Her lips sat parted, her eyes rolled to the back of her head. There was no sorrow or regret there. Not anymore. She opted out\u2014ran away and left him to deal with this pain alone. \u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d I said, dropping to my knees, my dress flaring like a parachute in the waves around me as I placed my hand to her skull.</p><p>David turned his head, his green eyes meeting mine. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help me?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, knowing this was wrong, but knowing also that if I didn't ease his pain, he\u2019d leave with that creature under the waves, and he\u2019d return as something darker than he was now. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you do without her?\u201d</p><p>He looked up sadly at the ocean, somewhere past the edge of the horizon, but his gaze returned with a smile. \u201cDie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I shot bolt upright in my bed, a mess of sweat cooling my face as the sea breeze whispered past my curtains and touched my brow.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, Ara?\u201d David pushed up on his elbow, his hand appearing on my shoulder. \u201cGod, you\u2019re soaking.\u201d He sat up more. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I touched my lips. \u201cI had another dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one where I kill you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He shifted closer and hugged me, rolling us both back onto the pillows.</p><p>Through the dome window above us, the pale light of a moon in its first quarter shone down with the coming dawn, leaving dull, coloured patterns across the white sheets. I was safe here\u2014comfortable in David\u2019s arms, the world I woke to now no longer startling me in the first few seconds I opened my eyes. My mind and body had finally adjusted to my giant new bed, airy new room, and crowded, busy new life. But the nightmares I suffered the past week were stirring things up, making me uneasy, afraid to go to sleep.</p><p>The song of crickets outside carried along the breeze through the open balcony door and filled the silence with familiarity as the edginess in my limbs fizzled away. I listened carefully to David, though, for any thoughts I might catch. His breathing was shallow, while his fingertip made one line over my shoulder blade repeatedly. He was worried. But I wasn\u2019t sure if my dream or something else had stolen his mind to thought.</p><p>\u201cNothing could ever bring me to harm you, Ara. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, but the nod I attempted failed. My eyes sat wide, staring into the dream. \u201cIt just felt so real.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed my brow, snuggling down a little lower in the bed. \u201cBad dreams usually reflect inner-turmoil. Maybe you\u2019re feeling guilty for something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty for what?\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps . . . for my brother. For being forced to deny his friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn't affect me that much, David.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my head again, wiping his hand down the sweat between my shoulder blades. \u201cLiar. I know it does, Ara. It would affect anyone, but you\u2014you\u2019re so careful of other\u2019s feelings. I know it eats you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why ask it of me? If you know how much it hurts me, why keep us from being friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019re young. Impressionable. Spirit bound to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m a vampire. That bind is so broken now it\u2019s not even worth mentioning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill,\u201d he said softly. \u201cBest keep you both away from temptation. Not to mention\u2014\u201d He huffed a breath out through his nose, \u201c\u2014I still haven\u2019t forgiven him for binding you in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough, I suppose.\u201d I nodded against his chest, biting the tip of my thumb. \u201cAnd, so, you think that\u2019s it\u2014that I'm having these dreams because I feel guilty about hurting Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d he said, brushing my hair back. \u201cBecause the only other conclusion I can come up with is that you think I might hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what reason would you ever do that?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, his chest sinking under my cheek. \u201cNone . . . hopefully.\u201d</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>The hum of voices down the table melted into the soft sound of the piano being played in the corner. I watched the pianist\u2019s deft fingers move across the keys, wishing I could trade places with him. I\u2019d much rather be playing piano\u2014not a care in the world\u2014than sitting at breakfast addressing things I spent all day either discussing or thinking about. There really was no escape from being queen.</p><p>David caught my gaze and glanced over his shoulder to follow it, smiling back at me gently after. And for that split second, nothing really seemed that bad in the world. He was here, right across the table from me, just as I\u2019d wanted for so long. And after dinner tonight, I could sit by that piano until dawn if I wanted, maybe even beside my king, playing a duet. Nothing in the world would grant me better reason to smile than to hear him play again.</p><p>\u201cAnd how is our new king faring after his coronation?\u201d Margret asked, breaking David and I from our locked gazes.</p><p>\u201cVery well, thank you, Margret.\u201d He bowed his head.</p><p>\u201cAny new developments with your powers?\u201d Walt asked. \u201cOur queen\u2019s powers flourished remarkably after her own coronation.\u201d</p><p>David looked at me, holding back a smile. \u201cNone yet, but it\u2019s only been a week.\u201d</p><p>I sighed into my plate. So we\u2019re not telling them you can read my mind?</p><p>Or that you can read mine, he thought back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Ar?\u201d Mike asked quietly, leaning across the corner of the table toward me.</p><p>\u201cI'm just tired.\u201d I dropped my spoon into my porridge, slumping my elbow down by my napkin.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you come down for breakfast then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you never eat breakfast with the people,\u201d Morg added.</p><p>I looked down the table to watch David talking with Arthur, his eyes bright, his hands moving like he was speaking in Sign. \u201cHe said I had to\u2014that it was my \u201cqueenly duty\u201d to eat with my people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Morgaine said, sitting back to sip her juice.</p><p>\u201cI know. But I just feel so . . . I don't know.\u201d I leaned on my other hand. \u201cEver since his coronation last week, I just feel so under the weather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Mike asked, pressing a hand to my brow.</p><p>I shrugged, sitting back in my chair, looking up quickly when I heard my name.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d David asked aloud, but his voice came through with a strong warning\u2014holding the weight of everything we\u2019d discussed this past week about my duties as queen.</p><p>I smiled, laying the napkin gently across my lap. \u201cI feel very well, thank you. Amazing what Chef\u2019s porridge can do for a little fatigue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d David nodded once in that kingly manner of his, and went back to his chat with Arthur.</p><p>Beside me, Mike\u2019s eyes shrunk from the roundness of confusion to tiny slits under a frown. He leaned in and whispered, \u201cSince when do you perk up for the sake of appearances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince David\u2019s been giving me a few lessons in royal etiquette.\u201d</p><p>Mike and Morg exchanged glances, and Emily, so bright and fresh at this hour of the morning, offered a gentle smile. I looked away. Her special immortal \u201cconnection\u201d with David that allowed her to sense his feelings didn\u2019t give her right to think she knew what was going on with me. But from the corner of my eye then, I noticed her and David looking at each other; David's gaze was quick, and Emily\u2019s response\u2014looking into her plate\u2014made my spine straighten.</p><p>David? I thought.</p><p>What?</p><p>Are you holding a private conversation with her?</p><p>Who?</p><p>Emily!</p><p>\u201cYes, Uncle. Now that the castle is vacant, I was hoping to head out there this week,\u201d he said, ignoring me.</p><p>\u201cWe have over two hundred prisoners in those cells, Your Majesty,\u201d Walter said. \u201cYou will need more than the five men you\u2019ve got to go through their files and determine their right for parole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been through most of the cases myself already,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I sentenced at least a quarter of them, and my uncle the rest. It should take five men only three days to complete the task.\u201d</p><p>David?</p><p>He kept his eyes on Walter, giving vague details about the members in his \u2018clean-out-the-prison\u2019 team.</p><p>David, I huffed, slamming my palm onto the table.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Yes, what? I shot the thought at him with enough force to almost burst a blood vessel.</p><p>Yes. She asked me a question. I answered, he thought.</p><p>What question? I asked, cursing the day I ever found out that David could still read Emily\u2019s mind, despite her being a vampire.</p><p>It\u2019s not relevant.</p><p>My breakfast suddenly hit my gut like an iron hammer. Why?</p><p>Because.</p><p>David, you can\u2019t have private conversations with Emily and expect me not to wonder what it\u2019s about. What if I did that with Mike\u2014or Jason? I waited, getting madder by the second.</p><p>She just asked if everything between you and I was okay, he finally responded.</p><p>And . . . why would she ask that?</p><p>She thinks I\u2019m being cruel. He smiled across at me. That I forced you to come to breakfast.</p><p>What makes her think that?</p><p>He laughed to himself\u2014his secret smile stealing my heart. Because she knows you. Knows you\u2019d never get out of bed this early without a fight.</p><p>I shrugged. Can she read your thoughts now, too?</p><p>No.</p><p>Are you going to tell her I can?</p><p>He turned his head and replied to Arthur\u2019s question. I half expected to have to wait for his answer, but it came through while he was talking, a skill I had not yet mastered.</p><p>I sighed, picking up my spoon to eat the porridge again. He was right. It could be dangerous for anyone to be aware that he and I had any more power than they already knew about. In this society, I was starting to understand why everyone kept their secrets. It seemed less lonely, though, knowing I wasn\u2019t the only one who didn't know who to trust. And I was glad David didn\u2019t even trust Emily with the secret of his new powers. She was already two steps too deep into David\u2019s circle of trust. Arm\u2019s-length was the best place to keep her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is with you, Ar?\u201d Mike caught the bitterness in my turned lip, reaching across to take Emily\u2019s hand, despite that she hadn't actually seen me look at her that way.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d I picked up my spoon again and gracelessly shovelled the slop into my gob, stealing myself a moment inside my own head.</p><p>The morning light moved across the glossy floorboards of the Great Hall in giant rectangles, spilling over the table and the vampires like they were nuisances in its path, warming one side of the room, giving halos to the heads closest to the giant windows. I turned my gaze to the painting behind me\u2014the giant oil depiction of Lilith mounting the fireplace\u2014and gave her a weak smile, wondering if she\u2019d hated keeping up with appearances as much as I did. She didn\u2019t smile back\u2014not any more than she usually did and, even then, it was fake\u2014a waning smile frozen in time, as if she\u2019d sat for that portrait on a day that had broken her heart. Now, it sat gloriously overlooking the Great Hall and all its occupants, but I got the feeling she just wanted to be covered over and stored in a dark room\u2014away from it all.</p> <p>A bright flicker of white light flashed across her nose for a second, blinding me as I turned back to face the front. I put my hand up to shield my eyes, frowning at Jase until I saw his smile, saw his gaze flick to the silver culprit, floating a few inches into the air above the table, shining the glare in my direction.</p><p>What are you doing?</p><p>David looked up. What do you mean?</p><p>I wasn't talking to you.</p><p>His head turned slowly to look at Jason. \u201cBrother,\u201d he said in a tone so sharp the spoon fell onto the tabletop with a clunk.</p> <p>Only a few people in their immediate vicinity noticed, but respectfully averted their eyes and attention until David drew his murderous gaze back from Jason. But the sheepish smile Jason flicked my way then made me smile, and now I couldn't quite drop it. It might have been an unofficial, albeit firm, ruling that he and I couldn't be friends, but that didn't mean he was gone. He was still here for me, and I felt that, even if I wasn\u2019t allowed to.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d I said, turning to the person who tapped my shoulder, but there was no one there. I looked behind me, beside me, frowning in Morg\u2019s then Mike\u2019s direction every few seconds, wondering if they\u2019d tapped me. And as I turned back to the front, something tapped me again, this time on my left shoulder.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Arthur whispered gruffly, and metal clanged loudly on the ground by my foot.</p><p>Jason laughed, catching my eye, making the burning stare I could feel from my husband hotter as the room silenced.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s two, brother,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cApologies, my king.\u201d Jason stood, clearing his throat, and looked down at me. \u201cCan you pass my spoon, please, Your Majesty?\u201d</p> <p>All eyes slowly drifted from Jason to David to me.</p><p>The shoulder-tapping offender lay on the floor by my feet, hesitation rising off it like stilling fumes, turning a simple metal kitchen implement into a do or don\u2019t.</p><p>I bent down, grasped it softly and sat straight again, the spoon flat on my palm. \u201cYou want it? Get it yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jason grinned, accepting my challenge, but instead of using his mind to carry the spoon, defying all laws of gravity, he pushed his chair out with the backs of his legs and walked calmly past each head, defying his king. \u201cMy lady.\u201d He bowed, scooping the spoon right out of my palm before turning my hand and brushing his lips across my knuckles in a very polite, but ultimately cheeky, kiss.</p><p>Blade and Nathan were the only two brave enough to laugh. Everyone else practically held their breath, and when I looked upon David\u2019s tight jaw as the table chatter slowly resumed again, I feared a little for Jason\u2019s well-being.</p><p>He\u2019s just teasing you, David, I thought.</p><p>A grey cloud of irritation passed over him. He exhaled, going back to his conversation with a coating of less-than-amused paint reddening his face. Even he knew it was all in fun. Those two had been stirring each other since conception. It was just so funny to see it firsthand.</p><p>You shouldn\u2019t press him that way, Jase, I thought, not really sure if David could hear it, too. But if he did, he didn\u2019t bother to look up.</p> <p>Jason offered an apologetic half-turn of his lip, lifting one shoulder slightly. He looked so cute and boyish then that I laughed, stifling it quickly before David could notice we were \u2018interacting.\u2019 Then again, he seemed quite distracted with being king. I could tell from the way he smiled, the way he sat so tall and straight, the way he moved his hands in a slow, regal manner, that he was having the time of his life. He was born for this role, and I was merely a bystander in the awe of his radiance. His people had fallen at his feet, showering him with their love and respect from the moment he came back from the dead. They didn\u2019t really need a queen to guide them out all this time. They needed a king, but not any king. They needed, we all needed, David.</p><p>He looked my way for a second, a glance that made me curious about which thoughts he could access in my head. So far, according to him, it was only projected thoughts he could hear, but with that look he just gave me, it seemed as if maybe he was hearing more than he let on.</p><p>I smiled to myself, coming up with a clever way to test it, then looked over at Jason and focused only on him.</p><p>Jase?</p><p>He slowly set his eyes on me, his head staying forward.</p><p>I'm going to think something for the purpose of a test. They\u2019re not my real thoughts, okay? I said.</p><p>He turned in his seat, intrigue lighting up his eyes and the sudden smile that slipped across his lips.</p><p>I tried not to smile back, making my jaw tight as I leaned on my hand and, without sending the thought to anyone at all, told myself how lovely Jason looked in that white shirt, with his hair smoothly brushed back, one thick lock falling against his brow, his bright green eyes casting beams of excitement across my heart every time they met mine. But David didn't even flinch. Nothing. There was no way he could hold the anger in if he heard that kind of thought.</p><p>It was confirmed. He couldn\u2019t hear me unless I projected a thought.</p><p>Okay, test done. I smiled at Jase.</p><p>He bowed his head, touching his heart.</p><p>The midday sun sat over the manor, offering more shadows in the corridors than light. I pushed the library door open and my eyes went straight up to the top of the bookshelves wrapping the windows on either side of the fireplace. They were normally decked out, packed tightly with brown spines and a party of dust motes dancing in the sunlight. But, today, the shelves were mostly empty, the books piled up on tables and chairs, making small cities over the wood floors throughout both levels of the room.</p><p>The new librarian looked up from her pile and bowed her head once before going back to her all-important task of cataloguing and labelling. She hadn\u2019t been made immortal yet, and the sound of her very human heart caught me off guard a little, a part of me wondering then if she was safe in here without a knight on watch. Then again, she was still alive, wasn\u2019t she? No one had eaten her yet. So, I shrugged it off and grabbed the gold railing, my hand sliding over it on the way up the stairs to the second floor. As I reached the top, though, a cold palm cupped my mouth, gagging my scream. The mighty force of my elbow went into the person\u2019s ribs, but he just laughed, dragging me by the waist into a nook between two shelves.</p><p>\u201cSo what was that all about?\u201d he said, releasing me.</p><p>\u201cJase!\u201d I slapped his chest lightly, not really able to pull my hand back far enough to do it hard in this tiny space. \u201cYou scared me. And what was what all about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt breakfast this morning.\u201d He grinned. \u201cThat sweet train of thought you went off on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um.\u201d I poked my head out and checked down both corridors of the balcony, peering into the lower level as well before sliding back into our little niche. \u201cDavid has a new power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBroader mind reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cI knew it. I just knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d</p><p>We walked out of the space and into the openness of the library again. \u201cAnd you were testing if he could read random thoughts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said with a bit of irritation. \u201cBut you didn't answer my question. What do you know about all this?\u201d</p><p>He sat down on the armchair by the shelf, sighing. \u201cHe can't read random thoughts. But he can read projected thoughts, and not just your projected thoughts, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours too?\u201d My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my god.\u201d I sat down on the lamp table beside him. \u201cAre you serious? I mean, how do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was walking the labyrinth the other day, and our paths crossed. He greeted me as usual and, in my solemn state, I thought how nice it\u2019d be to punch him in the jaw.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped a little.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, it was weird. He kinda . . . he smiled like something was funny, then continued on his way without saying anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think he heard your thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...well, yeah. I pretty much screamed it to the gods.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou hate him\u2014David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His shoulders slumped and he looked down at his thumbs, running one over the other a few times. \u201cI don't. But I wish I had his life.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly. \u201cI didn't take you for the kingly sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot his life as king, Ara.\u201d He bumped me softly with his elbow. \u201cIf I were David, I would have run away with you, lived a normal life, free of all this.\u201d</p><p>I placed both hands gently in my lap, looking around at all this. \u201cIt\u2019s safer here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. And David knows that, but he cares more about the throne than he does about\u2014\u201d He swallowed his own words, almost physically choking on them. \u201cI'm sorry. I shouldn\u2019t speak that way about him. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I stood as he walked across the room. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, really. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI better go,\u201d he cut in, turning around to face me again. \u201cI'm not supposed to be alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not alone.\u201d I motioned to the librarian downstairs.</p><p>Jase gave her a quick smile, which landed on his feet after. \u201cThis is too alone for my brother\u2019s wishes. I\u2019ll see ya at dinner.\u201d He patted my shoulder then disappeared, and I stood for a few moments among the shelves and the smell of old pages trying to remember what I came into the library for in the first place.</p><p>The housekeeper said he was in the study, the librarian said he was in the garden, and the gardener told me to look in the Throne Room. But as I climbed the stairs of the Great Hall after searching all those places, I heard him call my name.</p><p>\u201cArthur, there you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were looking for me?\u201d He caught up on the midway, casually leaning on the railing when he stopped. He looked like human-Arthur today with his hair still wet from a shower, a white T-shirt over denim jeans, sporting that unshaven look that suited his nephews so well. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEverywhere,\u201d I said, leaning beside him.</p><p>\u201cWe must have been on a wild goose chase.

Did you take it?\u201d</p><p>I held it up. \u201cWhy? Did you want it for something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you doing a pregnancy test?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still haven\u2019t got my. . .\u201d I paused on the word, knowing Arthur was old-fashioned. \u201cMy, uh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeriod?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed a little. \u201cUm, yeah. So, I thought I\u2019d just see if some miracle had occurred.\u201d</p><p>Arthur stood up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stood up, too.</p><p>\u201cMy dear, a pregnancy to my nephew would not be a miracle. It would be a tragedy.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cI know. I just. . . a part of me just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWants his baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I looked at my feet. \u201cI love him. I want to carry his child. Is that selfish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my dear.\u201d He touched my shoulder. \u201cAnd to be excited about the miracle of life, even if it meant your husband\u2019s death, would not be a sin, either. I\u2019m sorry. It was wrong of me to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right, Arthur. If I have a baby with him, there\u2019s no one else that can use the\u2014\u201d I covered my mouth to whisper, \u201cDagger of Yahanna on Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I was quick-tongued, Amara. All life is a miracle, no matter the consequence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, in this case, also means death.\u201d I toyed with the small box.</p><p>He cupped his hands over mine and the box. \u201cPlease don't do that test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Arthur, if you and I are going to . . . you know, go all Thanksgiving and get happy with a turkey baster, I need to make sure I'm not putting myself through that for nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But . . . please wait. David will journey to Elysium this weekend to free the prisoners, you can do it then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s around when you. . . if you were to discover that you were pregnant, and he, with his ability to read your thoughts again, discovered this, he would not waste time. He would leave immediately to kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I looked at the test.</p><p>\u201cI am sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I handed the test to Arthur. \u201cHold onto this for me then. I\u2019ll do it on Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled, bowing a little as he backed away.</p><p>\u201cOh, and, Arthur.\u201d I reached out for him.</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, there\u2019s been a new development.\u201d I folded my arms and walked closer, half checking for sly ears. \u201cWith. . . With that new power I told you about.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, stepping close enough to be accused of wanting a hug. \u201cDavid\u2019s mind reading ability?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I checked over my shoulder then leaned in to whisper in his ear. \u201cHe can read Jason\u2019s projected thoughts.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s spine straightened. \u201cGood God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s pretty damn powerful.\u201d</p><p>He leaned on the railing again, looking down at the test before tucking it in his back pocket. \u201cThe left-handed child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. He was always the left-handed child, so I wasn\u2019t surprised when Jason\u2014the right-handed\u2014turned out to have a broader range of skills than his brother upon being turned. But with David having taken his oath, the added power of Mother Nature is like gaining another layer of immortality. His left brain will be developing at a rapid rate, giving him skills on equal to, possibly greater than, his brother.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOnly half of that made sense, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>His lips spread in an easy grin. \u201cThe powers one gains when becoming immortal are based greatly on which side of the brain they use more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, left-brained people get more power?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not about greater or weaker powers, but which powers. I was ambidextrous in my human life.\u201d He held out both hands. \u201cWhen I turned, the function in my brain which allowed me to use both sides simultaneously also gave me the ability to think at a higher level of consciousness\u2014to see past the impossible, bypass the rules of physics and control things others couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if David\u2019s brain is essentially becoming ambidextrous, could he end up with powers like yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. The strength of his coronation cannot change his brain\u2019s imprint. He cannot suddenly gain power that was never possible; it will merely open his mind to what it was capable of before. Whatever Jason is capable of\u2014\u201d His eyes narrowed, his gaze distant. \u201cDavid may be very soon, also.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I should watch to see if he starts writing with his right hand?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cNo. Watch your thoughts, and I will make sure I watch mine.\u201d</p><p>I felt a chill pass through me. \u201cWhat if he found out about. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can never find out what happened between us in that training hall, Amara. Ever. Because it will not just be my head on a spike\u2014\u201d He turned and looked at me. \u201cIt\u2019ll be yours.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to object, tell him David would never do that to me. But Arthur was right. He did it to Pepper, he tried to do it to Jason, and being his wife did not place me above the law in David\u2019s mind. He\u2019d even said as much. If I broke the law by fornicating or even plotting to fornicate with his uncle, he\u2019d punish me to the full extent of the law. Unless. . .</p><p>\u201cWait! Aren\u2019t I allowed to have more than one husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But that won\u2019t protect you from what we\u2019ve done in the past, my dear. And, in order to marry another man, you must submit your intent to marry with the Lower Parliament and it must be approved by the people before you can so much as think about touching him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Our laws on fidelity are ironclad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should. . .?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his sweet smile warming his blue eyes, showing the younger, human version of Arthur. \u201cNo. Absolutely not, my dear. That would be suicide, and I don\u2019t fancy explaining to my nephew why we\u2019ve suddenly developed a love enough to marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sorry.\u201d I screwed my face up in awkward frown. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right.\u201d He wrapped his arm over my shoulder and pulled me close for a second. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out. For now, mind your thoughts and bide your time. And hope to God you\u2019re not carrying his child, or this fight will be over before it\u2019s begun.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, sighing out my disappointment as Arthur walked away.</p><p>Court was packed. More bodies had crammed themselves into that Throne Room since David returned as king than they had on the day of my coronation. I glanced at my husband on his throne and offered a smile, standing taller as I walked across the platform in front of the hundreds, all waiting for an appointment with their king. I could smell the tasty blood of those who had come over from the Dark Side\u2014a number that far outweighed the amount of heartbeats I could hear in the room\u2014and rather than making me hungry, it made me uneasy. If all those vampires suddenly turned on my people, it would be a slaughter without chance for a war.</p><p>\u201cNow there\u2019s a sight for sore eyes. Where have you been all day, my love?\u201d David reached for my hand as I sat down. \u201cI asked after you, but no one seemed to know where you were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had business to take care of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness?\u201d His brow arched.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what business does a queen have that she cannot share with her king?\u201d</p><p>The noise of the people had a gentle kind of hum to it, enough that I almost felt like a human in a room full of humans\u2014like none of the people in the first few rows could hear our private chatter if they wanted. \u201cTalk about it later?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, squeezing my hand gently. \u201cThis suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He nodded to the adoring masses. \u201cBeing queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He leaned a little closer, closing the gap between our chairs. \u201cWanna know a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I smiled, loving the burn of excitement my heart felt every time he came back down to earth long enough to be My David again.</p><p>\u201cI always dreamed of this. Always wanted to be king. But, in all my fantasies, had never imagined such a queen beside me\u2014could never have crafted such a beautiful creature as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding, Ara,\u201d he said, his voice soft but firm. \u201cI know we give you a hard time. I know I\u2019m on your back a lot lately about being a perfect queen, but you rise to every challenge I set, and I\u2019m proud of you. And I\u2019m proud to sit beside you as your king.\u201d</p><p>I held very still, taking a moment to bask in the warmth of his words. \u201cSo, nice-David got out of bed today?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cHe does that . . . on occasion.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand back. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sat tall in his chair again as Walter banged the stick, settling the room to silence.</p><p>\u201cHigh Lord of the Court, please present the first case,\u201d I said.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The House of the Damned had grown since we first built it. In only a few months, the rectangle building, with enough space to sleep ten children comfortably, now had its own observation wing, secure section, adoption offices, and staff cafe\u2014for the Lilithians and humans. Its expanse of one-building-tall, fifteen-cars-long, had grown to two stories high on the west wing and sat in an L shape at least thirty cars long, shining like a glorious shrine under the daylight among the green fields. It was a place anyone would be glad to call home, and I felt a pang of pride for making it all happen. We\u2019d come a long way from those days I sat merely thinking about the children, recording the nightmares they caused me in my diary.</p><p>I wandered down the hillside, stomping my feet a little harder than necessary for a light-footed immortal, driven toward the Damned House like a child on her way to a play-date, but stopped when I heard my name. \u201cOh, hey, Jase. Didn\u2019t see you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome \u2018ere a sec?\u201d He curled his arm inward, waving me over.</p><p>I detoured toward the square of cement, catching the basketball that bounced in my direction. \u201cWhen did we get a hoop?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the glass-backed board. \u201cMike just had it installed. I\u2019m testing it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d I ditched the ball and watched it slip through the hoop without touching the sides. \u201cWhy\u2019d he put it out here? This group of kids aren\u2019t allowed outside.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYet.\u201d Jase grinned.</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I tossed him the ball, half aware of the little faces watching us through the window behind me. \u201cHopefully, they\u2019ll just be cleared for adoption soon and we won\u2019t need an institute for them. Or maybe we\u2019ll just find that cure instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, actually, I have a few theories on that,\u201d he said, bouncing the ball as he spoke. \u201cI wanna test out your blue light\u2014see exactly what kind of electricity it is, because that whole heart-starting thing has my head going round in circles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it seems to be made up of static energy, but that shouldn\u2019t cause such a dramatic effect when shoot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>Jase stopped talking and looked up the hill. \u201cGreat,\u201d he muttered under his breath.</p><p>I spun around to watch David approach at a fast, human pace. \u201cHi, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Tuesday,\u201d I said flatly. \u201cI always visit the children on Tuesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow convenient.\u201d He stood beside me, eyeing his brother. \u201cAnd you both just happened to cross paths.\u201d</p><p>Jase sighed, tossing the ball away over his shoulder. \u201cWhatever, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe the title you were looking for is Your Majesty,\u201d David called after Jason, who just shook his head, walking slowly off over the hill.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d I glared up at my king. \u201cHe was here before I got here. I ran into him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said.\u201d He turned away. \u201cConvenient.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou really do think the worst of people, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He headed toward the house. \u201cI think the worst of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s your brother, David.\u201d</p><p>He turned around and walked backward. \u201cAnd I love him as such. Provided he stays away from my wife.\u201d</p><p>I imprisoned my smile, shaking my head, watching the bright sun turn to shadow over David\u2019s brown hair as he disappeared under the eaves of the house, flicking a quick grin my way before heading inside.</p><p>How could that man irritate me so much, then blast it all away with one look? I groaned, running after him. \u201cWould you wait up?\u201d</p><p>He held the door open with his foot, signing both himself and me in to the logbook. \u201cI\u2019m just giving him a hard time, Ara. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re doing everything you can to make sure he\u2019s afraid to even look at me.\u201d The door closed behind me, locking into place as it shut.</p> <p>\u201cCan you blame me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, folding my arms. \u201cBut don\u2019t try to play innocent when I accuse you of being nasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m being nasty. Get over it.\u201d He handed me a visitor\u2019s pass. \u201cIf he\u2019d never spirit bound you, we wouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, rolling my eyes, then held up the badge. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to come to the restricted block\u2014see Max.\u201d</p><p>I lowered the pass, toying with it for a second as the image of Max on the day I first met him flashed in my mind. He was so small and so thin, and his eyes were so hollow and dark. But it wasn\u2019t the eternal sadness of his little soul that haunted me the most. It was the way the keeper\u2019s metal stick speared his ribs and broke his skin, the child screaming then just laying there\u2014all instinct to fight dead inside him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d David cupped my hand and steered the badge up to my chest, pinning it to my blouse. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t remember anything now.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI heard it took several sessions with Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but last night, Max actually slept.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at my feet. \u201cWhat about Joshua\u2014his brother?\u201d</p><p>David hooked a finger under my chin to roll it upward. \u201cThey\u2019re both fine. Come see.\u201d</p><p>When we cleared the second security gate and locked it behind us, I heard a little voice squeal my name and a flash of gold hair tied with a pink ribbon caught my eye across the room, appearing beside me a second later. \u201cLook what I can do, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m watching, Lacey.\u201d I stood back, folding my arms, a smile holding a certain amount of excitement and interest across my face.</p><p>\u201cOne, two, thr\u2014\u201d Lacey grunted on the last word, tipping herself forward as both hands came down to the ground and her feet went vertical, the cuffs of her jeans sliding up her skinny ankles a little.</p><p>I clapped. \u201cYay! Well done, Lacey. And did you practice with the hula hoop today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I can do it for three minutes now,\u201d she said, holding up four fingers.</p><p>\u201cAw, well\u2014\u201d I reached out and pulled her close for a hug; her tiny arms wrapped my waist, her head sitting just under my ribs. \u201cMaybe you can show me when I come back from visiting with Max and Joshie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She pulled away and placed both hands behind her back, smiling up at me. She was the most adorable child out of this group\u2014her blond hair and bright smile lighting my every visit.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David said softly, closing the security gate behind himself and a sharp-faced man with dark, receding hair\u2014the kind of man who looked like he\u2019d spent too long working in an office and not enough time in the sun, enjoying things, like a smile.</p><p>\u201cGo play, Lacey,\u201d I said softly, touching her shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll come by later.\u201d</p><p>She toddled off and sat in the art corner beside her little friend.</p><p>\u201cThis is Ross Johnson,\u201d David announced, and Ross offered his hand. \u201cHe\u2019s come by to assess Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I shook his hand and dropped it quickly, fighting the urge to wipe it on my jeans. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we had to call you in, but we can\u2019t really send our head psychologist in with Charles, because she\u2019s Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been made aware of the basics of the case. Now, I understand this is the second group of children to come through the House?\u201d He motioned around the room.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, taking a half step away from the other children in the hopes Mr Johnson might follow. This wasn\u2019t really the place to discuss this. \u201cOver there we have Lacey and Harry, and the other two from this group were Charles and a three-year-old girl we\u2019ve named Sophie\u2014both in the secure wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what of the first group? Where are they now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour kids have been adopted out to loving Lilithian and vampire families, and it seems they\u2019re all doing remarkably well. The other two are in observation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d Ross typed something on his tablet, nodding as he did. \u201cMax and Josh, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, remembering back to the first day I came to the Damned House and saw Max playing in the sunbeams by the window. \u201cWe\u2019d held high hopes for Max. But, at night, when we had no control over the sunlight, he\u2019d become monstrous and hard to handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we had to restrain him after he tore the hair from a little girl\u2019s scalp on his first night,\u201d David said. \u201cHe was just too traumatised, and it seemed the dark only aggravated his torment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Mr Johnson said. \u201cAnd Katy, your head psychologist, mentioned that Charles and Sophie showed signs of dissociative personality disorders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, which may actually have been present before they were turned.\u201d</p><p>He wrote something else down, and I checked over my shoulder to see if Lacey and Harry were listening.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we take this discussion into the secure section?\u201d David suggested, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d Mr Johnson looked up then at Harry and Lacey, realising finally that we weren\u2019t alone.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Harry called, holding up a large rectangle page. \u201cLook what I did.\u201d</p><p>I left David and Mr Johnson by the security door and wandered over to the art corner, my eyes going wider when I got a closer look at Harry\u2019s picture. \u201cI love this, Harry.\u201d I squatted down and pointed to the house sitting under a sunny sky. \u201cYou\u2019re using so many colours now. And, can you tell me\u2014\u201d I aimed my finger to the red apples in the tree. \u201cWhat colour is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d He considered the apple for a moment, scratching just beside his nose. \u201cPurple?\u201d</p><p>I looked over at David. His smile grew.</p><p>\u201cVery close,\u201d I said. \u201cBut we call that one red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d Harry folded over his page, slapping his brow. \u201cStupid! Stupid! Stu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d David said gently, appearing suddenly beside Harry, gently taking both his hands. \u201cDo you want to know something, Harry?\u201d</p><p>Harry looked at David. He idolised his king and wanted to be just like King David when he grew up, which saddened my heart immensely, knowing the Damned might never actually grow up. But his love for David had allowed them a certain connection neither had with anyone else at the House, and David could always get through to him.</p><p>\u201cWhen I was a little boy,\u201d David started, \u201cI always got the colour red and purple mixed up. They look exactly the same, don\u2019t they?\u201d His eyes slowly drifted onto mine, sparkling with a grin, asking me to play along.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never gonna get this right,\u201d Harry said, dropping his head between his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d David lifted his face again. \u201cBecause all you have to remember is that the colour red\u2014\u201d He pointed to the apple, \u201c\u2014is the same colour as blood.\u201d</p><p>Harry sat up straight.</p><p>\u201cAnd you like blood, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d David finished.</p><p>Harry nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d David stood up, tousling Harry\u2019s orange curls. \u201cAnd if you keep getting the colours wrong, guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. No one\u2019s going to hurt you, son. We like it when someone makes a mistake around here because it means they\u2019ve got another chance to learn. And what do we get when we learn something?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cChocolate!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d David reached into his pocket and pulled out a Hershey\u2019s. \u201cHere you go, buddy. You learned that blood is red today, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then you can have this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, King David.\u201d He jumped up and threw his arms around my husband. And my eyes watered. I loved seeing the children happy. It was just so easy to make them smile. All they wanted was a little love, a little encouragement, and when given anything\u2014didn\u2019t matter if it was a flower from outside, a pin from my hair that one of them liked, or a new pack of pencils\u2014they were just so grateful it was heartbreaking.</p><p>David patted Harry\u2019s hair, holding back his own tears.</p><p>\u201cOkay, see if you can draw me a picture of a puppy, and I\u2019ll come back after I\u2019ve taken Queen Ara to see Max and Joshie, okay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Harry sat back down and tore open his chocolate bar, leaning in to share with Lacey.</p><p>\u201cCome, My Queen.\u201d David draped his arm over my neck. \u201cI believe we\u2019re invisible in the presence of sweets.\u201d</p><p>My head turned as we walked away, my eyes staying on Harry long enough to see him enjoy his first bite. \u201cYou\u2019re good with kids, David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKids are easy.\u201d He waved a dismissive hand. \u201cJust feed them sugar and they love you.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sure those principles will change when we have our own baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He tugged me closer and kissed my hair. \u201cBecause she won\u2019t be allowed any sweets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she\u2019s anything like her mother, no amount of sugar could possibly make her any sweeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharmed, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Mr Johnson muttered flatly.</p><p>David shook his head, ignoring it, for the most part, and keyed in the code to the security door.</p><p>The tall, lanky boy with sandy-blonde hair stood up as we approached. Between us, a glass window sat as a divider from the hallway: a bullet proof, smash proof, and soundproof one that was mirrored on one side. Max couldn\u2019t see us, but we could see him. Josh, however, had the finely tuned instincts of an adult vampire, a very old adult vampire, turning his gaze directly on us before we even stopped walking.</p> <p>\u201cHow is he?\u201d David asked, and only then did I notice Katy had popped up beside him in her long white coat, clipboard in hand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s showing progress, David. We closed the curtains today while he was playing in the sunlight, and he looked up, but he didn\u2019t screech or back into the corner this time.\u201d</p><p>David smiled, his eyes staying on Max. \u201cJason asked to do one last session with him. What are your thoughts on this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, I agree.\u201d She took one step closer to the glass, her loving eyes on the two boys as if they were her own children\u2014the very reason we hired her and made her immortal. \u201cHe has no memory of his past before he came to the House, but he\u2019s showing signs of repression. I\u2019m worried it might all come back to him at once if we don\u2019t dot every \u2018I\u2019, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this present behaviour is what he commonly exhibits now?\u201d Mr Johnson asked, peering into the room like Max was some science lab monkey.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She turned her head and smiled warmly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s a normal little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Joshua?\u201d the stern man asked.</p><p>Josh looked up again. There was no way he could hear us, but I got the sense that he just \u2018felt\u2019 us talking about him. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at giving him a position in the Rehabilitation Organisation,\u201d Katy said.</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d I almost squealed. I\u2019d never even thought of that, but it just seemed like such a perfect position for Josh. \u201cI think he\u2019d make an excellent carer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe think so too.\u201d Katy nodded. \u201cHe shows deep empathy and compassion with the children, and seems to have a good rapport with them, too, even with Charles and Sophie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Sophie?\u201d I said slowly, my head reflexively angling toward the other two windows across the hallway. The lights were out in those rooms\u2014the children preferring total darkness as they huddled in the corner, staring blankly at the walls.</p><p>\u201cYes. I watched him yesterday: he stood in front of the glass and placed his hand against it\u2014\u201d She pointed to Charles\u2019 room. \u201cAnd Charles walked over, slowly, at first. But then, he placed his hand against Josh\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>David and I looked at each other then back at Joshua, while Mr Johnson took more notes.</p><p>\u201cDoes Josh want to be adopted when we find a family to take Max?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. He\u2019ll stay here in the Organisation\u2019s employ until such a time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd Max?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re predicting another few weeks of counselling and training, but if Mr Johnson concurs\u2014\u201d She presented him. \u201cWe\u2019ll move Max back into the House next week.\u201d</p><p>I thought about Lacy and Harry. \u201cAre you sure he\u2019s stable enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t move him if I thought otherwise,\u201d she said reassuringly. \u201cI love those kids as much as you do, My Queen. I\u2019d never put them in jeopardy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I clasped my hands and took a look around. \u201cYou\u2019ve done really well here, Katy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She smiled, looking in on Max again. \u201cI think we all have.\u201d</p><p>The gentle hum of David\u2019s lungs expanding took my mind from thoughts of the day ahead to a peaceful state of sleep. The silence in the cavity where a heart should beat, and the warmth of his arms around me after my blood had fuelled his body, were two of the things I would never take for granted\u2014having spent too many nights just trying to imagine what it felt like to lay this way with him again. But, despite the tight embrace I fell asleep in, as my mind rose from deep REM, I suddenly felt too much space around me.</p><p>I opened my eyes and blinked until the blur wrapped the corners and the featureless walls of a dark room\u2014the space decked out with a single bed, a table and a lamp, with curtains hanging over what victims who came here would assume was a window. It wasn\u2019t. This room was designed to contain the screeching terror they\u2019d express when they realised this would be the last room they\u2019d ever see. But the cement walls and iron door couldn\u2019t lock away the screams of the past. I could still hear them\u2014hear every cry ever muttered, every whimper and every plea. The quiet prayers for mercy were embedded in the bloodstains on the walls\u2014deaths by the hundreds having occurred in the one tiny space. And there were twenty more rooms like this, each one authorised by signature of the queen.</p><p>With Loslilian being so far away from towns or cities, we\u2019d approved for the vampires residing here to have their particular dietary needs shipped in, provided they disposed of the bodies thoughtfully and quickly, keeping all kills discreet and private.</p><p>But, unless I\u2019d been typeset on the menu as \u2018meal of the day,\u2019 I really had no reason to be down here.</p><p>I sat up fully and tucked my legs to my chest. The iron door was closed, probably locked, making the room as dark as it was cold. I always imagined these rooms were a little more inviting, maybe pleasant. But, then, how was a room of death supposed to feel?</p><p>Being immortal hadn\u2019t made accepting the death of humans any easier, and that was precisely why I had never come down here.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called, but it seemed like everyone had gone to bed. Except for the shapeless figure I spotted in the corner. I held my breath, waiting for it to move\u2014praying to God it wasn\u2019t a dead body. Not that a dead body would move, but . . . you know what I mean. It\u2019d be pretty darn scary if it did. My life story had gone from normal to vampire in just a few weeks, and I wasn\u2019t about to start adding zombies.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I said again, this time a little quieter. And the figure moved\u2014just once, just a breath taken and held, then, it turned its head and looked my way.</p><p>I pressed my back to the wall, making myself smaller.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d it said, easing my rapid pulse.</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d I exhaled his name.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, searching the wall, his gaze sweeping past me several times. He shook his head at himself then and turned away.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d a small voice muttered.</p><p>My eyes focused on a balled-up shape between him and the wall\u2014its skin reeking with the sweat of fear.</p><p>\u201cPlease, don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Jason squatted down, brushing her thick, dark hair off her face. \u201cI promise, no harm will come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want with me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you can\u2019t handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere am I?\u201d she said, her voice calming a little under Jason\u2019s spell. \u201cWhere\u2019s Jeff?\u201d</p><p>The vampire looked off to one side. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . at peace now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Her eyes went wide enough that I could suddenly see the whites. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taking a walk through Purgatory,\u201d Jason said, cupping her ponytail. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Her voice quivered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d He yanked her hair, angling her head sideways to lengthen her neck. \u201cI\u2019m just going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>A scream split the seconds into minutes, the realisation of her own death sinking in only as Jason\u2019s teeth did, breaking her skin and severing the windpipe until the cry became nothing but a gurgled whimper. The thick, warm scent of blood filled the air, burning my nose and throat. I rolled onto my hands and knees and pressed my wrist to my nose, heaving. If this was a dream, it was an awfully real, awfully vivid one. I could smell the dirt on the floors, feel the chill of death fog the wintry air; hear her screams like they were right in front of me. But it didn\u2019t fit\u2014Jason didn\u2019t look right in here\u2014killing that way. I always imagined him to be the compassionate kind of killer\u2014one who\u2019d make love to his victims and kill them gently, so they didn\u2019t know. I just never pictured him as an attack killer.</p><p>But, for some reason, I found it oddly sexy\u2014in a very twisted, vampirish kind of way.</p><p>\u201cRight. That thought just crossed the line, Ara-Rose,\u201d I said, pinching myself. \u201cWake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jase stood suddenly, his arms falling by his sides as he slowly turned at the shoulders.</p><p>\u201cIn the flesh,\u201d I muttered awkwardly, sinking my neck into my shoulders.</p><p>He checked all four corners of the room, his brow furrowed. \u201cAr? You here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here, dummy.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He walked slowly toward me, his eyes small. \u201cIs . . . is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s me,\u201d I said, but as I went to slap him, my hand went right through his. \u201cWhoa.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, the green in his wondering eyes reflecting the glowing orb of blue he was staring at. \u201cLook at you, pretty girl. So lovely in blue.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my own hands, seeing them as ghostly fog. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dreaming.\u201d</p><p>I waved my hands through the chilly air. \u201cSome dream, huh? It feels so real.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at his kill, echoes of her screams shadowing his eyes, and humbly lowered his head. \u201cYou were never supposed to see me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, wiping his wrist across his bloodied mouth. \u201cLike a killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t that bad. Besides. . .\u201d I looked over at the limp girl. \u201cThis is only a dream. You don\u2019t really kill like that, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His jaw went tight. \u201cWhat if I did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you did?\u201d I repeated playfully.</p><p>\u201cWould you hate me?\u201d</p> <p>I laughed, rolling my head back. \u201cNo. Silly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I? I know what you are\u2014I always have.\u201d</p><p>He scratched his head and looked down at his shoes, taking a sharp breath through his teeth. \u201cThen, I uh\u2014I better tell you. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis . . . isn\u2019t a dream, is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shrunk into himself a little, as if my hand were waiting in the air with a giant slap at the ready. \u201cYou\u2019re outside your body right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am?\u201d I looked at my hands again.</p><p>\u201cYes. You\u2019re . . . you\u2019re a wandering soul. You don\u2019t even have a face.\u201d</p><p>I touched my face. \u201cFreaky. So, what do I look like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? \u2018Cause I look pretty normal to me. Just kind of see-through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike a ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I looked back up at Jason, but his eyes kept flicking over my entire body, not really fixing my gaze like they normally did. \u201cBut I feel normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smiled at me. \u201cBut I really wish you hadn\u2019t ended up down here.\u201d</p><p>We both glanced slowly at the dead girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not that sensitive anymore, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. . .\u201d he said, and left it hanging, switching again to the light, carefree Jase I loved so much. \u201cWhy do you always end up with me when you escape your body?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell. . .\u201d He looked down at his shoes, stuffing both hands in his pockets. \u201cYou do.\u201d</p> <p>I shrugged, but he wouldn\u2019t have seen it as a shrug. \u201cGuess I just miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I miss you too, little glow bug.\u201d He reached out and brushed his hand affectionately through my arm; it felt warm and tingly, kind of like standing right next to the air vent on a heater. \u201cBut you better get back, your colour\u2019s fading, and I have a body to dispose of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d I nodded, peeling my eyes away from the thumb he aimed at his kill. \u201cI\u2019ll come see you later. I wanna talk more about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t remember it,\u201d he said factually, turning away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He bent down and looped the dead girl\u2019s arm over his neck. \u201cYou never do.\u201d</p><p>What David and I had done in this bed with each other over the past few weeks had surely ruined Arthur\u2019s turkey baster plan. I\u2019d held off as long as I could, but couldn\u2019t exactly tell my husband I didn\u2019t want to have sex with him in case I fell pregnant and ruined his uncle\u2019s and my plan to save him from certain death. So, I let him have me last night, all of me, and prayed now, as I laid here in his sleeping arms, that we hadn\u2019t conceived. I wished it didn\u2019t matter. I wished I could imagine his life force moving through me, inside me, electrifying things to existence within my body. I wished I could cup my hand over my belly and imagine the colour of her hair, or if she\u2019d have his eyes or mine. What kind of smile she\u2019d have, whose temperament she\u2019d have. But all of those dreams belonged to normal people\u2014to people who were human and not immortal weapons, whose vampire-hunting child was foretold to be powerful enough that one of the oldest immortals in the world wanted her dead before she could even say her first word.</p><p>\u201cMorning,\u201d David said sleepily, and all my thoughts halted, my hand falling away from my belly.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I rolled slightly to look up at him; his stubble had grown in thicker overnight, making him look gruff and sexy, covering his dimple just enough that it looked like a ditch in the ground covered by grown-in grass. And under his thick, dark brows, pulled together slightly as he studied my eyes, those shining green emeralds stood out, brightening my day. \u201cI love the feel of your hand on my back first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He spread his fingers wider, waking each inch of my skin he touched, firmly cupping my hip and moving his fingertips just into the rim of my underwear, a naughty millimetre away from my butt-crack. \u201cAnd I love feeling you in my hands first thing in the morning,\u201d he added.</p><p>I giggled, pressing my head into his kiss. \u201cWoke up on the right side of bed today, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I wake with you snuggled into me like this.\u201d He squeezed me. \u201cI can\u2019t possibly wake in a bad mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve woken up late today.\u201d I patted his chest and pushed off it gently to sit, tucking my legs to one side. \u201cBreakfast is in ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>He rolled onto his side, his body going long as he grabbed his watch off the nightstand and checked it. \u201cLucky I\u2019m a speedy vampire and can break records for getting showered and dressed.\u201d</p><p>I copied his lively smirk. \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a pity you\u2019re not the king and can just decide breakfast isn\u2019t all that important today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what, pray tell, is more important than dining in community with our people?\u201d</p><p>I moved one shoulder up shyly to my ear, and David\u2019s smile spread across his face, his white fangs gleaming in the early light, warming my blood with a pang of hunger. But not hunger for the kind of food we\u2019d have in the Great Hall.</p><p>\u201cYou, my girl\u2014\u201d He cupped my chin and slid his thumb down it, \u201c\u2014are insatiable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, insatiable and still bound to my queenly duties, right?\u201d I said, knowing he was about to throw the covers back and get up to break that record.</p><p>\u201cJust as I am bound as king.\u201d He winked, and disappeared behind the bathroom door, leaving my bed empty, aside from the mound of proverbial duty I couldn\u2019t escape.</p><p>I\u2019d not heard a guitar being played in so long I couldn\u2019t remember the last time. And I knew David\u2019s style, knew before I even heard his voice rising above it that he was playing. But I wasn\u2019t exactly sure who the second guitarist was.</p><p>I wandered down the stairs to the Great Hall and crossed the room, hugging myself. The dining table was empty now, all the breakfast dishes removed and the people disbursed, but a small group was still lingering, settled on chairs in a disorderly circle beside the fireplace under the great picture of Lilith.</p><p>David smiled up at me, and I stopped dead, my jaw dropping when I saw Jason sitting beside the king, the two of them in white T-shirts and dark jeans, entertaining the staff with their musical talents. They were actually laughing and joking with each other, the air around them charged with a very radiant kind of energy. And it seemed that, when it came to me, those two could tear each other\u2019s throats out, however, take me out of the picture, and it was as if no conflict had ever arisen between them. Which, I guess, was the way they had to be after a hundred-and-twenty years under the same roof. It kind of made me feel bad for coming between them.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d David said, tuning the E string. \u201cLet\u2019s try some Jeff Buckley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, but I\u2019m singing this time.\u201d Jason elbowed his brother. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019ll get a pack of curious cats in here wondering what all the crying\u2019s about.\u201d</p><p>David reached out and flicked Jason playfully across the back of his head. \u201cRight. Let\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>Jason strummed once, getting a nod of approval from David, then started plucking the strings.</p><p>I leaned my butt against the dining table, keeping my arms folded, trying my hardest to hold the grin back. I always knew David could sing, but Jason was right\u2014not about David sounding like a dying cat, but that he was a little better. Jason had a better mid-range and his voice flowed easily from chest to falsetto. David had a more gruff, kind of sexy voice. Both of them great, but also surprisingly different.</p><p>The staff sang along with Jason, clapping and dancing, united as equals for this small moment in time. Right now, David was not their king, and Jason was just his brother\u2014the past we all shared just an inconsequential thing that happened once.</p><p>The song ended to a round of applause, David and Jason taking overly theatrical bows.</p><p>\u201cThanks, folks, we\u2019ll be here all week.\u201d David placed his guitar in its case.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Jason said quietly to a maid who took his guitar for him.</p><p>\u201cGood to see you two getting along.\u201d I clapped a few times as I walked over.</p><p>Both boys stood, and the staff quietly went back to work, tidying the chairs before they left.</p><p>\u201cIt happens from time to time,\u201d David said, kissing my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYeah, when there aren\u2019t any girls to come between us,\u201d Jason added lightly, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s nice to see.\u201d I rolled myself into David\u2019s embrace, wrapping my arms all the way around his chest. I knew that scene\u2014seeing the boys play guitar together like that\u2014would stay in my memory forever: a rare file in the \u2018happy memory\u2019 column. \u201cSpeaking of see, have you guys seen Em or Morg? I\u2019m supposed to have another politics and boring stuff lesson today,\u201d I added.</p><p>\u201cNope,\u201d David said, breaking away to close his guitar case. \u201cBut if you find one you find the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, they\u2019re pretty much glued at the hip, aren\u2019t they?\u201d Jason picked up his guitar case.</p><p>\u201cYou mean fused.\u201d David laughed, snapping his locks closed. \u201cI think Mike\u2019s got cause to worry there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked, sitting on the last remaining chair.</p><p>Jason and David looked at each other then at me.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou know what girls are like,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d I blinked a few more times than necessary. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they get talking, a relationship problem becomes gossip, girls unite, and then a simple mistake sees us guys in the dog house,\u201d Jason added.</p><p>\u201cRelationship problem?\u201d I stood up. \u201cWho\u2019s having problems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm and Mike,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>David glared at him before looking at me. \u201cThat\u2019s her business, Ara. Don\u2019t get involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I not? Mike and Em are my best friends, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He touched my shoulder and leaned in to kiss my cheek again, maybe marking me in some immature display of ownership. \u201cBut it\u2019s not our place to interfere. We\u2019re not in their relationship, so we can\u2019t pass judgement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s passing anything?\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m more worried about what Morg\u2019s saying to Em. I think she has thing for Mike. What if she\u2019s advising Emily out of the relationship?\u201d</p><p>Jason gave David a smug grin. \u201cTold ya.\u201d</p><p>I looked at David. \u201cTold you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him you wouldn\u2019t get caught up in the drama of it all.\u201d Jason stuffed his capo in his back pocket. \u201cWe\u2019re worried about the same thing.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I should go find them,\u201d I decided.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d David grabbed his guitar case. \u201cJust . . . Remain objective, okay? Don\u2019t listen to too much of what Em says about Mike. You know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know he loves her. I know he\u2019s. . .\u201d I thought about it, having a laugh to myself for a second, \u201c\u2014downright stupid when it comes to girls sometimes, but I\u2019ve also known him longer than she has. She can\u2019t badmouth him in front of me, I won\u2019t let her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d David nodded. \u201cBecause that kind of chatter is infectious. Before you know it, an argument she had with Mike will become a full-scale cause for hatred. Don\u2019t let Morg get inside her head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s good at that,\u201d Jason added, and both boys walked away, side by side.</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019re you guys doing?\u201d I asked, catching them on the stairs.</p><p>\u201cSleepover,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cSleepover?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Morgaine stepped past Emily. \u201cMike and Em had a fight. She doesn't want to sleep in the same room.\u201d</p><p>I noticed Em\u2019s red eyes then. \u201cAre you okay, Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said, her voice still shaky. \u201cI just...you know what he\u2019s like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no.\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe just doesn't get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra won't either, Em.\u201d Morgaine wrapped her arm around Emily. \u201cShe's his best friend.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTry me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn't listen to me,\u201d she started, and it all came pouring out with tears. \u201cHe doesn't understand what I'm trying to say. He thinks I'm being needy and bitter, when all I want is for him to want to spend time with me. That's all. I just want him to want to. He doesn\u2019t even have to, that\u2019s not what I\u2019m after, you know. And I know he doesn't have time, but...it\u2019s just, maybe if he\u2019d meet with me for a coffee every morning, or even invite me, or maybe if he\u2019d spent time with me last night instead of going fishing with the boys, then I wouldn\u2019t be so upset. I don\u2019t want all his time...\u201d She took a few jagged breaths. \u201cI just want him to want to be with me, even though he can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know he doesn\u2019t want that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Emily wiped her cheeks, angling her face away from me. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t show it.\u201d</p><p>I sighed, dropping my arms. \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, Em, I do understand. And I also understand why Mike doesn't understand how you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just...that's just how he always was with girls, before he and I were together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I'm not just some girl. I'm his fianc\u00e9.\u201d She held up her ring hand.</p> <p>I shrugged. If she thought she would be any different, she was kidding herself. She knew Mike only for the curse-captured, obsessed version of himself he was with me. But that just wasn\u2019t who he was.</p><p>Morgaine hugged Emily close, rubbing her back. \u201cWhere\u2019s David, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, he\u2019s on the phone to National Security, dealing with some human issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, come on then.\u201d She grabbed my hand, keeping an arm around Em. \u201cYou\u2019re having a sleepover with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. \u201cBut no scary movies.\u201d</p><p>Emily and Morg exchanged grins.</p><p>\u201cKnock, knock,\u201d David said softly, peering into the dark room.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Morg scowled at him.</p><p>He pretended to zip his lips, then tiptoed in slowly and crawled onto the bed between Emily and I.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cMissed you.\u201d</p><p>I reached down and linked my fingers through his, cupping my other hand over his wrist.</p><p>\u201cWhat are we watching?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Em jammed her elbow in his ribs.</p><p>\u201cOw.\u201d He laughed and poked her back.</p><p>\u201cChick flick,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He turned his head to look at Emily, then Morg, and laughed quietly, swiping a tear from Em\u2019s cheek. \u201cSad movie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Emily said. \u201cJust because you lack the ability to show any human emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm beginning to see why I stopped in the first place,\u201d he said playfully, then wrapped his other arm over Emily\u2019s shoulder and pulled her ear to his lips. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>I was about to fill him in on the plot line, when Emily\u2019s lip trembled, and I realised quickly that he wasn\u2019t referring to the film.</p><p>My gaze went back to the TV set. I knew anything she had to say would be said in thought\u2014not for my ears, clearly. She was so upset tonight, which could only mean there was more to this story than she\u2019d said. But, of course, she wasn\u2019t about to badmouth Mike with me in the room. I think she knew, deep down inside, which side I\u2019d take. But she was kidding herself to think David would side with her, either; he and Mike were two peas in a pod.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to him for you,\u201d David said in that deep, whispery tone.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cDon't bother. I'm not sure I care anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do, or you wouldn\u2019t be crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis would be so much sadder if they were vampires, not humans,\u201d Morg cut in, her mouth full of popcorn.</p><p>\u201cJust pretend they are,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not crying, Ara,\u201d David stated, removing his arm from around Emily. \u201cYou always cry in these movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I've done my fair share of crying for the next decade or so.\u201d</p><p>He sat forward and looked at my face, sinking back again with a sigh. \u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust...\u201d He scratched his chin, leaving his hand just under it for a second after. \u201cI just wish I\u2019d taken better care of you.\u201d</p><p>My words were lost, and I think Morg and Em were so shocked by it, even they held their breath. I felt the awkwardness saturate the air then, as both girls slowly turned back to watch the movie, and David looked on with a certain amount of trouble behind that gaze. He wasn't watching the movie at all; he was lost in whatever picture of the past he\u2019d just apologised for. But we all looked up, Morg pausing the film, when a loud rap came down on her door, and before she even got off the bed, the tension rose in the room with the scent of Mike outside.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Morg said, opening the door only a crack.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Mike\u2019s arm appeared on the doorframe above Morg\u2019s head. \u201cYou got a sec?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, I\u2019ve got...company,\u201d she said, opening the door.</p><p>Mike\u2019s mouth popped open a little. \u201cEm, there you are. I was wondering where you\u2019d got to.\u201d</p><p>She looked into her lap.</p><p>I leaned over and whispered in Em\u2019s ear, \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing here if he\u2019s not here to see you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join us.\u201d Morg\u2019s voice rose over mine in an obvious attempt to shut me up.</p><p>\u201cNo, he's not,\u201d Emily said, coldly.</p><p>\u201cAw, Em, come on.\u201d Mike took a step into the room. \u201cDon't be like that, you know I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, just go, please,\u201d she said, holding a hand up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>Morg, Emily and I huffed loudly.</p><p>Mike stopped walking, looked at David, then me, then Morg, and turned around, leaving the icy welcome behind.</p><p>\u201cJust give it time, Em,\u201d David said as Morg closed the door. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d The tension in her shoulders eased with David\u2019s fingers softly tangling in her hair, rolling her head toward his lap. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure I can always wait for him to care.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand over David's for a second, then stroked Emily\u2019s forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re here for you, Em. Okay. You can come move into my room if you want.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, closing her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay. We just need a break.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA break?\u201d I said.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI think he needs to lose me to know what it\u2019s like to miss me.\u201d</p><p>David looked up from Emily, the deep concern remaining in his eyes. He really cared about her, and I always knew that, but now I could really see it too\u2014could really see the connection they\u2019d formed through months being alone together, sharing blood. And he thought nothing of the fact that she was lying in his lap, her lips just inches away from a place only I should go. But it didn't feel as wrong as it should. It felt like . . . I don\u2019t know, maybe like they had some deeper, untainted connection.</p><p>Morgaine sat on the chair again, leaning forward a little as though she was listening to me whisper a secret across the room. I\u2019d seen her do that before, when she was trying to get a feel for a situation, so I gave her a soft smile, which she returned.</p><p>\u201cWe ready watch the movie again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReady,\u201d David whispered.</p><p>Morg pressed play on the remote, then came to snuggle up behind Em, her head on David\u2019s shoulder like he was some Universal Pillow. He\u2019d been a part of each of our lives once\u2014in some way deeper than friendship\u2014and we all owned some small claim to him. He wasn't bothered by the closeness or affection of Em and Morg, and he didn't even seem to notice it bothered me, which probably meant I was looking into it too deeply. So, I rested my head on Emily\u2019s, and fell asleep with David stroking my hair.</p><p>Despite falling asleep in Morgaine's bed last night, David tucked tightly between me and Emily, I woke in my own bed, with a pair of radiant green eyes smiling down from the vampire standing above me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d I sat up.</p><p>\u201cSomething you haven\u2019t had for a while.\u201d</p><p>My eyes wound around the cup in his hand, steam rising from the contents, the warm smell of sweet coffee waking my mind. \u201cYou made me a coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly the best for my girl.\u201d He sat beside me. \u201cDid you sleep better last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I rubbed my head with one hand, taking the cup with the other. \u201cI didn't even dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He smirked.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I studied him, pausing a sip away from tasting the first David-made coffee I\u2019d had in what felt like forever. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>He stared at the bed sheets, as if he didn't want to tell me, but the smile tugging his lips indicated that it wasn\u2019t for any strange reason. \u201cI put you to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, like you used to when I was human?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, the grin growing. \u201cIt seems that, with the power of a king, everything I could do to you before you became immortal, I can do again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, so, are you as powerful as Jason now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My telekinesis is very limited, and I struggle to read the projected thoughts of a stronger vampire, like Mike, but I\u2019m sure, with time, that will change.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped. I hadn\u2019t expected him to tell me he could do that. \u201cYou can read anyone\u2019s projected thoughts?\u201d</p><p>His secret smile slipped across his lips. \u201cLike you didn\u2019t already know.\u201d</p> <p>I sipped my coffee as a distraction, swallowing before saying, \u201cOkay. Maybe I was a little suspicious.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask me about it then?\u201d</p><p>My lips stopped short of their next sip. \u201cI. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d David said, sliding his arm between my neck and the pillow, cuddling me close. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that, David.\u201d I sipped the coffee again. \u201cIt\u2019s more like I just figured you\u2019d lie to me, or. . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr ask me why I was curious.\u201d</p><p>His spine straightened a little. I was sure he already knew how my curiosities came about\u2014by talking with Jason\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to hear me say it.</p><p>\u201cCan. . .\u201d And here was something I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to know, but kind of needed to. \u201cCan you read unfiltered thoughts yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn demand, do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I . . . I know you could do it randomly for a few days after the coronation, but, has that changed?\u201d</p> <p>The birds outside sang a song to fill the silence, and the gentle breeze moved the still air. David took a slow breath, his eyes switching from thought to humour and back again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I can read unguarded, un-projected thoughts again, but\u2014\u201d he said, but ended it there.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . not always, and . . . it\u2019s only yours so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine?\u201d I sat up a little more, balancing the cup in hand so as not to spill the contents. \u201cWhy only mine? Am I weak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Emily weak?\u201d He grinned. \u201cI can read hers.\u201d</p><p>Hmpf. I turned my head quickly and sipped my coffee, focusing on the liquid.</p> <p>He just laughed. \u201cI love your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled into my cup. I knew what he meant, because I loved his jealousy too\u2014the way any mention of Jason made his blood change temperature. \u201cCan you read Jason\u2019s mind?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, sitting back a little. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan he still read yours?\u201d</p><p>The conversation had clearly gone sour. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>My smile widened. \u201cI love your jealousy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, My Queen, do not need to be jealous of my brother.\u201d He took my cup and pushed me gently backward on the bed, a playful grin sweeping the anger from his eyes. \u201cI have you. I married you, and I will never need to play against him for your heart.\u201d</p><p>I touched his face, looking from his lips to his eyes. So many words came to my tongue, ready to roll off, tell him how right he was, but that sinking feeling\u2014the one like I\u2019d forgotten a child in the car on a hot day at a supermarket\u2014roiled up inside me. My eyes became smaller, focusing on it. I\u2019d forgotten something. I just knew it. And whatever it was, I needed to remember, because whatever it was, I was sure now, had something to do with Jase.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d he said with wonder, his eyes searching my face. \u201cI wish I could read your mind as easily as I used to. I miss knowing everything you're wondering and dreaming.\u201d</p><p>I let my legs fall softly apart as his weight came down to rest between them. \u201cI miss it, too. Miss everything about being human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He looked at my lips, his lovely dimple pressing into his cheek. \u201cBecause I can think of one thing you don't miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d He rolled the tip of his thumb past his index finger, tearing it open, and wiped the warm, sweet liquid across my lips.</p><p>My tongue moved involuntarily, stealing the blood for itself, sending it down to the back of my throat. And that was it. I had to have more.</p><p>David laughed as I rolled up and flipped him onto his back, landing on his hips like a cowgirl. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I miss being human. I miss the sweetness, the, I don't know, the innocence of our love back then, but I like this much better,\u201d I said, driving my pelvis down hard on his...zipper. \u201cAnd you do realise I'm so hungry right now I could drain you dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, succubus.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll flip you over after and take it all back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a threat or a promise?\u201d</p><p>I squealed, suddenly moving through the air, landing on my back with the pillows rising up around my ears, and David's jeans scraping roughly against my bare upper thighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, in that case\u2014\u201d I thumbed a button undone on his shirt and traced my finger down his flesh from his throat to his sternum. \u201cCome closer so I can bite you.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>I came over the hill, the midday sun bright and yellow above me, glaring in my eyes enough that as I set my gaze down on the basketball court, I could swear I saw Mike holding a child up to the hoop.</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d</p><p>He bent down, then tossed his hand in the air, waving it once. \u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what you do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Will,\u201d he cut in, presenting a small, blond-haired boy. \u201cHe\u2019s new.\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead halfway down the hill. \u201cYes, we met yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Mike smiled at the kid. \u201cI\u2019ll just walk \u2018im back inside. Two secs, \u2018kay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said chirpily, but my bones wouldn\u2019t move. Who on Earth authorised him to take the Damned outside? I mean, what if Will tried to escape? He could end up in all kinds of terrible places.</p><p>Mike walked the boy back toward the house, his hand on his shoulder, both of them talking animatedly, like they were best buddies. I almost didn\u2019t recognise my \u2018mature\u2019 best friend and Chief of Security anymore. He even dressed differently when he came to see the Dammed\u2014always in jeans and a light coloured T-shirt, usually wearing a baseball cap, too. And I kinda liked him this way. He was Fun Mike. Guy-I-grew-up-with Mike.</p><p>I reached the base of the hill as Mike broke into a light jog back in my direction, bending to scoop the basketball off the ground as he approached. \u201cHey, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey. Letting the Damned out now, huh?\u201d</p><p>He smirked at the quaver in my voice. \u201cYeah. Who'd have thought blood-hungry kids could get a release of energy from playing outdoors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . who, exactly, approved this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d He stood taller, clearly ready for a challenge. \u201cBut not without supervision, and only one at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing, Ara. Those kids,\u201d he pointed to the house, \u201cfor the most part, are normal. You can\u2019t keep them locked away for the rest of their lives\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I\u2019m the one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if the conditions are pleasant,\u201d he finished. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree, Ara, but you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike.\u201d I put my hands up. \u201cI agree, okay. I was just. . .\u201d</p><p>He smiled sheepishly. \u201cSurprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I didn\u2019t mean to start an argument. I think it\u2019s great they\u2019re going outside.\u201d I glanced over at the house to see all the little faces watching Mike and I through the window. \u201cIt\u2019s just that no one told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t David?\u201d Mike jumped up to dunk the ball in the hoop.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I strolled over and caught it on the rebound. \u201cHe told me we had a new group, and mentioned something about education, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you we decided not to feed them Pure Blood?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, searching my brain for that conversation, but it\u2019d never happened. \u201cNo. Why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one, they\u2019ve all been rejecting it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But, we were just gonna keep trying in the hopes\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough for them, Ar. Think of them as concentrated versions of vampires\u2014they need more blood than an adult.\u201d He stole the ball from my hands. \u201cKind of like when vampires get hurt and need human blood because ours isn\u2019t strong enough then, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what were the other reasons you decided against giving them our blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want them immune to Pure Blood venom.\u201d He threw the ball into the hoop, ignoring my sudden gasp. \u201cWe left it that way in case you never find a cure for vampirism.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you're just going to kill them if I can\u2019t change them back?\u201d</p><p>Mike took a deep breath. \u201cWe may have no choice. They can\u2019t stay that way for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike! That\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But it won\u2019t come to that. Besides,\u201d he said, dribbling the ball, \u201cwe\u2019re also leaving things open in case one of them wants to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're giving them the option?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey're children, they can\u2019t make that kind of choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, those kids are older than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in human years.\u201d I stole the ball.</p><p>\u201cYes, but they mature with experience and age, just like we do.\u201d He reached across and snatched it from my hands, throwing me a vehement glare with just a hint of a smile underneath. \u201cTheir minds aren\u2019t locked in childhood at all, like vampires first thought. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I cut in. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them learn, show reason, integrity, wisdom, even. But I don\u2019t like the idea of giving them the option of suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom, you mean.\u201d He turned away and threw the ball toward the hoop.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFreedom. It\u2019s not the option of suicide, Ara. It\u2019s the freedom to choose an immortal life or a peaceful death.\u201d</p><p>I studied him carefully for a second before he broke the stare and wandered over to grab the ball from across the court. He was serious about this stuff. I\u2019d never seen him get so . . . red in the face, over any topic. \u201cWhy does it matter to you so much, Mike\u2014whether they live or die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d He tossed the ball to me; I caught it. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>I hid my smile with the turn of my back, and aimed the orange ball to the sky, throwing it but missing my target. \u201cYou come here every day, don't you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no reason.\u201d I folded my arms, squinting up at him. \u201cOne might just think you were starting to like those kids.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He smiled bashfully, jamming his hands in his pockets, but it slipped away as he looked at his feet. \u201cSo what was the deal with you lot last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had coffee with Morg this morning. She told me you all fell asleep on David.\u201d</p> <p>I took a step away and grabbed the ball off the ground. \u201cYeah. And?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was Emily?\u201d</p><p>I passed him the ball. \u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, hinting the obvious. \u201cWhere, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, she had her head in his lap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He spun the ball around a few times between his palms, studying it. \u201cYou all looked at me last night like I was coming to Morg\u2019s room for sex or something, yet Em falls asleep with her head in your husband\u2019s crotch, and no one bats an eyelid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d He glanced sideways at me, the ball rolling off his fingertips toward the hoop again. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThings aren\u2019t great between her and I, Ar, but . . . I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you? Really?\u201d I asked in a flat but curious tone.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He bent down to grab the ball. \u201cShe just expects too much of me. I can't be with her twenty-four-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you don't want to.\u201d</p><p>He made a basket, his hands staying in the air a few seconds longer than needed. \u201cI . . . I don't know.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, trapping the ball under my toe as it rolled toward me. \u201cTrouble in paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d He copied my grin, elbowing me in the ribs after.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me one thing,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you actually want to be with her, Mike, or are you holding on to her like some trophy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice shot.\u201d He laughed, watching my ball go through the hoop without hitting the rims. \u201cAnd . . . yes. I do want to be with her, Ara. But\u2014\u201d His gaze went distant.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are . . . things. I dunno.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI just . . . it\u2019s not all black and white.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk,\u201d I said, and Mike walked away, taking a seat on the courtside bench, with his head in his hands.</p><p>I sat beside him, leaving the ball to roll off, coming to rest on the foot of the hill.</p><p>\u201cWhen I spend time with her, she\u2019s not even there. You know, I told her something really personal the other day, and she. . .\u201d He leaned back, looking up at the sky. \u201cShe laughed. Yet, when I told Morg the same thing, she. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she supported me. It\u2019s like, I know you think there\u2019s something with Morg and me, but there\u2019s not. She just . . . listens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gets you,\u201d I said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s not just her special talent, Ar. She\u2019s a good person.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and looked up at the same place Mike was staring. \u201cSo, are you saying you want Emily to be more like Morgaine?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, catching the humour in my voice. \u201cI just want her to want me for more than the idea she has of me, if that makes any sense.\u201d</p><p>I ran the words over in my head, interpreting them as best I could. \u201cYou want to be free to be you, and have her love you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But she\u2019s got this image of me and what I should be, you know? And it\u2019s not me, Ar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I nodded, thinking more about the Mike I grew up with. \u201cSo, what was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe personal thing you told Morg and Em, but not me.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted in a breathy grin. \u201cIt\u2019s private.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me.\u201d</p><p>I saw him considering it as he studied me in his peripheral, and I knew that, for the first time in so long, he saw me as his best friend again. \u201cI spend more time down here than I do at the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d I was taken aback for a moment, disguising my shock quickly with a smile. \u201cYou like hanging with the children?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his whole body rocking with the movement. \u201cI get something out of this. I don\u2019t know. I just . . . when I spend the day with them\u2014teaching them things, playing with them, and I see the difference it makes\u2014see them put what I\u2019ve taught them into practice or see them behave differently each time I visit, it. . .\u201d He stopped for a second to look at my face. \u201cIt makes my life seem like it has a purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d was only one of the hundred questions I suddenly wanted to ask.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked into my eyes then at my lips, probably expecting me to laugh. \u201cMorg thinks I should change my career path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>His hands tightened, a slow breath filling the lengthy pause. \u201cA teacher.\u201d</p><p>My gut dropped. \u201cAre you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He waved a reassuring hand. \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about it. You know I couldn\u2019t leave you, but I . . . I like the idea, you know, that maybe this\u2014\u201d he motioned around himself and my world, \u201c\u2014isn\u2019t all there is for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what did Em think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks . . . She\u2014\u201d He swallowed the lump in his throat. \u201cWell, she said it was ridiculous. Said I was born to be Chief, and that I shouldn\u2019t be anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d I nodded, stalling for time until I could sort my own thoughts and opinions out from my fears and worries. \u201cMorg\u2019s right, Mike. You\u2019ve always been the sort of guy who\u2019d be good at teaching. I mean, hell, you taught me nearly everything useful I know in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, shucks.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cBuuuut. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He patted my hand. \u201cI know you need me here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t always, though, Mike.\u201d I patted his hand back until he looked at me. \u201cI think it\u2019s great, and I think you should definitely do it. But, just . . . can you wait \u2018til this Drake thing\u2019s resolved?\u201d</p><p>He put his arm around my neck and pulled me close. \u201cSure, kid. I hadn\u2019t made any plans to go anywhere just yet. You can count on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled, pressing my brow into his kiss.</p><p>Since the king took his place on the throne, so many things had changed around here, including our secret meeting place under the Throne Room floor. The plain wooden chairs that edged the round table before had been replaced by what looked like dark-wood artefacts from King Arthur\u2019s Vault, each one square-topped, high-backed and identical. Even the king\u2019s and queen\u2019s chairs were the same as everyone else\u2019s, symbolising unity, David had told me, adding that the round table represented equality among men for the better of the kingdom.</p><p>We\u2019d discussed brightening the room with modern lighting but, in the end, David felt it was best to leave things traditional. I guess growing up by the light of torches in sconces made him accustomed to it. But my new vampire vision hadn\u2019t enhanced my ability to read in the dark, which was another thing that\u2019d changed since David returned from the dead: minutes. We now documented and recorded every discussion held in this room, unless spoken in confidence\u2014the minutes jotted down in some giant, yellowing old book with a quill and ink. David had come down with a bad case of sixteenth-century-itis. And, now, I was stuck editing the A4 sheets before they were sent to the scroll room for insertion into the giant book.</p><p>\u201cArrangements have been made,\u201d David finished, cutting Mike off. \u201cI need you here to protect the queen while I\u2019m away.\u201d</p><p>Mike sat down on the long wooden bench against the wall. \u201cI am the head of security, David. It\u2019s my job to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your job to do as I tell you,\u201d he finished, looking back at the faces around the table. Mike shook his head, yielding. \u201cBesides,\u201d David added. \u201cI want you to oversee Court in my absence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d pretty much everyone in the room said.</p><p>David sat down, his eyes moving past Blade, Ryder, Quaid, then Falcon, landing finally on Mike. \u201cWe both know Ara doesn\u2019t have the guts to do what has to be done around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I cut in.</p><p>\u201cThe men who were arrested last week for breaking human law?\u201d he said, his brow arching to prompt my memory.</p><p>\u201cSo I let them off with a warning.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with showing compassion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not how things are done,\u201d David said. \u201cNow, more than ever, we need to show strength. We need to make examples of these lawbreakers and make certain their behaviour is not contagious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the fear of torture was enough to scare them into behaving from now on,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cIf that were so, my love, they\u2019d not have committed a crime in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d Mike said. \u201cI\u2019m not undermining Ara by ruling Court while you\u2019re gone. She has to appear strong and independent, and that\u2019s more important than seeing everyone gets the right punishments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo show mercy is to exude weakness,\u201d David said, and looked at Morgaine.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Morg said. \u201cBut also agree with Mike, David. You can\u2019t put your security chief on the throne to do your bidding when you have a perfectly capable queen. What message does that give our people about your faith in her?\u201d</p><p>David looked sideways at me.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat does it tell me about his faith in me?\u201d</p><p>David leaned his elbows on the table, his head falling heavily into his sigh. \u201cI have faith in you, Ara. But you\u2019re too kind, sweetheart. You let too many murderous villains off with a warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I sat taller. \u201cI can be mean, if you want me to.\u201d</p><p>He half laughed. \u201cFine. Prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO. . .kay.\u201d I looked at Mike for a second. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere will be a case brought before us in Court today\u2014three men accused of murder in the human realm. I want you to judge them harshly, Ara. I want you to make an example of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing that was done before you took the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must sentence them to seven days\u2019 burial, without comforts. No torchlight, no air, no blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cThey have to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s barbaric. They\u2019ll go insane.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cLesser men have survived worse. Perhaps they\u2019ll come out better for it in the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to say, I agree.\u201d Blade leaned back in his chair, chewing a piece of grass he\u2019d smuggled in.</p><p>\u201cBlade? You can\u2019t be serious,\u201d I said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked at Emily\u2019s shocked face then back at me. \u201cDo you know what these men did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He sat up, placing the grass on the table. \u201cDo you know what they did to their victim?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t just break human law, Majesty. They broke our laws by killing in cold blood. They didn\u2019t even eat the man. They stabbed him several times in the chest and left him in an alley to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, isn\u2019t imprisonment enough, maybe twenty-five years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a human, yes, given that they lead such short lives,\u201d Ryder piped up. \u201cBut not for our kind, My Queen. It\u2019s laughable.\u201d</p><p>Mike stood. \u201cI agree, Ara. You need to use scare tactics right now. Once you\u2019ve established your monarchy and shown your strength, you can ease up a bit, but right now, people are looking for signs of weakness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo these men have to suffer so I can make a point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are many casualties on the road to freedom, Majesty.\u201d Morgaine bowed her head. \u201cTheir sacrifice is given for the greater good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine then,\u201d I challenged, looking at my king. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but you\u2019re going to walk those men down to the crypt and close their coffins yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA good councilman always does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but you're not a councilman anymore, David.\u201d I stood up. \u201cYou're the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means I\u2019m extending a courtesy to you by arguing this, Ara. That courtesy ends now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d he said firmly, and the room fell to flat silence.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t agree with this. I don\u2019t agree that burying men alive is going to solve anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree. I am the king, and I have final say.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened to protest, but I just couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing, and the whole room seemed to stand still, as if no one had the courage to speak up against their king, even though he was wrong.</p><p>\u201cIn this monarchy,\u201d I said firmly, my voice not even shaking, \u201cthe queen holds the power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the way I run things.\u201d He stood up slowly, placing his hands on the table, and I finally saw what it was the people saw in this king\u2014the reason they feared him. \u201cNow. Sit. Down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra. I'm not kidding. There are ways things need to be done. You have a king because you don't have the gut to handle this stuff. Now sit and let us do our job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won't allow torture.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s stone face broke; he laughed, waving a hand in my direction. \u201cTake your idealism somewhere else, Ara. I don't have time for it.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, digging deeper for a little inner strength, and looked at Mike, whose mouth hung open. This was clearly the councilman we hadn\u2019t met yet\u2014the David everyone warned me about. But I wasn\u2019t surprised, not like Mike. I\u2019d seen this David before.</p><p>\u201cMate, why not let her try it her way? If you\u2019re right, the best way to show Ara is to let her learn from her own experiences. She\u2019ll never learn from being told.\u201d</p><p>David stared Mike down for a second, then turned to me, his eyes softening when he looked into mine. \u201cOkay. Go ahead, but you\u2019ll be taking us back to the Stone Age, Ara, and when more vampires go ramped because there\u2019s nothing to fear, we\u2019ll be doing it my way, and I don't want any arguments from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered, nodding.</p><p>\u201cRight. Now. Missing venom stores.\u201d He looked around the room. \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing yet, Your Majesty.\u201d Blade sat back, linking both hands behind his head. \u201cThe dawn guard noticed the lock on the weapons vault was broken at about four in the morning, and seventy per cent of the venom was gone\u2014no fingerprints, no fibres or hairs. Nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo we think it was inside job?\u201d He looked at Mike.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking in to that,\u201d Mike said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got forensics on it, too. They\u2019re combing that place as we speak. If anything\u2019s to be found, they\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing they can\u2019t find,\u201d Quaid said, and we all looked at him; he grinned. \u201cA motive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have a pretty good idea what the motive is,\u201d David said flatly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m damn sure we\u2019ll be seeing those venom stores again\u2014on the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real?\u201d I said, not really meaning to say it out loud.</p><p>David looked over at me, offering a small smile. \u201cDrake has threatened us once before. I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s preparing for war, Ara. And I\u2019m certain he will attack without warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we evacuate the town? The Lilithians have human children there.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m sending spies out to Elysium tomorrow to keep an eye on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, last we heard, Drake still hadn\u2019t returned there,\u201d Mike said. \u201cSo, if he\u2019s planning an attack, it\u2019ll be from somewhere unknown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps. But we don\u2019t have those kinds of resources elsewhere, Mike,\u201d David said, meaning \u2018we\u2019 as the Set he used to belong to. \u201cDrake needs the armoury at Elysium if he\u2019s going to attack. And when he returns to set things in motion, my spies will alert us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine but, in the meantime, we need to find those venom stores. Without those, all he can do is injure our troops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr kidnap one to extract venom,\u201d Blade said, sending Mike and I stiff. If Drake came after anyone for their venom, it could only be either myself, Mike, or one of my private guards\u2014all people I cared about immensely.</p><p>\u201cYes, so, with that in mind,\u201d David said, pointing at Mike and my Guard. \u201cI want you five to be extra vigilant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need vigilance. You have me.\u201d</p><p>I sat back, rolling my eyes. If he kept up this high-and-mighty behaviour, he\u2019d be the one needing vigilance.</p><p>I no longer feared the Enchanted Forest. All those tales I\u2019d been told about the trees imprisoning anyone who dared walk below their bows at the hour of dawn must have been lies. Nothing like that had ever happened to me. But the rumour did afford me a kind of privacy at this hour I couldn\u2019t get anywhere else, which gave me a chance to think about things I couldn\u2019t dare think of at the manor.</p><p>A bright orange orb glowed through the trunks up ahead at a distance, the dawn rising around the forest like a warm greeting. I reached out and touched the base of each tree I passed, a kind of unspoken good morning, and each one responded with a gentle tingle against my fingertips. The ground beneath my bare feet was covered in dry, summer leaves, cushioning my steps while the energy of the forest rose up from the platform of nature, electrifying every nerve within me. I felt alive out here. More alive than anywhere else I\u2019d ever been. There was no loneliness in this forest\u2014not like when I visited the Garden of Lilith. No, out here I had the company of something not found within the border of the manor. It was as if Nature had given up on that place\u2014given up on the grounds, the people, even my garden. But ever since the day I swore in my own blood to protect the Stone and everything under its rule, the need to feel the buzz of life around me had become like my need for oxygen. If a day went by where I didn\u2019t come here, didn\u2019t strip down to nakedness, or at least leave my shoes behind out of respect for those things living under my feet, it almost felt like I was trapped in a coffin. And with all the pain I\u2019d suffered these passing years, the last thing I needed was to feel buried as well.</p><p>I walked on toward the openness up ahead, in search of the space and breath I knew I\u2019d find above the valley. I could breathe out here, but I could not escape the emptiness I brought with me. Something was missing. Some vital part of my mind or maybe soul had disconnected somehow, and no matter how hard I searched, I couldn\u2019t find the time or place in my memory that it first occurred. But I knew something wasn\u2019t right, and I knew that the bad dreams, the memory loss and this hollowness inside me was connected and that, somehow, it had something to do with Jase. Maybe it was as simple as my denied heart wanting him as a friend, or maybe it went deeper. I wasn\u2019t sure. But I had to figure it out, whatever it was, for David\u2019s sake and mine.</p><p>As I reached the clearing at the Stone of Truth, the energy in the forest surged and raced toward me along veins under the ground, gathering and collecting in this one place, rising up through my feet to wake my sleeping cells, then trickling away again and returning to the Stone.</p><p>I closed my eyes and held my arms out, angling my face to the sky, while the whispers of Nature filled the silence, making all the tiny hairs on my body stand on end. I could hear the wind kiss the thin edges of every leaf, could feel the small droplets of sunlight sneaking through the canopy, dancing intermittently on the bark around my toes, could hear the smallest insects crawling beneath the soil, and hear even the brush of a bird\u2019s wing on the sky. This was my song. This was where I could plug myself in to all that I was, and just exist, for no other reason than to be a part of something greater. Here, I could think clearly.</p><p>Here, I could focus on something other than the suffocating dread I had that something was missing.</p><p>Here, I could quieten my mind long enough to see the answers beneath all the questions.</p><p>\u201cAuress?\u201d a child called.</p><p>I slowly opened my eyes and lowered my arms, but as my gaze went to the Stone, a flash of gold hair caught my eye. \u201cHello? Is anyone there?\u201d</p><p>A child\u2019s face showed around a tree trunk; her cheeky smile challenging.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I called, but she ducked out of sight again\u2014her high giggles echoing off everything around me. \u201cEve, is that you?\u201d</p><p>She ran to the next tree, her hair trailing behind her like gold ribbons, but when I came upon her, she was gone again.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d I called. \u201cPlease come out.\u201d</p><p>I waited.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d</p><p>She giggled again, this time appearing further away. I ran after her, my limbs opening up as I broke into a fast, human sprint, feeling the air expand my lungs like a breath I\u2019d forgotten to take. I followed her all the way out to the clearing by the lighthouse, glad I\u2019d decided not to walk naked today, and stopped dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Trees had grown up overnight like blossoming buds in a time-lapse film, their luscious leaves casting shadows over the long grass, where the scent of apples and rotting cider wafted on the early fog, making sweet perfume in the air. I walked cautiously between the columns of trees, pinching the leaves on a few branches as I went to see if they were real. And as I came to a stop at the giant oak tree, centre to the orchard, I knew then that the child I saw must have been Evangeline. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAuress,\u201d she said, and my gaze went up the trunk to the tiny child sitting on the longest branch\u2014one leg dangling down, her finger twirling a lock of hair into a curl.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing up there?\u201d I stepped closer.</p><p>She smiled and reached up to pluck something from between two branches, holding it out in her open palm after.</p><p>\u201cCome down, Eve?\u201d I offered my hand. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled, but shook her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why won\u2019t you come down?\u201d</p><p>The smile grew, her eyes darting from my face to something behind me.</p><p>And a hand came down on my shoulder. I spun around and shielded my eyes, blinded suddenly by the high sun, seeing only a silhouette of a man there.</p><p>\u201cJeeze, Ara, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Jason said, helping me stand from the folded position I took. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, feeling silly. \u201cIt\u2019s just the light. It blinded me for a sec.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWhat were . . . what were you doing?\u201d</p><p>I looked back at the oak tree. Eve was gone. \u201cI was. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea, do you?\u201d he asked, taking a step back from me.</p><p>I stood with my mouth open for a second. \u201cI . . . no. Not really.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cYou were talking to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWas I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was I saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It wasn\u2019t in English.\u201d</p><p>I felt my face pale. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>My jaw angled slightly away from him then, my gaze drifting inconspicuously to the field. The apple trees were gone\u2014the fog and the cool and the scent of the orchard fading with it. I rubbed my head. \u201cI must have been sleepwalking.\u201d</p><p>Jase nodded, thoughtful.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing out here, anyway?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt\u2019s very early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEarly?\u201d He looked up at the sky, then into the distance where the manor sat, its cream fascia rising up over the Enchanted Forest like a castle. \u201cIt\u2019s after midday, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um. Really?\u201d I rubbed my head.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He drew both hands from his jeans pockets and walked over to sit under the old oak\u2019s leafy bows. \u201cAre you okay, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said wistfully, my toes parting the long grass with each step, the temperature of the soil beneath it cool and moist as if the morning were new. I tucked my dress under my bottom and sat down beside Jase. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve just got a lot going on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded casually, reaching between us to pluck a blade of grass from its roots. \u201cWanna talk about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said, but didn\u2019t talk.</p><p>\u201cYou know\u2014\u201d He leaned forward, resting his arm over a bended knee, wrapping the grass around his fingertip like a green ring. \u201cI was thinking about you before I ran into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll good thoughts, I hope.\u201d</p><p>He lay back, crossing his hands under his head, his feet flat on the ground just by my leg. \u201cI was just thinking how amazing it is that we\u2019re both still here, you and I\u2014that we can be friends\u2014sit side by side this way after everything you\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean after everything evil you did to me,\u201d I joked, gently slapping his bony knee.</p><p>He lifted his head a bit and offered a sweet smile, that soft, Jason smile that radiated the kindness in his soul. \u201cYes, and that takes an unbelievable amount of strength, Ara, which is as scary as it is incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can't even begin to imagine what it must have taken for you to survive what I did to you\u2014both times. And yet you came out of that. Your scars healed, your heart healed and, somehow, you found the strength to not only move on, but forgive me,\u201d his voice broke.</p><p>\u201cWow, you\u2019re really cut up about all this,\u201d I said, still making light of things.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I sat back against the barky trunk.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you are capable of more than you possibly realise, Ara. Yet you don\u2019t know that, and it breaks my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d I tilted my head bashfully to one side.</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it. You . . . you're like those fake columns in the Throne Room.\u201d</p><p>I pictured the stone pillars marking the aisles of the Throne Room, sitting proudly as beams of support, despite baring no actual weight at all. \u201cHow do you know they're fake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you think of them a lot.\u201d He shrugged against the grass. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because you know you\u2019re just the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might not feel like the pillar of strength, Ara, but if that roof ever does cave in, you\u2019ll be the one left standing, still holding everything together.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed, crossing my legs under me. \u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I mean, if you think about it, you always have been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? No way. You\u2019re thinking of David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s the hammer that nails the coffin, so to speak. No one would ever mess with him. But you\u2019re the one they look to for strength, Ara. Because you exude it in every breath you take, and everyone I speak to says the same thing: they have no idea how you\u2019ve come to survive what you\u2019ve suffered.\u201d</p><p>I lay down in the grass too, my toes against his shoes, bodies facing opposite directions. \u201cWell, with you saying nice things like that to me, maybe I\u2019ll start to believe it all one day.\u201d</p><p>He crawled over and landed on his side next to me, smiling at the corner of my mouth. \u201cSweet girl, you already do.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, too, reaching down to scratch the itchy rash on my hip. \u201cYeah. Okay. Maybe I believe that, but I don't think I\u2019ve found any backbone yet to support my own opinions.\u201d</p><p>He knocked my hand gently away from my skin. \u201cI don't know about that. I saw you make your own ruling in your very first session of Court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I thought back to that day. \u201cGuess I kinda did. But I got in trouble after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? As long as you thought it was the right thing to do.\u201d He turned my face until I looked into his eyes. \u201cBe the spoilt queen if you have to. Make your own decisions and know that we will back you one hundred per cent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of you will,\u201d I said flatly, thinking about David.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said sternly. \u201cAll of us will.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at the blue through the dancing leaves above us, trying hard to believe that. \u201cBut what if I put my foot down about something, and I'm wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we back you on that, too.\u201d He lay back again. \u201cBut, you won't be wrong. You\u2019re a smart girl. You just have to trust yourself.\u201d</p><p>I pushed up on my elbow and looked down at his face; his eyes met mine, all green and lovely, sparkling in the morning light, but the shadows made dark circles under them, showing how tired he was, how tired his soul was. I wiped my thumb softly over the sunken skin and leaned in to kiss his cheek in an innocent, friendly gesture. \u201cThanks, Jase.\u201d</p><p>He slowly cupped the small wet spot my lips left, a smile growing across his face. \u201cYou don't need to thank me for saying things you should already know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. Because you're the only one who ever does.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, still smiling, casting his gaze to the leaves. \u201cYou know David will see that kiss in your thoughts, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOops.\u201d I cringed a little.</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It was worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth a week in the dungeon?\u201d</p><p>He sat quiet for a second, then nodded once. \u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>I still had no clue if this scroll was a prophecy or a contract. Everyone had very compelling theories either way, but no one seemed to know any truths. Which is what brought me down here to the Scroll Room in the dead of night.</p><p>I laid the yellowing document on the table in front of me, not bothering with tweezers to preserve the delicate, ancient paper. Quite frankly, if it got destroyed, maybe all this nonsense would die with it: no more mystery surrounding its interpretation, no more possibility that either my daughter or me have been sworn over to Drake, and no more plans for one of us to be killed on the Stone of Truth with the Dagger of Yahanna so the bad guy could steal our powers. And maybe, just maybe, it would put this nonsense of David dying to rest.</p><p>But, I knew that removing the needle wouldn\u2019t undo the sting.</p><p>\u201cArgh!\u201d I huffed, scraping a layer of ash away from the corner of the page. Whoever damaged these scrolls had done a darn good job of it. There were barely any words left to read, and that was if you could even read the Language of the Ancients. Which, I couldn\u2019t. But I did still have Jason\u2019s sheet of interpretations. Only, even his words didn\u2019t make sense if this scroll was a contract. It just seemed too melodramatic: A time will come for the Pure One to rise. In Her Reign Of Light And Hope, she will free the land from the Fated Curse, and bear a child with great power.</p><p>I slid the other page of Jason\u2019s English translations over and held the candle up to them so I could see better in this dim, midnight light. The next line said, A child, possible only if conceived of pure? \u2014the question mark circled in red, because he wasn\u2019t sure if the translation for that word was noble blood, blood of Knight, or cleansed, since they could all mean the same thing. Then there were the next words: Born as and Son. He\u2019d told me the symbol for those words had no translation\u2014that it was similar to a word meaning firstborn, but also to one meaning disguised.</p><p>I exhaled with a grunt and sat back in the hard wooden chair, propping my feet up on the oak stabiliser under the table. How was I ever going to come up with an answer to this mystery if I couldn\u2019t decide what I believed to be true? Or maybe that was it. Maybe I had to pick a story and go with it.</p><p>I pawed over the pages again, comparing the symbols to the English notes.</p><p>\u201cNeed some help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGah!\u201d I dropped the scroll, blowing out the hard breath that almost became a really loud scream when I saw the familiar face. \u201cBlade? You scared the living hell out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d He pulled up a chair and sat beside me. \u201cIf there\u2019s no hell in you, maybe I won\u2019t find you so hot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d I issued him a dumbfounded stare.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d he explained, rolling his hand around as if I might get the joke. \u201cBecause Hell is hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d I looked back at the pages. \u201cWell, sorry to burst your bubble, Blade, but you\u2019re bound by the Curse of the Original Lilith. You\u2019ll love me until you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr until I fall head over heels for someone else.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d I said. \u201cNot too many worthy female counterparts around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything\u2019s gotta be better than you.\u201d He nudged me with his elbow, flashing a toothy grin.</p><p>\u201cYes, considering I may be destined for death-by-evil-vampire.\u201d</p> <p>He leaned in and peered at my sheets. \u201cHm. Tricky stuff, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I dumped the pages on the desk again and rubbed my face. \u201cYou got any ideas what all this means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to look at him, but he sat there, his face straight, hands in his lap, looking distracted or maybe bored. \u201cBlade?\u201d I said loudly, slapping his wrist.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He laughed, snapping out it. \u201cCouldn't resist torturing you a little.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ve had enough torture for one lifetime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh ha!\u201d He laughed, pointing at me. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like distasteful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, it was actually funny,\u201d he said in that well-articulated English accent, drawing his chair a little closer to the lip of the table. \u201cRight.

What is the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I, pretty queen,\u201d he said distractedly, his eyes moving over the words. \u201cBut, for what, exactly?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A child conceived with a firstborn nobleman and a pure Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then again, we could be wrong.\u201d He looked up at me.</p><p>I sunk back in my seat. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why the big deal about all this?\u201d He held up the scroll in question. \u201cI mean, what does it matter if we find the truth or not, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t.\u201d I took the scroll and rolled it up. \u201cI guess I just don\u2019t like questions being unanswered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Princess Sherlock\u2014\u201d he stood up and pushed his chair in, \u201c\u2014you won\u2019t find the answers by looking at the same sheet you\u2019ve been looking at every night since David arose from the dead.\u201d</p> <p>I frowned at him, tucking the scroll under my arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve been following me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my job.\u201d He spread both arms out and took a small bow.</p><p>\u201cNot at night.\u201d</p><p>His lip curved into a sharp, sideways smile. \u201cI am your eternal servant, My Queen. I am never off duty, especially when I know that you know you don\u2019t have a guard on at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should that matter?\u201d My lip turned up. \u201cWhat did you think I was up to down here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing bad. That\u2019s not why I followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you?\u201d I pushed past him and walked into the storage room; the musty smell of lonely pages was stronger here, closed in by the narrow aisles at least two vampires tall and twenty meters long, the shelves crammed tightly with scrolls and parchments.</p><p>Blade leaned his forearm on the doorframe above his head. \u201cI was worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. About you\u2014about how you\u2019re feeling right now.\u201d He folded his arms. \u201cI actually thought you might be coming down here to cry in privacy.\u201d</p><p>I gave a mock pout, grabbing a pile of scrolls. \u201cHow sweet. But I\u2019m not that into you, Blade, not enough to cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d He stepped aside to let me pass. \u201cBut, seriously, I thought you might be upset about David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the way he\u2019s been treating you,\u201d he said suggestively.</p><p>I stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Blade added. \u201cI notice everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just trying to stamp his seal, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that.\u201d Blade walked over and pushed in the chair I\u2019d left hanging out. \u201cBut he\u2019s all high and mighty about it this week. He\u2019s even hurt my feelings.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cHe\u2019ll get over it. I\u2019m giving him a gentle period of adjustment. Then, I\u2019ll kick his ass if he snaps at me in public again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he. . .\u201d Blade lowered his face but looked up with his eyes. \u201cIs he like that behind closed doors?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, laughing the word out. \u201cHe\u2019s still the same sweet David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019kay.\u201d He nodded. \u201cWell, I\u2019m just lookin\u2019 out for ya, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time, Sherlock.\u201d He saluted me and grabbed the stone column beside the stairs, using it to sling his body around the corner and out of sight.</p><p>\u201cMorning, My Queen.\u201d Edgar bowed, placing a tray on the edge of my bed.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Edgar.\u201d I sat up a little to look at David. \u201cWhere\u2019s the king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the crypt, Majesty.\u201d Edgar wandered over and opened my curtains. \u201cHe\u2019s given permission for you to dine in bed this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe crypt. What\u2019s he doing in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe he is carrying out the sentence he passed on the four men from New York this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I shoved the covers back. \u201cI sentenced those men yesterday at Court. They were to be put in the cell block.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies, Majesty.\u201d Edgar bowed. \u201cPerhaps I am mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, Edgar.\u201d I slipped my robe on and tied the belt around my waist. \u201cDavid\u2019s gone behind my back.\u201d</p><p>I charged forward, ignoring Falcon\u2019s line of questions as my feet moved over carpet then tiles then stone steps, following my memory down through the cell tunnels and the dark, chilly corridors that led to the crypt below the manor.</p><p>Row upon of row of caskets lined the walls like bars of gold in a vault, each one containing an ancient skeleton of loved ones passed, or victims of Lilith\u2019s hunger in the days she was alive. I\u2019d been down to the crypt only once\u2014walked into the open cavern of the Main Tomb, and my blood had run cold. It reminded me of a great underground cave, the walls rising high into the air above, almost blue-grey, turning black where the cave went too deep to see. But you couldn\u2019t walk through it. The cave went on forever behind a small brick wall placed as a partition between the floor and an endless drop into nothing\u2014the same endless drop they lowered prisoners into when Drake ruled.</p><p>My steps slowed slightly as I reached the end of the tunnel, seeing the orange glow of firelight flicker across the dirt floor, while a hammering sound echoed off the drop. And right where Edgar said he\u2019d be, my husband was fastening the last nail into a coffin\u2014the other prisoners nowhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I reached down and grabbed his arm. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat needs to be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I placed my hand over a soldier\u2019s as he and another lifted the coffin. \u201cI made a ruling. I sentenced these men to twenty years in The First Order\u2019s cells, away from their homes, friends, everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake him away.\u201d David waved a hand, standing up, and the soldiers shrugged me off, hooking chains under the casket.</p><p>\u201cHow could you go against me like this?\u201d I stood back.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David drew a long breath, pinching his brow. \u201cThis is my ruling, and when you sit in that Court, day after day, and see no more cases like this, you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d</p><p>The men hitched the chained coffin to the hook hanging over the depths of the sixty-foot hole it was destined for. I watched on, holding my breath, until David walked toward the crank that lowers the chain. \u201cDavid, stop.\u201d</p><p>He paused, his shoulders high and stiff. \u201cAra, please don\u2019t make this any harder than it has to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard? Hard for who?\u201d I cried, listening to the man inside the box banging the lid, screaming for all the mercy of the gods. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t do this. You talk about showing ourselves to be strong, a force to be reckoned with, yet you go against your own queen. How can my people respect me, if even you don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t need to respect the queen, Ara,\u201d he said, then nodded to a soldier near the door. \u201cThey need to love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I struggled against the man as he pulled me away from David. \u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the heart of this nation, Ara.\u201d David placed both hands on my arms. \u201cI am the fear. They will not cross me again, nor will any other vampire, for that matter. And in my doing this, you\u2019ve not had to sentence men to tortures you\u2019ll lose sleep over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll lose sleep anyway, David,\u201d I cried. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He wandered over and wound the crank, sending the last man slowly to the burrows of Hell.</p><p>\u201cDavid, this is madness. Please stop, I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is how things have always been done, Ara.\u201d He turned to face me. \u201cThey tested our resolve, and this is their reward.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s screams hollowed out, his scratching and clawing becoming an echo as the box hit the earth and the darkness of the past\u2014the darkness David had become accustomed to, grown up in, desensitised to\u2014rounded out around me, drawing me into both his world and his past. And I didn\u2019t want to be a part of that.</p><p>I watched him shovel a heap of dirt and toss it ceremoniously into the hole, and I loved him and respected him as much as I hated him right then. I knew he was right. I knew if those men were allowed to escape with easy punishment, they\u2019d be back here in thirty years having done the same thing, as would many more over that time. David was the rightful king, the man who had the heart to get things done, even if those same things would break mine. But he wasn\u2019t my David, right now. He wasn't the boy I fell in love with. This David was something else entirely.</p><p>I dropped to my knees as the last heap of dirt covered the vampire\u2019s cries, and David came to squat before me. \u201cMy love?\u201d</p><p>Tear streamed past my lips, making my nose run. I wiped them away with my sleeve, refusing to look at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d He stood up. \u201cI hope one day you\u2019ll come to understand why I had to do this.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, pushing up off the ground to stand. \u201cI understand. I really do.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my cheek once. \u201cBut I\u2019ve hurt you.\u201d</p><p>My tears salted the air on my lips. I looked up into his loving eyes, and the hatred I had for him a moment ago trickled away, taking the anger with it. \u201cLike I said, I understand why you did.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my brow and stepped past me, nodding at the guard before leaving the crypt, his shadow flickering on the walls under firelight until it disappeared.</p><p>\u201cBlade?\u201d I met him on the stairwell toward the eastern quadrant.</p><p>\u201cMy Queen. How are you?\u201d He touched his chest, bowing. \u201cI heard what happened.\u201d</p><p>I stopped on the stair below him, hearing the screams of that man echo throughout my soul. My tears had dried, but I knew my face was still red. \u201cLook, I know we shouldn\u2019t be talking alone, given the curse of Lilith and all, so I\u2019ll get straight to the point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOf course, My Queen. How can I help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I can trust with this, Blade. You\u2019ve always been on my side, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ara?\u201d He stepped down so he stood beside me. \u201cYou can ask anything of me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with the law, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, it has come to my attention that I am of little value in this system\u2014that David and Walter and everyone else are calling the shots, while I'm left to wander around thinking I'm making a difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ara, it\u2019s not like that. You\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s true. They\u2019re so used to me being this inept little human, they haven\u2019t seen me become the vampire\u2014the Lilithian.\u201d I stood taller, rolling my shoulders back. \u201cI want you to tutor me. I want you teach me the laws, the ways, the things I'm missing so that I can finally step up and play the role I was born to play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought Morgaine was teaching you.\u201d</p><p>I paused for a second, thinking about her lessons. \u201cI get the feeling sometimes that she\u2019s teaching me only what she wants me to know.\u201d</p><p>His brows moved slowly to pinch over the bridge of his nose. \u201cSerious?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated only for a second. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you. . .\u201d He leaned closer, his hot breath brushing my hair with the scent of mint. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust her?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, half checking over my shoulder.</p> <p>He nodded, his lips thin. \u201cNeither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My eyes flicked onto his.</p><p>He started walking, motioning for me to follow. \u201cI\u2019ve had my suspicions from the beginning about her. I\u2019m not sure what the deal is, but I . . . I dunno. Something tells me not to trust her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. . .\u201d I walked quickly, trying to keep up with him, feeling a little uncomfortable in this quadrant of the manor. \u201cYou\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this\u2014stepping up, I mean? It won\u2019t be easy.\u201d</p><p>I thrust my shoulders back. \u201cIf I wanted life to be easy, Blade, I would have left Drake on the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d He pumped his fist then held his hand in the air. \u201cHigh five, girl.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his palm. \u201cSo, does that mean you\u2019ll help me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen do we start?\u201d he asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cTonight. After lights-out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um, meet me in the library at twelve,\u201d I said, turning to walk away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Even though the table was only meters long, the separation between David I felt like miles. He sipped his wine, eyeing me the whole time, probably trying to get a grasp on my thoughts. But I had a mind blanket the size of Manhattan quilting them. He wasn\u2019t getting in, no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>Jason looked across at me, his shoulders sinking, and offered a sympathetic smile. And I looked away. With the mood David was in right now, last thing I needed was him making an \u2018example\u2019 out of Jason too.</p><p>\u201cI have to say, I agree with Walt,\u201d David said, and I looked up. \u201cIf his contact says Drake hasn\u2019t returned to Elysium, then I\u2019m happy to go ahead with our plans this weekend.\u201d</p><p>Walt nodded. \u201cI believe it\u2019s best, Your Highness, to get these prisoners sorted quickly. There are more important matters at hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike our missing venom stores,\u201d Margret added.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking into that,\u201d David said. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t got anything to go on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could just call Drake and ask him if he took them?\u201d Morgaine said, her tone light, joking. \u201cI mean, I still have his number in my contacts.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table laughed.</p><p>\u201cActually, I\u2019ve sanctioned the help of our white canine friend,\u201d David said, sipping his wine after. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sniff out the trail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSniff it out, Majesty?\u201d Walt raised a brow.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d David held back a grin, knowing how ridiculous it sounded. But it was actually a good plan.</p><p>\u201cWell, perhaps I may be of service then,\u201d Walt added. \u201cI could follow the dog, take a team with me, and hopefully recover our losses.\u201d</p><p>David nodded. \u201cThank you, Walt. Although, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll find anything more than the route they took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch can be learned simply by knowing their method of entry,\u201d Walt added.</p><p>My eyes narrowed involuntarily, and I sent a little thought to David: So we\u2019re trusting Walt now, even though he\u2019s only pretending to be Blood Bound to this Throne?</p><p>He looked up, answering Arthur then Margret, and thought, I\u2019ll talk to you about that later, for me.</p><p>I shook the irritation from my head, biting my teeth together. One minute, Walt was the traitor that infiltrated our Council, the next minute he\u2019s in charge of a very important operation, and David says he\u2019ll talk about it later. How was it that I got left out of this loop along the way? If things had changed regarding Walt, I should have been the first to know. And this just cemented even deeper the notion that, as a wife, I could trust David with my heart but, as his queen, I couldn\u2019t trust a goddamn thing he said.</p><p>I sat back in my chair and aimed my gaze at Blade, hoping he\u2019d catch it, but his eyes were small and smiling, lost on Emily\u2019s face as she talked with him across the table. Even Morg was watching them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d I leaned closer to Morgaine.</p><p>She sat up, looking away from them. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on, Morg. You know what I mean.\u201d I presented Em and Blade.</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She smiled in their direction. \u201cEmily just told a funny joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I sat lower in my chair. \u201cGuess I missed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you weren't paying attention,\u201d she said casually, scooping some food onto her fork. \u201cNothing new there.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and slumped lazily on the arm of the chair.</p><p>A fire burned bright between the windows, making the brown spines of old books glow orange. The tables were all bare again, the librarian having finished her cataloguing, and the room once again looked like a place of sanctuary. Even Arthur had taken up a seat by the long table facing the flames, instead of reading in his room like he had done lately.</p><p>I wandered across and peered over his shoulder. \u201cWhat you readin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He looked up quickly, flipping the book closed. \u201cMy Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuman anatomy?\u201d I frowned, plonking my butt on the chair beside him.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He spun in his seat to face me, resting his jaw on his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to study human medicine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re a society made up greatly of both vampires and Lilithians,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd with Lilithian bodies retaining much of their human makeup, I figured a doctor who is versed in both vampire and human biology might be of some use.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cSo, you planning to deliver a baby sometime soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw that,\u201d he stated to himself, nodding.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Why are you reading up on reproductive systems?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just comparing the differences in knowledge from the days when I was the most educated man in medicine to what they know now.\u201d He laughed, making a pile of his books as he stood. \u201cQuite a few advances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, just a few.\u201d I stood too. \u201cWhy\u2019s the fire burning? It\u2019s only just September.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes me feel more...human to sit here and read with the glow of firelight.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the chair by the fire, the pipe on the arm, and the copy The Hunchback of Notre Dame on the footstool. \u201cYou used to sit here with Arietta.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at the scene. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. I wish I could bring her back to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he said, picking up his reading material. \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on making sure I never have to say those words to you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as Arthur walked away. \u201cNight, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, my dear,\u201d he said, then tipped his head at the dark-haired knight who entered as he exited. \u201cBlade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur,\u201d Blade said casually, turning once to watch him leave. \u201cI think we scared him off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably for the best anyway.\u201d I leaned on the tabletop. \u201cNot sure I want everyone knowing what we\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you trusted Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m starting to see why people around here place more distance on friends than they do enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d He leaned on the table beside me, crossing his ankles. \u201cAnd why is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause friends betray you in your best interests, Blade. And there is nothing more dangerous than a person who is trying to protect you from the truth for your own good.\u201d</p><p>The corners of his lips turned down with thought, his head bowing once in a nod of approval. \u201cYou sure you need me to teach you anything?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou sure you need to ask that question?\u201d</p><p>He stood from his lean and wandered over to the whiteboard\u2014stuffed neatly into a crevice behind a desk\u2014and lifted it onto its stand. \u201cRight, before we learn anything about the law or the ins and outs of queenly duties, let\u2019s start with where you\u2019re going wrong and why you may have the respect of your people but not of your peers.\u201d</p><p>I looked into my lap for a second, digesting that. \u201cStraight to the nitty-gritty, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see no need to waste time on small talk, My Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s get started then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He pointed to the chair.</p><p>I sat down.</p><p>\u201cNow, first of all\u2014\u201d He paced the floor, his hands closed around a whiteboard marker behind his back, that English accent of his more prominent in Teacher Mode, \u201c\u2014most unlikeable thing you do: tantrums.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTantrums?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He grinned, making an overly dramatic point of stomping his foot.</p><p>\u201cOh. That.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that. A queen does not need to stomp her foot to get her own way. You\u2019re on the right track, Ara\u2014\u201d He stuffed the marker in his back pocket, \u201c\u2014standing up for what you believe, making decisions and seeing that people follow them. It\u2019s what you need to do. But you don\u2019t need to stomp your foot to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never even realised I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He squatted in front of me and delicately took my hand until I looked at him. \u201cAnd, this isn\u2019t a pick-on-Ara session, either. I just want to point out a few things that need to change if you\u2019re to earn the respect you actually deserve.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I drew my hand back. \u201cSo, no foot-stomping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And every time I see you do it, I\u2019m going to throw something at you, or maybe pinch you,\u201d he said, probably imagining it.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I give you official permission to pinch me if I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcellent. Now\u2014\u201d He joined his hands and stood up again. \u201cOne of the other annoying things you do\u2014\u201d</p><p>I sat forward, listening eagerly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve watched you with Arthur, with Mike, even with David, and one thing I can say that\u2019s consistent about you, girl, is you tend to believe whatever whoever you\u2019re talking to at the time says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mystery and history surrounding our past and possibly shaping our future as a nation, and you seem to believe too easily what you\u2019re told you need to do\u2014or even to believe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake this prophecy for example. What do you actually believe about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I considered all Arthur\u2019s points, the things Jason taught me in the library the day he translated the scrolls, and all the things Morgaine had told me in the beginning\u2014things I took as fact, that now turned out to be so far from the truth they weren\u2019t even worth remembering. \u201cI\u2019m leaning more toward it being a contract, not a prophecy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about the power of your foretold child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power to free the Damned?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I think I can free them.\u201d I waved my fingertips in the air.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Drake coming for your child. What do you believe about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe there\u2019s a reason he wants her dead. Maybe she turns out to be the devil. I don\u2019t know, but we can\u2019t just rule him as the bad guy because he seeks to kill her. I think we should have a heavily guarded sit-down meet, and talk about it all.\u201d</p><p>Blade smiled. \u201cAnd why hasn\u2019t this been done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause no one else agrees with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . who has all the power in this monarchy?\u201d</p><p>I sat straighter. \u201cThe queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. So, I reiterate\u2014\u201d He knelt before me, his elbow on his knee. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t it been done?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I stood up, forcing him to shift backward quickly. \u201cI need a plan. I need to think about what to ask Drake, and I need to organise to meet with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your people,\u201d he gasped dramatically, like a shocked old woman, rising to his feet, \u201cthey won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s my decision. I may be young, but I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they\u2019ll fight you on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll damn well overrule them,\u201d I said, stomping my foot. \u201cOuch!\u201d I swiped Blade's hand off my arm, cupping my sore skin. \u201cYou pinched me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stomped your foot. Try again.\u201d</p><p>I walked cautiously away from him and stood across the room, looking out the window. \u201cA meeting with Drake, in person, to talk\u2014sift through the lies and webs in this whole prophecy\u2014is what\u2019s best for my people. War leads to death. And secrecy\u2014\u201d I turned around to look at Blade. \u201cIt begets secrecy. I need to flush this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. So, now you believe that for yourself, what will you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them that\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people, my council, my House. And they will go along with it, because anyone who opposes will be asked to step down.\u201d</p><p>Blade appeared beside me, the dark shadows shaping his smile. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. And when they oppose you\u2014which they will\u2014what will be your immediate reaction?\u201d</p><p>I pictured myself in front of the House, standing at the head of the boardroom table, calm, taking slow breaths, staying silent until they all finished arguing around me. \u201cI\u2019ll whisper,\u201d I said, \u201cto get their attention. I\u2019ll tell them this is the plan. Tell them, including David, that I overrule them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell them?\u201d he prompted. \u201cNo yelling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think quiet repetition should suffice.\u201d The corners of my lips pulled outward, making me smile.</p><p>\u201cAnd...how do you know this is the right course of action? How do you know I\u2019m not leading you into some trap, bending you to my will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou trust Arthur. You trust Morgaine. You trust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken. But...\u201d I exhaled softly, touching my chest. \u201cBlade, I\u2019m following my own heart. Often, when people tell me something or ask me to do something, I do it because I\u2019m trying to be the queen I\u2019m supposed to be, even if it feels wrong. But I don\u2019t care about that anymore. I care about doing what\u2019s best for everyone\u2014for my people and my family, myself last. What they think of me doesn\u2019t really matter anymore. So, if I do what I always think is right, then I\u2019m choosing who to trust, not just walking blindly, guided by every voice of reason I hear.\u201d</p><p>He clapped his hands once, then again, and again, getting faster and faster until it was a full-blown applause. I took a soft bow.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t really need to teach you anything about being queen, Ara. I just need to shine some light on what you already know.\u201d He touched my shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re a good person. You may take longer than everyone else to figure out how to rule your own roost, but I\u2019d take a good soul as queen any day over a judicial prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Blade.\u201d I hugged him, wondering if that comment was a stab at David. \u201cI think I just...it helps having someone believe in me, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all want to believe in you, Ara. Some of us are just afraid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I sat down on the chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like falling in love.\u201d He leaned his butt on the table beside me again, taking the marker out of his back pocket. \u201cWe need this\u2014this queen, the safety, the protection, so bad that we\u2019re scared, if we hope, it\u2019ll all fall apart.\u201d</p><p>Those words rung true deep within me. \u201cI know how that feels almost better than anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And that\u2019s why I know that, even if this not-yet-conceived child does turn out to be the devil, and that\u2019s why Drake wants her dead, you\u2019d kill her in a heartbeat\u2014\u201d He held up a finger. \u201cAfter checking your facts, first.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling. \u201cYes. Fact checking. My new instant reaction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And calm breath, too. When you\u2019re about to stomp your foot, just remember, you don\u2019t have to. Being queen means you are one big foot-stomp. What you say goes, pretty little thing, so don\u2019t feel as if you have to yell and scream about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I grinned. \u201cWell, on the bright side, I guess this prepares me for parenting, too. Can\u2019t have two foot-stomping teenagers under one roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cWe certainly can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Almost as if my stomach despised this as much as me, it groaned when I reached the field bordering the training hall. This week went by so fast, with so many things to take care of and so many discussions at dinner, I wasn't really sure I\u2019d eaten anything human.</p><p>I touched the back of my wrist, running a finger over the raised vein there, thinking about Eric, wondering where he was, what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cHey, gorgeous. What you doin\u2019?\u201d Mike said, catching up to me at a slight run.</p><p>\u201cStudying my veins.\u201d I showed him my wrist. \u201cEric told me that when they look like this, I'm blood hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was the last time you had blood?\u201d He took my hand in his, flipping it over to look at my skin carefully.</p><p>\u201cThis morning.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and poked me in the ribs. \u201cI'm gonna call you Miss Piggy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up.\u201d I backhanded him. \u201cWhere\u2019s David? I\u2019ll eat from him before we start training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Cool.\u201d</p><p>We both took a step forward, but though Mike moved, I stayed stuck on the spot, caught by my lace under the sole of my shoe.</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you to tie that up?\u201d Mike groaned, glancing back.</p><p>\u201cCrud.\u201d I lifted my foot and released the lace, ergo freeing my halted steps. \u201cYou go ahead. I\u2019ll meet you in there,\u201d I said. \u201cFrom the sounds of that fight, I think David's opponent needs some medical attention.\u201d</p><p>Mike grinned, listening. \u201cHe\u2019s up against Falcon. This should be good.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as he bounded away like a little boy heading to a mud puddle.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that,\u201d Jason said, springing up out of nowhere.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour shoelace.\u201d He pointed down; it was already done back up.</p><p>\u201cYou did that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI needed you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won't let me train with you.\u201d He jerked his thumb to the training hall. \u201cOr even watch, because I'm not a Council or Core member. But I need to be close when you shoot that energy of yours. I want to get a reading\u2014see what it\u2019s made up of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, can't you tell David it\u2019s for research purposes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. He told me I wasn't to conduct any tests on you until the House had time to go over my proposal for the lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I frowned. \u201cSo, do you want me to shoot a bolt out the door for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you could.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI've got my equipment set up in the bushes just across from the doors. I just need about three seconds of that light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d He looked at my face, right above my eye, and ran his thumb along my brow. \u201cDon't worry about the pain, Ara. I\u2019ll figure this out, okay. I\u2019ll find a way to stop the headaches.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, closing my eyes. \u201cThanks, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lost, Queeny?\u201d Quaid called out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I was just talking to\u2014\u201d I started, but he was gone when I opened my eyes, \u201c\u2014myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing new there,\u201d Quaid said with a laugh. \u201cSo, who you shooting today?\u201d</p><p>I wriggled my fingers in the air. \u201cYou wanna be my victim?\u201d</p><p>He stepped back, palms raised. \u201cIt took me a week to get over the last shot. Use Falcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan't. He\u2019s fighting David right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh.\u201d Quaid looked at the training hall. \u201cCome on then. We better get in there and help him.\u201d</p><p>As we reached the entrance, though, Mike and Blade walked past with an unconscious Falcon between them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s fine.\u201d Blade winked at me. \u201cKing David snapped his neck as he went down.\u201d</p><p>My eyes expanded to take in the horror of Falcon\u2019s lopsided head for a second, drifting slowly onto David after. He stood proudly in the mirrored sparring section, flexing his fists, looking kind of evil and very satisfied with himself.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d I stormed over and stood right in front of him, nearly slipping in the blood.</p><p>He caught me by the arm and steadied me. \u201cWhat\u2019s what deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you snap his neck? We don't spar like that here, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He turned away and grabbed a towel off the bench to wipe his hands. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s gonna have a hell of a sore neck for the next few days. What\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p> <p>He sat down, breathing out through his nose. \u201cI didn't mean to snap his neck. I just...got a little carried away.\u201d</p><p>I looked out the window as Mike and Blade passed. \u201cLooks like a bad case of venting on the innocent.\u201d</p><p>He half smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d I sat down beside him. \u201cWhat are you venting? What's bothering you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later. For now\u2014\u201d He stood up and aimed his voice around the room. \u201cLet\u2019s have a volunteer for Ara\u2019s target practice.\u201d</p><p>While the knights murmured amongst themselves, probably drawing straws, I looked to the bushes outside the door, knowing Jase was in there, watching. It made me feel better in some ways.</p> <p>David delivered my target to the centre of the room, and the rest of the knights took a giant step backward, blocking the clearing from me to the door\u2014to Jason.</p><p>\u201cYou guys might want to move,\u201d I said, parting the air. \u201cIf I need to throw up after this, I\u2019ll have to run outside.\u201d</p><p>They parted quickly, and I caught the soft scent of Jase\u2019s breath from the small laugh I heard. I smiled.</p><p>Mike wandered back in and took his place beside David. \u201cOkay, Ara. Today I want you to shoot him back to the wall, and when he\u2019s down, I\u2019ll be sending in a few more. And they will hurt you if you don't strike them down.\u201d</p><p>I looked at David, who eyed Mike, disapproval trickling over his shoulders like rain.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d Mike said to David, without even looking his way. \u201cShe can handle it.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head and sat down on the bench. \u201cMake it count, Ara. I really don't want sit here and watch other men beat you. And I make no guarantees that I won\u2019t step in again.\u201d</p><p>I grinned at him. \u201cMike will kick you out of training if you do what you did last time.\u201d</p> <p>He sat taller, his concern slipping with a returning grin. \u201cThen make sure you flatten them, my love, or I will make sure no one ever wants to spar with you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, shut up and let the girl spar,\u201d Mike said.</p><p>David laughed and issued a hand in offering of the floor. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>The knight across from me looked nervous. He not only had to attack the queen in presence of the king but, if he didn\u2019t, he\u2019d be jolted with a bolt of really hot, electrifying energy that would most likely put him in a coma for a few days or, best case scenario, he pins me down, renders me unconscious and avoids my blast, then ends up with the king snapping his neck like exhibit A: Falcon.</p><p>\u201cShoot, Ara,\u201d Mike said, folding his arms.</p><p>I looked at my hands and took a deep breath, feeling the charge rise in them, moving up my arms and joining at the centre of my chest. It vibrated, building there until, like water rising in a tub, gradually moved up my neck and into my head, bringing the tight sensation with it. I felt a bit like a pirate, with my right eye all screwed up from the pain.</p><p>The knight parted his feet, scooping low to lunge toward me, and time slowed down.</p><p>I held my breath and forced the heat from my palms, imagining it going into the knight\u2019s chest. And as usual, it did. I never felt as if I had any control over it. I felt it leave my body, felt it hit him and ignite his shirt, felt the heat, felt his pain, heard his scream, but didn't feel as though I did it. It was more like watching it on a screen in front of me.</p><p>Then, the pain set in.</p><p>I dropped my hands, the static ceasing, and grabbed my temples.</p><p>\u201cKeep going, Ara,\u201d Mike ordered. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even two seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d I bit my teeth together, vaguely noticing a knight come at me from the side; my eyes darted to David, who stood, then back to the knight. If I didn't shoot this guy, David would do much worse.</p><p>I sent a bolt in his direction. It was small and did nothing but make him shake. He dusted his chest off and came at me again.</p><p>\u201cTwo more men,\u201d Mike called, and the fight was over. I was surrounded.</p><p>My heels slipped in Falcon\u2019s blood as I turned to run, sending me in a sideways skid until I landed against the mirror beside me, and all the pain in my head shifted suddenly to the right, making my jaw fall open.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David walked closer, his hand out. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>As I looked up to answer, three men shoved past him, diving in my direction. I shut my eyes tight and aimed again, focusing, trying harder to make this one count, and as I felt the light go through a chest, I flicked my hand outward, pushing it in Jason\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit!\u201d Mike said, and a whole room full of amalgamated gasps followed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My eyes flung open, but instead of sixty faces staring at me, they were all staring at the bushes outside\u2014the knight lying in a tangled heap among them.</p><p>\u201cDid I do that?\u201d I rolled up to stand, searching for Jason.</p><p>Mike and several others ran over to the frying knight, and David\u2019s hand came down on my arm. \u201cMy love, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, but I wasn\u2019t okay.</p><p>\u201cStand straight,\u201d he said, trying to help me.</p><p>\u201cI can't.\u201d My knees wobbled. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad. What happened out there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threw him. You picked him up about three feet off the ground and ditched him outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d I looked on as they rescued the man and helped him to his feet. \u201cIt\u2019s static electricity, isn't it? How can I possibly move things with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d He hugged me close to his bare chest; it was the first time I\u2019d felt his skin against my cheek in a few days, and it made me take a quick breath. \u201cYou okay, my love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I just forgot how nice our skin felt together.\u201d</p><p>He looked down lovingly, but his hand came up quick, gently wiping under my nose as the salty taste of my own blood fell onto my lip. \u201cI think we might've pushed you too hard.\u201d</p><p>I touched the blood. \u201cMy head feels cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Mike said, clapping his hands once. \u201cOne more round and we\u2019ll call it quits for the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s bleeding, Mike.\u201d David turned me around.</p><p>Mike stopped in his tracks. \u201cAra, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid punched me,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He licked his thumb and wiped it across my lip. \u201cDo you want to lie down for a minute?\u201d</p><p>I did want to, but I wanted to get this training session over with more. \u201cNo. I'm okay. I'm getting stronger, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Mike laughed. \u201cQuite a bit stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d I stepped away from David's arms; the pain had moved to the base of my skull now, slowly retreating down my spine. \u201cWho\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Mike, David said in his thoughts, his tone coming through with that cheeky smile I just knew he was wearing.</p><p>I grinned, rubbed my hands together, and as I wiped them away, flung a bolt at Mike. He cried out as he went down, clutching his arm.</p><p>David laughed loudly, slapping his knee, paralysed by hilarity. So I sent one at him, but he ducked, sweeping forward in a quick move, grabbing me at the waist and flipping me up into his arms like a damsel in distress. \u201cNice try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was gonna do that?\u201d I asked, ignoring the searing in my brain.</p><p>\u201cI can read your mind, pretty girl. Even if I can't actually read it right now.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but as the jiggle from my stomach moved up to my chest, the pain shifted again, pushing out on both sides of my head in a pressure-building explosion, just waiting to erupt. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He laid me on the ground; Mike stumbled to his feet, muttering something about revenge, and came to kneel beside me.</p><p>\u201cLay her on her side.\u201d His big hands cupped my ribs and he flipped me over, placing a shirt under my head. \u201cTrent, get that stuff Arthur gave us.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t open my eyes, but I felt David there beside me, felt his hand on my brow, heard his words in my ear while he soothingly rubbed my body and stroked my hair.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes, my love...my love...love...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stay. Don't go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not going anywhere...where...where...\u201d</p><p>The dry scent of cinnamon and coriander and number of other herbs filled my head, taking out all the volume and the ringing in my ears. I knew what was next. I held my breath, waiting for it to travel into my lungs and spin my world around, taking me down to the darkness for the next eight hours.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d I whispered with the breath I\u2019d held.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>I ran down the stairs, catching Jason\u2019s sleeve as he reached for the front door. \u201cHey, did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the labs?\u201d he said solemnly.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I stepped back a little. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be a bit happier.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, making his eyes smaller. \u201cHe didn't tell you, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn't tell me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king approved a lab and greenhouse on the rooftop for Arthur,\u201d he said spitefully. \u201cBut declined my proposal.\u201d</p><p>I sunk back on my heels. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He smirked. \u201cA scientific study into the possibility of you being the power to free the Damned would involve long hours of time spent in each other\u2019s company.\u201d He started walking away. \u201cWhy do you think he disapproved it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry, Jase,\u201d I called. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>He turned back as he reached the door. \u201cI\u2019ve known him for over a hundred years, Ara. If even the prospect of freeing the Damned couldn't change his mind, you won't have a hope in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d</p><p>He spun around, placing his book down on the dresser as his smile dropped. \u201cMy love, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are what\u2019s wrong.\u201d I poked his chest, coming to stop beside him as the bedroom door slammed shut. \u201cWhy did you deny Jason\u2019s proposal for a lab?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned away, groaning. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary? Not necessary.\u201d I grabbed his arm and made him turn back to me. \u201cDavid, we need to study my powers. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike is doing fine with what he\u2019s got going on in the training hall. I\u2019ve seen his notes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHis notes! So you've seen how every time he put me in that cage, every time he makes me shoot things, I practically go into a coma for the next eight hours in excruciating pain! And you think this is okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike he says, you just need to exercise it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me? David.\u201d I stopped, taking a few deep breaths. \u201cIt starts hearts.\u201d I held up my hand. \u201cWhat if it can turn a vampire back to a human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I believe in that anymore, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My eyes welled with hot tears. \u201cBut what if I do?\u201d</p> <p>He sighed, taking both my arms. \u201cMy love, there are more important things to worry about now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't want to hear any more. Look\u2014\u201d He kissed my forehead, swiping a cold tear from my cheek. \u201cMaybe once this business with Drake is put to rest, I\u2019ll approve a research division. Okay? But not now. Not while we have so many other things to focus on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for you. This is on Jason\u2014it\u2019s his project. He won't get in your way,\u201d I said, hopeful.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not open for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d I followed him across the room. \u201cIf you're worried about he and I being alone, you can put a guard on me. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra, please. I'm trying to pack. Can you...\u201d He pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this when I return from Elysium on Monday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we won't.\u201d I spun away. \u201cYou\u2019re just brushing it off, like you always do.\u201d</p><p>He appeared behind me, his fingers grasping my arm. \u201cLet\u2019s get something monumentally clear here, my dear, sweet girl. I brush nothing off. And, yeah, maybe I'm hesitant to discuss this with you, because there's nothing to discuss. I won't approve a lab for Jason as a guise for him to spend time alone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's not what it is. Do you have no faith in him at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you trust Arthur,\u201d I said spitefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to say that if he was worried about anyone trying to have sex with me, it should be his uncle, not Jason, but I was pretty sure that would result in Arthur\u2019s death. And as I looked up into his troubled eyes, the exhaustion of everything came down on top of me. My lip quivered. \u201cI can't do this anymore, David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat, my love?\u201d He pulled me close, my nice, loving David returning.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry. I know you don't want Jason and I to hang out, but he's trying to find a way to make my pain stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to stop, Ara. He\u2019s putting ideas into your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? Or is it that you don\u2019t want me to have any friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say something like that?\u201d He pulled away. \u201cI\u2019m not that sort of man, Ara, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d His tone broke at the same time as his heart.</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I said, exhaling. \u201cJason is my only real friend. He's the only one in this whole place who has my back, no matter what I do wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You're lying to me all the time. I can't trust anything you say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying?\u201d The skin on his forehead moved downward, bunching into a frown. \u201cAra, what makes you think I'm lying to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo many things.\u201d I shook my head, laughing to myself.</p><p>\u201cMy love, please. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, you told me I descended from Evangeline's bloodline, and now you tell me she died as a child, and you told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d He put a finger up. \u201cWhen I told you that story, I believed it to be correct. All I had learned came from Lilithian History books in our library. I told you what I knew to be the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He brushed my hair off my face. \u201cAnd these aren\u2019t the only half-truths we\u2019ve all been told. You have to trust me, Ara. I did not tell you those stories to steer you in the wrong direction. If anything, ask Arthur why he never told you the truth. Ask him, or any other High Vampire Councillor, why they never corrected myself or any other vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, you see? That\u2019s just it. Everyone keeps the truth so buried no one even knows what's true anymore. I mean, I came here believing Drake took revenge on all Lilithians because Lilith wanted to kill him, and now I'm told it\u2019s because Lilith killed Anandene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Anandene left Drake\u2014betrayed him. She ran off with one of the council leaders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's not what Arthur told me.\u201d</p><p>David looked down at his clasped hands, frowning. \u201cWhat else did he tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me not to discuss this with anyone.\u201d</p><p>His lip tugged on one side, making his whole face softer with that smile. \u201cYou can tell me. I'm your husband.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI know. That\u2019s kind of why I'm telling you. I just...\u201d I wandered over and sat on the box at the end of our bed. \u201cI'm getting lost in this web of lies, David, and I don't really know who to trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me.\u201d He offered his hand. I took it.</p><p>\u201cI'm trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, trying isn\u2019t good enough. What reason on God\u2019s good earth would you have not to trust the one person in the world who always has your best interests at heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause that one person is also willing to do things I don\u2019t necessarily agree with in order to protect me.\u201d</p><p>He placed his other hand over mine. \u201cAnd I will do that whether you trust me with your truths or not. Nothing will change that.\u201d</p><p>I allowed a small smile.</p><p>\u201cNow, tell me what you know about Anandene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur told me that she cast a spell using the Stone of Truth, and it brought a curse on the lands\u2014many people died. Lilith had to slay Anandene on the Stone to end the curse. Drake offered his life up, but Lilith tricked him, captured him and imprisoned him until Anandene was dead. There was nothing he could do to save her.\u201d</p><p>David swallowed, lowering his hands to his knees as he walked backward and sat on the box. \u201cHe never told me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you things?\u201d</p><p>He nodded, his thoughts lost in some other place. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . that\u2019s really awful.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYep. And, so, that\u2019s why he killed Lilith, not because he wanted the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes so much more sense.\u201d David nodded again. \u201cThere are so many lies layered over the top of lies. I can hardly see the truth under it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Arthur was lying about that story?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo. That\u2019s the first time I've heard anything of it, which means it\u2019s probably true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then, what do you think about Drake wanting our child dead?\u201d</p><p>He swiped a hand down his face, sighing, then slid his butt across the box and flopped back on the bed. \u201cI don't care about that part of the story, Ara. The fact is that he\u2019ll never even get half a chance to contemplate the idea of possibly making a plan to kill our child. I won't let that happen.\u201d</p><p>I moved over and sat right by his waist, running my finger along the belt-line of his jeans. \u201cAnd, what are you going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKill him with the Dagger of Yahanna?\u201d</p><p>He sat up on his elbow. \u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI'm not as dumb as I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur told you?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d he said to himself, flopping back on the bed again.</p><p>\u201cHe...\u201d I divided truths in my head and carefully chose which ones to share. \u201cHe wanted to prepare me for the fact that you were going to die.\u201d</p><p>His chest stopped lifting, his body becoming immensely still, only his throat moving as he obviously swallowed all the grief he was holding but would never share.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you tell me about the dagger?\u201d</p><p>He sighed and rolled up on his elbow, placing his hand firmly over mine. \u201cI didn't want to break your heart. We fought so hard to be together, and you\u2014\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cYou wanted to die after you were tortured. And that was only because you thought I was dead. So, what would happen to you if you had to be here, alone, ruling, doing things you didn't believe you were capable of, if you also had the burden of losing me?\u201d</p><p>My eyes watered.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry I didn't tell you, Ara. I am. I wanted to, and that\u2019s why I stayed away. In fact, I laid here\u2014\u201d He pointed to the pillows. \u201cI came to you one night, laid here for hours telling you everything, and in that one perfect moment, as I stroked your cheek, you smiled, and for the first time ever in my life, I felt like everything would be okay.\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand gently to his cheek. \u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He pulled away. \u201cIt won\u2019t. It can\u2019t be, and that single moment I let myself believe it would caused more pain than I ever knew existed, because I was forced to realise then that I\u2019d never feel like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn't have to be that way, David.\u201d I grabbed his hand and held it tight. \u201cYou don't have to kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. He will come for you, Ara. He will come for our baby one day, and I can't\u2014\u201d He shook his head, searching for words. \u201cI can't live with that fear. I need you safe. I need our people safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won't lose you,\u201d I said, and it was non-negotiable.</p><p>He looked at me, seeing my thoughts, seeing my strengths, but none of what I felt seemed to matter to him at all. \u201cYou will, Ara. There is no choice. It takes the hand of a king to use that dagger, and I am the only king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are hundreds of people who would take that role and kill Drake, David. It doesn't have to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the only rightful king,\u201d his voice grew louder.</p><p>\u201cThere are ways around it,\u201d I said sternly.</p><p>And his body shifted, his shoulders going back as he saw the words in my mind: king by right of heir. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I stood up as he appeared across the room by the fireplace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust...no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I would do anything to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s out of the question.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut it would save our forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It would destroy it, Ara!\u201d He spun around to look at me. \u201cDo you think I would ever be able to touch you again if you\u2019d been with another man?\u201d</p><p>I sunk back a bit. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to sleep with anyone to do it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me.</p><p>\u201cIVF, turkey baster...\u201d I suggested.</p> <p>He turned away. \u201cI couldn\u2019t live with myself if you had to go through that just to save me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019d be living. And I know, from experience, that you can get past just about anything that happens to you, David. You were burned on the fire\u2014you caught me with my legs around Mike. You can get past a damn turkey baster.\u201d</p><p>He went ultra still and ultra quiet for a second, then turned around again, his whole body shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d I asked, trying not to smile.</p><p>\u201cTurkey baster.\u201d</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t help it. I laughed too.</p> <p>He wandered over and placed a hand to the back of my neck, pulling me in for a kiss on the brow, my favourite kind of kiss. \u201cMy love, it\u2019s a good idea, but I'm the king. It\u2019s my job to die for our people\u2014for you. I swore that in my oath, and that is what I\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He smiled conceitedly. \u201cYou have no say. Arthur gave me the dagger, Ara. I'm leaving for Paris in a month to kill Drake, and you can either enjoy this time with me, or you can waste it being mad.\u201d</p><p>Paris? Which meant Arthur hadn't given him the real dagger, because I knew, and Arthur knew, that Drake was in Romania. I propped my hands on my hips, a challenging grin marking my lips. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll take door number two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, be reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Me be reasonable? You\u2019re talking about going to your death, taking our forever and throwing it away, and I don't get any say!\u201d I leaned forward on each word. \u201cAnd you just think I should sit back and take it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I stomped my foot. \u201cI won't, David. If you go . . . if you go to kill him, I . . . I\u2019ll do something stupid while you're gone.\u201d</p> <p>He stepped into me. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged out of his grip. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep with Arthur and make him king.\u201d</p><p>His jaw dropped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>I held strong; my shoulders straight, head high.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He grabbed my arm firmly. \u201cIf you touch him\u2014\u201d He shook his head, his teeth like a cage behind his lips. \u201cIf you . . . I\u2019ll kill him. And God help me, Ara, I wouldn't be able to stop myself.\u201d He dropped my arm and turned away. \u201cSo, if you think for one second that having a child with him will save our forever, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I'm not, because it\u2019d mean you\u2019d be alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I will hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can live with that better than your death.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, the stern, scary David resting just behind that green gaze. \u201cI am going to tell you something, young lady, and you are going to listen.\u201d He grabbed both my arms and moved me to sit on the chair.</p><p>I plonked down clumsily, keeping my eyes on David's as he squatted in front of me, composing himself.</p><p>\u201cYou will do as you are told. I am king, and I will kill Drake. I will not have you touching or carrying the child of another man.\u201d His voice shook with anger. \u201cThis will not be negotiated, and if you even think about going against me, I will have you locked in a cell until word of Drake's death has been received. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>The little girl inside me shook, nodding her head, but the woman I felt growing deep in my soul every day stood taller, readying her sword. \u201cYou can't ask me to accept your death, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not.\u201d He stood up. \u201cI'm telling you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod!\u201d I stood up too, and stomped my foot again. \u201cWhy do you have to be like this? I'm not one of your minions. I'm not someone you can boss around. I am the goddamn queen, and I! Have power! Over you! Maybe I\u2019ll lock you in a cell, and not let you out until I kill Drake.\u201d</p><p>He rushed up beside me and grabbed my arm again. \u201cYou stubborn, spoiled little brat.\u201d</p><p>I tugged away. \u201cI\u2019d rather be a brat in a world where you're alive than an obedient wife in a world where you're dead.\u201d</p><p>He walked away and sat down on the coffee table in the sitting room, running both hands through his hair. \u201cI can't fight with you, my love. I can't. I won't. I have to kill Drake. I'm sorry. I know that means I'm giving up our forever, but I had hoped to at least leave you with a child before I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could be a single, teenage mom!\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cYou always wanted a family, Ara. A little Harry, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won't be a little Harry, David. I can't even fall pregnant.\u201d My voice broke. \u201cAnd Lilithians don't have boys. We have girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don't want a child because you don't want a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that!\u201d I screamed. \u201cI'm just saying...I don't want this. Any of this. I wanted a family: a mum and a dad and a baby. Not an eternity without you. You're all I have ever wanted to live for. If you take that way, then I have nothing left!\u201d</p><p>He softened a little. \u201cI know. Okay. I know. But you're strong\u2014stronger than any of us have ever given you credit for, and you will get through this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my lowered head. \u201cI won't.\u201d</p><p>He appeared a step away from me, testing the waters. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. And, if you\u2019re so hell-bent on dying for us, then\u2014\u201d I looked up at him, my jaw stiff, sight blinded by tears. \u201cI want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He closed the gap between us quickly, his green eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d I shuffled my feet, standing a little taller in the domination of his height. \u201cI love you, David, enough that I am willing to do anything to keep you alive, even if that means I can't be with you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what then? You\u2019re just gonna go out and fuck some random stranger!\u201d He sunk back on his heels, dropping his arm to his side as a flash image of Jason came to the front of his thoughts. \u201cOr maybe not a stranger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't go there, David. I didn't have anyone in mind. I'm just trying to wake you up and make you see that you can't make decisions like this without me. I have a say.\u201d I pointed to my chest. \u201cYou're my husband and I don't want you to be dead for forever. Don't you remember? Have you forgotten what you told me about how vampires love eternally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, looking down.</p><p>\u201cThen what makes you think it\u2019s okay to leave me, to just die and not care how it makes me feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don't care?\u201d he yelled. \u201cAra, I am the only one who actually does care how you feel. I am the one who came after you when my brother was torturing you. I'm the one who laid burning in a fire, alive, to save our forever, and it was all for nothing, because as soon as those scars healed, my heart was torn open again by this\u2014\u201d he presented the air, as if everything we were discussing was laying out in front of us, \u201c\u2014by this truth that I battled with long before you ever even noticed I was struggling with something. I've had to deal with this. I've had to think long and hard about letting Drake live, running for the rest of our lives, or killing him and leaving the one girl I never wanted to hurt alone, forever, to fall into who-knows-whose arms.\u201d He stepped back, rubbing his hairline, his voice shaking on the brink of tears. \u201cSo don't tell me I don't care how you feel, Ara, because it is all I care about.\u201d</p><p>My fingers had wrapped so tight around the key on my necklace that, as I dropped my hands, too much blood came rushing back into it. \u201cThere has to be something we can do.\u201d</p><p>He reached across and placed his hands on both my shoulders. \u201cThere is. Enjoy the last few months we have\u2014make some memories, maybe make a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll leave before she\u2019s even born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is just how it has to be,\u201d he said coldly, turning away. \u201cDiscussion closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I called, but he disappeared, slamming the bedroom door behind him.</p><p>I sat on my bed, tearstains drying out my cheeks, and told my dad the best of all my adventures living in Paris, including how my husband just confessed he was going to his death for some noble, supernatural cause.</p><p>There was no negotiation, Dad, I wrote. He just didn't care how I felt about it, and there was nothing I could say. He had a point, and I know he\u2019s usually always right. But not this time. He\u2019s doing the wrong thing! What does he think will happen if he just leaves me here\u2014alone? I won't survive it, Dad. I won\u2019t. I never wanted to live without him, and he won't reason with me. What am I supposed to do but go behind his back and put a turkey baster where it\u2019s not supposed to go? I don't want to, Dad. I started crying again. I don't want to betray him, but he's left me no choice. I just don\u2019t know how to fix this, how to make it that I won\u2019t lose him. I sobered a little, holding my breath, resting my finger over the \u2018send\u2019 button.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d My door opened slowly, a head of blonde hair popping in between the crack.</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d I quickly swiped the tears away and deleted the last paragraph, leaving my email as the chirpy, I'm-doing-well kind my dad really wanted to hear. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry to disturb you. I just...can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d I moved over and patted the spot on the bed next to me. But Emily closed my door and walked over, taking a seat on the foot of my bed instead, her knees facing the dresser as if maybe she had bad news and didn\u2019t want to see my face as she said it.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Em?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade just told me,\u201d she said, as quiet as a mouse.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>She drew a jagged breath, wiping her wrist along her nose. \u201cDavid went to Mike\u2014told him about this dagger.\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold. \u201cAnd . . . what did Mike say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe. . .\u201d She scraped repeatedly at the back of her hand with her thumbnail. \u201cHe threw things, yelled, screamed. They fought, but he...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe what, Em?\u201d I edged forward.</p><p>She placed both hands slowly on the bed beside her legs. \u201cHe promised David he\u2019d take care of you\u2014make sure you didn't do anything to stop him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d I sat up and shoved my laptop aside. \u201cWhy would he do that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDavid's kind of right, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?

We don't have to kill Drake. We can reason with him, or...I don't know, anything. But not death. That\u2019s eternal, Emily. Don't you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I care.\u201d She spun around on the spot to look at me. \u201cYou know I love David. But I love you, too, Ara, and I care about the future of our people, and that means we need you alive because we need an heir to the throne\u2014David\u2019s blood or not.\u201d</p><p>I hid my face slowly in my hands. \u201cWhy can't anyone, ever, just take my side?\u201d</p><p>She appeared beside me, sweeping my head against her shoulder. \u201cI'm on your side. But, I...I just don't know how to talk sense to him, Ara. All I can do is accept what he thinks is best and just go along with it.\u201d</p><p>I uncovered my face. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI'm not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I smirked. \u201c\u2019Cause you . . . you\u2019re kinda pale.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted her seat. \u201cNo. I'm just...cautious not to aggravate him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not, Ara. Not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>We both sat smiling for a few seconds, but inside, a part of me was battling with the other half that thought telling Emily my plan to have a child with Arthur was a bad idea.</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was a way I could save him?\u201d I said, still talking myself into involving her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if\u2014\u201d I sat up more. \u201cWhat if there was a way I could crown someone else king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo David wouldn\u2019t be the one who had to kill Drake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d say do it. Yeah. Whatever it takes, Ara.\u201d She nodded, becoming more convinced by the second. \u201cI'm on your side. If there\u2019s a way we can save him, let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would mean...\u201d I hesitated. \u201cIt could hurt him, though.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes went dark, her chin slowly rolling upward, making her shoulders straight and her spine tall. \u201cYou mean jure uxoris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She brushed her skirt down her legs as she shot to her feet and took a few steps backward. \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have even half a brain in that head, Ara, you won't do anything of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not getting in the middle of that. If that\u2019s your only plan\u2014\u201d She walked over and opened my door. \u201cYou're on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said to myself as she slammed it behind her.</p><p>Every summer, as a little girl, I\u2019d leave the wintry cool of my home in Australia and fly a couple of thousand miles across the sea to my dad\u2019s house. I only ever stayed a few weeks at a time, but it meant everything to him. I knew that as deep as I knew my own soul. Every night, when he\u2019d tuck me in and kiss my head, he\u2019d take a minute or two to sit by my bed and tell me a story\u2014always some tale about love conquering all\u2014before winding the mechanism on the base of my music box, setting it down on my grandmother\u2019s dresser, and closing my bedroom door. I\u2019d fall asleep to the gentle hum of his voice lingering in my ears and the soothing chimes of a lullaby. Now, whenever I hear rusty clicks moving a string of notes toward the end of a song, it always takes me back to the sweetness and innocence of childhood. But, this tune was different.</p><p>I lay staring at the dome of stained glass above my bed, imagining that little girl in the picture had grown up and lived some amazing life. But the score to my imagined story, chiming through the night from the silver box David gave me the night before our wedding, conflicted the joyous past I tried to create with a quite sombre, rather daunting one\u2014bringing more sorrow and mystery than I think the composer intended. The notes rolled off each other in ghostly succession, the melody so intrinsic it took on what felt like solid form, floating in the summer air above me\u2014a foggy white light, littered with tiny sparkles.</p><p>No one ever taught me the words\u2014given that they were in the Ancient Language, but somehow, I\u2019d sung the translated version the day David died at Elysium. Lying here now, though, I couldn\u2019t recall even one lyric\u2014didn\u2019t even know the title.</p><p>\u201cMort de l\u2019Amore,\u201d a small voice whispered. \u201cDeath of Love.\u201d</p><p>My eyes moved from the glass dome above to the child beside me. Her golden hair fell in long, crinkled waves over her shoulders, framing the eternally youthful face of pale skin, unblemished by life. She sat toying with the golden apple, spinning it carelessly between her fingertips.</p><p>\u201cMort de l\u2019Amore,\u201d I said it quietly to myself, sitting up a little. \u201cDo you know the words?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her small mouth opening, waiting for the gears to spin back around to the song\u2019s beginning. And her voice was high like a child from the choir of angels\u2014the words of the song touching my ears for the first time, despite once having moved my lips. I closed my eyes and listened for the meaning\u2014catching a moment of sorrow within it that was quickly retrieved by the deep undertone of love. Eternal love.</p><p>The words faded away then to nothing but a soft breath, a few seconds after the endnote. Eve looked down as if the golden apple had been mentioned in the lyric, and held it up, giving it a gentle turn to show a small hole in the side.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a keyhole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA keyhole?\u201d I reached for the apple; she drew it away. \u201cWhat\u2019s inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you share them with me?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze went to my collarbones. \u201cOnly you hold the key.\u201d</p><p>I touched my necklace. \u201cThis key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d she said, slowly reaching across to cup my hand with her tiny, cool fingers, then turned my palm upward, laying the apple there.</p><p>\u201cBut the hole is too big for this key.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re not looking at it properly,\u201d she said, and a coy smile moved her lip, her hand coming up a second later to swipe the apple. It rolled, bouncing off my fingers in a series of failed attempts to catch it, hitting the ground with a thud, then disappearing under the bed.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d I looked back at her, but the only thing beside me now was the peacefully sleeping man sprawled out like a starfish, taking up way more than his fair share of the bed. I waited a moment to see if the thud woke him, holding my breath as I watched his chest move rhythmically up and down, the cool air coming from his nose, moving across the sheets and brushing my pinkie where my hand rested, propping my arm up against the sheets.</p><p>Satisfied he wasn\u2019t planning to wake up and accuse me of conspiring with imagined figures, I rolled onto my belly, hooked one hand to the underside of the bed, and hoisted myself over the edge toward the ground\u2014lifting the bed skirt to search beneath the mattress. The blood rushed into my skull in this half upside-down position, making my eyes want to pop. But I had to find that apple. The only gold things under the bed, though, were the intricately-weaved letters on the spine of the book Petey showed me last month: Aide-Memoire de l\u2019Auress.</p><p>Auress? I sat up again, frowning. I\u2019d heard that word somewhere before. But couldn\u2019t place my finger on it. Not that it mattered right now anyway. The apple was gone, as if it had never been in my hand in the first place. Yet, I could still feel the chill of Eve\u2019s skin.</p><p>Maybe it was a dream. Maybe not. But one thing was for sure: that apple held some kind of key to some kind of secret Eve wanted me to know. I\u2019d looked at it many times\u2014spun it around in my fingertips, just as Eve had, but I\u2019d never seen a keyhole there before. What did it all mean?</p><p>I threw the covers back, my nightdress unravelling in layers of silk around my feet as I wandered over to the fireplace, briefly glancing back to see if I woke David. He didn\u2019t wake, not even when the door to the secret passage squeaked fiercely, as if it\u2019d not been opened in a hundred years.</p><p>Cobwebs broke across my nose and throat as I walked the dark steps downward, placing my toes gently to each one in case it caved under my weight. Normally, in these situations, I\u2019d tell myself not to be scared, that silly things like ghosts and vampires didn\u2019t exist but, for some reason, I just couldn\u2019t take my word for it.</p><p>I reached the base and stood for a moment in the dusty darkness, considering turning back and at least getting a lantern. There was no light in that room, and the dawn was still a good hour or so away. But, if I went back upstairs and David caught me sneaking around, I\u2019d have to either justify my mission or come up with some lie. And there had been enough lies between us lately. Enough that neither of my two options was all that appealing. So, I pushed the door open, cringing as the groaning hinges screeched their protest in an echo through the tunnel for all who may be waking in the manor to hear.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>My quick steps halted immediately, and the figure sitting on the edge of Eve\u2019s bed resolved itself into a man, his elbows on his knees, holding something rag-like in his hands. \u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d He looked up from the floor between his feet, offering a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing in here?\u201d I walked over, letting the dense relief swim through my limbs and relax them.</p><p>\u201cI like to come here to think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy here?\u201d I motioned around the dusty space\u2014its ancient fabrics and trinkets making it look like a haunted house. \u201cIt\u2019s so eerie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason you came down here, I guess.\u201d</p><p>I frowned at him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a secret. No one in the world can find you here unless they know about this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wanted total privacy?\u201d</p><p>He slowly cast his gaze to the floor again. \u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I guess that means you heard about David's little suicide mission?\u201d I swung around the bedpost and came to rest on the mattress beside Jase, stirring up a dust cloud as I landed.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? I mean\u2014\u201d I cleared my throat. \u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d</p><p>He stood, dumping the thing he was holding on the chair as he passed it. \u201cLike cutting a hole in my gut to drain out all the guilt, all the pain, all the fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I stood too. \u201cI'm so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to himself. \u201cGrowing up, we . . . we\u2019d fight. We\u2019d play pranks on each other and, sometimes, we\u2019d do things brothers really shouldn't do\u2014nasty things. But I always loved him, Ara. I've always known he\u2019d be there after to make up with or punch in the arm every day for a year until we got over whatever little feud it was we had at the time. And I was okay with that\u2014it was how we were. But. . .\u201d He sat down in the chair on top of what he\u2019d just thrown there. \u201cI can't even imagine him not being here. I can't comprehend the idea that my brother will be gone . . . for forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wandered over and squatted before him, resting my hand gently over his. \u201cI won't let this happen, Jase.

It is what it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy won't he help me help him?\u201d I said, breaking to tears on the last word. \u201cI thought by coming to him, by getting it all out in the open, maybe we could change things, maybe we could work together\u2014do something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it was the right thing to do, but. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, it didn't work. He doesn't care.

Don\u2019t you see, Ara? It\u2019s not that he doesn't care or that he wants to die, but that it\u2019s taken him so long to accept his fate that he\u2019s worried it\u2019s all gonna come undone with one word of hope, and then he\u2019s going to lose all that again when whatever plan you had fails.\u201d</p> <p>I swiped a tear from the very tip of my nose. \u201cI get that. I do. I really understand what he's gone through to cope with what he has to do, but I don't care. I just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what will happen to you when he\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk yourself this,\u201d Jase said, stopping in front of me. \u201cWhat does it mean to you? What will your life be when he\u2019s no longer in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Empty,\u201d I answered quickly.</p><p>\u201cNo. Think harder. Think about that first day, when you wake up and there's a shift in the paradigm. When you look out the window and suddenly that sense that he's out there, that you'll see him next week or that you'll argue with him about something he said, will be gone. Like staring at a blank canvas.\u201d He rolled his shoulders back slowly, watching the realisation form in front of him. \u201cThere\u2019ll never be any way to paint over that. There will never be any way to fill that hole, Ara, and I love you, you know that, but even I can't fill that hole for you. I know. . .\u201d He sighed, dropping his hands to his knees for a second before standing tall again. \u201cI know you\u2019ve messed up from time to time when it comes to him and the way you love him. But you do love him, and that\u2019s what counts in the end, Ara, because after a hundred years with one person, that's the only thing that keeps you together. God knows.\u201d He rubbed his brow. \u201cI tried. I . . . but we failed, and it breaks my heart so immensely deep that you'll have to suffer that\u2014that you'll have to feel that way for even a second. I would do anything. . .\u201d His fists tightened. \u201cAnything to keep you from that, because your life won't just be empty without him, Ara, it\u2019ll be like living without air.\u201d</p> <p>I stepped closer, my eyes wide. \u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe know this, too, Ara. He knows all that his death will do to you, and he is still going to go\u2014still going to let you suffer that, because his reasons for dying far outweigh anything else he might care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it.\u201d He offered a gentle smile; just one corner of his lip turning up, gifting me with the presence of his dimple. \u201cI don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I spun around quickly. \u201cDavid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d He glared at Jason as he walked over and placed his arm around me possessively.</p><p>\u201cI was already in here when she came in,\u201d Jase said flatly.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d David looked from him to me, then back again. \u201cThen tell me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were just discussing your recent decision,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He sighed, stepping away. \u201cGet back to bed. We\u2019re not having this discussion again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do that to her.\u201d Jason moved in, coming up fast in front of David. \u201cShe has the right to fight for you. There has to be another way.\u201d</p><p>David just smiled. \u201cWould I be going to my death if there were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I understand that, but\u2014\u201d Jase\u2019s words stopped, his eyes going smaller. \u201cWhere did you get that information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat information?\u201d I asked, stepping into the conversation.</p><p>David glanced back at me once, his shoulders sinking. \u201cDon't you get it, brother? This has to end with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, what do you mean?\u201d I curled my white fingertips over his forearm. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave me in the dark anymore, David. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Jason one more time, who nodded, almost as if agreeing with something, then softly spoke my name\u2014all the fight, the strain, the depth leaving his voice in defeat. \u201cWhat you know of the prophecy so far is wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . what parts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of it. It\u2019s backward, misinterpreted.\u201d He started pacing. \u201cThis child, this Blood of Knight and Lilithian, that\u2019s not you. Nothing has been foretold. Only promised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat those pages are is\u2014\u201d David stopped and looked away. \u201cThey\u2019re not a prophecy, Ara. They\u2019re a contract.\u201d</p><p>My eyes darted to Jason. \u201cSo Jason was right.\u201d</p><p>David frowned at him. \u201cYou told her it was a contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur didn\u2019t tell me,\u201d Jason said, answering an unspoken question. \u201cI only had to read it to see the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd still,\u201d David said, turning away to rub his head. \u201cIt seems even you missed the proverbial left hand while you were watching the right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d Jason nodded once then looked at me. \u201cAra, you\u2019ve not only been mislead, pretty girl. You\u2019ve been lied to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? By who?\u201d I asked Jase, but it really was aimed more at David, because I already knew the answer\u2014could feel the tension coming off David\u2019s soul in waves.</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cAnd Morgaine,\u201d Jason added.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I nearly rocketed forward to grab David and shake him.</p><p>\u201cWe deliberately mislead you, my love\u2014misled everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt began as bended truth, many centuries ago,\u201d he said. \u201cMorgaine needed others to back her against a king she wanted overthrown. But without hope of new queen rising, the Lilithians wouldn\u2019t stand. So, she tore the scrolls, burnt them, marred them in order to make the words appear as if they were from the Book of Carmen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Book of Carmen?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA collection of Vampirie\u2019s predictions written down throughout the centuries,\u201d Jase informed.</p><p>\u201cMorgaine made people believe there was a prophecy,\u201d David continued. \u201cAnd she created an army in the name of the new queen, not knowing whether one would ever return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she go to such lengths? What the hell is it we\u2019re fighting against?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake,\u201d both boys said simply.</p><p>\u201cHe is a master of the Dark Arts, Ara. He deals with Black Magic, and as if that weren\u2019t something to fear enough, those dealings with the devil have turned his soul into something as twisted and black as death itself,\u201d David said. \u201cHe has done unspeakable things, and even in a society of killers, there is a line we all draw. Morgaine was tired of seeing her people\u2014your people suffer. She had to stop him, even if it took her centuries to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, she made the contract look like a prophecy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t they have supported her if it was a contract? I mean, doesn\u2019t it promise the restoration of things taken?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It promises to restore one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat one thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t actually know.\u201d David sighed the words out. \u201cNo one does. It was never mentioned in the contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we do know for sure, Ara,\u201d Jason said, \u201cis that there\u2019s no document foretelling the birth of a child\u2014or the future possibility to restore mortality to vampires.\u201d</p><p>I let that sink in for a second.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara,\u201d David said softly. \u201cWe can\u2019t free the Immortal Damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I cupped my hand over his as it landed on my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m okay, David. Jase already told me that might be the case.\u201d</p><p>David glared at Jason. \u201cYou knew this as well?\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded. \u201cArthur told me what happened that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day?\u201d I studied both boys, completely confused.</p><p>David stepped back, closing his eyes. \u201cWe never intended to make up that part of the prophecy, Ara. Morgaine told our people of a coming queen\u2014one who would bear a child that could kill Drake. But, when you were rescued from Elysium, we. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all thought you just wanted to die,\u201d Jason finished for him, looking back at me.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t realise it was merely because you believed I was dead. And in a moment of desperation, Morgaine told you that lie\u2014told you there was a way to save the Damned.\u201d David hung his head in shame. \u201cAnd neither herself, nor I, have had the courage to correct it since that day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I whispered his name, my heart breaking a little, not for the truth, though, but for the fact that he not only went to so much trouble to lie to me, but keep it up too. I felt stupid and used.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis. . .\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cThis is why you wouldn\u2019t approve Jason\u2019s lab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He eyed Jason suspiciously. \u201cAnd now I\u2019m left wondering why my brother, who also clearly knew more than he let on, was sanctioning for a lab to research ways to do something he knows can\u2019t be done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just for the immortality cure, David. You know that,\u201d Jase said sharply. \u201cI clearly outlined my concerns for her safety and the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike has it under control,\u201d David yelled.</p><p>\u201cHas what under control?\u201d I stepped between the two of them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David composed himself. \u201cYour blue light.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands.</p><p>\u201cThat is not control,\u201d Jason said, presenting me. \u201cI\u2019ve warned you, David. He could be hurting her by pushing her. And she\u2019s tired of being in pain, brother\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is my problem, Jason. Not yours. You\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just her pain, though. I told you. I showed you all the facts, David. I strongly believe that, beneath all these lies, we may have actually found a way to restore mortal life.\u201d</p><p>David let a breath out through his nose like an angry bull. \u201cBrother, there is no\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what does the contract mean?\u201d I cut in before they started bickering again. \u201cWhat does it actually agree on?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s shoulders rolled back to their correct position. \u201cLike you said, Ara. It was a simple promise Drake made to Lilith to give something back in exchange for a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just a child,\u201d Jason said, his throat tight, his teeth closed.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d David added, his fists falling loose. \u201cHer child, one not yet born, but sworn to be conceived under certain conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertain conditions?\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cTell her, or I will.\u201d Jason stared David down\u2014both of them meeting eye to eye, like a man staring into a mirror. \u201cFine,\u201d he added, peeling his eyes away from his brother. \u201cAra, your blood is cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCursed?\u201d I repeated, feeling like I had the repeat-every-last-line-these-guys-say disease.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jason said. \u201cTo bear only females until the debt is repaid\u2014a debt Lilith bequeathed your bloodline\u2014passed down from mother to daughter over the centuries, until falling, finally, on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich further cements our conclusions that your mom Eleanor wasn\u2019t your biological mother, Ara,\u201d David added. \u201cSince she gave birth to a boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, so my dad isn\u2019t my dad. My mom wasn\u2019t my mom. And I can only have girls until I\u2019ve given Drake my firstborn.\u201d</p><p>David shook his head. \u201cNo. Until your firstborn is conceived with a nobleman\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA nobleman?\u201d I grimaced. \u201cWhat, like a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnight.\u201d Jase winked at me.</p><p>\u201cAs in. . .\u201d I pictured a man riding a horse in a metal suit with a jousting stick. \u201cLike a. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen were not knighted only for their ability to wield a sword, Ara,\u201d David said. \u201cThey were knighted for the nobility they either had in their blood or in their hearts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I have to a baby with someone who\u2019s noble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just any noble,\u201d Jason said, casting his gaze slowly across the dusty room to his brother. \u201cOne specific noble.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>David sniffed once, standing taller. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>I went to speak, tell him I already knew that, but Jase cut in. \u201cYou weren\u2019t meant to exist, Ara,\u201d he said. \u201cLilith was supposed to be the one who bore a child with David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I suddenly needed to sit down, but stayed standing, unable to move. Lilith . . . and David? No way. No freakin\u2019 way. \u201cThen . . . I wasn\u2019t foretold or promised? You were, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like designed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake needed blood of the purest forms to create this child. Now, we don\u2019t know why that was a requirement,\u201d David reported, as if he were a lawyer in a court, presenting facts to a jury. \u201cBut he cast a spell on my father\u2019s bloodline many centuries ago\u2014one that would see only sons born to the blood of Knight until, at last, the cleansing was complete and two sons would be born to one mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne with the purest of heart,\u201d Jason said and looked at David. \u201cAnd the other. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCenturies of all the bad in one little boy.\u201d</p><p>Those words swallowed my thoughts for a minute, reminding me of what David\u2019s own father believed about Jason. \u201cJason\u2019s the impure one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d Jason looked at his feet.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re\u2014\u201d I walked over and touched his shoulder, ignoring David\u2019s quick intake of breath. \u201cYou\u2019re learning this for the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was always told as such. I just never knew it would turn out to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did your father know?\u201d I looked at David.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure. But he misinterpreted the meaning, taking it to mean Jason would be evil.\u201d</p><p>I smiled across at Jason. He was far from evil. \u201cSo, you were originally intended to be with Lilith then, David?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once. \u201cWe\u2019re not sure what went wrong. All we do know is that you carry her blood and her curse. You could bear child after child, Ara, but the curse will not break until this child is born of yours and my blood.\u201d</p><p>And, finally, the information in the scrolls made sense. For once. \u201cHow do you know this stuff?\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s dimple showed for a second. \u201cWhat do you think I\u2019ve been doing all these months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nodded, rubbing my face. \u201cOkay. Info overload.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed once, and the sound brought me back a little, made me realise we were all still here, not lost somewhere in the past.</p><p>\u201cSo he wants our baby,\u201d I said simply. \u201cLet\u2019s just not have one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blood curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If we do not conceive before I die, and you were to go on to love another\u2014\u201d David cleared his throat, his eyes clearly avoiding Jason. \u201cAny child you bear with that man will carry the burden that is yours, that was your mothers before you and so on and so on\u2014the curse repeating itself over and over, passed down to the firstborn, until this child, conceived of my blood, exists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the curse will break on conception?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, that\u2019s what Drake agreed to restore or . . . give back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but it\u2019s not relevant or even important, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling Drake.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? We can\u2019t run from this. I must father our child to save her sitting where you sit now, carrying a curse that is not hers. And from the second she is a living being inside your body, her life will be in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in danger? You said you don\u2019t know what Drake plans to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been promised to him, that\u2019s all we need to know,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived a hundred years under his roof, Ara, and he is not\u2014\u201d David held his finger up, angling his head away, \u201c\u2014getting my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then . . . he needs to die?\u201d I said, though I couldn\u2019t feel the words come from my lips.</p><p>\u201cYes, because if I choose to live\u2014to run and not kill Drake, then we will look over our shoulders every day, my love, wondering if today is the day our baby girl doesn\u2019t come home from school, if today is the day he finds her.\u201d David walked over and cupped both my shoulders gently, leaning down to look right into my eyes. \u201cI was born purely to end this curse, Ara. There is no way around this.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to scream and yell\u2014wanted to find the corpse of Lilith and burn it or stab it repeatedly for undoing everything I ever thought I had. David was never mine. He probably only fell in love with me because he and Lilith were meant for each other. \u201cHow long have you known about this?\u201d I said so quietly that Jase took a step forward, his hand twitching as if he planned to touch me.</p><p>David took a second, but finally answered with, \u201cSince before you left for Loslilian.\u201d</p><p>I sat down on the armchair, landing on the doll Jase had thrown there earlier. Neither of the boys said a word for a while. Jase watched me carefully, probably reading my thoughts, while David stood staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about this blood curse, David. Not when there is still a way to save you,\u201d I said softly, not really wanting a challenge, but not ready to give up the fight either.</p><p>\u201cHaving a child with another man and sending him to kill Drake is not the answer, either, Ara,\u201d David said calmly, even though it was through his teeth. \u201cI checked. I talked with Walt, with Arthur, and they have varying opinions, but one fact remains: the scrolls that describe our laws clearly state that the child must be born for a jure uxorious to take his throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Both Jase and I said.</p><p>I stood up. \u201cI thought it could be as long as I was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to the law, Ara, ask me. Trust me. I'm the one who knows every in and out and every loophole. The child must be born,\u201d David said. \u201cAnd before our new king even had a chance to kill Drake, he would swoop in, steal you and your unborn child, and probably kill it in the womb to stop the cycle repeating. I can't let that happen.\u201d</p><p>I sat down again. \u201cWhy didn't you just tell me all this when we argued earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He looked at his brother. \u201cI don't know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d Jase said, but his voice broke beneath a breathy laugh. \u201cWhat, you think she\u2019s gonna laugh at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d David studied his feet. \u201cI guess I just forget sometimes that you can be reasoned with, Ara. That you\u2014\u201d He stopped and came to kneel in front of me, gently taking my fingertips in his. \u201cThat you're my best friend, and I can tell you anything.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou reminded me of that by coming to me earlier, being straight with me, and I really appreciated that. I know I came across as angry and unreasonable, but it\u2019s . . . if there was anything else we could do, I would already be doing it. Do you really think I want to leave you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don't, silly girl. I have everything I ever wanted and so many things I would never have imagined to want. But I have to give up this life\u2014\u201d He reached up and cupped my cheek. \u201cHave to leave you alone, because this burden was born to me, not to you, my love. I don't want to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of forever, and I don't want that for you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, laying my hand over his.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ara. Just tell me you understand. I need you to understand.\u201d</p><p>I nodded again.

I\u2019ll be there in a sec.\u201d David hung up and stowed the phone again, untucking his shirttail where the device dragged it into his pocket a little. \u201cAra, time for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike\u2019s got an issue with one of the Damned.

Make a baby with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not funny, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged, trying not to laugh at the look on his face.</p><p>He pointed at Jason. \u201cIt\u2019s on your shoulders, brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna touch her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I stood, but he disappeared. \u201cArgh! He has got to stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>A frown moved in across my face, my gaze slowly landing on Jason. \u201cWhy are you sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d He exhaled, folding over as if he was puffed out. \u201cI didn't know that\u2014about the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . if I\u2019d known.

Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He sobered with a shaky breath. \u201cIt is. As long as he never asks me what I was about to say.\u201d</p><p>My frown deepened. \u201cWhat were you about to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething that would\u2019ve ruined your last few months together.\u201d He stood straight again. \u201cIt was stupid. I wasn\u2019t thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would ruin it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Just . . . nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you. . .? Did you. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Ara.\u201d He reached across and rubbed my arm reassuringly. \u201cI\u2014it was just bringing up the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, don't do that.\u201d I grinned. \u201cHe hates even thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll uh. . .\u201d He backed away a few steps. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya later, sweet girl, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cO\u2014\u201d I started, but when I looked up to see his smiling eyes, he was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with these Knight boys and farewells?\u201d I said, imagining Eve down here in the eerie old room beside me. But no one answered.</p><p>The morning had risen outside as we\u2019d all talked, and there was at least enough light in here now to find a small golden apple if one were searching for it. So, I put my aches and problems away inside my chest for a minute and dusted my hands off on my nightdress, even though they weren't dirty, then folded myself in half to look under the bed. That apple I dreamed about was in here somewhere. I could have sworn I\u2019d put it on the dresser last time, but it wasn\u2019t there when I stole a glance behind Jason just now.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d I said softly, not sure if she was here or if she was even real. \u201cCan you help me find it?\u201d</p><p>A high chime rang through the air then, sharp, but melodious, drowned out slightly by the clicking of gears. I walked slowly over to the music box on the dresser and, there, sitting among a few small trinkets, was the golden apple Eve was given before she died.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Eve,\u201d I whispered, picking it up. \u201cI promise you I\u2019ll figure this out.\u201d</p><p>The apple glimmered in what little dawn light crept in between the boarded windows. It was heavy for something so small, reminding me a little of a fairy tale I read when I was young\u2014about a golden ball and a frog.</p><p>I turned it several times in my hands, poking the smooth, cold surface, but there was no hole, no button, no secret door. It was completely solid. And I had no idea what that meant. Maybe the keyhole I saw in my dream was a mistake or maybe even a metaphor, as in, maybe, the apple was the key to something, or the door to something.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you know that promise I just made?\u201d I said suggestively, then curled my fingers around the golden apple, hiding it away as I headed for the stairs again.</p><p>When the secret door closed behind me this morning as the dawn settled toward day, I\u2019d stood in my empty room for longer than the clock ticking on the wall cared to admit. But David didn\u2019t come back up\u2014didn\u2019t come to talk to me or make everything okay. He was gone, clearly off somewhere playing his role as king.</p><p>I left my room behind and, as I\u2019d walked down the corridor to find him, my sweeping gaze landed on the two figures in the front yard. A caravan of delivery trucks streamed in one by one, and David and Arthur stepped up to sign for packages that were, judging by the volume of plants and boxes of beakers they were checking, the stock for Arthur\u2019s new Herbalist Lab and greenhouse. Clearly, David wasn\u2019t coming up to talk to me anytime soon. He\u2019d given me all he was required to give: the facts. He\u2019d brush it off and keep going now, duty-bound to operate in a \u2018business as usual\u2019 manner. The way he always did. Come what may.</p><p>He looked up from time to time as I paced the floors in front of the windows, and I pretended not to notice him trying to catch my gaze\u2014walking with my head down, my fingers tightly clasped around the golden apple. He did care how I felt, for what it was worth. I knew it mattered to him how much this hurt me, but I could map the conversation out in my head that we\u2019d have even if he did actually come up here to comfort me. Nothing I did or argued could change what had to be done. I had two options: accept his death quietly and with grace, or demonstrate my inner child by kicking and screaming about it until David was gone.</p><p>Down in the yard, a large truck arrived, and a small group of men ran eagerly toward it, tapping the edges before it even stopped. They were all smiling and laughing, talking with enough animation that I could almost read their lips. Arthur seemed more excited than the others, though. David had blessed him with the lab and greenhouse he\u2019d applied for over the last hundred years passed, then gone and denied his own brother the same. I felt hurt for Jason. He deserved better than what he put up with here, and the truth about his brother\u2019s future had hit him harder than even I expected. It just seemed like only Jason and I really understood what it meant\u2014really knew what it would be like to lose David. Maybe Arthur understood, too, but he seemed to accept that this was David\u2019s duty. As if he\u2019d accepted it long ago, like David had. The fact was, David would go away in a month or so, pack the dagger into his bag and. . .</p><p>I took a quick breath, dropping the apple to the ground by my feet with a solid thud.</p><p>The dagger. Arthur gave him the duplicate. The fake.</p><p>I ran to the window and pressed my hands and nose against it, watching Arthur in the front yard by the pond. Maybe he wasn\u2019t all that supportive of David\u2019s plan after all. Maybe he had his own in effect right now. But if David journeyed to Romania with the fake dagger and jammed it through Drake\u2019s heart, only one of them would die. And it wouldn\u2019t be Drake.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David\u2019s firm fingers wrapped my arm, gently tugging me away from the window. But when I turned around to look into his eyes, a pair of warm, caramel one\u2019s stared back.</p><p>\u201cFalcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need some rest, My Queen,\u201d he said, and a flicker of something other than business flashed in his eyes for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve been out here since dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I glanced over my shoulder out the window. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He dropped my arm, stepping back into professional mode. \u201cBut you at least need to lie down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? So I can wait for my husband to die from a more comfortable position for you?\u201d I said spitefully. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, does my pacing offend you somehow?\u201d</p><p>He bent down and picked up my golden apple, studying it for a second before planting it firmly in my hand. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I swiped a hand across my nose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a spoilt brat. You\u2019ve made so much progress lately. This isn\u2019t you. You\u2019re hurt, I get that, but there\u2019s no sense in behaving like a child to express it. Which is exactly what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders dropped. I looked quickly down both ends of the hall and let out a long breath. \u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry, I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He grasped my upper arm and steered me toward my room. \u201cRest for a bit. The grief will still be there when you wake up.\u201d</p><p>My chest caved a few times, turning the ache inside to an outward snivel. I wanted so badly just to fall into Falcon\u2019s arms for a hug\u2014just a pair of arms, anyone\u2019s arms, to ease the caged, heavy feeling in my heart. But he wouldn\u2019t have any of that. I knew that. So, I sucked up the grief and opened my door, quietly thanking Falcon before closing it and flopping down onto my bed\u2014an \u201cacceptable\u201d place to grieve. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou have to give David the real dagger!\u201d I slammed Arthur\u2019s bedroom door behind me.</p><p>The gentle hum of his violin stopped in an abrupt and high-pitched screech as he looked up in shock. \u201cAnd why on God\u2019s good earth would I ever do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s going to kill Drake.\u201d I held strong, reshuffling my feet as if standing tall on a rocky boat. \u201cIf he has the wrong dagger, Drake will kill him.\u201d</p> <p>Arthur rested his violin in its stand by the fireplace and stood motionless for a moment, exhaling through his nose.</p><p>\u201cArthur, he knows Drake\u2019s in Romania.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He appeared by my side, and guided me by the wrist to the long oak table in the middle of the room. \u201cTake a seat, my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sit,\u201d I said, sitting. \u201cI want you to promise me you\u2019ll give him the real dagger.\u201d</p><p>All Arthur offered in response as he sat down across from me, though, was a long sigh into his fist; his thoughts lost a million miles away. \u201cWhat has he told you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe told me his father knew about this blood curse and this connection to Lilith, which means you had to have known, Arthur, how can you not? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to have to stop you there, Amara.\u201d He held his hand up. \u201cI knew about the Cursed Blood of Knight, yes, and I argued with David for three hours about telling you the truth. He overruled me, princess, and you\u2019re his wife. I\u2019ve no place going against his wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m your friend,\u201d I said in a shaky voice. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that count?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And that is precisely why I sat in that day Jason was helping you read the scrolls. I hoped a hint of the truth would be enough to set your mind working, that maybe you would come to your own conclusions after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut all it did was shatter my hopes of freeing the Damned, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I learned an important lesson that day\u2014to trust David when he says he knows what\u2019s best for you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe warned me that you were holding on to the hope that you could save the children to survive. I was wrong to let Jason tell you as much as he did, but I didn\u2019t realise that until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>I twiddled my thumbs, watching one go around the other for a second. \u201cYou knew Lilith when she was alive, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, surely you must know more about this contract and the promised child than you\u2019re letting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know some things, but not from living in that time. I was not around for the death of Lilith, or the events that led to it. But with decades of research, I\u2019ve collected some facts about it and made my own conclusions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . do you know what Drake wants with my child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I have a theory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d I said, my voice peaking with interest.</p><p>\u201cLilith killed Anandene, and eventually promised her own child to Drake as a means to end the suffering he caused in return. But why does he want her child as repayment for what she did to his wife?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cSeems like an odd exchange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Unless he planned to use the powerful blood of his immortal sister to restore the untethered soul of his beloved.\u201d</p><p>My face went numb. \u201cRestore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you once that immortal souls are the one\u2019s that reincarnate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, unless the connection was severed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, Anandene\u2019s body was killed, not necessarily her soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . .how . . . I mean\u2014\u201d I thought about all that. \u201cHe wants to . . . what? Reincarnate Anandene?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr insert her soul into your newborn child.\u201d</p><p>My mouth dropped.</p><p>\u201cIt would explain the queer requirements of conception,\u201d he added. \u201cThe fact that it had to be born from the purest blood of a nobleman\u2019s son. And it explains why Drake has kept Safia, a known Vampirian enemy, around all these years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would a witch have to do with a baby and a soul insertion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs her to complete the ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRitual?\u201d That sounded so much scarier than using the words soul insertion, conjuring up images of lightning and stone tables and long cloaks. \u201cIs . . . is this kind of thing possible?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cDrake performed this ritual once before. But it failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who was it? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know only a few details, but it has been whispered that Drake attempted it on his mother\u2019s soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . what happened to her then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know, princess.\u201d He folded his fingers together on the table. \u201cI do know that a certain kind of magic runs in his veins, in any born immortal\u2019s veins, but he would not have the power to perform such a spell. He needs a witch\u2014needs Safia, and I fear that, once he\u2019s done with her, he plans to dispose of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d I said, then rolled my wrist out. \u201cI mean, aside from the obvious\u2014her being dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafia will not go easily. She would be only too aware what Drake plans for her, and she will be taking steps to prevent this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>Arthur sat back, resting his knuckles by his lips, studying me as if considering how much to disclose. \u201cShe may be looking for an immortal vessel of her own, possibly the one Drake plans to take from you.\u201d</p><p>I touched my belly. \u201cSo, she\u2019s going to insert herself into my baby?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded once, his eyes lost in thought. \u201cAfter all my research and contemplation, this is my latest conclusion.\u201d He reached across the table for my hand; I placed it in his. \u201cOf course, I could be very, very wrong.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand and sat back. \u201cIt sounds pretty scary. But also very plausible. What did David say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was of no consequence\u2014said that Drake would be dead before it was a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut even if we kill Drake, what about Safia?\u201d</p><p>Arthur laughed. \u201cIf he\u2019s not around to kill her, she won\u2019t need a new body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cSo, if we kill Drake, does that void the contract?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you kill him with the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why not just kill him with venom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, my dear, think back. Try to remember what I told you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a second to think about it.</p><p>\u201cThat the dagger severs the connection of the immortalised soul from this world,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you simply kill Drake, his soul will reincarnate, or could possibly be transferred into another immortal body later, and the contract will be reinstated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the contract is bound to his soul?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to Lilith\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>I exhaled, my shoulders sinking. \u201cFalling on her descendants until it\u2019s fulfilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d I rested my head in my palms. \u201cI was really hoping to find a way around using that dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs was David, my dear. He and I have exhausted all these options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he tell me about the whole soul insertion ritual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it is only a theory at this point, and David does act on a whim. I came up with this theory, but I\u2014\u201d He laughed, jerking his head toward the fireplace and the stack of books beside it. \u201cI may have spent too long poring over fantasy.\u201d</p><p>I slowly looked back from the books. \u201cSo, what do we do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said: focus on what we know, protect your unborn child and, rather than dig through the depths of Drake's lies and plans, kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd kill David in the process.\u201d My sharp words travelled across the oak top of Arthur\u2019s table and hit him right in the heart, making his body shudder.</p><p>\u201cI lost him once.\u201d He looked down. \u201cAnd I swore I would not lose him again. But it seems we are left with little choice.\u201d</p><p>And that left only one thing to gain in David\u2019s Inventory of Death. \u201cSo you\u2019ll give him the right dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my word.\u201d</p><p>I nodded once and, feeling the rise of emotions I just wanted to control, placed both hands on the tabletop, stood slowly, and walked away.</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d</p><p>I stopped, holding the door ajar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and as the door closed behind me, the tears I could hold no longer streamed down my face. I felt like a leaf in a pond, held down by a stick\u2014too tired to come back up, too alive to just sink down and give up.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Blade left his guard post and scooped me up in a warm embrace. \u201cDon\u2019t cry, little queen. Please, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t lose him, Blade. I can\u2019t do this,\u201d I sobbed into his shirt, my arms and hands shaking, so tight with grief my skin was red. \u201cI\u2019m not strong enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, don\u2019t you know?\u201d He placed a hand over the side of my face, cupping my ear firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re stronger than anyone gives you credit for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to be, Blade. Maybe if I wasn\u2019t\u2014maybe if David knew how bad this would hurt me, how much it would kill me, he wouldn\u2019t go. He wouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has no choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sunk down, tearing away from Blade\u2019s arms, and sat on the ground with my head in my hands. \u201cI know. But I have no control. None. And I hate it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d David\u2019s smooth voice came past Blade\u2019s shoulder; he squatted down in front of me and, as his eyes met mine, I saw them flicker\u2014felt him reach into my mind and see everything that just happened.</p><p>He sat down beside me, the hall empty around us, free of guards, maids, friends, even Blade was gone. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I hiccupped into my palms, rolling down to rest my head in David\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s ever going to make this okay, is it?\u201d he said, his hand hovering above my hair as if he didn\u2019t want to break me down further by touching me.</p><p>The only answer I could give was a shake of my head, keeping my face hidden. And we sat there alone, our backs against Arthur\u2019s door, watching the sun turn the walls orange then black as the night consumed us.</p><p>Living things watched me pass\u2014the all-seeing eyes of nature following me as I ran fast through the Enchanted Forest. My feet barely touched the floor, the speed of this immortal body taking me from the tree line outside the Garden of Lilith to the endless valley of trees beyond the Stone.</p><p>I stopped on the face of a cliff, my palm against a trunk, folding over to catch my breath. The life of Nature ran violently through my veins, charging them with energy, while the exertion of my run simultaneously drained me. This body was an engine that could not be idle\u2014could not run far enough away from the problems to fall down and care only about the physical pain. I couldn\u2019t walk through the fields or the trees without the Spirits of Nature making my heart ache, magnifying every emotion. Nothing would make this better. It was like dreaming while awake, and no matter how hard I pinched myself, I just couldn\u2019t get back to the world where none of this was happening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I slid down the tree and let both legs dangle into the mouth of the valley. I knew this place was unnatural. I knew that if I flew a plane over this side of Loslilian Island, there\u2019d be no valley. But beyond the Stone of Truth, it seemed the world went on forever. It felt like a parallel world out here, a secret parallel world, because I was, from what I\u2019d gathered, the only one who\u2019d seen it\u2014almost as if it were a gift only for those connected to the Stone.</p><p>The cuts and bruises on my bare feet healed as I sat, and the scrapes and gashes on my arms, hands, and cheeks tingled as they sealed themselves shut. My hair was frizzy, I could actually feel it, and I was sure my face was covered in dirt and blood because, when I wiped my tears away, my hands came back brown.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t save him, Eve,\u201d I said, feeling her spirit beside me.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying not to.\u201d I wiped my face again and held my hands out, showing them to the forest. \u201cBut I can\u2019t stop them from coming. How do I do that?\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped then, when her small, almost transparent hand landed in mine. \u201cThe apple holds the key,\u201d she said.</p><p>I looked up from our locked fingertips and into her bright blue eyes; they were just like mine\u2014her face heart-shaped and so youthful it hurt to look at her, knowing she was dead\u2014almost as if my soul quivered, bleeding inside. \u201cWhat does that mean, Eve?\u201d</p><p>She reached out slowly with her other hand and placed it flat across my belly. \u201cThe apple holds the key.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean the child?\u201d I said, cupping my hand over hers, but the tiny, cold touch of Eve was gone. I looked up to the place beside me where she sat a second ago, hearing the birds sing louder as the pink light across the trees turned bright yellow under the late morning sun. I knew I\u2019d sat here longer than I thought. I knew David would be looking for me, worried. I knew I\u2019d get a lecture from him and everyone else who treated me like a baby when I returned, but I didn\u2019t care. I hugged my knees to my chest and laid my cheek against them, thinking about the keyhole in the golden apple.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I called to the lone figure heading toward the lower west wing.</p><p>He stopped in the darkened entranceway just below the stairs, watching me descend. \u201cWhat you doin\u2019 up so late, b-Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBara?\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d He shook his head at himself. \u201cI gotta quit calling you baby.\u201d</p><p>I stepped off the stair and stood beside him, feeling suddenly so much smaller at the base of his bulk and height. \u201cDavid threaten to tear your arm off, huh?\u201d</p> <p>Mike slowly folded one arm into his body, then the other. \u201cI dunno what\u2019s gotten into him lately. He\u2019s, to put it bluntly, he\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s the same David he\u2019s always been. We\u2019re just meeting the councillor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not sure I like King David.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, pushing his arms down from their fold. \u201cGive it time. He\u2019s been through a lot the last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He nodded. \u201cFine. So, what did you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um.\u201d I looked back up the stairs then at Mike again. \u201cDavid ran off the other day because you had a problem with the Damned. Just wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He touched my shoulder. \u201cIt was just Harrison. He wet his bed and wanted King David.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth slowly. \u201cPoor baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s all right. He didn\u2019t want you to know, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? Why?\u201d</p><p>Mike\u2019s sideways smile warmed his whole face. \u201cDuh! You\u2019re a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I nodded, but my face still wrinkled with confusion. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever mind it, Ara.\u201d He turned slightly and started walking away. \u201cIt\u2019s all sorted now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I called to the back of his head. \u201cWell, thanks for the chat. Nice to see you. Hope we can do it again sometime in the next century.\u201d</p><p>I heard him laugh softly, throwing his hand up in a gentle wave goodbye. He must have been really busy. But I meant those words as more than just a joke. Since I\u2019d fallen off the lighthouse, he and I had spent less and less time chatting casually. He really had stepped into the role of employee and not so much friend.</p><p>\u201cMiss you,\u201d I added quietly and turned to walk back up the stairs.</p><p>The whole manor was quiet, almost desolate. The Lilithian people finally at rest. They had their queen, the possibility of an heir\u2014one they still believed was foretold to transform vampires into humans\u2014and they would soon be rid of their immortal enemy, even though this meant losing their king, it was, to them, a worthy death. And a king could always be replaced. It was replacing the love of my life that I had a problem with. But, all that aside, those living in the manor were finally free. Morgaine had achieved nearly everything she set out to do centuries ago, yet her success made me feel hollow. My life so far had been lived around fulfilling this prophecy and freeing my people from the darkness of Drake\u2019s reign. Now that had been achieved, what was next? Day-to-day, right? Just ruling, eating and sleeping. Wake up, rinse and repeat. Over and over again for the rest of forever, alone.</p><p>I turned the corner into the openness off the great library, and as I started up the stairs to the second floor, stopped and put my foot back down on the ground. The secret door to the Scroll Room was open, candlelight and laughter lilting up the stone stairs from within.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I called down the hole, coming to stop on the cusp, with my arms folded.</p><p>\u201cDown here, sweetheart,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cCan I . . . is it okay if I come down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>My head led the way toward David and the other voice, my fingertips trailing the bricks behind me. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be sleeping? You have a long trip tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires don\u2019t require as much sleep as your kind.\u201d David placed his arm around my waist, pulling me close to his body, keeping his eyes on the notes in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI found it!\u201d Jason popped out from the door to our right and stopped dead when he saw me. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason.\u201d I nodded politely.</p><p>\u201cHi. Um...what brings you down here?\u201d He walked over and laid a scroll out in front of David, but his whole body was kind of stiff, tiny particles of tension clinging to every inch of his skin\u2019s surface.</p><p>\u201cWoke up alone, went to get something to read, heard laughing, thought I\u2019d investigate.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at me, eyeing David carefully after to see if he noticed. \u201cDid David fill you in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d David pointed to a page of indecipherable scribble, made less visible in the flickering candlelight. \u201cWe found out more about Morgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I turned the corner of the page, leaning over it as if I could actually read that language. \u201cAnd . . . what does it say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a birth record. See?\u201d His finger moved along the page, marking the words. \u201cMorgana LeFay. Born on the Sabbath day to Lilith of Loslilian and Lord Callon LeFay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeFay? But . . . I thought Christian, Lilith\u2019s first husband, was the father of Morgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently, we were misinformed.\u201d He stood back from leaning over the table. \u201cAra? Do you know who Lord LeFay was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a very powerful witch,\u201d his voice pitched in an interested tone on the last word.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him being a witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, but it explains why Morgana never survived.\u201d</p><p>I groaned, rolling my eyes. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitches are mortals,\u201d Jason explained, handing me a piece of paper. I unrolled it and the face of a stern-looking man stared back up at me in lines of grey and black, his long hair framing his face, falling around a frilly collar. \u201cAccording to Natural Law, those with the Power of the Earth cannot be immortal. Any who\u2019ve attempted spells or rituals to prolong life have met consistently with severe and often hellish consequences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d David cut in. \u201cSo, what would happen to a child conceived of a mortal witch and an immortal vampire?\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows slid across my forehead, nearly meeting in the middle. \u201cSo you think Morgana died before her body made the change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d bet my life on it,\u201d David said, and Jason and I both looked up at him quickly. \u201cWhat?\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cDistasteful, David,\u201d I said, laying the picture of Lord LeFay down.</p><p>David, having realised he just made a pun about his own, now inevitable demise, laughed softly to himself and started rolling scrolls.</p><p>I let myself digest this information, thinking about so many random other bits all at once, that when two of them crashed together, a conclusion sparked. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s not dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d David said, tying a ribbon around an old, yellowing scroll.</p><p>\u201cI mean, what if she lived? What if she couldn\u2019t be immortal but maybe aged at a slower rate than a human?\u201d</p><p>Jason and David exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cHow old would she be if she were actually alive today?\u201d I finished.</p><p>David scratched his nose, bending down a little to lean his elbow on the chair back. \u201cWhy, Ara? What\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>I held my smile for a minute. \u201cWhat if she\u2019s Drake\u2019s witch\u2014the one you know as Safia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of Safia?\u201d Jason practically gasped.</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I looked up at David, not sure if I was allowed to say anything. \u201cArthur told me.\u201d</p><p>David turned at the shoulder to look at Jason.</p><p>\u201cAra, did Arthur say if he\u2019d ever actually seen Safia?\u201d Jase asked in tone soft enough for a child.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cAll he said was that she\u2019s very old and very powerful, and that he wanted to get his hands on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s real?\u201d Jason looked at David.</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem,\u201d David said, playing it like he and Arthur had never discussed such things.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal if she is real?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only heard rumours of the Great Witch Safia Demente. But, none were good,\u201d Jason said. \u201cSome say she conjured curses and plagues, killed babies\u2014that she corrupted and influenced the church back in the days before Christ, and there have been rumours that she can change form and become something else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a snake?\u201d I asked, remembering my Walk of Faith.</p><p>\u201cAny creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . she\u2019s Drake\u2019s prisoner, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd...is that bad news for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s bad news for any vampire\u2014even Drake\u2014if he gets on the wrong side of her,\u201d Jason said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHer mere existence is bad for the entire human race, Ara,\u201d David added. \u201cShe\u2019s unnaturally old\u2014been around longer than us.\u201d He motioned between himself and Jason.</p><p>\u201cAnd, rumour has it, as hideous as a millennium-old steak sandwich,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cWhich is a perfect example of what happens to witches when they meddle in the natural order of things,\u201d David said.</p> <p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aside from being so old her skin is as thin as paper, her soul is also demented from the inside out, like rotting fruit, Ara,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cWitchcraft eats the body and the soul when used for dark purposes,\u201d David finished. \u201cBut she is much too old to have once been the child Morgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, there goes that theory.\u201d I moved my shoulders in a noncommittal gesture. \u201cSo . . . if her soul is so rotten and dark, what would happen if she sanctioned herself a youthful, immortal body to occupy?\u201d</p><p>David went stiff, growing taller, his hands stopping short of the scrolls they were about to grab.</p> <p>\u201cI knew it,\u201d Jason said. \u201cYou two know more than you\u2019re letting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen it\u2019s your concern, brother, I will include you.\u201d</p><p>I slapped David\u2019s arm. \u201cBe nice. Jason can know if he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Safia won\u2019t get the chance to insert herself into our child. Here.\u201d He handed a pile of scrolls to Jason. \u201cPut these away.\u201d</p><p>Jason just groaned, grabbing another stack of paper off the lamp table as he walked away.</p><p>When the storage room door closed behind him with a high squeak, David turned to me. \u201cAra, for Safia to insert a soul into a living being, she would need to untether the one already in place\u2014something that can only be done with the Dagger of Yahanna. Once I use it on Drake, its power will die with him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd with you.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed my brow, closing his eyes. \u201cGive me an alternative, my love, and I\u2019d take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, we could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA real alternative,\u201d he said sharply and walked away, not noticing Jason behind him until they bumped shoulders. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and closed the storage room door gently behind him.</p><p>Jason walked toward me, his steps graceful and light as the wind, and leaned against the table, folding his arms. \u201cDon\u2019t keep pressing him about jure uxoris, Ara,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019ll never agree to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why do you keep bringing it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019m just hoping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo yourself a favour\u2014\u201d We both looked over at David through the windows, rummaging around in the storage area. \u201cStop hoping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, standing up again. \u201cHe\u2019s worried about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows how bad you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I said, smiling. \u201cMaybe he\u2019ll stay then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said casually, packing away scrolls. \u201cHe won\u2019t. He\u2019ll just go to his death with the burden of your aching soul on his.\u201d</p><p>My arms dropped to my sides, but I plastered a smile on as David came back in.</p><p>\u201cWe good?\u201d he said to Jason, laying his hand on my arm.</p><p>\u201cYup. I\u2019ll finish up with these and lock the door on my way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, bro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d Jase waved and headed into the storage room, leaving us alone in the total silence. The seconds-hand on David\u2019s watch ticked, keeping time to the beat of my heart, offering the comfort of noise in a completely wordless moment. I held my thoughts back from David, and he did the same with his own.</p><p>When he realised I was practically paralysed, unable to speak for fear of saying something he didn\u2019t want to hear, he slid his touch down my arm and scooped up my hand. \u201cBed?\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his fingertips, deciding right then that any pain I felt for losing him had to be felt alone. This was hard enough for David without me adding my broken heart to it. \u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t wanna sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat shall we do then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUuum, well, I have a few things I want to try out before my only company is a cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cat?\u201d David looked utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I started walking. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect me to get married again once you\u2019re gone, do you?\u201d</p><p>He stayed behind for a second, but a burly laugh broke the silence in the room. It seemed like forever since I\u2019d heard him laugh in such a carefree way, maybe even as far back as our last day by the lake. \u201cRight. Well, in that case,\u201d he said, stepping up to take my hand again. \u201cThere are a few things I\u2019ve always wanted to do to you, mon amour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d I closed my eyes, feeling the tingle of his words. \u201cSpeak French to me, and you can do whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and whispered something in my ear, and I didn\u2019t care what it was, didn\u2019t care that the squeeze of his hand on the small of my back sent a thousand hot ideas into my mind because, whatever he said, it was definitely not in English.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>We stood against each other, arms by our sides, the backs of our fingers touching only by the finest hairs between them. We were like two individual flames meeting before blending as one\u2014the heat intense but our skin immune, our bodies two, but our souls completely intertwined.</p><p>My cotton nightdress felt like air along my craving skin\u2014like a breath I wanted to exhale so I could feel the closeness of David\u2019s soon-to-be naked body against mine. We both knew what we were about to do wasn\u2019t just for the sake of being close or fulfilling primal needs: it went much deeper than that. The first time we ever made love with the hope we might fall pregnant, I was scared and unsure that\u2019s what I really wanted. And every time after that I\u2019d either been afraid it wouldn\u2019t happen, or afraid that, if it did, it\u2019d mean losing him.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d David asked softly into the crown of my head, his warm breath forcing my eyes closed.</p><p>I laid a hand across my belly, shaking slightly.</p><p>\u201cMy love?\u201d He lifted my chin. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>It had all changed. Every reason I ever had for wanting to make love to him had changed. I could finally hope it would bring the blessing of a little girl, and I wasn\u2019t scared, not about anything, not about being a young mom. Not about going it alone, without David. I wasn\u2019t even scared that I\u2019d mess it all up and fail as a parent.</p><p>I opened my eyes and smiled, melting the concern in his. \u201cI can imagine it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cImagine her?\u201d His hand cupped mine.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can finally imagine what she\u2019ll be like.\u201d</p><p>His hand moved from my belly to wipe a tear from my cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s not imagine anymore, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m afraid, though, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d His green eyes searched mine, so intense with depth and wisdom and strength that I felt silly for feeling fear when I should be thinking of nothing else but this moment. I was afraid it wouldn\u2019t happen, though\u2014afraid our baby wasn\u2019t possible, no matter what we did. But something in his eyes just made it all okay, like he\u2019d take care of it. Like nothing was impossible while I had him.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes,\u201d he whispered in my ear, guiding my hand onto his heart. \u201cLet me make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you let it last for forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t promise you forever, Ara. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen at least make it last until the dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat,\u201d he said with a slowly shaping grin. \u201cI can promise.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back a little and took all of him in: he looked magnificent as king, as if he\u2019d grown an inch taller since he was sworn in and maybe even jumped a few points on the sex-appeal-o-meter. The stubble tracing his jawline had grown in over the day, shadowing his face like immortality\u2019s version of a Calvin Klein model. The white shirt he was wearing had been sewn from a fabric so soft it was almost a part of his body, falling over the contours of his chest like skin, leaving all the warmth on the surface as if he were naked already. I felt him under my hand, his chest moulding the cup of palm, the shirt parting at the buttons, inviting my fingertips inside.</p><p>David smoothed the tip of his thumb from just under my earlobe and down my throat, his lips softly pushing my nightdress off my shoulder a little. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe how well I know every inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Gravity drew the fabric down the step he hadn\u2019t, and my skin fell open to the warm summer night as the top of the dress bunched around my elbows, leaving everything from my hips upward exposed and tingling slightly with little bumps. Both his hands trailed firmly down my back, following its shape like a hand tracing a distant skyline of smooth rolling hills. I held my breath, afraid to breathe a moment of this realness. My hand sat against his chest, his body solid and alive beneath it, yet my mind floated along the memory of the first time I saw him smile\u2014the gentle half-turn of his lip, the way he\u2019d hide the thoughts he could hear, trying so hard not to give anything away about how they made him feel. I saw him as that boy I sat beside at the piano on my first day of school, felt the ache rise from my gut to my chest, knowing I could never go back. All that was gone. And those memories were all I\u2019d have left soon, never to make any more.</p><p>When I looked up, the hold of his round, black eyes on mine nearly burned a hole in me, his tears clouding them, so restrained I just wanted to cry for him. But he blinked and they slipped past his lashes, falling eternally away to the land of forgotten things. In this moment, we were here, alive, and one day, he\u2019d be gone. I\u2019d stand here in this memory, touching the air as if I could feel him there, but I\u2019d only be able to imagine what it felt like once to know his warmth, to feel the way his hands moved over my body in ways I couldn\u2019t even dream up. And I knew he felt every breath of my pain as he read the thoughts that provoked it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never be far away, Ara.\u201d He drew me closer by the small of my back, and as my hands dropped to my sides, the nightgown slipped past, falling at our feet. \u201cI\u2019ll leave a part of myself behind in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd every time I look at her, I\u2019ll die a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t.\u201d He kissed my hair. \u201cYou\u2019ll know what it feels like to love again.\u201d</p><p>I stood on my toes, reaching up to cup my hands behind his neck, our lips connecting a breath later. But the kiss only broke my heart\u2014the supple warmth of his lips, so lovingly wrapped up in mine, were so exquisite in their hold that the only emotion they could possibly convey was love: unending, unconditional love. The kind of love I would never have again.</p><p>I angled my chin so I could feel the slight prickle of his stubble, a feeling that always made him real, present\u2014one I could always find when I closed my eyes, even if he wasn\u2019t here. Every breath of that kiss would become a moment locked away\u2014stored for the day it would only be something I opened at night, when I lay in bed with my eyes closed\u2014our forever lived in a series of events that already happened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut we have tonight,\u201d he said, waking me from my thought with a firm hand cupping my cheek. \u201cMy love, don\u2019t go there. Just be here, in this moment, with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p> <p>David\u2019s hands went under my bottom, prompting me to jump up and wrap my legs around his hips. He carried me slowly to the bed, falling down on top of me; the sheets and pillows rising up like clouds around us. I felt the softness of them under my bare skin, each tiny inch tingling as if this was the first touch. And David\u2019s mouth found mine again, the sweet kisses growing with the desire heating his blood, his hand folding around my breast, smoothing a path for his lips to follow.</p><p>\u201cThere are so many things we\u2019ve never done,\u201d he said under the kiss. \u201cSo many I planned to do right now, but\u2014\u201d He leaned back and smiled down at me. \u201cTonight, I think I just wanna love you.\u201d</p><p>Those words rushed into my heart, taking the thoughts and desires he showed me earlier, and tossing them aside. All I wanted now was to feel his bare chest pressed to mine, his hands on my hips, our bodies connected closer than humanly, or immortally possible.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I guided him gently backward and rolled onto my knees, sweeping his shirt up his waist. \u201cThen we need you naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou read my mind.\u201d He tossed his shirt aside and brought his arms back down to his sides\u2014his ribs expanding, showing the skeleton beneath.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so thin now, David.\u201d I cupped his ribs with both hands and kissed the hollow between his breastbones.</p><p>\u201cThat happens when you\u2019re stressed about leaving the love of your life.\u201d</p><p>I stopped kissing and just rested my brow against his soft belly for a moment, feeling my hair sweep off my face under David\u2019s fingertips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sad, my love. Remember? Tonight isn\u2019t about the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to ignore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I heard a smile shape his words. \u201cI think I can take your mind off it.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed breathily and, with tears wetting my lips, began my important task of kissing every inch of his skin from his ribs to his jeans again. As I reached his belly button, he drew his stomach in, trying not laugh. \u201cDoes that tickle?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but don\u2019t stop.\u201d He smoothed both thumbs down my head, resting his fingertips gently to the base of my skull, and I felt him grow harder near my throat\u2014pushing against the zipper of his jeans.</p><p>I could smell him, almost taste him\u2014the sweet chocolate mixed with the familiar but very slight scent of the day\u2019s sweat. He\u2019d never let me get this close before, never opened himself up this way. It was as if there were no walls between us now; we were finally free to explore all those things we\u2019d been afraid to share. He\u2019d even stopped waxing all his hair off, his chest now sprouting a few hairs around his nipples\u2014my tongue noticing the fine trail from his navel downward.</p><p>I pinched the top of his zipper then and slid it down, rolling the waist of his jeans and briefs past his hips, seeing the head of his penis grow as my fingertips brushed past it. And my blood boiled with a naughty idea.</p><p>\u201cI can see what you\u2019re thinking, my love.\u201d He stopped me.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what it feels like,\u201d I said, half suggesting, half asking.</p><p>\u201cAra, you know how I feel about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I looked at the patch of dark hair below his V of muscles. \u201cBut I just want to try it, just once.\u201d</p> <p>The thoughts in his mind flickered like a broken light for a second, finally deciding that it was better if I satisfied my curiosity with him than with another man after he was gone. \u201cOkay.\u201d He exhaled, and tangled his fingers in my hair, guiding my mouth toward him.</p><p>I had no idea what to actually do, and wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect, either, but as I delicately wrapped my fingers around him, following his length to the base, I was no longer afraid I\u2019d do it wrong. None of it mattered. There was no self-consciousness here. Not between us. We were in love. We were married, and if I wasn\u2019t perfect, it just didn\u2019t matter anymore. I knew he\u2019d love me anyway.</p><p>I wet my lips and guided him closer, closing my mouth around him as he let out a quiet gasp.</p><p>His hands shook against my head, his thighs clenching to hold himself up on the squishy bed, and my naked skin tightened with bumps, cooled by the air from his nose, the draught deeper, stronger each time my tongue made circles.</p><p>\u201cThat. Feels\u2014\u201d He drew tight breaths through his teeth. \u201cAmazing.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders relaxed a little then, and as I moved my grip down the length of him, I felt him grow harder\u2014the salty liquid thickening slightly under my tongue.</p><p>\u201cAw, Ara.\u201d His hips pressed closer to my face, his hand cupping the back of my head as he went deeper into my mouth, stopping where my tongue blocked my throat. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can take anymore,\u201d he said, and slowly eased himself from my mouth, leaning down to kiss me softly after. \u201cThat felt way too good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I straightened my spine to meet him face to face, and leaned back a bit, sliding my tongue across the moisture left behind.</p><p>He nodded, gently moving me backward on the bed. And I saw the thoughts in his mind then\u2014saw him imagine sweeping me down onto my back and sliding my underwear off, tossing them across the room\u2014both of us laughing as he pictured them landing on the lampshade. \u201cLay back so I can taste you,\u201d he ordered sweetly.</p><p>I tucked my thumbs into my undies and slid them off as I landed on my back, parting my legs for him.</p><p>But his eyes moved to my belly instead, his hands flowing swiftly to land under his gaze, stopping there for a second. \u201cI\u2019m going to do this right for once, Ara, and we\u2019re gonna have a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel that, too,\u201d I said. \u201cI think this time it\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed my stomach, pressing his lips firmly into the skin just above my pubic bone. I held onto him, winding my fingertips through his hair.</p><p>\u201cGod, your scent is so familiar,\u201d he said in that deep, David-y tone, moving his lips down a few inches, stealing my breath as his tongue parted the hairs in one long sweep upward. \u201cAnd you taste so lovely I could kiss you here for hours.\u201d</p><p>My whole body shivered, my legs spreading wider than I knew they could. I felt his finger slide in and brush a part that sent the shiver deeper, expanding the muscles inside me. I could smell it\u2014the scent of sex and desire, like a cloud of heat in the dying summer air around us. And as I drew a breath, committing it to memory, felt it suddenly on my lips, tasted it on my tongue under David\u2019s mouth against mine. It didn\u2019t really have much of a taste, or maybe I just didn\u2019t notice it, but it left my mind as soon as it entered, because David gently guided himself inside me, filling my body with the hardness that had been in my mouth only minutes ago.</p><p>I wrapped my legs around his hips, digging my fingertips into the skin on his back, bunching it up tightly\u2014my own little handful of David. For once, I owned this moment\u2014owned the love, the energy, the truth finally between us. All the lies, all the secrets had come undone, and all that was left was his love for me, and mine for him. I didn\u2019t need to guard my thoughts. I didn\u2019t feel angry or resentful to him for keeping things from me. I felt closer to him than I ever had before, and I, finally, closed my eyes and prayed to the gods to bless us\u2014bless this moment with a little baby girl.</p><p>The past was coming undone with each breath he took, each movement against me. None of it mattered anymore. Everything we\u2019d done to hurt each other was no longer important, because all that mattered right now, in this moment, was life.</p><p>I came back down to earth, and David smiled his secret smile, seeing me suddenly faze back in.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you go?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see?\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands under my bottom and guided my hips closer to his, driving himself gently and slowly inside me, as if he didn\u2019t ever want this to end. \u201cI can never see your thoughts when you do that\u2014when you faze out. It\u2019s like you\u2019re not even in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe another out of body experience?\u201d I suggested, making a little squeak at the end as he hit a very sensitive spot.</p><p>He laughed, his lovely teeth showing, taking me back to our first date at Betty\u2019s for a second. \u201cI think this is really more of an out-of-this-world experience.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my legs tighter around him where they\u2019d slipped with the sweat. I didn\u2019t care how hot and sticky we were, though. It was his sweat and my sweat, and I just wanted him, all of him, to be all over me.</p><p>\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna need a change of sheets,\u201d he noted, looking at the bed under me.</p><p>\u201cI dunno\u2014\u201d I twisted my shoulder to the right and pressed my hand to his rib, shoving him down on the bed\u2014flipping myself around so I came to rest with my legs either side of his hips. I felt him go deeper inside me in this position, saw the shock in his eyes as he studied my naked body on top of his. \u201cI think I like the idea of sleeping in a puddle of our own love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I think I like you on top.\u201d He reached for my breast, and I grabbed his wrist, guiding it gently above his head, sliding both my hands up his and linking our fingers. The world moved with the rhythm I decided\u2014a slow beat, each swing of my hips, each time I took him deeper inside me, like the roll of a wave on the shore, lap by lap, and I owned him. He lifted his hips to meet mine in the middle, closing his eyes as he set his pace to mine, enjoying me, enjoying my body.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t just lay back and let me have full control. I knew that. I could feel the burn to govern this rising up in his hands like electricity. He broke free of my grip and cupped my waist, moving me to his own pace, much faster and a little harder than before.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, noticing something odd in his gaze. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>The sharp smile made his eyes small, his head moving side to side for a second. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty darn hot when you\u2019re being seductive, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d I leaned forward and placed both hands on his chest, pushing down slightly so my hips rose off his\u2014the warmth there going cool.</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d He flipped me through the air and landed on top of me, wrapping both my legs tightly around his hips. \u201cI much prefer creative control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCreative control?\u201d I said, a brow arching.</p><p>He smiled down at my nakedness, shrugging one shoulder after. \u201cOr maybe just control.\u201d</p><p>A rush of excitement filled my gut. I kinda liked that, too. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t start tying me up.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed into cheeky slits. \u201cIf I did, you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I would,\u201d I said playfully, learning something new about myself then: I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d want to stop him. \u201cI could just say no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He moved closer and pressed his lips to mine in a long, very slow and very wet kiss. \u201cNot if I gag you.\u201d</p><p>I went to say something witty, but couldn\u2019t help laughing instead.</p><p>\u201cMmm, don\u2019t do that.\u201d He leaned back a bit, closing his eyes, moving inside me again. \u201cYou know how much that giggle stirs my inner vampire.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you know how much your inner vampire turns me on.\u201d I accompanied my statement with a quick flick of my nail down his chest, making him bleed.</p><p>His chin rolled so his gaze settled on the cut. \u201cPerhaps I will have to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>My insides tightened. \u201cI dare you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He was too shocked to actually do it, though. He just closed his mouth, keeping a tight smile there, and ran his hand firmly down my arm, cupping my wrist and pinning it to the bed by my hip. \u201cI swore I\u2019d never be that way with you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that kind of thing is not for you. It\u2019s for whores.\u201d</p><p>I huffed. \u201cWhores?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d He brought my wrist up above my head, his hand wrapping it so tight the blood filled my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you holding me like that?\u201d</p><p>His fingers loosened. \u201cLook, I love you, Ara. And no matter how much I want to, I would never do anything disrespectful to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I like that kind of disrespect.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed, and the sweet warmth of his breath brushed over my lashes, flavouring my tongue a little with orange chocolate. \u201cYes, I think you\u2019ve always been a bit twisted, my love. Perhaps it\u2019s all the torture you suffered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s your excuse?\u201d I said, and he stopped pumping. \u201cYou clearly want to do those things to me.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m just mentally deranged from years of inflicting heinous punishments on the stripped and restrained bodies of lawbreakers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s okay for you to be twisted, but not me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, because you are my sweet, pure-souled little wife, Ara. And I won\u2019t taint you the way I\u2019ve been tainted.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, sending my incredulous smile across the room, away from him. \u201cI\u2019m not as pure as you think I am.\u201d</p><p>He cupped both my cheeks and kissed my lips once. \u201cI\u2019m going to die soon, Ara. Let me go peacefully to my death with the notion that my involvement in your life hasn\u2019t ruined you, please.\u201d</p><p>I laid both hands above my head, crossing my wrists like they were bound; my body long and open to all he wanted from me. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll just have to stick around until I\u2019m all sweet and innocent again then.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and caged both my hands in one of his. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be sorry you did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to spank me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, smiling playfully.</p><p>\u201cOkay, but remember, you asked for it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cI can take whatever you can dish out.\u201d</p><p>He bit his lip, his fang making a deep impression in the skin, and reached down, leaving a gentle but sharp sting across the firmest part of my thigh, almost on my bottom.</p><p>I jumped a little, my leg tightening, but the rush of heat only tingled, making my skin want more. \u201cThat didn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to hurt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen you up\u2014take something from you that you wouldn\u2019t give to anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cControl. Permission to hurt you.\u201d He paused, letting the words simmer through me. \u201cThe right to do whatever I want with the trust that I\u2019ll draw the line before it gets too much. The feeling of opening up\u2014experiencing something we normally run from\u2014in a completely open, completely vulnerable situation.\u201d</p><p>I thought about the emotions that little smack stirred in me, seeing myself tense and flinch as the pain flared, my soul suddenly connecting with him after the sting dissolved. \u201cYou do realise you\u2019re tainting me right now.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips and ran his thumb slowly up my chin, pulling my mouth apart. \u201cMaybe that was always inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs was the hurt,\u201d I said sadly.</p><p>His hand rested over my breast, his fingers pressing firmly to feel my heart. \u201cI know you\u2019re suffering, Ara. But I will leave you with a child, at least. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, placing my hand over his. \u201cThen you better make love to me, David. I don\u2019t want our child conceived while you\u2019re spanking me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, falling on his elbows, his silky, naked body completely touching mine, and brought his hand up to sweep my sweaty hair off my brow. \u201cLook at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said self-consciously.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up so much, Ara, but you\u2019ll always be that sweet girl I fell in love with on the football field at school.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at his perfect dark pink lips, then at the long lashes surrounding those emerald eyes, and I could still see so much of the boy he would always be to me\u2014the sweet, funny, carefree guy I sometimes missed. But that was fading\u2014washing away to reveal the man inside me right now. My king. My husband. Strong. A fighter. A man willing to die, willing to do anything to see that I never went a day again in my life looking over my shoulder. And his face changed then, his body moving faster against mine, his eyes turning dark and black as he reached the point of no return, becoming the man who would one day be the father my daughter never knew.</p><p>I held back my cries, the lusted breath of ecstasy, the tears and the rage, and just wrapped him up tight in my arms, feeling him release his life force into my body, spreading hope and light throughout. I didn\u2019t want to orgasm. I didn\u2019t want to feel the pleasure of the moment; I just wanted to remember what it felt like to hold him this way\u2014to love him with all my heart\u2014no other distractions in the world. So I drove my fingers into his hair, his shoulder pressing my jaw with the closeness, his body so heavy I couldn't breathe, and just held him tighter\u2014the muscles in my arms flexed and rigid to keep him close. I\u2019d never let him pull away. He was everything to me, just as I was everything to him, and we held each other as this truth rained through our tired, sweaty bodies, relaxing us down through the scales of exhaustion, breath by breath.</p><p>He rested his weight on top of me, his elbows propping him up, and stroked my hair behind my ear a few times, taking in all of me\u2014taking in my smile, my eyes, my scent, my skin, the wetness, the heat, the breathlessness. We laid that way, David going soft inside me, connected and unwilling to part, wordless but speaking volumes in silence, until we both turned our heads and watched the glimmer of red sunlight kiss the horizon on the far side of the world.</p><p>I felt the presence of the hunter behind me, his eagle eye anticipating my every move. But he couldn\u2019t read my mind, thank goodness, which meant he could only guess what I was about to do.</p><p>Ever since that cursed day I fell off the lighthouse, Mike had slowly and surely managed to get his own way again and have guards all over the manor. It was downright annoying. Especially since the business I had to attend was not for Falcon\u2019s ears, nor was it for the four men standing guard between the windows on every corridor and on every door of the manor. They were sworn to absolute secrecy about any and all private business that occurred, but I still didn\u2019t trust them.</p><p>My red summer dress, so fitting for such a devilish mission, reflected the morning light back against the white walls to my right, making them pink, and my shadow danced beside me, flickering and dipping, lengthening over Arthur\u2019s door then wrapping the corner to the stairwell before I reached it. I glanced back inconspicuously to check Falcon\u2019s shadow, then turned the corner and headed down the stairs, taking a very quick right on the second floor, my fast feet putting sudden and great distance between my guard and I.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he called quietly, careful not to disturb any manor guests. But he\u2019d never find me. I closed Jason\u2019s door so slowly that the only sound it made as it clipped gently into place had no more volume than the back being snapped fast on an earring.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d he tried again, his voice drifting toward the wrong end of the manor. He knew he\u2019d been given the slip, and I\u2019d been caught giving him the slip enough that knew I had very little time before he picked up my scent and followed me here. Except, by the time he figured it out, I\u2019d be long gone, leaving him with nothing but the burning question on his mind as he\u2019d scratch his head, muttering, Where the hell did she go?</p><p>Before executing my \u2018Houdini\u2019 escape, though, I took a moment to look around the small space. Unlike the other rooms in the manor, this was undersized by the plaster wall hiding the secret room beside it but, despite the lack of space, still overflowed with Jason\u2019s personality. It was set out much the same as Arthur\u2019s room: a redwood canopy bed to the left, swathed in rich auburn blankets and pillows; a fireplace between two windows, except Jase only had one window, and a long oak table across from the foot of the bed. But, unlike Arthur\u2019s room, Jase\u2019s was painted blue between the white panels on the walls, and instead of plants and books about plants, his shelves were stuffed to overflowing with novels and comic books. His baseball cap sat on the tall drawers between the window and his bed, a pile of books stacked on the floor beside it, almost as high as the ledge, clearly used as some kind of footstool while he sat there in the nook, reading, and a small cluster of clothes littered the blanket box. It was exactly as I\u2019d imagine it should be.</p><p>I walked over to the oak table and spread the collection of papers aside to see what he\u2019d been doing. Several cartoon sketches of dragons, and girls with big eyes and long, blue hair, stared back up at me. I knew he was talented, but most people I\u2019d met that could draw were good at either real-life or cartoon. Not both. Jase was clearly just too talented.</p><p>I picked up a picture and ran my fingers over the lines of a dog\u2019s face and the speech bubble above its head, moving my touch then to the cursive signature on the bottom right corner. I\u2019d never really paid much attention to his handwriting, but it did say a lot about him\u2014each long, smooth stroke of the pen tip over the page that led to the tall then rounded lines of the J and the O, shorter, more decisive strokes on the A and the N, and the S almost non-existent. He never really owned his name. I knew that. It was a name given to him by his father because it was against the law not to name a child. David told me their father had flipped through the paper until he found the front page news about a cad named Jason Fruge, a rat of a man that rained devastation on their town, selling high-interest loans to the already poor and destitute then taking their homes when they couldn\u2019t pay. And Jason saw this name as a role he\u2019d one day live up to: a sign, a signature, that illustrated everything impure and childish and dishonest about this offcut of a boy. But all I saw was a strong warrior with a heart so big and so kind it allowed the innocence of boyhood to shine through, despite everything he\u2019d done or suffered. I would never believe he was the \u2018leftovers\u2019 of centuries of evil being drained from one bloodline, not for as long as I\u2019d live. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I placed the page back down and hugged myself. This room and everything in it held a certain amount of personality that Jason didn\u2019t carry with him out in the real world, and it smelled like him, so rich with everything that made me love him, that I walked toward the secret door to Eve\u2019s room with a bit more of a brisk stride than I intended.</p><p>If I could have avoided coming this way, I would have. But the secret passage from my room was off limits while David was in there, awake. He\u2019d hear it the second it opened, and I didn\u2019t have all day to wait for him to finish reading his book. Once his mind was set on a few hours of relaxation, he would do exactly that. And, unfortunately for me, the secret room was the only way I could escape Falcon. It wasn\u2019t like I could just close my bedroom door, wander down the corridor to find Morgaine and have a chat with her. Falcon would overhear, then tell Mike what I\u2019d said, and then it\u2019d all get back David, who\u2019d be mad at me for talking to Morgaine in the first place, since he clearly had some underlying reason he didn\u2019t want me to. Unfortunately for him, though, I wasn\u2019t quite as naive and trusting as I had been a few weeks ago.</p><p>I pushed the panel to Eve\u2019s room so the door popped open, then tiptoed inside, closing the portal behind me. The room was dark and undisturbed, still stale from the last conversation that was held in here. I could almost feel the tension and confusion lingering within the very air I was breathing. It seemed nothing in here was ever affected by time, not even memories.</p> <p>I shook it off and walked across the room to the bookshelf disguising a secret door that led down a stairwell and into a tunnel that would take me to the small Lilithian village, Lamia, on the other side of the island. From there, I\u2019d be able to speedily run back here and seek out Morgaine\u2014free from a certain giant Mike-alike. Sure, it was a great length to go to, but this was Falcon I was running from\u2014not Quaid. It took great lengths just to stop him hearing me take a pee in the bathroom every day.</p><p>Dust gathered under my fingertips as I traced the spines of the old books, feeling for the loose one. When I pulled back on it, though, it shifted downward, but the secret door didn\u2019t open. I pulled again and again, finally giving up with a little groan. Clearly, it would take greater lengths to escape Falcon than I realised. The door was sealed in place, like it was unlatched or the connection had just disintegrated over time.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d I huffed, looking down at my summery dress. The only option left now was to jump from the window, and hope no one saw me do it.</p><p>I quietly unhitched the wooden panel from the loose nail over the window and laid it to the ground, peering out through the glass. The coast was clear, but the distance from here to my clear coast was a pretty big drop. Had I been better at math, I might have even been able to guess exactly how far it was, but it didn\u2019t matter. I had to jump because I just had to talk to Morgaine. So, here I sat, butt on the window ledge, feet dangling over the second story drop, taking a mouthful of air to give me courage.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a vampire, Ara. Just jump,\u201d I told myself.</p> <p>Myself didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll throw you.\u201d And as I was about to slip easily off the ledge and drop to a graceful landing, the air wrapped my feet and legs and hands, and came out of my gob in a long scream. The ground rose up too fast\u2014way too fast for me to calculate the angle of my feet against the speed of attack.</p><p>I covered my eyes, readying myself for the impact, when a neck-twisting jolt sent shockwaves through my bones, a large pair of hands wrapping my ribs and falling under my knees before the ground smacked my hiney.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Ara,\u201d Falcon growled, placing me gently on the ground.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d I gasped, pulling my dress down to cover my undies.</p><p>\u201cNever mind that.\u201d He stepped back and rubbed his head, cursing under his breath. \u201cYou scared the living hell out of me. What were you thinking?\u201d</p> <p>I looked up at the window, and the wavering ghost of Eve smiled down at me, covering her mouth. \u201cI . . . I was trying to escape you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should know better than that by now, Ara.\u201d He straightened up, rolling his shoulders back. \u201cI mean, Your Majesty.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to rush in all white-knighty and save me. I would have been okay if I\u2019d hit the ground, Falcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And if I\u2019d given you about two more seconds, you would have corrected the fall, but I wasn\u2019t willing to risk it.\u201d He rubbed his hand firmly across his heart. \u201cNo offence, but if you\u2019re gonna turn yourself into royal stew, do it on someone else\u2019s watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think someone pushed me.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at the window, taking a quick step forward. \u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>Eve pressed her finger to her lip.</p><p>\u201cNo one.\u201d I looked back at Falcon. \u201cI\u2019m stupid. I just fell, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said, issuing me one raised brow. \u201cI follow you for eight hours every day of your life. You\u2019re not stupid. And you didn\u2019t fall. So don\u2019t try to play dumb with me. Who pushed you?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. He\u2019d never believe me.</p><p>\u201cEve?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>My mouth fell open below wide eyes, and when my head whipped up to the second floor window, Eve was gone. \u201cYou saw her?\u201d</p><p>His gaze slowly came back down to mine. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you talking to thin air\u2014heard you say her name.\u201d</p><p>And a sudden rush of panic flooded me. \u201cFalcon, you can\u2019t say anything to Da\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d He held up his hand, stopping me right there. \u201cEverything you do, say, or see, is privileged information, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not to Mike. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the one I report to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . .\u201d I stood a little taller. \u201cWho is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m acting Head of Queen\u2019s Guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded once. \u201cThey report to me now.\u201d</p><p>I couldn't believe my ears. \u201cWhy did Mike put you in charge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he has other things to do\u2014more important than worrying about what you\u2019re doing. He has an entire Knight\u2019s Core to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d I placed my hand on my brow, blowing a puff of air out through one corner of my mouth. \u201cThat is messing with my head.\u201d</p><p>Falcon laughed. \u201cWell, it\u2019s how things are now. And if you ever\u2014\u201d He held one finger up in emphasis, \u201c\u2014attempt an escape like that again, I will quit my job and put Mike back in charge. Got it?\u201d</p><p>I saluted. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Now.\u201d He grabbed me very gently by the arm and led me into the shadows closer to the manor. \u201cWhere were you going, and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath and let it out slowly. It amazed me how much he was like Mike, with his sandy blond hair, his bulky frame, his warm eyes that were quite smiley when he wasn\u2019t looking at me, and the sternness that afforded him command of the room without solicitation. \u201cCan you give me a chance?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cA chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. A chance, Ara.\u201d He stepped closer to make his point. \u201cI\u2019m a member of your personal council. I\u2019m your bodyguard and the one man responsible for your overall safety. I\u2019m trusted by both your husband and, more importantly, your overly-protective best friend.\u201d We both chuckled softly. \u201cIf Mike can trust me, maybe you can give me a chance, Ara. Because in order for me to keep you safe, I need to be sure you won\u2019t try to run off on me when you have something you want to do but don\u2019t think I\u2019ll approve of. So. . .\u201d He took another long breath. \u201cLet me earn your trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of security, Falcon, to do with information I\u2019ve learned\u2014from David,\u201d I added so he didn\u2019t think I was being easily led. \u201cAnd he asked me not to let anyone know, not even the council.\u201d</p><p>Falcon nodded, taking a step back. \u201cI respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d I said, waiting for the \u2018but.\u2019</p><p>\u201cNo buts.\u201d He raised both hands. \u201cIf you have good reason not to tell me, then just tell me that, Ara. Just tell me you need to take care of some business, and I\u2019ll back off for an hour or so. Okay?\u201d</p><p>My face went blank. I could feel it. \u201cAre you being serious right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running the show here, Ara.\u201d He presented the proverbial show. \u201cMike might not have trusted you before, but I trust you. I think you\u2019re a very smart girl, and I think you have grown up monumentally in the last two months, and if you say you need privacy for a bit, then I respect that.\u201d</p><p>I just wanted to hug him. I nodded once instead, reminding myself that knights are not friends. \u201cThank you, Falcon.\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head, placing both hands behind his back. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d</p><p>I left Falcon in the garden and followed \u2018last sighting\u2019 reports from bystanders until I found my wrath-recipient wandering down an empty corridor in the servant quarters. There was no one around at this time of day so, despite the sub-level of the manor not exactly being a cone of silence, it seemed like as good a place as any to bark my fury on the unsuspecting target.</p><p>\u201cMorgaine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me.\u201d</p><p>She watched me walk toward her, growing slightly taller. \u201cI did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Immortal Damned\u2014the prophecy, which is really a contract. And worse, your lies, David\u2019s lies\u2014all of them have gone so deep you\u2019ve had to convince the entire Lilithian public of the same.\u201d I stopped in front of her, closing the door beside me to block out the white light spilling into the hall. \u201cWhat are you hiding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything, Majesty, and neither is David.\u201d</p><p>I bit my teeth together. I knew my face was as stone and hard as the statue of Lilith in the fountain outside, but so was my resolve. She was damn well going to at least confess, or this stone face would be last thing she saw.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I made up a prophecy\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty big deal, Morgaine. That\u2019s a pretty frickin\u2019 huge lie to carry all these centuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but. . .\u201d She made a small gap between her fingers, her neck shrinking into her shoulders a little. \u201cIt was just a teensy stretch of the truth.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, dropping my folded arms. \u201cKnowing the conditions in which the lie about the prophecy was forged, Morgaine, I can forgive that. I mean, really, I\u2019m not surprised. None of the prophecy crap ever made sense anyway, but. . .\u201d I angled my head to one side, my open palms rolling outward with my shrug. \u201cYou lied to me about the Damned, and maintained that lie all this time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI got scared, Amara.\u201d She brushed her hand down my arm. I jerked away. \u201cOur people have been suffering for centuries. They were locked away, tortured, forced to torture other vampires at Drake\u2019s will. And it was unnatural. We couldn't live that way any longer. Then, after Jason hurt you, I thought you wanted to die. I thought you were going to commit suicide, and I just couldn\u2019t think. I told you there was a way to help the Damned before I even realised what I\u2019d said. And you didn\u2019t even look up at me until I said you could free them. After that, I had to do some pretty darn fast thinking to reshape that lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, only you and David know the truth about the Damned\u2014that I can\u2019t, and my child can\u2019t, fix them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. You've not been made a fool of, Ara. It took some work, but I convinced Emily and Mike, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about Arthur? Did you convince him, too? Because he just went right on along with it\u2014even told me he wanted to be free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t lying, Amara. He wanted freedom. But not from immortality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, from what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom his bind to Drake\u2014an eternal bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean . . . he wanted you to use your venom to kill him once all this was over.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wants peace: death. He wanted a family, a wife, a normal life, but he will never have that. Joining our fight was his way of setting things right\u2014his penance to God for all the wrong he\u2019s done, you might say. Once the humans and the Lilithians are safe, Amara, he. . .\u201d She looked down at her feet, shaking her head.</p><p>I slowly rolled my chin to my chest. \u201cAnd when were you going to tell me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t. And neither was he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he promised he\u2019d stay. He\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd he will keep that promise to you now, My Queen.\u201d She rushed in and touched my shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s not going anywhere. You gave him new reason to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, Amara, like the daughter he never had. And he has everything he ever wanted: his nephews are safe and well, away from the plague of Drake\u2019s darkness. He has the lab he always begged for.\u201d She smiled fondly, hugging herself. \u201cAnd he has a precious little girl to worry and fuss over.\u201d</p><p>I smirked. \u201cPrecious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must know he holds you in high regard, Amara. You\u2019re more precious to him than even his nephews, I believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that, Morg. But . . . are you sure? I mean, are you sure he doesn\u2019t still want to di\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d She nodded once. \u201cHe swore to David in his own blood that he\u2019d stay here and care for you after David\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wants to protect me so bad, maybe he should kill Drake himself.\u201d</p> <p>She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. \u201cThis whole thing\u2019s a mess, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I covered my head with my hands for a second. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do to set things right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would help if everyone in my Council sat down in a room and unveiled all the truths they\u2019ve been hiding, you know, a massive heart-to-heart type of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it would serve the queen well, perhaps you should arrange this.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cYeah, right. I\u2019m sure everyone will participate equally.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine moved one shoulder up slowly. \u201cYou never know who might surprise you as the one who reveals the most secrets, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>She eyed me critically. \u201cNothing. Anyway, there was something else you wanted to ask me, wasn\u2019t there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. How did you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ability to understand another person goes a little deeper than pure empathy, My Queen. What did you want to know?\u201d</p><p>My arms fell heavily to my sides with the breath I exhaled. \u201cWhat do you know about Lilith\u2019s children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d She frowned. \u201cNot much. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid found some more information on her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the Scroll Room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in there?\u201d She took one step in that direction. \u201cI\u2019ve been right through there. I never found anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you were looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was. I\u2019m trying to piece this together as much as you are. So\u2014\u201d She rolled her hand at the wrist, prompting me. \u201cWhat did he find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a half-blood witch. We think Drake may have her\u2014if she lived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Drake have her?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cWell, where is she? Where did she go? If she simply died, there\u2019d be more information on her. Someone has gone to great lengths to ensure no one ever asked questions about her.\u201d</p><p>Morgaine nodded thoughtfully. \u201cTrue. But, why would Drake have her? Maybe she\u2019s alive, living out there somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Drake killed anyone who had any allegiance to Lilith, but Morgana was probably very powerful, maybe served a purpose. Or maybe he\u2019s just kept her to torture her all these years for being the blood of Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorturing her?\u201d Morgaine nearly rocketed forward, then sobered herself, straightening her shirt. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? He did it to me, and he ordered his own son\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe boy, the blond one I killed at the castle.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, her eyes drifting down the hall. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it was. Arthur told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She nodded, smiling to herself. \u201cArthur told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did he tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. We were just talking and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted you to feel better about that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was telling me about Drake\u2019s incestuous behaviour and the monsters he created from it, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. First of all\u2014\u201d She laughed, holding her index finger up. \u201cDrake was not incestuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He had a child with a woman who was his great granddaughter by blood, but he didn\u2019t know that at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ... that was that the boy I killed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You killed Simon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was vile, but he wasn't Drake\u2019s creation. Okay, maybe he was, but not his son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was he Drake\u2019s creation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake adopted Simon when he was a small boy. He\u2019d been living in the slums of streets infested with disease and plague for months on his own, feeding off rats and all sorts. When Drake found him, he\u2019d been exposed to some horrific situations, including brutal rape by passing travellers.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cThe child was a mess,\u201d she continued. \u201cDrake taught him to be a vampire from a young age\u2014taught him to kill, to transfer his rage onto those who would become his next meal. But, on Simon\u2019s twentieth birthday, when Drake turned him, the heightened vampiric emotions took anything sweet and human we once saw in him and burned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, he created a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and Drake had grown to love Simon too much to lock him away, but the boy just couldn\u2019t be controlled. That is the only reason he was killed. Drake is not that cruel, and he would not have kidnapped Morgana, if she even existed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat makes you so sure? And why the sudden change in opinion about Drake?\u201d</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, her jaw stiff, hands tight by her sides. \u201cWell, it\u2019s actually not sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ve just. . .\u201d She loosened her fists. \u201cI just keep my opinions to myself if they oppose that of the greater mass.\u201d</p><p>My mouth fell open in disgust.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t judge me.\u201d She pointed in my face. \u201cIt\u2019s how I\u2019ve survive in a world of vampires that hate my kind.\u201d</p><p>I pushed her hand down. \u201cFine. But I didn\u2019t realise you were Pro-Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! I so am not.\u201d Her tone softened then. \u201cBut he\u2019s not as bad as everyone says, either.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms and leaned on the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m always saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She smiled and patted my arm. \u201cBut you just haven\u2019t learned yet that sometimes your opinion is the least important part of ruling a nation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s the most important, smarty pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlaying the game,\u201d she said, and folded her arms slowly, adopting my coy grin. \u201cAgree to be agreeable until the masses agree with the opinion you\u2019re keeping to yourself. If you\u2019re right, that eventually becomes evident. You don\u2019t need to kick and scream to make people see your side, Amara. Only time can really do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you think Drake is agreeable?\u201d</p><p>She leaned on the wall beside me, propping her foot up under her thigh. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I have to kick and scream, Morg, to make my voice heard here. If we can reason with Drake, then David doesn\u2019t need to go to his death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo go tell him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake.\u201d She whipped her phone out of her pocket and held it out to me. \u201cCall him up. Ask him if he wants to negotiate.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, pushing the phone away. \u201cVery funny.\u201d</p><p>She placed it back in her pocket. \u201cDavid's going to Elysium to free the prisoners tomorrow, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be freeing Pepper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll be back next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, he\u2019ll be back, but one day he\u2019ll go on the next mission, and he won\u2019t return, Amara.\u201d She took a step toward Mike as he appeared down the other end of the hall. \u201cI wasn\u2019t joking about calling Drake. I think you should consider it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Then I\u2019ll text you his number.\u201d She turned and walked backward for a second, her arms folded. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want David to die either.\u201d</p><p>I watched her walk away, wondering which part of her recommended the call to Drake: the betraying traitor we suspected she was a few weeks ago, or a true friend who wanted to help me stay on the throne. Either way, we shared one common belief: killing Drake was not the best option, even if he wanted to insert an evil witch\u2019s black soul into my not-yet-conceived child. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Midday sun streamed down through the glass dome above me, casting coloured light across my forearm and David\u2019s chest. I frayed the tips of my fingers through the reds and blues, turning my hand to angle the colours into my palm. The world could just feel so simple at times, but not more than it did when I was in David\u2019s arms this way. Somewhere outside, though, down the long, winding road leading to the manor, a car was edging closer, all fuelled up and ready to take my husband away for the week, turning this precious moment into one of our last.</p><p>I traced a circle around the hollow between David\u2019s collarbones, feeling for a pulse I knew I\u2019d never find. I\u2019d hoped that one day Jason and I would figure out the key to reversing vampirism and that maybe I\u2019d know what it was like to hear David\u2019s heart beat under my ear, but the truth of that wish occurred to me only then: even if those power were still possible, David would be long dead before I figured them out.</p><p>My heart sunk, its roots reaching out for something to hold onto inside me. But without hope to find them, they were left floating around like unbound tendrils, lost.</p> <p>I did feel some relief, though, finally knowing the truth about all this prophecy stuff, and it was much easier being around David with no secrets between us. I could breathe for once, and just exist with him; no longer afraid he\u2019d read my thoughts and find out I knew more than he wanted me to. However, I did still wonder how he learned about his bloodline being cleansed. If Arthur knew, was it something David had always known, too, and was it even true that he and Lilith were meant for each other, or was it just another unfounded theory?</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about the prophecy now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI . . . good, I guess.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s tricky, because I nearly slipped up and said something to Margret and Walt the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you nearly say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I nearly said that it was a relief not be tangled up in some prophecy I didn\u2019t want a part of.\u201d</p><p>David laughed.</p><p>\u201cI corrected myself, though,\u201d I added. \u201cAnd said I was relieved that we were finally seeing to the prisoners at Elysium.\u201d I grinned. \u201cBut I accidentally called it La Chateau de la Mort.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again, propping his arm behind his head. \u201cWas Arthur around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of Arthur.\u201d He lifted my top a little, rolling up to look down. \u201cThat rash you woke up with after you fell from the lighthouse is still there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I cupped his hand, stopping him from touching it.</p><p>\u201cIs it sore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Just itchy. Like I can feel something crawling out through my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I want you to go see my uncle and get something for it. It looks as though it\u2019s turning black.\u201d</p><p>I cringed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go see him once you\u2019re gone this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He drew his arm from under his head and checked his watch, then tucked it back again. \u201cThen call me right away and tell me what he says.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you be out of service at Elysium?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly in the tunnels.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean dungeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nuzzled my head for a second. \u201cDungeons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill . . . when you free. . .\u201d I swallowed my heart back down from my throat. \u201cWhen you free her, will she. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, Pepper and I are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know that. She doesn\u2019t know you dumped her and fell in love with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, enough.\u201d He slid out from under me and hooked his legs over the side of the bed. \u201cThis is hard enough as it is, without you adding your concerns.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He stood up as. \u201cPepper is a part of my past. Were it not for the fact that she is one of the prisoners granted pardon, I\u2019d not have any contact with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe broke the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo she\u2019s nothing to you now?\u201d</p><p>He turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s just how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarsh.\u201d I crawled across the bed and hopped out, coming to stand next to David. \u201cWould you hate me if I did something illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I half laughed. \u201cWhy are you so serious when it comes to the law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the way I am, Ara.\u201d He walked to the blanket box and zipped up the duffel bag there. \u201cIt\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always been. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stopped behind him, searching the set of his shoulders for an answer I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted. \u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Carefully and cautiously, I reached across and touched his back. \u201cYou are only going to Elysium, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . you\u2019re not sneaking off to kill Drake, are you?\u201d</p><p>He turned with a smile and reached up to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear. \u201cI will return to you this time, mon amour. You have my word.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>No one could imagine from looking up at the beige wall around the Garden of Lilith that a menagerie of life thrived behind it. Yellow beams of summer light reached down through the pink leaves of oddly shaped trees, turning the shrubs along the path purple, like a canvas of endless colours to distract my lonely thoughts. I balanced my toes over the cobblestones, avoiding the cool, slippery moss growing between each one, and made my way slowly to the water fountain at the centre of the garden. Tiny dots of water rose from the stone statue to catch a ride on the breeze, greeting my cheeks with cool kisses before sweeping out of the garden and far away.</p><p>I wiped my face with the back of my wrist and took a seat on the grey ledge, laying my book down beside me. There was something magical and peaceful about this place but, for some reason, despite no one being allowed here without invitation from the queen, I never really felt alone\u2014never really felt like this was my garden.</p><p>Beside me, a small splash caught my attention. I dipped my fingers into the pond, sending a school of orange fish scattering under lily pads, making them ripple as if they were breathing. But I didn\u2019t care if the fish ran away. I didn\u2019t even what their company today. I just didn\u2019t really want to see anyone. Didn\u2019t want anyone else to ask me how I was feeling now that David was gone, then look away, disinterested, when I said I felt like crying. The only answer anyone wanted was, \u201cI\u2019m doing well.\u201d I got so sick of saying it; so sick of everyone ignoring the lie they heard in my tone, that \u2018alone\u2019 had become the only place I could stand to be. I\u2019d come out here to the Garden in search of the gentle breeze that moved the leaves in a summer song, harmonised with the deep hum of frogs croaking. But as my thoughts stopped for a second so I could listen to that peaceful sound, my ears pricked. I heard nothing. No insects scuffling about. No frogs calling for a mate. No birds chattering and bickering over worms. And my skin crawled with the very distinct feeling that I was being watched.</p><p>I stood slowly and turned around, searching every shadow or flicker of movement. \u201cEve? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d A tall silhouette appeared in the glare of sunlight. I shielded my face, turning to run when it grabbed my arm. \u201cAra. Ara,\u201d he said more gently, pulling me in, wrapping his arms all the way around my head and shoulders.</p><p>I pushed out from the firmness of his chest, catching the scent of orange chocolate. And all the fight in me stopped, my lips falling softly part, hands to my sides as I took two slow steps backward. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming,\u201d I stated.</p><p>He smiled down at me, his green eyes warmer than they\u2019d been since I couldn\u2019t remember when. \u201cNo, my love. You\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>And that was it. My lip quivered, my chest went tight, and a full-scale melt down started off for the finish line. \u201cWhat are you doing back?\u201d I wailed. \u201cYou\u2019ve only been gone for one night.\u201d</p><p>He cupped a hand to the back of my neck and drew me to him again. \u201cI got all the way out to Elysium, unpacked my bags in my old room and, when Quaid brought me the prisoner manifest, I suddenly realised I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>My face rolled up to look at him. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean. . .\u201d He sighed impatiently, but not like he was irritated with me, more himself. \u201cWhy would I be hundreds of miles across the country, releasing vampires I don\u2019t believe deserve it, when I have such little time left in the one place in this world I actually want to be?\u201d</p><p>I brushed my hair from my cheeks. \u201cWith . . . do you mean here? Being king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed, scooping the last strand of hair away from my lip. \u201cSilly girl. With you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened but nothing came out.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, dropping his hands from my face to take a seat on the fountain\u2019s ledge. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re surprised by that breaks my heart, Ara, and proves to me that the man I thought I was is not the king that stands, well, sits before you now.\u201d</p><p>I sat down next to him, watching our shadows on the ground blend and meet as one. \u201cYou have been a bit. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMean,\u201d he said in short. \u201cI\u2019ve been a king but not a husband. A lawyer and judge, but not a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I said softly, sweeping his hand into mine, and he actually turned in his seat so he could look at me. \u201cI understand, you know. I get it. I do. You\u2019ve not only had to deal with the painful burden of going to your death, but you\u2019re also coming to terms with the fact that you\u2019ll be leaving me alone. Which is hard for you, I know, because I also know you don\u2019t want me to be sad, but you\u2019re duty bound to do it anyway.\u201d</p><p>His eyes drifted to our locked hands, a gentle smile holding back the pain I could see in them. \u201cYou know me well. But it doesn\u2019t excuse\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I know something else about you, David, and I\u2019m not sure even you\u2019ve realised this is a factor in your moods.\u201d I exhaled through my nose, trying to word what was buzzing around in my brain. \u201cRoyalty is important to you. And you\u2019re a good king. But you\u2019ll only be king for a short time. I know you want to make sure that, in your short reign, people remember you as one of the great ones. I understand that about you.\u201d I patted his hand. \u201cI understand that you\u2019ve been battling with these two parts of yourself, and it\u2019s hard to be a good king and a kind husband. I couldn\u2019t do half the things you do, David, and I respect you for that. And I know, at the end of the day, you still love me as much as the moment you met me. So I\u2019m okay with your nasty side from time to time. And if you weren't going to die in a few months, I know that, eventually, you\u2019d have found a balance between being a king and a loving husband, but we don\u2019t have that time.\u201d I cupped his hand and squeezed it until he looked at me. \u201cSo, I understand, and I don\u2019t want you to feel guilty about anything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The muscles in his jaw tightened, but as he opened his mouth to speak, he let the control slip for a second and I saw his chin quiver, saw the coating of tears in his eyes, so thick they hadn\u2019t spilled.</p><p>\u201cAw, David.\u201d I reached up and swiped under his lashes, releasing them. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>He tucked me into his chest, his tears falling against my hair. But I didn\u2019t mind. \u201cMy love. I\u2014\u201d His body shook for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you. I love you more than I thought it was possible to love a person. And I know the pain you suffer right now. I know you\u2019ve kept that pain from me to save my heart from aching, but I\u2014\u201d He swallowed hard, sniffing back the liquid. \u201cHow am I gonna leave you? I . . . If it would take surgery to cut you out of my heart, what must that mean for the way you love me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hurt you. I . . . All I\u2019ve done is yell at you, undermine you, overrule you and dominate you. I\u2019ve no right to treat you that way, and I\u2019m,\u201d he paused and kissed my head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into his chest again, wrapping both arms all the way around his slightly bony ribs. \u201cI forgive you, David. Like I said, I understand why you\u2019ve been that way. I mean, you haven\u2019t really been my David, which means you\u2019re clearly under a lot of stress. It would be unnatural not to be.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a little, cupping the back of my head again. \u201cAnd this is why I snuck away for a bit. I can free the prisoners in a few days. But, right now, I just want more time with you.\u201d</p><p>I hugged him tighter. \u201cMe too, David. I . . . we only have a month until you go to kill Drake, and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m rethinking that timeframe, Ara,\u201d he cut in.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat back to look up at him.</p><p>\u201cWe need more time.\u201d He touched my face. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even conceived yet, and that aside . . . I\u2019ve avoided being around you,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be honest, my love, I\u2019ve tried my hardest not to even look at you, touch you\u2014anything that would make it hurt more the day I have to leave you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s mean and stupid. I . . .\u201d He wiped a hand down his face, drying the tears away. \u201cI wasn't aware I was doing it. It wasn't until I got on the road, played a few CDs\u2014\u201d He looked down at me then, his eyes changing. \u201cDo you know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve listened to music?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I have since before our wedding.\u201d</p><p>I pouted kind of mockingly.</p><p>\u201cAnd as soon as I let my mind go for a second and just hear the notes, the music, my heart broke. I went back through all the horrible things I\u2019ve done or said these last few weeks, and I told myself to shut up, that you understood. Repeated this to myself all the way to Elysium, but it didn\u2019t matter. My heart wasn\u2019t listening to my brain, Ara, and I just had to come back.\u201d He brushed his curled fingers down the side of my face. \u201cI couldn\u2019t leave for a week without making sure you knew exactly how much you mean to me.\u201d</p><p>The birds and frogs had started singing again all around us, almost too noisy, like they were happy to see David again, but they were the only sounds. I just didn\u2019t know what to say, and at the same time, his words didn\u2019t surprise me. What surprised me was seeing the boy I fell in love with sitting right here in my garden, when I never thought he\u2019d surface again. \u201cI thought royalty had killed this David, like maybe the coronation had changed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt did, sweetheart.\u201d He tucked my hair behind my ear. \u201cIt changed me in the wrong ways. And I will still be a firm king, but not at the cost of your heart.\u201d</p><p>I cupped his hand and held it to my face. \u201cGood. Because you are one of the great kings, David. And I don\u2019t want anything about that to change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, huh?\u201d His tone rose up a few octaves.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I feel safer with you on the throne. And I know I can rule my people well when you\u2019re gone, but. . .\u201d I smiled up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re leaving me with a pretty good example to follow.\u201d</p> <p>His broken, sad face cracked, and he smiled then. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how happy I am to hear you say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d I said, hugging him again. \u201cI think your smile pretty much says it all.\u201d</p><p>He laughed into my hair, wrapping his other arm around my ribs and linking them together there, holding me tight in this secret garden where nobody else was permitted to go. Not even the king.</p><p>When the sun rose, I opened my eyes and lay dreading the day. That is until I smelled the sweet scent of citrus and cologne beside me. Each spicy breath filled me with renewed hope while every word we spoke in my garden yesterday echoed in my thoughts, elevating that hope to real possibility. David had not only said he was rethinking the time frame for his death, but had also gone and given the dagger back to Arthur for safekeeping. He didn\u2019t tell me this, of course, but my reliable uncle-in-law had. And that made me suddenly eager to begin my day\u2014another day I was blessed to have David beside me.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He grabbed my hand as I flopped my legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s breakfast time,\u201d I said simply. \u201cWe have to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>He tugged my wrist, and I tumbled back down into the spoon. \u201cForget breakfast. We can be monarchs tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we had to appear at all social gatherings, that our presence was a show of strength and governance?\u201d</p><p>He snuggled his nose into the curve of my neck, wrapping both arms all the way around my waist. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. And you\u2019ll have centuries to prove that after I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a little, stopped trying to get up, and just lay there all snug and cosy in his arms. \u201cI like this version of you much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Enjoy it now then, because this me has to go back to his kingly duties this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I rolled over so I faced him.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a new case coming in to Court today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I can handle it?\u201d</p><p>He ran the tip of his nose down mine. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, sweetheart. It\u2019s that I don\u2019t want you to handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a member from Eric\u2019s band.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat up.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d David looked at the empty hollow of his arms, then at my face, then at his arms again.</p><p>I lay back down, and the hold he had before tightened. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe revealed his vampirism to a human girl, and Eric was forced to kill her.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cIs Eric in trouble for that? Will he be brought before us t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t I sentence his friend? I would\u2019ve been the one to do it if you weren't here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d The cool breath he huffed moved my hair. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t rush in and play daddy all the time,\u201d he reasoned, more with himself than me. \u201cYou\u2019re a big girl. If you want to handle this on your own, that\u2019s fine with me.\u201d</p><p>I leaned back a little to see if he was being sarcastic, but the corner of his lip angled up on one side with a sweet smile, and he closed his eyes again, taking a deeper breath of my scent. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding, are you?\u201d I asked, just to confirm.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout letting me handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>He slid both hands along the sides of my face and planted a very soft, very sweetly-David kiss to my lips. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to sit back and watch you be independent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019ve always been independent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, sweetheart. I mean, when we met, you needed me. You . . . you needed me to care for you, guide you. Love you. And I guess I got used to that. It became a habit to baby you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Mike did.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can see how that relationship evolved that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you back down. If I put my foot down about something, you very rarely challenge me anymore. You never even question me, and sometimes I just don\u2019t realise I\u2019m being a. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoron?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. A controlling asshole.\u201d</p><p>I sucked back the burst of laughter, accidentally spitting it out in David\u2019s face.</p><p>He wiped away the dots of my hilarity and skidded closer, wrapping his ankle around mine, our bare skin touching in every way possible. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be that guy with you, Ara. I don\u2019t want to hurt you like that, and I do, you know I do, want you to be this wonderful, independent, smart, switched-on girl you are. I think I just suck at being a husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t suck, David.\u201d I touched his face softly. \u201cI love you, okay. And the fact that you\u2019re willing to acknowledge your own bad behaviour shows me that you\u2019re a better husband than I could have hoped for.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my lips again. \u201cThat means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>I cuddled in to him again. \u201cLet\u2019s just start fresh, okay. I mean, neither of us has had a chance to be the other\u2019s spouse because this is the first time we\u2019ve really been together since we were married. Think about it,\u201d I reasoned, \u201cwe had torture, possible eternal separation, followed by months apart, learning to rule a monarchy and, now, we have your imminent death on the horizon, and all of this is before we\u2019ve even had our first anniversary.\u201d</p><p>He laughed once, completely wrapped up in what I was saying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say,\u201d I continued, \u201cthe fact that we still love each other, that we can forgive each other\u2019s downfalls and mistakes, means that we\u2019re doing pretty well as a first-year married couple.\u201d</p><p>The bend of his arm wrapped the back of my head, and he pulled me in under his jaw, holding me so tight I held my breath. \u201cThere\u2019s that wisdom I saw in you all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll those years ago, huh?\u201d I raised a brow, even though he couldn't see it. \u201cHow old have we become in the last two years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking for myself,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ve aged rather rapidly since I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cBut what I meant was that you\u2019ve always been very wise, that I knew it from the first moment I heard your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the deeper wisdom never surfaced, is that what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just think sometimes you see the answer as being too simple, and you ignore your mind\u2019s first response to things and bypass it, getting completely muddled up in the process of it all. But as you\u2019re getting older, I\u2019m seeing you use that wisdom more and more, and it makes me worry a little less about leaving you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I quietly thought about that for a second, seeing how I could easily have taken insult to it but knowing he meant it as a compliment. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, you know, even when you\u2019re gone, David. I still have Arthur. I know he\u2019ll stay here and help me out as much he can.\u201d</p><p>He nodded against the top of my head. \u201cI know. I\u2019ve actually spoken to him about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout caring for you when I\u2019m. . .\u201d He kissed my hair, squeezing me. \u201cI know you\u2019ll be in good hands.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve already picked out my cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He laughed. \u201cAnd what kind of cat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkittles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkittles?\u201d He leaned back to look down at me.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m gonna ask Mom and Dad if I can have him.\u201d</p><p>He closed us into his hug again. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you anything you want.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, imagining Skittles sitting on the foot of my bed. David would be gone, but it\u2019d be nice to have a little piece of home here with me. As long as I kept Petey out of here.</p><p>\u201cPetey will eat that cat as soon as he sees it,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWere you just reading my mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head, finding only amusement beneath the irritation. Everything in my world just seemed to be back to normal again, even if it was only for five more minutes. It was a blissful five minutes at least. \u201cI love you, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor forever.\u201d</p><p>The court noisily praised my last ruling as the defendant backed away and blended with the crowd again. Today\u2019s cases had mostly been fun ones, but I knew the next would be hard\u2014to see Eric for the first time in so long and then sentence his friend to some horrific punishment.</p><p>A tall figure appeared on the balcony at the back of the room, leaning on the railing as if he was some bystander, a king pretending to be a commoner. I threw a gentle smile his way and looked back down at the accused: a young man with jet-black hair to his ears, piercings in every inch of flesh available, and tattoos like sleeves down his arms that were clearly there before he was turned. It seemed that some mistakes we made in life really did scar us for eternity. I was very glad then that I never snuck out to get that tattoo my friends all had done to mark our clique as one for forever. I cringed just thinking about the possible and eternal ramifications of that mistake.</p><p>Walter took centre stage to present Adrian Fernandez, a.k.a. Lice, and informed the court and all its attendants of this man\u2019s indiscretions. I listened as Lice pleaded for mercy, falling to his knees at the base of the stairs, but his cries did nothing to melt my heart.</p><p>\u201cYou broke the law, Adrian,\u201d I said. \u201cThe lead singer of your band is a good friend of mine, but that affords you no exclusions to the rules everyone else has to follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He shook his clasped hands in the air. \u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have done it in the first place.\u201d I looked up at the balcony for a second; David was still there. \u201cIf you loved this girl, planned to be with her, I might have understood, but you told her what you are in order to receive attention and praise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cErm.\u201d Walter cleared his throat. \u201cFellatio.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Walter; he was trying not to laugh. \u201cPardon?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat again and mumbled, \u201cHe did it to receive, er . . . fellatio.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Um. . .\u201d I looked at the court again. \u201cFellatio.\u201d</p><p>David coughed into his hand, folding over and turning away quickly to hide his laughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd that girl is now dead because of your ego,\u201d I continued, feeling my cheeks go hot like a stone in the sun. \u201cIn this Order, we value all life: human, vampire, and Lilithian alike. There are no exceptions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake, Majesty, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mistake you won\u2019t make again.\u201d I stood up, straightening my crown. \u201cI make my official ruling, and while it pains me to do this\u2014leaving Eric without a drummer, leaving the world without your musical talents\u2014it is also not my doing. You broke our law, knowing the consequences. I hereby sentence you to a week in the crypt\u2014\u201d</p><p>The crowd gasped. Adrian\u2019s hands fell to the floor to hold him up.</p><p>\u201cYou may have a dose of blood before you\u2019re entombed, given that this is your first offence, but you will have no other comforts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he cried again as my knights lifted him to his feet.</p><p>I held my hand up, a warning to talk no more.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d he cried again, his hollow voice echoing as the Guard dragged him away, one of the men drawing a syringe of Created venom from his sword belt in case Adrian decided to make a scene. He shut up quickly when he saw it, and walked away with his dignity intact.</p><p>In the front row a pair of black eyes met mine. Eric gave a small nod and moved his mouth to say, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t smile back. It was so very good to see him, but when my feet were planted to this stage, in front of hundreds of people from my community, I had to be their queen\u2014I, essentially, had no friends.</p><p>I moved my stern gaze away from Eric, all the way across the crowd to Walt\u2019s very surprised face. \u201cNext case, Walter.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cUh, yes, Your Majesty. Case number fifty-five. Harrison versus Yeardley.\u201d</p><p>Above the court, David looked down on all the people, nodding toward me once before slinking back into the shadows. But I heard his voice enter my thoughts, distracting me a little from court as he disappeared, Good job, he said. I\u2019m proud of you.</p><p>I smiled at my feet then turned my focus back to the case report.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Eric threw his arms around me.</p><p>I hugged him back fiercely. \u201cIt\u2019s so good to see you again. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, yeah.\u201d He leaned out from the hug. \u201cBand\u2019s doing well. Just released our first album and, well, I\u2019ll have to tell the public that Lice is in rehab or something for the next seven days but, yeah, we\u2019re all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel bad for you, Eric. I know Adri\u2014I mean, Lice, is a friend\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stepped back to stuff his hands in his pockets. \u201cSay no more. He knew the rules.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry you had to kill that girl.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAre you kidding? Ara, I\u2019m a vamp\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I palmed my head. \u201cRight. I forget you don\u2019t mind a bit of homicide.\u201d</p><p>His easy smile brought me back to my hometown for a moment, flooding me with memories. \u201cS\u2019good to see ya again, kiddo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Eric. I missed you.\u201d</p><p>He went to speak, but stopped, looking up as David approached. \u201cHey, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d David hugged him, and they both broke into a series of manly back pats. \u201cLong time, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Eric stood back, allowing room for David to stand beside me. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good run. How you been?\u201d</p><p>David shrugged. \u201cBeen better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Tough break, man. I heard about the Dagger.\u201d</p><p>David nodded, but quickly pasted a smile in place. \u201cYou stayin\u2019 for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Eric grinned, looking at me. \u201cDepends what\u2019s on the menu.\u201d</p><p>David laughed, wrapping his elbow over Eric\u2019s neck as we walked out of the Throne Room. \u201cWe both know what will happen if you ever taste my wife\u2019s blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorth the risk,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cOn the bright side,\u201d I cut in. \u201cIt might just be a way to resurrect you from the dead, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201d Eric landed in a lazy heap on the leather sofa next to me, making it squeak with protest, the sound echoing through the library.</p><p>\u201cHey, Eric.\u201d</p><p>His cheeky grin spread across his face like a wild party, promising exciting things if only I let myself go with him. \u201cWhat y\u2019up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReading.\u201d I tucked my legs up to one side, leaning more on the arm of the sofa to angle away from him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re too close for my husband\u2019s liking.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew. I didn\u2019t see it, but I felt it. \u201cHe\u2019s not here to protest.\u201d</p><p>I shut my book. Clearly, Eric was out for some fun tonight or, at the very least, some fun company. \u201cCan\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, his shoulders looking kind of bony in that plain back tee. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen ya in ages. Just wanted to catch up without the \u2018fold\u2019 around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy fold, you mean. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe followers.\u201d He made quotation marks in the air with his fingers. \u201cThe many who love and protect their queen. Most of all, that power-hungry vampire you call a king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d I backhanded his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s my husband you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d He sat back, resting his hands in his lap. \u201cCoulda fooled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean. . .\u201d He leaned on my thigh to push himself up, then wandered across the room to pore aimlessly over book spines. \u201cHe\u2019s changed, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo everyone keeps saying,\u201d I said flatly, dumping my book on the end table. \u201cHe\u2019s just under a lot of pressure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying.\u201d He waited a few seconds, then turned at the shoulder to flash me a grin. \u201cSo . . . what you readin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, um.\u201d I reached across and laid my notepad over the title of the book. \u201cJust researching.\u201d</p><p>\u201cResearching,\u201d he said slowly, as if drawing out the word would prompt an explanation from me.</p><p>\u201cStuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStuff, huh?\u201d His whole body bounced with his casual nod. \u201cAide-Memoire de l\u2019Auress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I stood up and grabbed my book from his sudden thieving paws, shoving his chest after.</p><p>He took a few steps back, kind of stumbling from the force, and jammed his hands in his pockets, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t try to hide things from a guy two-times faster than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had no right to do that.\u201d I put the book back down on the table he\u2019d stolen it from.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t lie to me.\u201d He stepped back into my circle of fury. \u201cWhy are you reading that? What happened here while I was gone?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hip distractedly. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing?\u201d he said, suddenly beside me again, but this time lifting my top.</p><p>I yanked it back down. \u201cGet off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your skin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not nothing, Ara. Come on.\u201d He held both hands out, palms raised. \u201cTalk to me.

He hasn\u2019t seen it since it went dark and took on the shape of letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you haven\u2019t had sex with him?\u201d he asked playfully.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should answer. \u201cLast time we did, the rash wasn\u2019t as bad but . . . after I woke up the next morning, it was searing hot and the symbols had taken on real shape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what, making love to your husband makes the rash worse?\u201d he suggested as well as asked. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re allergic to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha.\u201d I reached over and flicked his earlobe. \u201cFunny.\u201d</p> <p>He sat back, exhaling rather loudly for the quiet space we were in, then lopped his arm over the back of the sofa and around my shoulders. \u201cForget reading for tonight. You can investigate memory loss and icky rashes all day tomorrow. But you\u2019ve only got me for one night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you suggest we do?\u201d I sat up and removed his arm from my body.</p><p>\u201cJog your memory.\u201d His lips angled into that sharp grin I loved.</p><p>\u201cHow will we do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo jump off a lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>I held my awkward smile, not sure if he was kidding or not, shaping it into a frown when he stood up and offered me his hand.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said. \u201cWho knows? Maybe if we sit up there and watch the sun rise for a bit, you might remember something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I took his hand and stood. \u201cBut Quaid\u2019s coming with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cQuaid?\u201d He looked over his shoulder. \u201cWhy him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my night guard. I take him everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Eric\u2019s brows shot up to his hairline. \u201cWow. Things have changed around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed this place,\u201d Eric said, dangling his legs over the platform and into the abyss below.</p><p>I sat down beside him, hugging the railing with both my arm and my chin. \u201cSo, if you miss it so much, why not come back to us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I finally have a life, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had a life here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a job here, following you around and offering advice. No offence.\u201d He bumped me with his elbow. \u201cI got better things to do with my eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough,\u201d I said, casting my attention then on the yellow glow reaching out to sea from behind us, lighting up my hands and making eerie shadows of the rocks below each time it passed. The fierce wind roared up here, whipped past the metal railing, shaking everything that wasn\u2019t made of iron, while the sea called beneath us\u2014hundreds of meters down where it bashed the rocks in some angry attempt to prove greater might than the land. My hair moved around my face in a wild dance, strapping my eyes every few seconds, leaving them kind of teary with the sting.</p><p>\u201cI love the way the ocean smells when it\u2019s late at night,\u201d Eric said.</p><p>\u201cMm.\u201d I smiled, watching the dark sky with almost new eyes. \u201cI think the glow of the stars gives it an almost richer, more dreamy flavour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, girl. Don\u2019t go all poetic on me.\u201d He reached into his pocket. \u201cThe king might have cause to worry \u2018bout your intentions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, between you and I?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIn your dreams.\u201d</p><p>He just smirked, looking out to sea again, tapping a small, silver case about the size of a card deck against his leg. \u201cI sat in on a class today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Down at the barracks.\u201d He flipped the case open and offered me the contents. I declined with a scrunched-up nose. \u201cMike\u2019s got some pretty good stuff goin\u2019 on down there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I came to sit in on the \u2018How to Kill a Vampire Without Venom\u2019 and \u2018Putting a Vamp Down in Three-Seconds\u2019 lectures last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade was giving that one today\u2014to the newbs.\u201d He lit a smoke, cupping his hand around it so the flame wouldn\u2019t blow out in the wind, then shook the match and dropped it over the edge. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this one move, where they jam a dagger into the back of the neck\u2014\u201d He used the two fingers holding the smoke to make a line over the top of his spine, \u201c\u2014slip it between the third and fourth vertebrae or something,\u201d he said suggestively.</p><p>\u201cYeah, severs the spinal cord and sends them down fast. Takes at least a day to rejuvenate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn which case, you die.\u201d</p><p>He drew on his cigarette, puffing the fumes out with \u201cAnd the guns are new.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, thinking about Mike\u2019s face when he first opened the crates. \u201cThe bullets are spiked, you know? Some with Created and some with Pureblood venom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Mike gave me one\u2014a gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Just the Created venom, though. Told me to watch out for Drake. Said it was standard issue now\u2014all guards and knights keep one on their sword belts.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cThey all keep a syringe handy, too\u2014just in case they need to arrest someone that puts up a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He took a puff of that smoke again and blew it out. \u201cThey took Lice down with it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Once they got him around the corner, they jammed it in his neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d He moved his shoulder up. \u201cHe was puttin\u2019 up a bit of a fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have, too.\u201d</p><p>He laughed then, nodding. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did Mike show you how to shoot a vampire? \u2018Cause those bullets won\u2019t go through bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He flicked his cigarette bud over the edge and the little flickering orange glow burned its way out of sight. \u201cHe said to aim for the eye\u2014that the bullet bounces off the skull of a vampire and stays inside, just jumpin\u2019 around.\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cMashing up the brain.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYup. Or go for the belly.\u201d I made a gun-like motion to my own belly. \u201cBalls work well, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I bet.\u201d He leaned forward and stuffed his smoke case in his back pocket. \u201cSo, do you get a gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I have a sword, but I don\u2019t walk around with it on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? King does.\u201d</p><p>I thought about how sexy David looked with that sword hanging down by his leg, all tall and strong and stern, kinda like an eighteenth-century prince. \u201cI have a dozen or so guards that carry swords. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFairs enough.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, resting my chin on the railing. The night seemed to have worn on to morning across the far horizon too quickly, leaving the ocean with an almost red glow as far out as the eye could see. \u201cSailor\u2019s warning,\u201d I said, nodding toward it.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe red sky. They say that if it\u2019s red at night, it\u2019s a sailor\u2019s delight\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nodded. \u201cRed sky in morning, a sailor\u2019s warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard that one before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKiddo, I was in the Navy for a decade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Navy?\u201d</p><p>He looked slowly away. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were human?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his shoulders sinking a little.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss being human?\u201d</p><p>His lips moved quickly into that coy grin, making his eyes light up. \u201cNot even a little bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I wrapped my arm across his waist and gave him a little squeeze. \u201c\u2018Cause I like you as a vampire. You\u2019re cocky and kinda sadistic, but there\u2019s no one else like you, Eric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, silly.\u201d I laughed, and he laid his arm over mine, patting my elbow a few times.</p><p>When I first met him, I always thought music was the way David connected to the deeper, more soulful part inside himself. He never played for show, never paraded himself or his musical talents, and was never arrogant about it. But I never saw in him the emotion I saw in other true musicians when they\u2019d play alone\u2014when they thought no one else was around. I could sit at the piano and play for hours, tears streaming down my cheeks, the very soul of the song coming to life because of me. And I\u2019d watched David sit for hours, too\u2014snuck up and hid behind the door to the Great Hall\u2014waited for the sad song he was playing to draw some raw emotion from him. But never. Not once. He played, but he never let go.</p><p>I stood by the bedroom door, my arms folded, and watched him where he sat on the bed with his guitar across his lap, his thoughts somewhere out there on the day over the balcony ledge. He played a sad song, sitting slightly more hunched than he usually did, and sang the words as if he was compelled to, yet wasn\u2019t really performing either\u2014he was just singing for himself. And this\u2014the curve of his spine, the angle of his chin against the grasp of the world, and the very absence of that smile in his eyes\u2014was his tell. This was his raw emotion shining through. He would never bleed tears into an empty room. He would never let emotion come up on its own and steal his composure, but his body couldn\u2019t pretend he felt no pain in his heart.</p><p>I walked over and sat behind him on the bed, wrapping one hand under his arm and turning it to cup his shoulder, laying my cheek on the other. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>He received my affection with what sounded like a breath of relief, gently resting his jaw against my eyebrow. \u201cIt is now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I whispered back, smiling into his shoulder blade.</p><p>\u201cWhat you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust watching you sing.\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at the open door and sighed, shaking his head as he turned his gaze on the day again. \u201cI thought I shut that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. I opened it.\u201d</p><p>He nodded to himself.</p><p>\u201cHey, David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m worried.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout. . .\u201d I sat up on my knees and massaged his shoulders. \u201cThere\u2019s something . . . wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s this lighthouse thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it, my love.\u201d He laid the guitar down on the bed and turned when I didn\u2019t answer, taking my hand off his shoulder to hold it. \u201cI can see how upset you are by this. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . I get this feeling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded, not really sure how to explain it. \u201cLike I\u2019m forgetting something.\u201d</p> <p>He laughed and hooked his arm behind my back, pulling me around and into his lap. \u201cYou are, my love. You have amnesia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I . . . I have a really bad feeling about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou\u2019re missing a part of your life, a section of events that happened, resulting in extreme pain and near death, and your mind is trying to make sense of it. It\u2019s your instinct to survive, to find a reason something occurred and prevent it happening again.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders relaxed. \u201cYou think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He lifted my hand from the buttons I was toying with and kissed it. \u201cI\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, I feel like something bad happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt did.\u201d He laughed. \u201cYou fell off a lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, too, patting his chest before resting my face in the curve of his neck, his stubble prickling my eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I guess I\u2019m just not used to the sensation of losing my memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean mind,\u201d he joked.</p><p>\u201cBe nice.\u201d I gave him a soft slap on the thigh. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not just me who lost their mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike did, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, what. Do. You. Mean?\u201d he said each word more firmly, but with a hint of a smile in his tone.</p><p>\u201cI mean. . .\u201d I sat up to look into his eyes. \u201cMike had a memory lapse that night, too. He said he\u2019d planned to take a new box of cuffs down to the training hall, but when he went to get them from the mailroom, they were gone. They\u2019d already been put in the hall. He asked around, and no one else had done it, but he had no memory of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you think this has something to do with your loss of memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . what could that possibly be?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cStop worrying about it, Ara.\u201d He kissed my head and rubbed my back. \u201cI\u2019ve looked into it, and I can\u2019t see any evidence of foul play, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you talk to Jason\u2014about the accusations that he erased my memory?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriefly.\u201d He tucked a strand of hair behind my ear.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he said he had a few theories\u2014that he would fill me in when I got back from Elysium this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he knows something, right? So\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, he doesn\u2019t know anything of value. He has theories. I asked him, I probed to see if he might have erased yours or Mike\u2019s minds, but he didn\u2019t give any indication. And he\u2019s a terrible liar. If he\u2019d done anything to you or to Mike, it would\u2019ve come out in my interrogation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterrogation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA brotherly interrogation,\u201d he said softly, running his hand down my arm. \u201cStop worrying. I really don\u2019t think anything bad happened between you and Mike that night. He\u2019s always taken good care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s not like I think he pushed me. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said, curious. \u201cBecause that was my first thought just now, when you said he had no memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. But it\u2019s unlikely his lapse in memory is connected to yours. He was under a lot of stress back then. And as for you? Well, you hit your head pretty hard, Ara. I think you\u2019re just worrying too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I snuggled back into his neck. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>The ocean cooled the grounds around Loslilian, sending its sweeping, stormy breeze low across the lands. The last two days, with David being home and, essentially, on holiday, the summer had been warm and the days longer and brighter. But I woke this morning to the sound of thunder and a great, raging storm going on in my heart as well as outside.</p><p>We stood on the steps at the front of the manor, a taxi waiting by the fountain, the tears of farewell restrained by formalities, trying to let each other go. I focused on the softness of David\u2019s fingers in mine, running my thumb down his nail. \u201cTry to enjoy yourself at Elysium,\u201d I said. \u201cAt least a little bit.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, but it didn\u2019t reach his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m releasing prisoners I sentenced\u2014some I locked away, never to be seen again, all because my queen has a too kind a heart. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll enjoy this, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019yes, but you\u2019ll be a good boy and do it anyway, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He bowed mockingly. \u201cYes, My Queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I reached up and patted his head. \u201cNow, run along like a good little king, and set your people free.\u201d</p><p>He gave a breathy laugh as he turned on his heel, saving the last kiss for a journey across the wind from his lips, to his palm, to me catching and storing it in my pocket.</p><p>\u201cBe safe, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe strong, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I bowed my head once. \u201cI will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCatch ya later, kiddo.\u201d Eric stepped up and hugged me.</p><p>I breathed him in deep, committing all of him to memory. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cI\u2019ll have to come back in twenty years and check out this hot daughter you\u2019ll have.\u201d</p><p>I slapped his arm softly. \u201cGood thing I know you\u2019re kidding, or I might be tempted to neuter you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly, his fangs showing under that cocky, carefree smile. \u201cGood thing you think the best of me and actually thought I was joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet outta here,\u201d I said playfully, shoving him.</p><p>He backed away and stood beside David, copping a light punch in the arm.</p><p>\u201cLater, Ara.\u201d Quaid elbowed me as he passed. \u201cTake care \u2018til I get back, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d I jerked my head toward Blade. \u201cHe follows me when he\u2019s not supposed to.\u201d</p><p>Quaid smiled at his three comrades. \u201cDon\u2019t break the record without me, guys. I\u2019ll be back once I\u2019ve delivered the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll keep it on hold \u2018til then,\u201d Falcon said, giving that cool nod of his.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Catch ya\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d Blade waved once, and we turned away as David, Quaid and Eric piled into the car.</p><p>\u201cWhat record?\u201d I asked Falcon.</p><p>\u201cDarts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. You play darts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust one of the many ways we fill in time when we\u2019re not stalking you.\u201d</p><p>I held still for a moment, watching Falcon\u2019s face carefully. And there it was: the tiniest hint of a smile. \u201cDid you just make a joke?\u201d</p><p>He started walking inside as the car pulled away down the drive.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I probed. \u201cYou have a bone of humour in your body?\u201d</p><p>He held the door open for me, and I ducked in under his arm, following Emily. \u201cI\u2019m quite a funny guy when I\u2019m not around you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bring out the worst in you, huh?\u201d I said.</p><p>His timid smile made me stop walking for a second. \u201cNo, but my job brings out the serious side of me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know the funny side of you, Falcon, but I know I feel safer with your serious side than I do with any other knight on the Core.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He bristled with pride. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m in charge of the Guard now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Blade slapped Falcon on the shoulder. \u201cThis guy should win an award for the size of the steel rod he can cram up his arse.\u201d</p><p>Emily and Blade laughed their way down the corridor and out of sight, and I turned to offer Falcon a sympathetic pout.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to earn friends,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut they love you anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. When I\u2019m not walking around with that steel rod wedged where the sun don\u2019t shine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, only when you\u2019re off duty then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cOr off doody.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I covered my mouth. \u201cThat was a pretty good one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I said.\u201d He closed the front door. \u201cI\u2019m not all business.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cSo, we\ufffd\ufffdve addressed your tantrums\u2014\u201d Blade pointed to his thumb, \u201c\u2014your naivety and, today, I want to talk some more about respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRespect?\u201d I slid my bottom back on the tabletop and let my legs dangle. \u201cWho am I not respecting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your respect for everyone else I have a problem with, Ara. It\u2019s theirs for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I looked down at my knees, tucking my hands under them.</p><p>\u201cThe general population residing within these walls seems to hold you in reasonably high regard. I\u2019ve checked, talked with them about you,\u201d he said, pacing the floors again like he was lecturing at a university. \u201cIt seems to be only your peers, you know, anyone who knew you before you were queen, that haven\u2019t taken a step back yet to notice this transformation you\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d Emily said, and my eyes moved upward with Blade\u2019s to the girl leaning her arms over the railing on the second floor balcony.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d Blade said, turning back to me. \u201cMorgaine\u2019s not too bad. King David could use a lesson in the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of spousal control.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. So did Emily.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t be a problem now, Blade,\u201d I said, shifting over, patting the spot next to me for Em to join. \u201cHe apologised for that, and it really . . . It\u2019s not who he is. He\u2019s just been having a hard time.\u201d</p><p>Blade bowed his head. \u201cOkay. That\u2019s fine. But the thing is, Ara, it\u2019s not the other people we need to change. It\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to change me because they disrespect me?\u201d I said flatly.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emily added, scooping my hand up in hers. \u201cBecause you teach people how to treat you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s eyes went wider for a second, a warm smile narrowing them after. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Emily, and you could take a leaf out of your own book, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Emily nodded, turning to me. \u201cAra, Mike babies everyone if they let him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah, and you allow way too much of it, Your Majesty,\u201d Blade said. \u201cAs a human being, you deserve the respect and confidence of your friends and family but, as a queen, you must command it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCommand it?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYes. It happens one situation at a time,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou stand tall and clearly warn the culprit to rephrase their statement, this time with a little respect. Do that once or twice, Majesty, and people will catch on that you believe you deserve better than to be spoken to like you\u2019re a seventeen-year-old spoiled brat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that what people think of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much anymore. But there\u2019s just a few who haven\u2019t woken up to smell the coffee. And you\u2019ve been so busy being sad over David not being here, followed by news of his impending death, that you haven\u2019t really noticed just how bad your people treat you.\u201d</p><p>I brushed my thumb down Emily\u2019s, focusing only on that so I wouldn\u2019t cry.</p><p>\u201cI think she has, Blade,\u201d Emily said. \u201cShe\u2019s not as tough as she looks.\u201d</p><p>Blade\u2019s face appeared under my lowered gaze, his black eyes peering up at me softly. \u201cMy Queen, you don\u2019t even realise how much your people actually love you. Those who don\u2019t are in the minority.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But, hey, get this\u2014\u201d He grinned at Emily. \u201cEms and I took a stroll through Lamia Village the other day to see how it was thriving now, and when we got to the great water fountain in Town Square, there was this group of little human girls sitting on the steps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were making garlands of blue paper roses to hang around their necks, Ara,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I overheard one of the girls call herself Princess Amara,\u201d Blade finished.</p><p>My heart melted. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Honest to God.\u201d Blade tapped his heart. \u201cYou and David aren\u2019t just the king and queen, struggling to rule and be in love. You\u2019re figures in history; stories parents tell their children.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Blade laughed, standing up again. \u201cSo don\u2019t feel so alone, okay, Ara? You\u2019re not. Your people love you, and respect you. But you need to realise that you\u2019re the queen, not a girl fresh out of high school with no relevance or training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, Ara,\u201d Emily added. \u201cIf you think about it, you know more about the laws, systems, and history than almost any of us.\u201d</p><p>My mind wandered to this morning\u2019s lesson with Morgaine on Lilithian and Vampire politics and history\u2014a lesson I, for once, stayed awake for, realising now, more than ever, how important it was that I knew all that stuff. Very soon, there\u2019d be no king to save me from myself. I needed to\u2014had to\u2014understand how to do this on my own or, when David was gone, everything would fall apart. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Em,\u201d I said, feeling the realisation flood my system like water rising. \u201cI probably know more than anyone here, aside from Arthur and Morgaine. And no one, not Margret, Walt, not even Mike, has the right to speak to me like I\u2019m a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Em said, her smile radiating as she looked at Blade. \u201cSo, what are you gonna do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I didn\u2019t know. Not really. \u201cI guess, now that I\u2019ve addressed it as an issue, I\u2019ll just have to put myself to the test next time a situation arises.\u201d</p><p>Emily looked at Blade. He shrugged, nodding. He seemed happy enough with that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stand back on this one, Majesty. Let you find your own feet,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you need any advice, or encouragement, look to me for a quick nod.\u201d</p> <p>I gave one in return. \u201cThanks, Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d He reached back to the table nearby and grabbed a notepad and pen. \u201cNow, I want you taking notes for this part, because you\u2019re going to learn all the loopholes in the laws you can and cannot be overruled on, and those you can be punished for breaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said, and I meant that. Up until now, learning anything made my eyes roll, as if I was back in school, being treated like a kid again. But, in suffering curiosity and belittlement for too long, I\u2019d come to realise just how important it was to be informed. If I knew what I was talking about, no one had cause to argue with me or doubt me.</p><p>He was small, just a dot on the horizon, almost completely shadowed by the two giant cliffs guarding either side of the small beach, but before I even reached the steep steps leading down to the sand, I knew it was Jase.</p><p>He crossed his arm over his body and under his elbow, then flicked it out quickly toward the waves, sending a small stone skipping across the choppy surface as best it could considering the almost violent conditions out there today.</p><p>I could tell, even from up here on the cliff side, that something was troubling him\u2014could tell he came out here to be alone, but I didn\u2019t really care. I needed some space, too, and my skin had been craving the fury of the ocean for about a week now. We weren\u2019t supposed to be in the same space alone but, if one of us was leaving, I was sorry to say it\u2019d have to be him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he called, without even turning around.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know I was here?\u201d I projected my voice over the noise of the wind, even though I knew he could hear me just fine. A habit, I guess.</p><p>\u201cI can smell you.\u201d He turned slightly and smiled at me, then ditched another stone from his handful into the water.</p><p>\u201cBut I was downwind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Ara. My senses are very finely tuned when it comes to you. I could smell you before you even knew you were coming this way.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>I laughed too, closing my shawl around my chest as I stopped beside him. \u201cHey, did you get that reading you were trying for at training the other day?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cAnd now I need a new ammeter, thanks to your telekinesis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelekinesis?\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how you threw him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it was my light.\u201d I waved my fingers.</p><p>\u201cYour light doesn't have that kind of power. Maybe to knock someone back with the blast, but not pick them right up and toss them aside.\u201d He threw another stone.</p><p>I reached across and stole one from the cup of his palm. \u201cShow me how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me how to do it.\u201d</p><p>He looked at the stone in my flat hand, then dropped his collection on the wet sand at his feet, the pebbles scattering like pearly black diamonds. \u201cOn one condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d I smiled sheepishly. \u201cWell, almost anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep everything I teach you a secret.\u201d He wrapped both hands over my own and the stone. \u201cThey all believe your blue light threw that knight, Ara, and it\u2019s probably safer if you keep it that way.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay, agreed. But what about David?\u201d</p><p>A thin smile stretched his lips. \u201cI\u2019d never ask you to keep something from your husband, Ara. You can tell whoever you like, as long as you trust them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked at my hand all tucked up and warm in his. \u201cI accept the terms of our agreement. Now, show me how to make it move.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Well, you only discovered this because of your survival instinct. Quite often, a vampire\u2019s power can lay dormant for thousands of years, until a situation arises where they need to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I could have more powers I don\u2019t know about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said with a small laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t even begin to imagine the potential within you. You\u2019re not only a child of Lilith\u2019s blood, but you\u2019re also deemed a goddess by Mother Nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that means I\u2019m supposed to be magnificently powerful?\u201d I asked disbelievingly.</p><p>\u201cNot just powerful, sweet girl, a force to be reckoned with, something that should scare the wits out of any man who opposes you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at my own small hand, so feeble against his long, ancient and athletic fingers. \u201cI can just see Drake shaking in his boots now.\u201d</p><p>His hand tightened around mine. \u201cHe should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be, when I figure out how to use this power.\u201d I grinned up at Jase\u2019s very slight dimple\u2014the one he\u2019d get when he was enjoying something. \u201cNow, stop stalling just so you can hold my hand, and show me how to do it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but we both knew he wasn\u2019t really stalling. \u201cOkay, as I was saying before, you found the ability because you had the need for it. So, I want you to imagine I\u2019m trying to steal this stone from you, and I want you to use your mind to throw it into the ocean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But since we\u2019re role playing, why are you trying to steal it?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a second, looking up when the idea struck him. \u201cBecause if I get it, you have to let me kiss you.\u201d</p><p>My spine straightened.</p><p>\u201cOn the lips,\u201d he added.</p><p>I pictured it for a second, and before our lips even touched, an imaginary David came down and ripped Jason\u2019s arms out of their sockets, laid his face down on the boulder by our feet and smashed his heel into the back of Jason\u2019s head, knocking all his teeth out. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me your word.\u201d He held out his pinkie.</p><p>I linked mine over it. \u201cYou have my word. If you get the stone, I\u2019ll kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will hurt me when he sees the kiss in your thoughts, Ara. It\u2019s not a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you better hope you\u2019re not wrong about me having telekinesis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoping?\u201d He took a step back and crouched down, pulling his jeans up his legs a little. \u201cAra, I\u2019m praying right now.\u201d</p><p>I looked at his white teeth under that smile, and a faint memory of what those lips felt like flooded my senses.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said, his tone playful but warning. \u201cYou better start moving that stone.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my hand back as he swiped at it, almost catching it in his palm, but my so-called powers didn\u2019t surface. So, I ran\u2014turned on my heel and bolted down the beach, my feet sinking into the softer sand further away from the waves.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t run from me,\u201d he called. \u201cAnd human pace won\u2019t even give you two-seconds\u2019 reprieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t run like a vampire when I\u2019m concentrating,\u201d I called over my shoulder, half noticing Falcon on top of the lighthouse as I turned back, watching on: the protective knight. I knew there was no way he\u2019d hear us from all the way up there, and a part of me wondered what he thought we were up to, running along the beach like a couple of kids, with me screaming and dodging Jason\u2019s every leap to grab me, and him laughing in such a carefree, boyish way, it almost sounded like he was happy.</p><p>\u201cStop concentrating,\u201d Jase said, nearly catching the hem of my dress. \u201cThe point of adding high stakes is so you\u2019re not thinking about anything but fight or flight.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not working.\u201d I ducked as he lunged toward me again, then took a quick side step at the cliff wall and darted down the beach in the other direction, leaving Jason face down in the sand, laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re enjoying this chase a little too much, I think,\u201d I said, stealing a glance to see how far away he was, but my face hit the rock hard centre of his chest instead, and I fell back on my hands, dropping the stone somewhere in the sand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not trying very hard, Ara.\u201d He stood above me, his eyes scanning the yellow grains around the circumference of my body.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the sad part.\u201d I got up on my hands and knees and sifted through the sand. \u201cI actually am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re hoping to find it before I do, I wish you luck.\u201d His voice was littered with amusement; his arms crossed over his baseball shirt, with the cuffs of his jeans wet and folded up above his bare feet. He was waiting for me to find it, I just knew, and it was either so he could steal it and win his kiss, or to prompt me to use this power he was sure I had. But I just wasn't that convinced he was even right. \u201cWhich is why you ran in the first place,\u201d he said smugly.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jason.\u201d I felt a stone pass under my fingertips, and moved my hands opposite it to throw him off. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a scientist, doesn\u2019t mean you know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not just a scientist, Ara.\u201d He knelt down and dug into the sand right by my heel, standing up again with the stone in hand; I sat back on my thighs, gasping silently. \u201cI\u2019m a century-old vampire who has seen the birth of every scientific and medical advance in the most significant age of science known to man, and I know\u2014\u201d He held up the stone, \u201c\u2014exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>I stood up, dusting my hands off on my dress. \u201cWhat do you want, Jason? Is this whole thing really just so you can get a kiss from a married woman?\u201d</p><p>He smirked at the stone between his fingertips, his eyelids thinning into smaller slits until they closed and the stone rose above his palm, floating mid air. \u201cOpen your hand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Emerald green shone out as he looked directly into me. \u201cOpen your hand, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I slowly rolled my palm flat, and the stone wandered across the space between us and landed gently there like an invisible man had moved it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to play games to steal a kiss. In fact, I don\u2019t need to steal a kiss, and let me make one more thing clear to you, Ara-Rose. I don\u2019t want to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, closing my fingers over the stone, the cool wind whipping my hair and shawl outward toward the cliffs.</p><p>\u201cI am here to help you,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo help my brother, and anything I have ever done in contradiction since I came to this manor was purely in either yours or his best interests. I may love you, Ara\u2014\u201d He stepped closer, cupping my tight fist. \u201cBut that love only gives me perfect reason to do anything to avoid my lips touching yours, because the repercussions of that kiss would not just affect me, they\u2019d affect David and, in turn, you.\u201d</p> <p>The lump in my throat wouldn\u2019t shift. He was right. But he had won that kiss fair and square, except I knew it wouldn\u2019t end on this beach. Falcon would see. I would know it happened and, when David found out, which he would because I\u2019d tell him, Jason would be on stable duty for the next year, if David was in a good mood.</p><p>I tried not to look at him, but his eyes were locked onto mine, holding me to his gaze, his thoughts centring on the moment our lips would touch\u2014after so, so long.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a kiss,\u201d he said softly, and his fingers closed around mine, making my skin burn, gradually getting hotter and hotter like water on a stove.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping you find your will to fight.\u201d He took the last step into me and cupped my chin, rolling my face upward so our lips aligned, leaving just an inch and a warm breath between us. I couldn\u2019t feel the ice on the wind anymore, didn\u2019t care that Falcon was behind us or that the ocean tide had moved in as we stood here, getting dangerously close to our feet. The only thing I felt was the roiling cloud of fear in my gut, swirling and thickening at the taste of his breath, sparking the memory of his smooth lips. I couldn\u2019t do it, though. I knew he was waiting\u2014knew he was respectful enough to make it my choice, on my honour. But I couldn\u2019t keep my word. And it wasn\u2019t because David would tear Jason apart if I did, but that the reason David would do it is because the kiss would hurt him more.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I lowered my weight back onto my heels, but stayed close to him\u2014chest to chest, hand to hand, faces angled for a kiss, and the heat in my palm seared around the stone. \u201cYou\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing that,\u201d he said smugly, laughing a little as he looked down at my hand. My fingers were bright pink, small clouds of steam billowing up through the cracks between them, while the scent of melting flesh made my nose twitch. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase, I mean it. It hurts. Stop it.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled his hand away, stepping back, but the burning intensified. \u201cOnly you can stop it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hand: the fist was fused shut by melted flesh, my whole arm shaking violently. \u201cJase,\u201d I said, panic rising in my tone. \u201cPlease. I don\u2019t know how to make it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrop the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d My hand wouldn\u2019t open.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He took a step closer and the heat raged, as if his skin, his breath, maybe his soul, set the rock in my hand alight. \u201cAra, fun\u2019s over. Drop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I cried out, landing on my knees in the sand, digging and scraping at my hand to force it open. \u201cWhat is this stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a rock.\u201d He knelt beside me. \u201cJust a normal rock from the ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so hot?\u201d I practically screamed.</p><p>\u201cYour blue light, sweet girl. You\u2019re on defensive\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I yelled as he reached for my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust let me\u2014Ah!\u201d He folded in on himself, his face going bright red. \u201cAra, stop!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get away from me,\u201d I said, pretty sure I\u2019d just zapped him without meaning to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He tried to stand, tried to walk away, then sunk to his knees. \u201cAra, stop!\u201d</p><p>I glanced up quickly to see him curled into a ball a few feet away. But I hadn\u2019t done anything to him. He\u2019d probably just stepped on a jellyfish or something, or maybe he felt the heat, too, as if my electric light had surfaced without colour and hit him hard. But I didn\u2019t care. I needed to concentrate, needed to focus to get this stone out of my hand.</p><p>I phased Jason, the waves, the wind, the world, out, and imagined that the stone in my hand was just an ice cube, that the heat would melt it. \u201cFocus, Ara. Focus,\u201d I mumbled and, all around me, a shimmer of blue light parted the shadows, taking the warmth around the stone and sending it through my entire body, leaving my palm cool and tingly and suddenly free.</p><p>I unfolded my fingers, rolling my hand to tip the small droplet of water and the pile of sand grains onto the ground by my knee. The melted flesh bubbled and bled, then healed over, leaving the skin smooth and supple again.</p><p>My lungs expanded, contracting slowly as the long breath I exhaled cooled my limbs. \u201cI melted it,\u201d I said to Jason, my eyes filled with wonder, but his deep, almost restless groan snapped my thoughts back to the agonized screams still ringing in my ears. \u201cOh, my God. Jase!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He rolled into a tighter ball, cradling his arm in the circle of his body. \u201cGet help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason. Why?\u201d I touched his hip to roll him over, but my presence startled him; he raised his wrist to block me, revealing the twisted, awkwardly bent position of his other arm: the wrist had snapped back one way, the forearm broken clean in half, his arm held on only by a thin thread of flesh that refused to give way. My first instinct was to rush in and help, but my body took over, sending my hand to my mouth to cover the scream.</p><p>Falcon appeared beside me, quickly sizing up the situation, but as he bent down to help the injured, even he drew back in blood-chilling shock. \u201cVampire\u2019s bones don\u2019t break,\u201d he said, grabbing my arm to move me away. \u201cWhat have you done to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I looked down at my hands, covering my face with them after. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun, Ara.\u201d He pointed up the steep steps. \u201cGet Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is he laying like that?\u201d I cried instead.</p><p>\u201cHis arm\u2019s broken.\u201d Falcon knelt beside Jason to take a look. \u201cHe needs help. Go!\u201d</p><p>Jason groaned, barely able to catch a breath, obviously suffering more agony than he\u2019d ever felt. Despite every ounce of damage I\u2019d ever seen him endure, this was, by far, the worst.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Ara!\u201d Falcon yelled.</p><p>I reached out and grabbed Arthur\u2019s arm as he shut the bedroom door. \u201cHow is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d He placed his medical kit on the ground by his feet and let out a breath through his nose, pulling me in for a very needed hug. \u201cHe wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he tell you how it happened?\u201d I asked, stepping back.</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d Arthur nodded, his distant eyes finding a smile a few seconds later. \u201cTelekinesis, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d I looked down at my hands. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>Arthur just shook his head, bending at the knees to pick up his bag, and walked away, shaking his head as a long whistle left his lips, carrying the sound of amazement down the hall with him. But I wasn\u2019t amazed, or surprised. I\u2019d nearly ripped off the entire arm of a vampire, whose bones were like iron-coated cement. How on earth did I manage to hurt him that way?</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason called, a mildly impatient tone coming out through the wooden door with his voice.</p><p>I pushed it open and poked my head in, showing my teeth in an apologetic grin.</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he said, reaching his good hand out. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but. . .\u201d I nodded at his arm in its sling, closing the door with my foot. \u201cI also kind of do.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the broken appendage and just smiled. \u201cWell, one thing I can safely say is, I have never ever felt so much pain, physical pain, in all my vampire life, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t.\u201d I covered my ears. \u201cI already feel bad enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure some people around here would praise you for it.\u201d He offered a timid smirk, to which I replied with a pout. \u201cTake a seat,\u201d he said and patted the bed. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, eyeing the brown leather-bound journal tucked in beside his leg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen I first started developing my powers, the telekinesis was the worst\u2014the hardest to control or accept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He held the book up. \u201cI started taking notes, assessing myself, testing my limits. This\u2014\u201d He passed it to me, and as I took hold of it, could actually feel the ancient energy within its pages\u2014could almost see the past. \u201cI\u2019m sure this will help you on your journey, too, Ara. I want you to have it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is your journal?\u201d I frayed the pages with my thumb, flipping it open to the first page.</p><p>\u201cYes. And it contains many secrets about my powers, so you must promise to keep it safe.\u201d</p><p>I hugged it to my chest. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He nodded once and shimmed down a little deeper into his covers, closing his eyes, though he didn\u2019t give the impression he wanted to sleep. \u201cYou did good today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI broke your arm. I hardly think that\u2019s good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d He opened one eye. \u201cBecause I think that\u2019s pretty damn amazing.\u201d</p><p>True. It was kind of amazing. A little. If I really thought about it. \u201cWell,\u201d I said lightly, standing up. \u201cNext time you\u2019ll think twice about making bets to win a kiss from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d he scoffed, laughing, \u201cIf that\u2019s the pain I have to go through to kiss you, then, no offence, but I\u2019ve got better things to do with my time.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGood. So do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019ve got a whole lot of reading to do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, I do.\u201d I held the book up, laying it on the bed after, my thoughtful gaze falling on its leather binding.</p> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s your hand?\u201d Jason asked softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I unfolded my fingers as he took it in his and traced a line down my palm.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, you know?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>He drew my palm to his lips and kissed it. \u201cI didn\u2019t heat that stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I thought you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise, Ara.\u201d He left my hand in his lap, still holding it. \u201cAs soon as the pain stops, I\u2019ll figure out how you did what you did, and then we\u2019ll get started on mastering it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout David\u2019s approval, huh?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has no say in this.\u201d His green eyes bore into mine with stern appeal. \u201cYou\u2019re showing signs of a power he knows nothing about. Husband or not, he can\u2019t stop me from helping you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he finds out what happened, I\u2019m not sure he will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope not. Because you melted that stone, Ara. I was in agony, never hurt so much in all my life, but I still saw you tip the water and sand remains away.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hand, reliving that moment. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s another power? Melting things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He closed his eyes and readjusted his head on the pillow. \u201cI think your blue light heated the stone\u2014almost like a reverse fulgurite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver seen what lightning does to sand?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cIt strikes the ground at such a high temperature for such a short time that, when it retracts again, the ground cools quickly and the sand turns to glass. I think maybe you heated the stone enough to basically melt it back to sand again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. That would have to be pretty hot, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs hot as lightning. About three-thousand-two-hundred-and-seventy degrees Fahrenheit to be exact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not sure yet if that\u2019s what it was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He winced, scrunching his eyes tight. \u201cBut I will figure it out, Ara. I promise you.\u201d</p><p>When I looked up from the journal, his eyes were open again, swearing that promise to me with all his heart.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I leaned over and planted a kiss to his cheek. \u201cGet some rest, Jase. I\u2019ll see ya later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, Ara,\u201d he said, and I closed his door behind me, shaking my head as a smile passed my lips for a moment. I knew I needed to go up and speak to Arthur about all this now. I knew he wouldn\u2019t just walk away, amazed by it all. But I needed to tell someone more important first.</p><p>\u201cYou did what!\u201d David\u2019s shock came right through the phone line and made me grin.</p><p>\u201cI . . . it just broke, David. Like, just snapped in half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d I heard him sigh. \u201cI took a tour through the Vampiric Institute of Science a few years back\u2014saw the Brokemon Test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Bro...it\u2019s a demonstration, really, more than a test, where they pit vampire against machine. And these were powerful machines, Ara. They\u2019d lay the vampire\u2019s arm under it and attempt to break the bone. The test was conclusive each time, sweetheart; One hundred per cent conclusive. The machines always failed. Now, I\u2019m not trying to undermine you here, but are you sure it broke?\u201d</p><p>I just laughed to myself a little. \u201cYou can talk to Arthur, if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d He went quiet for a second. \u201cDamn, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My smile grew.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what everyone says,\u201d I chirped.</p><p>\u201cEveryone? Who else have you told?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you. I mean, Arthur and Falcon know, and obviously, Jason, but no one else.\u201d</p><p>David went quiet again. \u201cHe\u2019s okay, though, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s healed now. It only took about six hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix hours? Why didn\u2019t you call me the second it happened, Ara? If that much time has passed\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. But we haven\u2019t been able to get hold of you. No service in the dungeons, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sorry. Didn\u2019t think of that.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cNow you\u2019re just starting to sound like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, rather than sound like you, can I have your power, please?\u201d he said, and I giggled. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re not supposed to be cooler than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe you\u2019ll get some wicked new talent soon. You\u2019ve only been officially sworn in on the Stone for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery true. I guess I have a whole month worth of a lifetime to find out, right?\u201d he said.</p><p>My shoulders sunk. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been nice to see how powerful you became after another century.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But, perhaps I\u2019ll pass that power down to my daughter.\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand across my belly, thinking about what Eve said. And a part of me wondered if maybe, in some small way, she meant that our child held the key to saving David. \u201cI did that pregnancy test.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I heard the smile in his voice.</p><p>\u201cIt was negative.\u201d</p><p>A long moment of silence followed before his deep, whispery voice came down the line, distorted with a bit of static. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always next time, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d he said in an almost quick, insincere manner. \u201cNow, what were you doing, exactly, when you broke my baby brother\u2019s arm?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI was running away so I wouldn\u2019t have to kiss him.\u201d</p><p>My ability to silence him surfaced again. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m going to assume there\u2019s quite a story behind that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is.\u201d I sat down on my bed and crossed my legs. \u201cRemember when I threw that guy at training the other day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase said it wasn\u2019t my blue light that did it. It was telekinesis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTelekinesis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Apparently I can snap bones with, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, just . . . I need a second to get my head around this.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, letting him have his second.</p><p>\u201cSo, you have telekinesis? You didn\u2019t snap his bone with your bare hands, but with . . . your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because I thought he was the one that was hurting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me I could move things with my mind, that the power had surfaced the other day out of necessity, and that if we could recreate a situation where I felt threatened, it would surface again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he hurt you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He tried to kiss me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He paused again, clearly seething on the other end of the line. \u201cJust give me the full story from start to finish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, he was throwing stones into the ocean, and I was headed down to the beach. I asked him to show me how to throw them with my mind, and he said we needed high stakes to force my power out of hiding. So we agreed that. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wager was a kiss?\u201d David asked, but not in a dull, flat tone, more like he was laughing.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. We were playing keep-off. If he got the stone, I had to kiss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he didn\u2019t get the stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So he didn\u2019t believe for a second that you\u2019d actually use that power, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he did. But I guess that was my grand prize\u2014the knowledge of power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. So you were running from him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But, when he captured the stone and he was standing right in front of me, all geared up to accept his prize, I couldn\u2019t do it. And I was holding the stone in my hand, and it got really hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Jase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d I corrected, rolling my eyes, \u201cwas doing it to me, you know, making it burn to make me fight. But even he got scared when my hand started melting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The stone got so hot my hand fused shut and I couldn\u2019t get it out. Jason stepped in to help me, but I thought he\u2019d make it worse. So I kind of, I dunno, I didn\u2019t want him to touch me, and then he just fell to the floor. When the stone stopped burning, his arm was broken, and I don\u2019t really remember doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you remember how you got the stone to stop burning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI melted it,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI felt it turn to cold glass in my hand, and then it just melted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . . you melted it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna need some time to process this,\u201d he said distractedly, then came back into the conversation with a completely different tone. \u201cOn another note, did you go see Arthur about that rash?\u201d</p><p>My hand went to my hip to scratch it. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>I inhaled to the deepest part of my lungs and let it out. According to the book Petey showed me, the one safely back under my bed, I already knew what the rash was. I just wasn\u2019t sure Arthur could mix up a remedy to fix a Mark of Betrayal, and I wasn\u2019t really sure what I\u2019d done wrong, either. So, until I figured this out, the last thing I wanted to do was tell anyone about it. \u201cHe\u2019s my uncle, David. I feel kind of funny talking to him about that stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Ara. The fact that he is your uncle is exactly why you can talk to him about anything. And he\u2019s seen it all, my love, not just every ailment known to man, but he\u2019s seen your entirely naked body, too. Who do you think stitched your organs back in after you fell off the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>I cringed.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t feel embarrassed around him. Just go show him and let him fix you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked at the floor just under the corner of my bed. \u201cI\u2019ll go see him now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. And call me as soon as you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I hung up and stuffed the phone in my pocket as I landed on my hands and knees and lowered my face to the ground, peering under the bed. The book was still there, undiscovered. Clearly the maids didn\u2019t sweep under here often.</p><p>I reached in and pulled it out, sitting with my back against the mattress after. There was only one sure-fire way to find a cure for anything, and that was to find the cause. But no matter how many times I studied this book, I never really found anything other than one conclusion about my role as this ordained goddess: I was an open book, and all my secrets were painted in cryptic ink on my body for all to see. None of the Marks I\u2019d read about seemed to be anything more than images that told stories; each one shaped differently according to what I liked to call its \u2018genre\u2019. I knew there were Marks that could cause the bearer damage, heartache, all kinds of things, but none of these fit that category. Not even this so-called Mark of Betrayal. Far as I knew, it was harmless.</p><p>I flipped through the pages again, taking mental notes, and when I came to the page Petey showed me, stopped and ran my hand over it. There was only the one English translation, and I hadn\u2019t yet learned enough words of the Ancient Language to decipher anything other than what I already knew. But I knew a few people who could. Only problem was, that would mean involving other people.</p> <p>I lifted my top and checked the Mark. Just like the drawing in front of me, it was snakelike, wrapping my waist and hip from my rib to the soft patch of skin just above my pubic bone. It was red, raised, itchy, and black on top, like an incomplete tattoo.</p><p>\u201cBetrayal.\u201d I read the word aloud, smudging the ink slightly with my fingertip. I hadn\u2019t done anything that would betray anyone, as far as I knew, unless Mother Nature considered falling off the lighthouse a betrayal.</p><p>I closed the book, shrugging. Maybe She did. Maybe, in Her opinion, being careless enough to be on a lighthouse and fall in the first place was betrayal. Who knew?</p><p>The only solid conclusion I had was that I\u2019d done something to betray someone or something and, as an Auress, I couldn\u2019t hide from it\u2014like every secret thought or act that betrayed my crown would be catalogued physically. And that thought made me look up, even though the answer wasn\u2019t above my sliding glass door. But something in my own words clicked: betrayal to the crown. There were things I could do as queen, decisions I could make to my own free will, provided I always had the peoples\u2019 best interests in mind. So maybe that was it. Maybe I\u2019d made some decision, committed some act that I hadn\u2019t realised was going against my crown. If I could figure that out and put it right, maybe I could get rid of this Mark myself. But, to figure it out, I\u2019d have to think carefully back to everything I did the day I fell off that lighthouse, and check that against my notes on the laws of the Lilithian reign, and maybe even against some of the known laws of Nature.</p><p>I snapped the book shut and stood up. I had a lot of study to do.</p><p>The flames burned low in the open fire across from me, their golden glow flickering against my hands and my books, lighting the words on the page. I could see now why Arthur lit the fire when he came here to read at night. It really was quite a lonely place, but not so desolate with those sparkling embers, and the smoky smell of burning wood kind of \u2018took me home\u2019 in a sense.</p> <p>I sat down with another book in hand to cross reference, but the lure of Jase\u2019s diary was calling me in a voice louder than the one seeking the answer about my Mark.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay. Just a little look,\u201d I said to myself and shoved the giant Book of Shadows aside, its dusty pages snapping shut like an iron door. Jase\u2019s book was small, no bigger than a short novel, with the leather having been bent so many times the spine was wrinkled and looked almost dirty between the cracks. I determined, as I gently unfolded the pages, that it must have been about a hundred years old. And I got a very sudden sense of respect for the wisdom Jase must have collected over that time.</p><p>The first page was titled by its date: 1914. There were scribbles and lines in the margins\u2014notes taken then corrected, some in different inks, as if he\u2019d come back to this page many times. In fact, all the pages seemed to be in the same condition, and I guessed he\u2019d experienced signs of his telekinesis long before he actually knew what it was. I scrolled down through the curvy text, looking for keywords, since I really didn\u2019t have time to sit and study the entire entry. When I spotted the words accidental and David, I narrowed my grid and read that passage:</p><p>My brother, David, staring back at me. He wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. I hadn\u2019t seen him for some months now, and to aim my gun right in his face and almost pull the trigger, well, let\u2019s just say that\u2019s not the happy reunion either of us expected. Our meeting was purely accidental, coincidental, who knows? But I was mighty glad to see the guy. For a while, I thought he was dead. I know that\u2019s not possible, but I worried anyhow.</p><p>\u201cThis must have been from the war,\u201d I whispered to myself, so awed by it that myself turned the page. \u201cNo.\u201d I slapped my own wrist and closed the book. \u201cStay on track.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d I replied and slid the giant Book of Shadows in front of me again, using a bit of might to pry it open and a bit of skill to stop the heavy pages on the right from flipping over and covering what I was reading on the left: the title page. Just the same as human parents once did in their family bibles, the names of each child in this witch\u2019s bloodline had been scribed on the first page, a sort of naming ritual. And there, at the bottom, right under Callon LeFay, was Morgana.</p><p>I held my breath. She was real. And this could be living proof that she at least grew old enough to read. Perhaps this book was passed down to her. Perhaps she knew all the spells by heart. Maybe she was wondering what ever happened to the book.</p><p>As I went to turn the page\u2014take a little stickybeak at some spells\u2014a certain combination of letters in a very unusual name stood out at me from the list: Anandene.</p> <p>\u201cAnandene?\u201d My nose crinkled. Anandene and Morgana were related?</p><p>There were no lines connecting the names. None that even connected Callon to Morgana, so there was no way to know if Anandene had been directly or distantly related to Morgana. The names were simply listed like required ingredients in a fancy dish.</p><p>Typical. I\u2019d opened this stupid book to find answers, and all it had done was create another bloody mystery.</p><p>I dropped my head into my hands.</p><p>As if I needed any more mysteries right now.</p><p>\u201cOoh, what spell are we doing?\u201d Eve said, sitting on the desk beside the book\u2014her legs crossed like a lady, an eager grin on her dead face.</p><p>\u201cWe are not doing any spells.\u201d I gently turned a few pages until they balanced equally on each side. \u201cI was hoping to find something that might get rid of unwanted ink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry the back of the book,\u201d she muttered in a hateful huff and vanished.</p><p>I scowled at the empty space. \u201cThanks for your help.\u201d</p><p>As the coals in the fireplace burned to embers and the early morning chill of an approaching autumn settled around my nose and ears, I flipped past hundreds of spells that healed broken or sick things, potions mixed for ailments and hopes, and when I came to the end of the book, found a stack of notes and spells stuffed in between the last page and the hard cover. One was a love spell. I tossed it aside. Did not need that. One was a sleeping spell. I tucked that into my pocket for the next time I needed an easy escape. But the last one I unfolded was written in another language, the page so thin and delicate I wasn\u2019t sure it was actually ever paper.</p><p>I laid it beside a sheet parchment and scribbled down the symbols and words exactly, copying the pictures and the diagrams, then stuffed it all back in the book and closed it. I wasn\u2019t sure what the spell did, but I knew of some translation books that could help me figure it out. And, also, I had Jason. He could read that language as well as Arthur could. I knew he\u2019d help if I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Aide-Memoire de l\u2019Auress, an encyclopaedia of Lilithian law, and several books on magic,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWhat could our young queen be searching for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d I gasped, flipping the books closed and most certainly losing my pages. \u201cWhat are you doing up so late?\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a chair beside me and sat down, moving a few books upward to make room for his elbow. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a sleeper.\u201d</p><p>I felt the weight of being sprung bare down on me, making my whole face go hot. My fingers wrung the hem of my dress tightly and my eyes wouldn\u2019t shift from the books. I needed to come up with an excuse for having these titles checked out, but I couldn\u2019t think of one. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain anything to me, princess.\u201d He reached across and patted my hand. \u201cI was just teasing, but,\u201d he said as he stood up. \u201cIf you need help with anything, you know you can come to me, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, keeping my eyes on the books.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d I saw him bow his head once in my peripheral. \u201cI shall leave you to it. Just don\u2019t stay up too much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said, then spun in my chair to look at him. \u201cArthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my dear.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, still considering my words. \u201cI . . . I have a rash.\u201d</p><p>His eyes squared off a bit under a furrowed brow. \u201cWhat kind of rash?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, this kind.\u201d I stood up and lifted my top. \u201cI already know it\u2019s a Mark of Betrayal,\u201d I said, and Arthur\u2019s eyes met mine. \u201cI just can\u2019t. . .\u201d I motioned to the books behind me. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d</p><p>He looked away, slowly exhaling. \u201cI may know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I stepped closer. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s. . .\u201d He seemed to be considering his words very carefully, looking from the books to me, and back again. \u201cEventually, you will figure it out. Eventually, it will not be a secret I can keep but, for now\u2014\u201d He bowed once. \u201cI must ask you not to seek the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I fear the truth could bring you more harm than a little rash on your flesh.\u201d</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest, but took a second and let the words simmer through me instead, considering them, taking them for every ounce of meaning I could hear in his undertone and thinking long and hard in that second whether or not I wanted to challenge him. \u201cOkay, so, maybe don\u2019t tell me the truth right now, but at least tell me how it could bring me harm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose your husband in a few short months, Amara.

And I\u2019ve told David the same.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat does he know about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows it\u2019s not a rash, my dear. He wasn\u2019t born yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t know what kind of Mark it is, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Which is why he\u2019s been looking for that book.\u201d He nodded to the table.</p><p>\u201cThe Journal of the Auress?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and you must keep it from him at all costs, Amara.\u201d He used a tone of \u2018grave warning\u2019, but it only made me laugh. He might have known the full weight of what he said but, to me, I couldn't piece anything together based on that statement, and it just wasn\u2019t going to be enough to quash my curiosity\u2014not for this version of me, anyway.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth he will find in that journal will be too much for him to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if we want the truth, even if it has something to do with destroying happy memories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, I guess you have a lot of reading to do, my dear.\u201d He nodded to my books then turned on his heel. \u201cBecause you\u2019ll not be hearing it from me.\u201d</p><p>I huffed, dropping my hands to my hips as Arthur walked away. \u201cHow rude.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe means well,\u201d Eve said, suddenly beside me. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t want to be the one that hurts you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts me?\u201d I looked sideways at her then back at the empty library. \u201cHow would he hurt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you figure out the puzzle, you\u2019ll understand why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPuzzle. What puzzle?\u201d I frowned. \u201cAnd, hey, why did you push me out the window the other day?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her young face looking innocent. \u201cTo free your soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFree my. . .? How would that free my soul? Eve?\u201d I called, circling on the spot a few times, but the ghost was gone.</p><p>I always loved the manor kitchen, with its warm, country feel, wood counter tops crowning rustic-looking cupboards, and a giant old dining table that centred the space\u2014its washed, fading green colour stylishly unmatched by the white chairs pushed in under it. The whole room had that \u2018grandmother\u2019s kitchen\u2019 kind of feel, with a collection of herbs and spices grown fresh in the garden then hung inside over the windows or the stove, and a pot rack suspended from thick black chains over an island counter. But my favourite thing about this place was that, in the morning, the soft scent of fresh bread, toasted slowly over an open flame, would accompany the rich aroma of Italian Roast, drawing me gently awake the closer I got.</p><p>I wandered in and sat down, swinging my legs under the table as the carbon copy of Mike placed a mug and a pitcher of cream in front of me. \u201cHey, Falcon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorning, My Queen. Sleep well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing I had Quaid outside my door all night?\u201d I grinned. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d He sat down. \u201cI sleep better when I have a guard on you. I just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I don\u2019t usually order it every night. But, last night, I had a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunch?\u201d My brow arched, the scepticism hidden behind my coffee mug as I took a sip. It was no creamy, sugary delight, like David\u2019s coffee, but it was nice to have someone make it for me. \u201cWhat kind of hunch?\u201d</p><p>He exhaled loudly, swiping his thumb across his bottom lip. \u201cWhenever I get those . . . feelings, you usually end up in some kind of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t last night.\u201d I flashed a cheesy grin, cocking my head like an innocent puppy.</p><p>\u201cNo. But we did pick up a suspicious scent around the border of the manor this morning. Whoever it was, they may have been on their way to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, creepy.\u201d I dusted myself off jokingly. \u201cAnyway, I wasn\u2019t in my room for most of last night. I was reading in the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He sipped his coffee. \u201cWhat were you looking for? Anything I can help with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHopefully. That\u2019s why I asked you here this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to show you something,\u201d I said, feeling a little awkward.</p><p>He sat back, folding his arms as if waiting for me to tell him I\u2019d gotten myself into some kind of mess. \u201cNeed to show me what, exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad. I mean, I hope.\u201d I stood and lifted my shirt, scooping my jeans down an inch to show where the black rash snuck down below my pubic line.</p><p>\u201cThe Mark of Betrayal,\u201d he said, clearing his throat after.</p><p>\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d I twisted at the waist a little to look all the way around at the back of my hip.</p><p>\u201cI happen to have extensively studied anything to do with you, your body, your past, and your bloodline, Ara. Of course I know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve studied me?\u201d I lowered my top and pulled my jeans up again.</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty, I am Head of the Queen\u2019s Guard. That role comes with certain expectations.\u201d He walked over to the sink and dumped his cup in there. \u201cI should be the number-one most educated man in this manor when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how do you know what kind of Mark it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it wraps your torso from your heart to your hip\u2014it\u2019s the only Mark of its kind. And the question is, Ara\u2014\u201d He propped one foot on the seat of the chair, resting his arm over his knee. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I leaned my butt on the tabletop. \u201cI was hoping maybe if I could figure out what kinds of things would give me this Mark, then maybe I could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, what ever it is you\u2019ve done, to be Marked with that symbol, it has to have been something pretty spectacular.\u201d He dropped his foot to the floor, standing tall again. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the Four Detriments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are four things a queen can do that ultimately betray her crown, her people or herself. You don\u2019t need to figure out so much what it is you did, but perhaps whom you did it to. And there should be a symbol somewhere in that mess of a rash all over you that reveals it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, which one.\u201d I lifted my top and poked at the black line.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He put my top down for me. \u201cAnd stop doing that. If anyone walks past, they\u2019ll think we\u2019re being inappropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry, Falcon. That wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Just. . .\u201d His eyes drifted away from me. \u201cJust be more careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop saying sorry.\u201d He pulled the chair out and sat down, offering me my seat again. \u201cHow long have you had the Mark, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt started as a red rash after I fell off the lighthouse, and it\u2019s just been changing since then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you jump?\u201d he asked, and silence befell the room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My mouth opened, but I was so shocked by the question I struggled to form an answer. \u201cNo way. I\u2019d never do something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? Maybe you were so depressed about David being away that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Falcon, that\u2019s ludicrous.\u201d I jumped up and walked over to the sink. \u201cIt would take a lot more than that to make me want to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBingo.\u201d He appeared beside me. \u201cThen, what did you do before you ended up on the lighthouse that night?\u201d</p><p>My immediate reaction was to protest. But I stopped. What if something really bad had happened, and I did actually jump? I mean, David was there that night. What if he and I had an argument\u2014what if he told me the truth about going to his death, and that\u2019s why I jumped, knowing I didn\u2019t want to live without him? It would make sense. It would explain why he was so hell-bent on keeping the truth from me. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t that at all. Maybe, just like my gut had been trying to tell me, it had something to do with Jason. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything that would be bad enough to make me want to die, can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know, Ara.\u201d He shrugged, stepping away. \u201cUnfortunately, there are no books I can study that get inside your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut someone can.\u201d A suggestive grin teased my lips. \u201cSomeone can get in my head and go back to that night\u2014see what happened.\u201d</p><p>He settled back on his heels. \u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Maybe I could ask him to, I dunno, hypnotise me and take me back on a past-month regression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad idea, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, A: he\u2019s not allowed near you, especially when the king is absent. And, B: until we know exactly what happened and whether or not you did, in fact, jump, every person in this manor is guilty until proven innocent. Including David,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cWhy David? He\u2019d never hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that. And neither do you, really. He\u2019s pretty vial, Ara, especially when it comes to the law. For all we know, he pushed you off the lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he push me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knows? All I know is that he was out there that night, and it\u2019s a pretty convenient story that he just happened to return here to \u201ctalk\u201d with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. It\u2019s my job to protect you, Your Majesty, even if that means from the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I should go to Jason, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you know it wasn\u2019t him?\u201d He let that hang for a second. \u201cHe was the last one to see you that night, Ara. Not to mention, your memory is gone. How do we know he didn\u2019t erase it?\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my head. \u201cSo we tell no one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, let me take a good look at the book of Marks, and another good look at your body\u2014in private.\u201d He looked around as if someone might have heard him say that. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t come up with an answer, then we\u2019ll discuss further investigation, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And just until we\u2019ve figured this out, I want guards on you at night.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cOkay. If that eases your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will.\u201d He nodded once.</p><p>\u201cAnd, thank you, Falcon\u2014for helping me out with this.\u201d I motioned to my Mark.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always my pleasure, Majesty, and I know I don\u2019t need to say it, but . . . you can trust this information will go no further than me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot to Mike?\u201d</p><p>He held back a small laugh. \u201cEspecially not to Mike.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d I said, popping my head around Jason\u2019s door.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, come in.\u201d His arm rose in a wave from his huddle over the spread of papers in front of him.</p><p>I stopped a second to look back at Falcon. \u201cComing, Fal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He gave a small nod of approval. \u201cI can hear everything from out here.\u201d</p><p>I flashed him a grin and closed Jason\u2019s door behind me, shutting us into his room, alone. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know why the stone melted. But that wasn\u2019t why I asked you here.\u201d He leaned his butt against the table and folded his arms. \u201cYou were thinking about something at breakfast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m always thinking about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this thought involved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I wondered over and sat on the blanket box at the foot of his bed. \u201cWhat thought was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have something you want me to translate into English.\u201d</p><p>My fingertips slowly moved to my hip pocket. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He held his hand out. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what kind of spell it is\u2014or if it even is a spell,\u201d I said, passing him the page I found last night.</p><p>He considered it for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s a junction fabricator.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt creates pathways over the dead.\u201d He turned around and laid it on the desk, grabbing another sheet of paper and a pen.</p><p>\u201cThe dead? Do you mean, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike brings dead things back to life, if the body isn\u2019t damaged. But it\u2019s not black magic,\u201d he added quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a kind of highway, you might say, that guides a soul from one realm to another and puts it where you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRealm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Think of it as if we live in layers.\u201d He laid one hand over the other in the air. \u201cUp top, we have the spirit realm, and below, we have the mortal realm.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd this spell makes a path for a person to cross sides?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo cross back, yeah. Unless its body had no head, or something like that.\u201d He leaned over the page again and started taking notes. I watched the symbols on one page turn to English on the other under his pen tip, picturing the actions of the spell in my head. \u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d Jason said without looking up, and I stared at him, waiting, but he didn\u2019t elaborate.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s something else?\u201d</p><p>He stopped writing with a rather expressive full stop and dumped his pen down. \u201cThis rash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow it to me.\u201d He looked at my waist.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s not what you think it is, and I want to see how much it\u2019s changed.\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly inched my shirt up my ribs and drew my tummy in a bit as his warm hands cupped my waist. He knelt down in front of me, his tepid breath calling the tiny hairs above my jeans to attention, and spun me this way and that, frowning, tracing lines over the black rash.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019ve already decided it\u2019s a Mark of Betrayal, but it\u2019s not because you\u2019ve done anything wrong, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s it from?\u201d I pulled my top down as Jason stood up again.</p><p>He propped his shoulder on the tall bedpost, his legs leaned out long, arms folded, making me feel small under his penetrating gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s betrayal of the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the heart?\u201d I touched my chest absently. \u201cIn what way?\u201d</p><p>He just shrugged, lowering his face to hide that sheepish grin.</p><p>\u201cOh, right. You think I love you, huh?\u201d I said jokingly.</p><p>But he just shrugged again. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. Just don\u2019t, okay.\u201d He raised both palms. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring you here to argue about your feelings, Ara. I just wanted you to stop trying to figure out what you did wrong.\u201d His arms fell to his sides. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d</p><p>I walked a little closer, my eyes narrowing with curiosity, and stopped right in front of him. \u201cI think I know what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked, his eyes a little wider than normal.</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d I had to tell him. I had to tell someone what happened between Arthur and I in the training room that night\u2014the night I fell of the lighthouse. Or jumped.</p><p>\u201cI already know, Ara. And that has nothing to do with the Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know about my uncle and the training hall, and the . . . turkey baster plan you came up with after.\u201d</p><p>Invisible lava coated my cheeks. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He glanced back at his bed and reversed a few steps to sit on it. \u201cI found you that night. You were . . . Mike was there, too. He was towering over you, yelling at you, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI punched him in the face and took you up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went down there to drop some cuffs off, and he found you half naked on the floor, wearing only Arthur\u2019s shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I covered my mouth. \u201cSo he\u2019s known? This entire time, he knew what I planned to do with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He looked up from the floor. \u201cI erased everything about Arthur from his mind the next day. And then I erased yours, took everything from the moment he walked into the training hall that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne?\u201d I prompted.</p><p>\u201cOne: you were distressed about it all\u2014about Mike knowing. And, two: he would have told David about this plan you and Arthur had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you stopped him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but not just because David would freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Mike. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was irate, Ara. He got scared. He thought you\u2019d actually slept with Arthur\u2014that David would hate you now. And all he could think about was the pieces of you he had to pick up last time David left. He just didn\u2019t want to see you like that again. And. . .\u201d His lips folded into a thin line. \u201cHe overreacted. He slapped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlapped me?\u201d My neck jutted outward like a jumper on a skyscraper.</p><p>\u201cYeah. It was just a shitty situation, Ara. I was mad with him at first but . . . I understand what he was going through then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelusions of grandeur?\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed. \u201cProbably. All that aside, though, he was packing his bag the next morning, about to quit and go back to Australia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you still needed him, so. . .\u201d he continued. \u201cI erased it from his mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then I jumped off the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me curiously. \u201cWhat makes you think you jumped?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cJust a hunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHunch, huh?\u201d He sighed, both hands going to his head as he flopped back on his bed.</p><p>\u201cYou know why I jumped, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen. . .\u201d I walked over and sat down beside his leg. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye and looked out from behind his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s better left buried, Ara. Believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He sat up again, coming to stop with my hand in his. \u201cYou trust me, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd you know that\u2014\u201d He squeezed my hand. \u201cI always have your best interests at heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d I nodded again.</p><p>\u201cThen, can you wait? Please. Ask me to tell you another time, maybe when David\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is it because of what happened with Arthur?\u201d</p><p>He tensed, wincing. \u201cKind of. But not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase.\u201d I laid my other hand over his. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t just let this go. You\u2019d be better off telling me the truth now\u2014save me all the investigation and worry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his lovely white teeth making me a little hungry for the bite. \u201cI want what\u2019s best for you, Ara. We all do. But if I tell you what happened that night, it\u2019ll make you hate yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I want to berate myself for something I did, that\u2019s my prerogative, Jase. Not yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He nodded, his distracted gaze moving toward his window. \u201cAnd I will tell you. But not today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmpf!\u201d I mashed my features together in a scowl. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to sound like David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s the last thing I want to say to you, Ara, but I have to protect you. And you know I always tell you the truth, but this time, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re between a rock and hard place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He exhaled through a smile. \u201cI just need your understanding on this one, just for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded. \u201cFine. But you\u2019ve got two weeks, and that\u2019s it. Then, you better tell me what the hell happened that night. Fair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPinkie promise.\u201d</p><p>He laid his pinkie over mine and shook once. \u201cI promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now, what was this conclusion you drew about my melting stone problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He stood up quickly. \u201cSo, I was right about the lightning theory\u2014the fulgurite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were.\u201d I stood beside him at the table.</p><p>\u201cYes. You really didn\u2019t wanna kiss me, did you?\u201d He turned to me, smiling.</p><p>\u201cUm. Kinda not really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He lifted my chin, green eyes meeting blue in a world of acceptance. \u201cBut, that fear\u2014for whatever reason you didn\u2019t want to kiss me, ignited your fight instinct in the method of which you've been practicing most, but when your hand heated up, the temperature acted to reverse the process of making rock, you might say, by turning it back to its original state.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Wow. And . . . did you get a headache when you used your light?\u201d he asked, wearing a huge I-know-what-I\u2019m-talking-about grin.</p><p>\u201cUm. Now I think of it.\u201d I touched my head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He grabbed a stack of papers and started writing. \u201cThat just confirms my theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got scared, focused your concerns too much on the rock. You made it the problem, so, your electric energy rose up to protect you. Your skin melted, you felt the pain, thought I was causing it, and broke my arm to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I gathered that much.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cRight, but. . .\u201d He tapped the page once with his pen. \u201cI don\u2019t believe your blue light thing is actually meant to be used as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would it be for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure.\u201d He rubbed his brow. \u201cI need to think.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I took a step back. \u201cShall I come back later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019ll come see you at training. Tell Blade I\u2019ll be there: he can get the others to back off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked at the door then back at Jase. \u201cSo this is what the crazy scientist part of you looks like?\u201d</p><p>He stopped writing and slowly looked up, turning his gaze on me a second later. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I held both hands up. \u201cGo ahead and theorise. If you can figure out how to make me melt stone again, that\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more worried about your headaches, right now, sweet girl,\u201d he said, and turned away to scribble things down. \u201cIf you wanna melt stone again, just go sit on the beach with one in your hand, Ara, and think back to how you felt the other day. Reliving the same emotions should give you the ability to recreate the scenario. Just\u2014\u201d He stopped and held up his arm, sporting a smart grin. \u201cDo it alone.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cOkay. Maybe I\u2019ll go out there after training today, if I have time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He went back to his pages. \u201cAnd, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d I stopped by the open door.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I skipped over and took the translated spell from him. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny time,\u201d he said, without even looking up.</p><p>The training hall was empty, except for the lone knight in the corner, taking out what looked like a year\u2019s worth of fury on the punching bag. His arms were tight, the muscles lean and long, covered in a thin layer of perspiration, which I gathered wasn\u2019t so much from the punching but from the restraint he was using not to break that bag.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He looked up and wiped his wrist over his chin, then hit the bag again. \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I uh\u2014\u201d I looked out the windows to see if anyone else was coming. \u201cI wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about?\u201d</p><p>I stopped with both hands on the weighted bag to steady it. \u201cYou okay, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He gave it another hit, the sheer force absorbed by my buckling knees. \u201cJust girl troubles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGirl troubles?\u201d</p><p>There was something odd about the way he looked at me then, as if maybe he thought I already knew\u2014or should know. \u201cWhat\u2019d you want, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I wiped my hands on my jeans. \u201cDo you remember the night I fell off the lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, then turned to the bench behind him and grabbed a towel, disappearing under it for a second. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I tell you something, will you promise not to investigate further until I say so?\u201d</p><p>His scruffy hair stuck up from out of the towel first, followed by his wide caramel eyes. \u201cI make no guarantees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d say that.\u201d I spun on my heel and headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he called, grabbing my arm. \u201cJust . . . what do you know, Ara? If it\u2019s something that puts you in danger, I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve heard from two people so far that if I know the full story, it could lead to some problems between David and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Now, that\u2019s concern enough right there.\u201d He flopped the towel over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know. But you either agree to my terms, or I walk.\u201d</p><p>He repositioned the towel. \u201cWhat terms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise me you won\u2019t rough up my source.\u201d</p><p>He rocked back on his heels, his lip curling in disgust. \u201cYour source is Jason, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. I could see Mike was in a tough spot here. He knew I wouldn\u2019t come to him unless the information I had was good, but he also knew I wouldn\u2019t share one shred of it if I thought Jason might get hurt.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d he rescinded. \u201cI won\u2019t torture the little shit for information. Now, what d\u2019you wanna tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit me.\u201d</p><p>His brow folded, but then he laughed.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Mike. You hit me because you thought I slept with Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he coughed. \u201cAra, that\u2019s . . . I\u2019d remember thinking something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d I smirked.</p><p>His arms fell heavily to his sides. \u201cNob-head erased it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I don\u2019t remember coming down here the night you fell.\u201d He looked over to the weapons shelf where the cuffs sat\u2014all lined up like shining reminders. \u201cSo, what, you were down here, and I. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could smell Arthur had been here, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing here with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalking. Where no one could hear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he cut in before I could finish.</p><p>\u201cWe were trying to find a way to save David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUsing the dagger to kill Drake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about it then?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t have sex with Arthur, Mike,\u201d I promised. \u201cExcept. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t listen,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cAnd I. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slapped me.\u201d</p><p>He looked at my face for a long moment, his eyes going smaller with thought. \u201cI\u2019d never do that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Jason said he found you the next day, packing to leave because of it. He knew I needed you here, so he erased it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you believe him?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Mike\u2019s hands went into his hair. He walked backward until he found the bench, then sat down. \u201cAra, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Mike.\u201d I appeared beside him. \u201cYou were stressed and worried. I get that. But I know you. I mean, I don\u2019t have any memory of you coming down here, only my talk with Arthur beforehand,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I know you wouldn\u2019t have hurt me. It was probably a pathetic little tap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn't make it okay, Ar.\u201d He stood up again, slipping a shirt over his head and down his ribs. \u201cI\u2019m the chief of security\u2014the one person in the world who is trusted to protect you, and I . . . I hit you?\u201d His eyes narrowed as he muttered the last words in stunned disbelief.</p><p>\u201cAw, Mike?\u201d I stood up. \u201cMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He opened himself up for a hug. \u201cI\u2019m glad you did, Ara. It\u2019s . . . I should know.\u201d</p><p>I fell into his sweaty embrace. \u201cIf it means anything, Mike, I forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw.\u201d He kissed my head firmly. \u201cYou\u2019re a good girl, Ara. But, I. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ended up falling off a lighthouse after that. Are you sure I didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t throw me off it, Mike. You went up to your room, and Jason took me back to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . does he know how you ended up out there that night?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI think Arthur knows something, too. But. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Falcon and I have been doing some research, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcon?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s my go-to guy.\u201d</p><p>Mike half frowned, half smiled. I could tell he was as pleased as he was shocked.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cwe think maybe I jum\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Falcon swept into the room, flanked by Blade and Quaid, the three of them making an awful lot of racket\u2014certainly enough to drown out anything I might have said.</p><p>\u201cWhazzup, guys?\u201d Mike flashed them a toothy grin, turning his head to whisper, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk later,\u201d under his breath.</p><p>I nodded, patting his arm, and Mike skipped off into the mix as if the guys hadn\u2019t just tried to silence me. However, I was not so willing to play nice. Instead, I marched straight up to Falcon at full speed, grabbed his giant arm and hauled him outside. \u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d</p><p>He leaned down a little so the general distance from his mouth to my ear wouldn\u2019t factor out discretion. \u201cIf you tell him you jumped, you can forget living, Ara. He\u2019ll cover you with guards twenty-four-seven, and he\u2019ll call David home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a right to know, Falcon. How can he protect me if he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the one protecting you right now. I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But when it comes to your safety, that is the very thing clouding his vision. I still don\u2019t know why you jumped or if it might\u2019ve had something to do with David, so I don\u2019t want the king back here until we\u2019ve had a chance to figure it out.\u201d</p><p>We stepped apart as a group of knights walked between us and into the hall, both of us staying quiet until they were well and truly inside and the only noise out here was the gentle summer breeze and the chirping of birds in the trees.</p><p>\u201cMike knows you butted in deliberately then, Fal.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell him it\u2019s because you were about to say something I didn\u2019t want Quaid and Blade to overhear.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the three of them in the centre of the training hall, laughing loudly like they were trying to hear their own voices over a storm. \u201cThey know, don\u2019t they\u2014Blade and Quaid?\u201d</p><p>Falcon nodded. \u201cI briefed them.\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms in, watching the man across the room that I was once so close to\u2014the man I could trust with anything. \u201cIt\u2019s so wrong that you\u2019re leaving Mike out of the loop, Falcon.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Mike, too. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s too close to you, Ara. I believe this is best\u2014and I\u2019ve got ten years of Special Forces training to back my claim.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial Forces, huh?\u201d I elbowed him softly.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He winked, leading me away with a gentle hand to my shoulder. \u201cLet\u2019s finish up with training for today, then we\u2019ll go to the library and put in a few more hours\u2019 research on the Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019kay,\u201d I said glumly. \u201cIf I\u2019m not crippled with a headache after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething tells me you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I frowned up at his grin. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike cut in, jogging over. \u201cYou\u2019re up first today. We\u2019re gonna do weapons training after dinner instead. I need to make a report on your blue light for David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe asked about it\u2014said his reasons were on a \u201cneed to know\u201d basis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t need to know?\u201d I asked, winking at him.</p><p>\u201cGuess not.\u201d He backed away. \u201cI think he\u2019s just worried. He said something happened on the beach the other day.\u201d He eyed Falcon suspiciously, then asked me, \u201cAnything you wanna share?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm.\u201d My gaze flicked to Falcon, whose face pretty much said \u2018Don\u2019t you dare\u2019. \u201cI\u2019ll check with David first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me. So\u2014\u201d Mike clapped his hands loudly and looked around the room. \u201cVolunteers?\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room went dead quiet, half of them casting their gaze to the floor\u2014fifty strapping young lads, shirtless and manly, all cowering before a girl half their size.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Mike rolled his sleeves up. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I started. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p> <p>He leaned in and cupped my arm. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I deserve it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>At first I was confused, until I realised he meant that he deserved the pain for the slap he\u2019d given me. \u201cFine.\u201d I grinned, rubbing my hands together. \u201cPay back time.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cThen we\u2019re even, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even close.\u201d I bared my teeth at him. \u201cBut I might consider forgiveness if you make me some of your famous brownies later.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, smiling, and moved to the centre of the room. \u201cClear the space, everyone.\u201d</p><p>Everyone moved back five paces, giving Mike and I plenty of battleground.</p> <p>\u201cWhere would you like me to fire, Mikey?\u201d I asked, resting my hands on my knees. \u201cCause, personally, I\u2019d like to shoot you in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! Good luck.\u201d He turned and offered me a small glimpse of his butt. \u201cThis knight is way too quick for\u2014Ah!\u201d He jolted forward and hit the deck, a rush of blue filling the space around him, as if a glow-worm just farted, retreating back into my fingertips after.</p><p>The entire room of knights, both vampire and Lilithian, broke into burly laugher, and from the corner of my eye, I saw greenback exchange hands.</p><p>\u201cWhere shall I shoot you next?\u201d</p><p>Mike stumbled to his feet, rubbing his bottom. \u201cWhy not aim for the heart?\u201d He faced me again. \u201cYou did a pretty good job of banging it up last time, maybe you can finish it off.\u201d</p><p>The crowd roared, half with laughter, the other half with a very long \u201cOoooh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeart sounds great,\u201d I said, and flicked a bolt of energy toward him, but he ducked to one side and swept under it, charging forward fast before I even realised I hadn\u2019t hit him. I coughed out as I went down on my back, the ground rattling my spine like an iron hammer on a twig. I was sure I even heard something crack.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Mike leaned back a bit.</p> <p>\u201cSure,\u201d I said in a squeezed voice, using my pain to distract him, then hooked my ankle up and around his chest, forcing him onto the ground as I rose up to pin him flat with both knees. \u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>He whacked the ground with a flat palm three times, and I eased my kneecap back off his throat.</p><p>\u201cSorry, too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d He shoved me back on my butt and skittered away. \u201cSilly girl. You had me then, were it not for your compassion.\u201d</p><p>I got to my feet and stood ready to take him on, but he waved in three more knights from the sidelines, and the odds suddenly changed in their favour. But I had a new weapon up my sleeve, something none of them could fight if I could just figure out how to use it.</p><p>\u201cTo your right, Majesty,\u201d a man called, coming in from my left.</p><p>I saw him shift before I heard his voice, though, so his attempt to distract me was futile. My fist drove a new path for blood through two bones in his ribs, burning the hole closed with a bolt of blue energy after. He fell to the floor just as knight number two dove into the fray and cupped the side of my face from behind, twisting my neck to the highest point of resistance. I dropped my hand down by my hip and shot him in the balls, logging his screams of horror in my feel-bad-about-it-later thoughts. It wasn\u2019t over yet. We had fifty more knights in here that\u2019d willingly take me down.</p><p>But it was Mike\u2019s hands that wrapped my waist. \u201cGoing for a man\u2019s family jewels, Ara. That\u2019s low. Even for you,\u201d he whispered in my ear, then flipped me upside down, dropping me to the floor with one knee on my chest, the other pinning my head by the ponytail. \u201cYield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d I struggled against him for a second, then pushed a hand into his chest and shot him right through the heart. I smelled the flesh burn, saw it melt as the shock registered in his eyes a second before he flew back. And two knights grabbed me as Mike hit the ground, dragging me to my feet.</p><p>I yanked my arm from one grip and elbowed the guy in the ribs, swinging my wrist up to his jaw with another jolt of energy. He went down hard, but the knight on my right wasn\u2019t giving in, and the pain in my head slowly grew, strengthening for each shot.</p><p>This guy was twice my size in both height and weight, and he was a vampire. I had nothing on him physically. But . . . mentally.</p><p>I focused hard on his arm, feeling my face and hands go hotter, the pain in my head rippling throughout my jaw and neck. My blue light seemed useless against him\u2014the man wearing it like a Christmas tree parades its candles, and the telekinesis wasn\u2019t working either. I couldn't find that place in me that\u2019d awakened when I broke Jase\u2019s arm. Maybe it was there, maybe it was afraid to come out again because of how devastated I felt after I hurt Jase. But if the power didn\u2019t surface, I\u2019d lose this battle to a vampire and, in turn, probably lose a lot of respect among the Core.</p><p>One of us was going down in the next ten-seconds, though, and it wasn\u2019t going to be me. I knew this guy\u2019s strategy: he\u2019d stand there and cop the pain until it got too much for me\u2014until I threw the towel in. But he was hurting, too. That much was clear, and if my energy was at full strength like it had been when I first shot Mike, this guy wouldn\u2019t even be standing. But the colour was fading, the light more of a white than a blue. I knew the vampire could take the pain, but I was sure even he had a limit.</p><p>I brought my hand up to his face and pushed him backward. He fought me for a second, but his weight shifted suddenly and mercifully, and he let go of my arm, stumbling back a few steps.</p><p>\u201cGet back in there, Phelps!\u201d the knights surrounding us called, barking like dogs on the sidelines.</p><p>I blocked them all out and sent another jolt at the vampire to finish him. He dodged, though, and the pain in my head intensified, rising up my arm. I screamed, caging my head in my arms as I landed on my knees. I had to get up. I couldn\u2019t quit now, not when I was this close.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike called.</p><p>I turned my head and saw myself in the reflection of his eyes as they met mine\u2014saw all the fear and amazement he felt inside radiating out of him, right into the deepest part of me. I heard him speak, saw his lips move and even felt him run a finger under my nose, collecting something wet, but the words didn\u2019t really register. My electric hold was locked onto the vampire, and he was going down, come hell or high water.</p><p>\u201cAra, stop,\u201d Mike yelled, pulling my hand down. \u201cLook at the floor.\u201d</p><p>My eyes drifted away from the lock of an angered gaze at the standing knight, and saw a pool of blood flooding my feet. I wondered how it got there\u2014if someone had been hurt. I wondered why Mike hadn\u2019t called for them to see the nurse. I was about to tell him to do something, tell him to help the person who was bleeding, when Mike\u2019s words shot past me in a mighty growl, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaving her life,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>I felt him touch me\u2014felt his hands on me, felt the world move under the swaying in my head, but I didn\u2019t see him move me. I didn\u2019t see anything until I felt the grass under my fingertips, Jason pinning my wrists to the ground, holding them there.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d he demanded, then looked up at the approaching crowd. \u201cEveryone stay where they are damn well standing, or her head will explode.\u201d</p><p>The earth heated under my hands, like touching a cake fresh from the oven. It smelled like warm clay on a hot summer\u2019s day\u2014the grass giving off a little smoke. Mike took one step closer and watched on with his mouth agape as the light from my hands went bright white, melting the sand to mud in the cup of my palm, the liquid rising up my arms and through my veins, assimilating the pain in my head, like warm water over cold toes. My spine eased to relaxed, my neck rising from within the safety of my collar bones, and I rocked back on my knees, resting on my sit-bones beside Jason, who held a stern gaze at Mike, one finger still aimed in case my beloved BFF saw fit to interfere.</p><p>\u201cWhat. . .\u201d I started, breathless, \u201cjust happened?\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cThe pain\u2019s gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that pain\u2019s gone.\u201d I pressed three fingertips to my temple. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cIt worked. I can\u2019t believe it actually worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worked?\u201d</p><p>He spun me at the shoulders and held them both tight. \u201cI went through a thousand conclusions: that maybe you were a negative terminal of a battery, and the knights you were shooting were positive, causing a short circuit. Then I thought maybe you were what\u2019s known as a \u2018loose circuit,\u2019 because the energy wasn\u2019t passing through a load, but that didn\u2019t really fit, either. And then I came up with what proved to be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Nature\u2019s energy. You\u2019re drawing it from the earth, and you can use it, but it needs to go back into the earth after.\u201d He pushed his dark locks from his face, his smile so radiant you\u2019d think he was a kid at a circus. \u201cWhen you use it for that purpose, you\u2019re the negative terminal, the knights the load, and the earth the positive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me right now,\u201d I said with a soft chuckle, \u201cbut my head doesn\u2019t hurt, so I don\u2019t really care.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and helped me to my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll show you more about it later. I have an entire report on it, but I gotta write this down before I forget what\u2019s. . .\u201d He tapped his head. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on here. I gotta g\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d Mike pushed in and swathed me like a blanket. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I said, my lungs restrained by the grip of Mike\u2019s loving embrace.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you fight so hard before,\u201d he said, sweeping my hair back. \u201cYou really weren\u2019t gonna give up, were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would be the point of it all then, Mike? If I always give up when it gets too hard.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me in again. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I gave him a gentle squeeze then stood back. \u201cBut, I have to shoot you now. I wanna see how powerful I am without the pain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cupped both my hands and shook his head. \u201cNo way. We need to test you on something not living first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked around. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tree.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMike?\u201d I said flatly. \u201cA tree is living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Miss Mother Nature. Fine.\u201d He flipped his chin in Ryder\u2019s direction. \u201cRun down the barracks and get a couple of dumpsters, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing, boss.\u201d Ryder saluted and ran off with five guys in tow.</p><p>\u201cHere ya go, Chief,\u201d a young knight said, waltzing toward us, carrying a boulder the size of a child like it was a box of paper. \u201cTry this while we\u2019re waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Joe.\u201d Mike aimed a finger to the centre of the field backing the hall. \u201cJust plonk it right down there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo worries, sir.\u201d He ran off, jolly and spritely, and dropped the boulder, turning to check with us if the position was okay.</p><p>We both gave him a thumbs-up.</p><p>\u201cKay, Ara.\u201d Mike jammed his hands in his back pockets and stepped away from me. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you can do.\u201d</p><p>I felt good about it, certain I could explode that morsel of rock with the blast and not end up flat on my back after. I leaned down into my knees a bit, rubbing my hands together. Once upon a time, I needed to use a thought or a feeling to induce the electricity. But now, I could do it on command. I wondered if telekinesis would eventually end up that way for me. In fact, according to Jase\u2019s diary, if I practiced every day, it most certainly would.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Ara. Quit daydreaming, and shoot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGimme a break.\u201d I turned back to look at Mike, flicking just one finger toward the rock so I could watch his face as it exploded unexpectedly. And like I\u2019d imagined the very expression he\u2019d wear, the bottom of his jaw moved an inch apart from the top, and the whites dominated a larger part of his eyes. I didn\u2019t need to see the damage I caused. I heard it\u2014heard an almighty shatter, like lightning splitting the earth, felt the rock debris hit the backs of my legs, saw the wind of the blast rush past and sweep my hair toward Mike, the whole event ending in the shock on his face.</p> <p>I folded over, laughing.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Mike yanked me quickly to stand. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I watched realization melt the concern on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re laughing, Ara. Why are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d He grabbed my arm and turned me to face the field. \u201cDid you see what you did? It\u2019s bloody lucky we tested you out on a rock first.\u201d</p><p>I scanned the field for any signs of the boulder, but it\u2019d been obliterated. All that remained was a small group of knights on the other side, each holding a dumpster between them\u2014completely frozen in place.</p><p>\u201cTake the dumpster back,\u201d Mike called across to them. \u201cWe need something more hardwearing.\u201d</p> <p>They nodded once and shuffled away, looking rather relieved.</p><p>\u201cWell, then.\u201d Mike patted my back as if I were one of the boys. \u201cBest you go clean yourself up and fill Jason in.\u201d</p><p>I dusted my shirt off a bit and smudged a large smear of blood away from my chin. \u201cFill him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wanna know what you just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you approve of that?\u201d</p><p>He flashed a simple smile. \u201cBaby, he just solved one of the biggest problems I\u2019ve had on my mind since this whole thing began. He can have whatever he wants.\u201d</p><p>I jumped onto my toes and wrapped my arms around Mike\u2019s neck. \u201cThank you, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, watch the shirt.\u201d He pulled me off gently, motioning to my bloodied mess of an outfit.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d I wiped some of the blood away with my hand, but only smudged it worse. \u201cI\u2019ll go take a shower and come back down later, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And I\u2019ll have the knights run laps through the forest to find you more boulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good.\u201d I nodded, then walked away with a huge smile on my face\u2014my head completely pain free.</p><p>I lay awake, fully clothed, listening to the clock tick across the room. The manor was a lonely place without the echo of maids cleaning, footmen laying plates or the gentle but distant chatter of House representatives. Trouble was, at this hour it was too late to be night, and too early to be morning. I was stuck halfway between the world of the living and the dreaming. And worse, I couldn\u2019t find the door to either.</p><p>I stuffed my hand under my bottom and pulled my phone from my back pocket. David still hadn\u2019t called\u2014or messaged. Nothing. If he was gonna fall off the face of the earth, the least he could do was let me know first. Then again, maybe it wasn\u2019t him. Maybe it was me. Perhaps my phone had stopped working somehow and wasn\u2019t receiving calls. But that didn\u2019t explain why my inbox was empty. Not even my dad had replied to my emails, and he promised to tell me how his appointment with the doctor went this week.</p><p>\u201cQuaid?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>My door popped open and a line of yellow light spilled into the room, licking the wall, then the celling. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you got cell service?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his phone from his pocket. \u201cYup. Why?\u201d</p><p>Of course he did. That wasn\u2019t the problem; that wasn\u2019t the reason David hadn\u2019t called. \u201cNever mind.\u201d I turned my face away, and the room went dark again. But my heart leaped into my chest when a very loud, very obnoxious song played suddenly from the device in my hand. I almost dropped it three times trying to run my thumb across the screen to answer the video call. And as the name registered in my head and a face showed, shadowed by an early morning, I ran for my closet and switched on the light, simulating daytime.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d I almost cried, composing myself quickly.</p><p>\u201cAra? I hope I haven\u2019t caught you at a bad time.\u201d</p><p>I motioned around my wardrobe. \u201cNope, just . . . getting dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeading out late today, huh?\u201d He looked at his watch.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I had a study period before class,\u201d I lied. \u201cHow\u2019s things over there? You never emailed me back.\u201d</p><p>Dad looked at my face for a long moment. \u201cAnd you were worried?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. There was a very slight delay in my movements from action to the screen, but Dad didn\u2019t seem to notice. He looked as though he\u2019d just woken up\u2014still in his plain tee and pyjama pants, a coffee by his elbow and the kitchen all kind of dark around him.</p><p>\u201cWell, we\u2019re all fine here, honey,\u201d he assured me. \u201cI had my appointment with the cardiologist on Thursday, and he\u2019s adjusted my medication. Says I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look fine, Dad. You look . . . old.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOh, there\u2019s that brutal honesty I missed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that Ara?\u201d Vicki said, gliding into the room. Her face lit up when she saw mine. \u201cAra, how are you? We\u2019ve missed you so much. What are you doing up so early? It must be, like\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven a.m., Vicki.\u201d I plonked down on the ottoman by the shoe rack.</p><p>\u201cOh, right, you\u2019re ahead of us in Paris.\u201d She sat down beside Dad. \u201cYou look well,\u201d she said, but it was a lie; even I could see how pale and grainy I looked on the screen. \u201cYour face has really rounded out since you left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cIs that Mom-talk for \u2018you\u2019re getting fat\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. You look healthy, for once. Not that skinny little kid that left us a few months ago. They must be feeding you well.\u201d</p><p>I drew my stomach in and readjusted my jeans. Maybe they were feeding me a little too well. \u201cYeah. Food here is good. How\u2019s Sam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good. He got a dog,\u201d Vicki said.</p><p>\u201cA dog?\u201d I looked at Dad. \u201cYou said we could never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a dog,\u201d Dad said, his hand entering the conversation. \u201cHe\u2019s got a follower, and that\u2019s it. He\u2019s not keeping it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhose dog is it?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. It hasn\u2019t got tags or even a chip,\u201d Vicki said. \u201cIt\u2019s this great monstrosity of a thing,\u201d she added. \u201cWhite, fluffy, drools way too much.\u201d</p><p>Dad turned his head and frowned at her. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen it drool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt licked my face the other day,\u201d she said, insulted. \u201cI had to take a shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessar\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the dog decided to make a home with Sam?\u201d I cut in.</p><p>\u201cFor now. It\u2019s not staying, though,\u201d Vicki said.</p><p>\u201cHow often does it come by?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMostly on weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dog knows the days of the week?\u201d I asked drily. Vicki nodded and shrugged at the same time. \u201cSam must be feeding it something really good then.\u201d</p><p>Vicki laughed. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t mind. The silly-looking thing helps with the laundry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d I said absently, my mind going off on a tangent. A big, white, fluffy dog that helps with laundry. That was no stray.</p><p>\u201cHelper or not, Sam knows the rules about dogs.\u201d Dad stood up. \u201cI don\u2019t mind him having it here for now, as long as he looks after it, and it doesn\u2019t eat my azaleas.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think Petey will\u2014\u201d</p><p>Dad stopped half way between the kitchen and the table, and turned around. \u201cHow\u2019d you know its name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm.\u201d I bit my lip. \u201cVicki said Petey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d She looked utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. So, anyway. . .\u201d I hesitated. \u201cDad, can I talk to you alone for a minute?\u201d</p><p>He and Vicki exchanged long glances, then she stood up and slowly left the room. But I was sure she\u2019d parked herself just around the corner. I didn\u2019t care, though. As long as she stayed out of this conversation.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, honey?\u201d He sat back down, angling the screen so I now looked onto the wall, which only confirmed that Vicki was standing right there, listening.</p><p>\u201cAm I adopted?\u201d</p><p>Dad\u2019s eyes shot past the screen, coming back again a little wetter and sharper than before. He slowly breathed out and lined his fingers together under his chin. \u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust . . . just answer me, Dad.\u201d</p><p>The reflection of his eyes showed Vicki\u2019s face just before she appeared. She sat down beside him again and took his hand: the united front, ready for something it seemed they\u2019d been prepared for for a long time.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ara,\u201d Vicki said for him. \u201cYou\u2019re adopted.\u201d</p><p>Finally, some truths. I had to choose which role to play then: the shocked daughter; the angry teen who resented her adoptive parents, or the real me that just wanted to tell Dad not to worry so much\u2014that it was okay. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\u201d I asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTo . . . there was just never a good time,\u201d Dad said.</p><p>\u201cWell, now\u2019s a good time.\u201d</p><p>Vicki stood. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you both to it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Vicki.\u201d Dad patted her hand and turned back to face me. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to tell you, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . after I left your mom, she forbid me to tell you. She thought you\u2019d want to leave her and find your, what she called, \u201creal parents\u201d. Not that she felt that way, but she thought you would. We planned to tell you once you turned eighteen, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot after everything that happened.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEverything? What do you mean?\u201d The way he said that sentence made me think for a second that he knew about Drake arresting and torturing me.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Mom dying and you moving here\u2014all that heartache, then breaking up with Mike. I didn\u2019t want to complicate things further.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAnd, you know, I appreciate that, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not sure I could've coped with the truth then, but . . . I can now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d He leaned forward, propping his elbows on the table. \u201cWhat would you like to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer name. My mom\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>He smiled fondly. \u201cHer name was Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, honey, she passed away giving birth to you.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened as if I knew what to say, but I didn\u2019t. I just stared at Dad\u2019s face, waiting for him to speak.</p><p>\u201cShe was just a child when she had you, Ara, sixteen, actually\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She thought she was in love with this boy, and they . . . well, you know how it goes. Nine months later, you were born.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, well, how did you come to adopt me? I mean, did you know Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRose was. . .\u201d He looked down. \u201cShe was my baby sister, charged to my care after my mother passed away.\u201d</p><p>Sister? I never even knew he had a sister. \u201cDid my mom know her, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He smiled fondly. \u201cRose and Eleanor were close, you know. Eleanor was the support Rose needed then. I just . . . I was a guy. I just didn\u2019t know what to do with a pregnant sixteen-year-old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then. . .\u201d I just felt more confused about it all. \u201cDid you plan to adopt me all along, or was that forced on you after Rose died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was never forced on us, Ara.\u201d He shook his head impatiently. \u201cIt was our choice. Rose planned to raise you herself. But. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you became our little blessing.\u201d</p><p>I truly believed him as he said that. I could tell from his voice that no matter how much pain I\u2019d brought him, there had always been more joy. \u201cDid Rose ever get to hold me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cFor a while. You were nearly a month early, so we all knew you might not survive, but we never imagined we\u2019d lose Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did it happen? How do people just die from giving birth, Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you not know?\u201d I asked, getting louder.</p><p>\u201cShe was in a car accident, honey, and went into early labour. She didn\u2019t have any major injuries, so they let her give birth naturally. And . . . when you were born, this pretty little blue baby, and Rose held your tiny little hand, the reality of it hit her harder than we imagined.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cSome say she died of a broken heart\u2014that she couldn\u2019t live in a world where her baby was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I lived!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I wish she\u2019d known that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, if she\u2019d held on just a few more seconds\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know, Ara. No one can know God\u2019s plan,\u201d he said softly in the \u2018dad\u2019 tone that always made things feel better. \u201cBut I think she knew, deep inside, that you\u2019d survive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she looked me right in the eye that day and asked me to take care of you and, a second later, she slipped away and you started crying.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe. I sat with my lips slightly parted, picturing it all.</p><p>\u201cEleanor came back in and she wrapped you up and kissed Rose on the head, promised she would never let you go.\u201d</p><p>My shaky hand moved to cover my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSo, we adopted you. But Eleanor and I . . . we. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were never really together, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe made a pact to raise you as our own. But we weren\u2019t married. She changed her name so all three of us shared the same surname, and I loved her, Ara. I loved Eleanor like my own family. But not like a husband loves a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Eleanor who gave you your second name\u2014Rose,\u201d Vicki said softly, sitting down beside Dad again. \u201cShe wanted you to always carry a part of your mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd. . .\u201d I took a jagged breath and steadied my tears. \u201cWho\u2019s my father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d Dad shook his head. \u201cI went to find him a few years ago, but all I found was his sister Mavis. She told me he\u2019d been deployed to Iraq after nine-eleven, and was killed in the line of duty.\u201d Dad hung his head. \u201cHe never made it home.\u201d</p><p>The reality sunk through me, dragging my body into the ground. I was too late. If I\u2019d found out when I was younger, I might have at least seen my father, even once, and the weight of the unknown came down on me hard, undoing all the hopes I had for future where I knew him. How was that possibly fair? \u201cWhat was his name?\u201d I asked, pressing my thumb to my chin to stop it shaking.</p><p>\u201cHayden Matthews, and he looked. . .\u201d Dad smiled, but his eyes held all the sadness of things gone by. \u201cHe looked very much like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlue eyes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His smile warmed. \u201cThose were from Rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . you say you\u2019re her brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He nodded, and I almost believed him, save for the fact that David told me this man, who I called my father, had a \u2018distant\u2019 ancestral connection to me. Certainly not close enough to be my uncle. \u201cWere . . . were you her adopted brother?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d</p><p>I turned away.</p><p>\u201cAra, honey. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>My eyes shifted sideways. Dad\u2019s arm was right in direct line of the camera. I knew his hand was against the screen\u2014trying to reach out to me. \u201cI know that everything you thought you knew about yourself has just fallen apart, but I love you, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, Dad.\u201d I placed my fingertips to the screen. \u201cI\u2019ve just got so much going on right now. I . . . I don\u2019t know how to cope with it all. And I\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m not upset. I just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just need a hug?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, wiping my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s David?\u201d Vicki asked. \u201cHe should really be here for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s away on business,\u201d I said, sobbing. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t get hold of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Dad asked, his tone flooding with worry.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just not answering his phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have a fight?\u201d Vicki asked.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cBut things aren\u2019t okay, are they?\u201d Dad said.</p><p>I shook my head again. \u201cDad? I . . . was anyone in my family ever. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cInfertile.\u201d</p><p>He sat back in his chair, looking at Vicki. \u201cHoney, are you trying to have a baby?\u201d</p><p>I didn't even have time to speak; Vicki butted in with, \u201cAra, you're too young. You're barely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how old I am, Vicki, and I don't mean to sound nasty, but it\u2019s not up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want a baby, Ara?\u201d Dad asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve only just married, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid\u2019s going to die,\u201d I said, and my eyes went wide around my shock. I didn't mean to say that, but it just slipped out. I guess I just needed to tell someone\u2014needed someone to know how helpless and scared I felt all the time. But as I looked into both Dad and Vicki\u2019s mortified faces, I wished I hadn\u2019t said it.</p><p>\u201cI'm so sorry, Ara.\u201d Vicki reached out and touched the screen. \u201cIs it cancer?\u201d</p><p>I looked at Dad, swallowing the lump in my throat. \u201cI . . . yeah,\u201d I said, because I wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d understand if I told them he was going to kill a vampire to void an ancient contract.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara.\u201d Vicki burst into tears. \u201cI'm just so, so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long?\u201d Dad asked, broken inside but composed outside, as he always was.</p><p>\u201cA few months.\u201d I wiped my nose, sniffling. \u201cWe were hoping to have the happy news of a baby before he...\u201d My voice broke.</p><p>Dad sighed, lowering his head into his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, Ara,\u201d Vicki said, rubbing Dad\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cWhy do people always say that?\u201d I buried my face too. \u201cYou know it won't. He's going to die. And we can't even fall pregnant. What if it\u2019s me, Dad?\u201d</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>\u201cWhat if it\u2019s something wrong with me? That means I ruined his only chance to know he was gonna be a dad before he. . .\u201d I stared at the wall for a second. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing after this for him. He doesn't get to go on. He\u2019ll be gone, and I wanted him to know he was going to have a little girl before he went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara, please don\u2019t think that way,\u201d Vicki said. I could see how badly she just wanted to hold me, but we were divided by what they thought was thousands of miles. \u201cIt\u2019ll happen. I\u2019ll pray for it everyday, I promise. You\u2019ll have your little baby before he dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf prayers could make me fall pregnant, Vicki, I already would be. But I just don\u2019t think I\u2019m meant to be a mom.\u201d</p><p>Dad reached out and touched the screen again. \u201cMaybe you should come home for a bit. It might\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can't do that, Dad. We have a life here. We have friends and responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you have family here,\u201d Vicki reasoned.</p><p>\u201cI have family here, too,\u201d I said softly. \u201cDavid can\u2019t leave, and it\u2019d break his heart if I did.\u201d</p><p>Vicki exhaled; I could see the loss of hope in her eyes. Neither her nor Dad knew what to say or what to do. And right on time, as if it were a bell to save me from further explanation, my phone grizzled, making a fuss, the caller ID swallowing Dad and Vicki\u2019s faces. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that David?\u201d Vicki asked, clearly noticed my eyes light up.</p><p>\u201cYeah.

You called?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly like fifty-thousand times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on now, it wasn\u2019t that many,\u201d he said playfully. \u201cIt was more like\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMom and Dad called,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAh, good. And how are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told them you have cancer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he said slowly, dragging the word out.</p><p>\u201cIt kind of slipped out that you\u2019re gonna die. And I had to make up some comprehensible explanation. I mean, they picked up on my extreme sadness anyway.\u201d</p><p>The silence on the other end of the line lasted too long. \u201cYou're sad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I just thought, for the sake of appearances, you\u2019d suck that up around your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuck it up? Suck it up! David, would you suck it up? Would you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I'm sorry.\u201d His voice got louder. \u201cJust . . . don\u2019t yell at me. I really don\u2019t want to fight with you.\u201d</p><p>I released my fury with a groan. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I'm sorry, okay. I just . . . what\u2019d they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were devastated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! They love you, David. They want to do anything they can to help.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cAw, I really wish we could tell them the truth. Actually, I kinda wish your dad was a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how he always has that way of solving problems\u2014or making you feel like they can be solved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI bet he\u2019d have some clever way we could fix this Drake contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and I bet you\u2019d actually listen to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to whom?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do listen to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh! You so do not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe my track record isn\u2019t that great. But you gotta admit things have gotten better lately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d But they\u2019d be better if he was actually here, with me.</p><p>\u201cI thought about it, you know,\u201d he said after a while.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning him\u2014your dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think we should discuss it. I think, even if he couldn\u2019t find a way out of our situation, at least he\u2019d be here to take care of you\u2014for eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a little girl, anymore, David. I don\u2019t need an eternal dad,\u201d I snapped, then calmed myself. \u201cBut, I mean, it\u2019d be nice if I didn\u2019t have to bury him one day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, we\u2019ll discuss it further when I get home.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI'm worried about his heart, though. He looks sick, you know. And he\u2019s playing it cool, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be fine. If he gets worse, I\u2019ll turn him myself.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cBut you don't know the secret of how to turn a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon't I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is getting off topic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is? Because I don't remember setting a topic for discussion,\u201d I said playfully.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHow\u2019s training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Jason saved my head from exploding yesterday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings got . . . bad.\u201d I shivered at the memory. \u201cJason comes bursting in, grabs me and hauls me outside and, no joke, as soon as he puts my hands in the ground, like, forces them into the soil, the pain stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou're kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. He said I need to ground my power, and added something about closed circuits, or whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he come up with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been thinking a lot about it. Guess he had an epiphany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . I gotta admit, I don\u2019t know much about science, but that was pretty clever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that's why I want him to have a lab, David. He can help me. You don't know how much stress he's taken off my shoulders by figuring out why I'm getting those headaches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were stressed about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I was. How would you feel if you had to put yourself in that kind of pain every second day, and no one was going to help you...and no one cared? You all just told me to get over it, but he never stopped thinking about it\u2014researching it.\u201d</p><p>He took a really long breath and let it out right into the mouthpiece of the phone. \u201cFine. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have the lab\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I jumped up and out of my seat.</p><p>\u201cBut, it comes with a huge but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay with a but.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want a guard with you at all times when you\u2019re together. Do you think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Oh, David, thank you. He\u2019ll be so happy when I tell him. I wish you were here right now so I could kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm smiling just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>I smiled too.</p><p>\u201cAnd...\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want full reports on everything he's doing with you, and why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. I know he won't have any problem with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then. Go see Walt and tell him to set up an account for Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And just remember, Ara, I'm doing this for you, not him. I want answers, and I want to see something concrete by the time I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t give us much time. You're coming back Sunday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. But, things...\u201d He sighed. \u201cThings are bad here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to transport a few prisoners to the Vampiric Institution for the Insane.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . the vampire mind is still very human. There\u2019s only so much one person can handle before they . . . well, before they lose it.\u201d</p><p>I waited for a second, tense, feeling a kind of energy in David\u2019s voice that made me wonder if one of those prisoners was. . . \u201cIs Pepper one of them?\u201d</p><p>He coughed, then cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to discuss the prisoners, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she go nuts because of what you did, or was it something after that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave fun setting up the lab, Ara. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>I went to speak, but he hung up the phone, and all the things I wanted to tell him about my birth parents suddenly went on hold, boiling up like bad news, making me so mad not to be able to get it all out. I opened messages on my phone and wrote: Just thought you might like to know that I found out about my birth mother. She's dead. So is my father.</p><p>As soon as I pressed send, though, I felt worse.</p><p>The phone rang a second later.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid. I'm sorry. That was really petty of me, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my love. I'm sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have hung up on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. You've told me not to ask about Pepper. I should respect that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you shouldn\u2019t. You're my wife and you do have a right to know, but I . . . Ara, I did that to her,\u201d he said, his voice shaking, \u201cand I\u2019m dead ashamed of myself.\u201d</p><p>I held still in case the door to his emotions slammed shut in my face. I wasn\u2019t sure what to say or how to move this conversation forward without forcing him back into his shell. \u201cWhen . . . um . . . when was the last time you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout a year or so before I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas she . . . like that then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you didn\u2019t do it to her, David.\u201d I practically laughed with relief. \u201cMaybe time has, or . . . I don\u2019t know. But you shouldn\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Ara. You\u2019re sweet to say that, but you don\u2019t know the full story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if you\u2019d tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though he couldn\u2019t see it. One day, maybe, was good enough for me. \u201cSo, how do you know she\u2019s insane? Like, what did she say to you when you saw her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it. She didn\u2019t even recognize me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was too busy peeling her own skin back and eating it to notice anything other than a passing rat she could mutilate.\u201d</p><p>I let out a shaky breath. \u201cDavid, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is what it is. So. . .\u201d His tone changed, taking the subject with it. \u201cYour dad told you about Rose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Wait. I never mentioned her name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I've known about her for a while. I was waiting until I had news of a nice family somewhere out there waiting to meet you before I said anything, but . . . I never found anything on your biological father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm okay, you know. I still have my dad and Vicki.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I'm still here, and I love you, and I'm sorry we\u2019ve fought today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. I hate fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>After a long silence, with me lost trying to think of something else to say to keep him on the line, he said, \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I whispered. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cJase.\u201d I leaped off the last step and ran into his arms at full speed, well, full human speed.</p><p>He caught me gracefully, gave me a quick squeeze, and placed me gently back on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re awfully cheery today, Ara. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went for it, Jase. I don't know if it was just pure luck or if David woke up on the right side of bed, but he approved it.\u201d I stood back, swiping my hair from my face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cApproved what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lab, silly!\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, his brows forming two lines in the middle, just like David when he was utterly confused. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI talked to him on the phone this morning, then I went to see Walt to get the budget plan. Jase, you have the full backing of the House, and an unlimited budget.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, that\u2019s. . .\u201d He scratched his head, still looking a little mixed by his emotions. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d I tapped his arm once. \u201cThere\u2019s a condition, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to have a guard present whenever we\u2019re researching or training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's\u2014\u201d He nodded, smiling. \u201cYeah, that's more than fine. More than fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you'd say that.\u201d I clapped once, bouncing on my toes. \u201cWe have to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAnd I know just the place to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut on the town?\u201d I joked.</p> <p>\u201cBetter.\u201d He patted my arm as he walked past. \u201cHave everyone meet at the lighthouse tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, lighthouse party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He walked backward, the reality clearly having sunken in to his smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a tradition around these parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo celebrate on a lighthouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He started up the stairs. \u201cAnd tell Blade he better be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I watched him disappear into the second floor corridor, then turned to look back at Falcon, who was standing inconspicuously in the shadows nearby. \u201cYou coming, Fal?\u201d</p><p>He stepped forward, his hands clasped in front. \u201cYou\u2019ll understand if I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what? The lab or the party?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cBlade\u2019s in the library, preparing for your lesson on royal popularity, if you\u2019re looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nodded once. \u201cI get it. You don\u2019t approve of either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because both situations put you in position to end up in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade will be there tonight, and you\u2019ll be there at every training session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could say that gives me comfort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d I turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad, Falcon. If David agrees, you can bloody-well get over it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty,\u201d he said resolutely, following me up the stairs.</p><p>I wished I could tell him to go away. He\u2019d made me mad now, and I really didn\u2019t even want to be in the same space as him. In my old life, I could\u2019ve stormed off and slammed my bedroom door, but this version of me had to wear any disdain under her sleeve and express only composure. It sucked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and angled my neck slowly to see Falcon. He\u2019d stopped about six paces behind me, hanging his head. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have every right to celebrate this. What happened at training the other day was spectacular, and if it weren\u2019t for Jason, it wouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d</p><p>I walked down a few steps and stood on the one just above him so we were almost the same height. \u201cLook, I respect you, Falcon. A lot. And I. . .\u201d I thought about it for a second. \u201cYour support would mean a lot to me, you know.\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his face swapping the sternness for a smile. \u201cI support the result. Just not so much the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll come to the party tonight?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ll go that far, but I won\u2019t stop you from going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t think you would.\u201d</p><p>He wet his lips, nodding. \u201cI was planning to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He walked ahead of me. \u201cLet\u2019s go find Blade and tell him the good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you were going to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on.\u201d He cordoned me off from the last step with the back of his forearm.</p><p>I stopped abruptly against his sleeve. \u201cWhy are we hanging on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEm and Mike are in there.\u201d He nodded to the Great Hall.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they\u2019re arguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we listening in?\u201d I asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lowered his arm. \u201cWe\u2019re respectfully not trespassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2019re going to the library.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if we walk past now, they might think we heard them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what if we do? They should take their business somewhere private.\u201d I shoved past Falcon and nearly tumbled backward down the step as Emily flew past us suddenly, her face in her hands. \u201cEm?\u201d I called, but she evaporated.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Falcon asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I let go of the railing and dusted myself off. \u201cShe was in a real hurry.\u201d</p><p>Falcon looked over his shoulder. \u201cTrouble in paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it would seem.\u201d I considered the doors to the Great Hall for a second. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go see if Mike\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Falcon nodded once and fell back into guard mode behind me.</p><p>The lone figure sitting at the right hand of the king\u2019s chair didn\u2019t notice Falcon and I on the balcony above him. His head was in his hands, his troubles somewhere on the ground between his feet.</p><p>I tiptoed down the curvy staircase, my hand tracing the railing and, once at the bottom, appeared at vamp speed beside him. \u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head and our eyes met. I expected to see tears, but he just looked worn. \u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened? Emily all but caused a tornado on her way outta here.\u201d</p><p>He sighed and his brow landed against his thumb, his elbow on his knee. \u201cI can\u2019t do it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis business with Emily.\u201d He sat tall again. \u201cEver since she left university and moved here, she\u2019s been really needy and whiney. I just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s probably just bored. I\u2019ll assign her a task other than council member. Maybe she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe gave me back the ring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I screeched.</p><p>\u201cShe gave it back to me\u2014last night. She just walked up and said she was done, that she didn\u2019t want to get married anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mike.\u201d I sat down in David\u2019s chair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Mike spun around to face me, tucking his legs under the table. \u201cI mean, she took it back this morning\u2014she was over it, you know, whatever made her break up with me. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t want her to take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I reached out and wound my fingers in the ball of his fist.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exhausted, to be honest, Ara. And I think maybe I jumped into a relationship too soon after we broke it off. I just\u2014\u201d He leaned back in the chair and looked up at the roof. \u201cI just need some time to clear my head.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she didn\u2019t.\u201d He presented the room, aiming his hand off to the path Emily had taken in haste. \u201cShe ditched the ring at my head.\u201d</p><p>I tried not to laugh. \u201cShe did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked around the floor for a second. \u201cI don\u2019t even know where it landed. For all I know, with a throw like that, it went through twenty-odd walls and ended up in the library.\u201d</p><p>I laughed then. So much for sensitivity. \u201cWe\u2019ll find it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBut she\u2019s not getting it back this time, Ara. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ending it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He stood up. \u201cShe ended it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d I started, but he walked from the room, and I just watched, deciding then that inviting him to our lighthouse celebration was a bad idea, especially considering how much he hated Jason. \u201cThis party is getting smaller and smaller,\u201d I said to Falcon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Emily will go.\u201d</p><p>I looked up to where he stood on the balcony of the second floor. \u201cCan you go ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He bowed and turned away.</p><p>Nate headed out of the library as I waltzed in, and he flashed a quick grin, holding up the latest book he borrowed, then hurried off before I could ask him about the party. I knew he\u2019d come, though, without question.</p><p>\u201cBlade,\u201d I called into the open space, searching up, down, and around with my entire body. The curtains were drawn across the great windows, the room dark and empty. I noticed the projector set up on a table across from a whiteboard, and a stack of notes beside it, but Blade was nowhere to be seen. \u201cBlade? You here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Ara.\u201d</p><p>My eyes moved quickly to the bookcases under the balcony, landing on a hunched figure in the armchair. It was so dark that if he hadn\u2019t spoken, even my vampire night vision wouldn\u2019t have noticed him. \u201cWhy are we sitting in the dark?\u201d I asked, wandering over.</p><p>He smiled up at me where I sat on the arm of the chair. \u201cYou spoken to Em today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I heard about her and Mike.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, the leather squeaking behind him. \u201cShe loves him, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he get it? It\u2019s so simple.\u201d He stopped with both hands propping him up against the oak table. \u201cShe just wants his affection, his love, maybe a little attention. It\u2019s like he doesn\u2019t want her, Ara, like he keeps her all to himself because he wants to prove he\u2019s really gotten over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has.\u201d I stood, too. \u201cEmily\u2019s not his trophy girlfriend, Blade. He loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough. Not enough to have asked her to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy so sensitive about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my friend, Ara. I care about her.\u201d</p><p>I laughed in the back of my throat. \u201cDoes . . . does she know you\u2019re all cut up about this?\u201d</p><p>He dropped his hand from his head and looked at me disapprovingly. \u201cI\u2019m not all cut up.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, and it made him smile, too. \u201cThen why can\u2019t I feel the pulse of our bind\u2014your never-ending-Curse-of-Lilith-love that you\u2019ve had for me all these months?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d he said with a grin and sat down on the chair. \u201cOh God. Why can\u2019t I fall for someone who isn\u2019t taken by a high-ranking member of my new society?\u201d</p><p>I laughed and sat down beside him. \u201cNow, what fun would that be?\u201d</p><p>He bumped me softly with his elbow. \u201cWell, all jokes aside, and no disrespect but, I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I leaned my head on his shoulder. \u201cMe too, Blade.

I need a guard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme guess,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cFalcon doesn\u2019t approve of you hanging out with Jason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all need to give that guy a break.\u201d He pushed the chair out with the backs of his legs and stood up again. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything but the good he\u2019s done for you since he\u2019s been here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I guess they just find it hard to forgive what he did in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet they praise the king for more heinous actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWell, I got his back, Ara, you know that, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He clapped once. \u201cThen we have a lesson to get started on.\u201d</p><p>The global view from the rooftop spread my little world outward, but the sight of the new greenhouse narrowed it in again, stealing the glamour from the winding beige roads, the unending fields of green grass, and the vast clusters of trees. I half expected it to be a modest, kind of rounded conservatory, the glass maybe frosted and opaque, but I was dead wrong. I was wrong about the rooftop, too. In my mind, I\u2019d pictured a grey, water-damaged cement surface, cluttered up with blackened chimneystacks and broken roof tiles. But it was remarkably spacious and flat, spread wide across the East Wing, dropping at the edges into slanted tiles, peaked at the window points over the attics on the rear face of the building.</p><p>Ahead, the large dome marking the manor entrance caught the sunlight, making it glint in my direction, but even with all its glorious colours, it sat in pale contrast to the wall of glass Arthur and David had commissioned. Clearly, they\u2019d been planning it for much longer than I realized. Its sheer magnitude and ambience was probably visible from the furthest bridge connecting Loslilian Island to the mainland. It stood at least thirty feet above the manor, the ceiling forming a long peak down the length of it, so clear and open it was a glistening shrine to the sun, inviting its golden beams down onto the mess of greenery inside. I wasn\u2019t sure where\u2019d they stuffed the lab, but there was no sign of another room anywhere up here.</p><p>As I neared the building, I scanned the windows for sight of Arthur. Word had it that he was up here pottering around somewhere, but there were at least four rows of tables and planters inside, and I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d spot him once I was in the thick of it all.</p><p>I pushed the door open and stared down the barrel of the first aisle: greenery, stacked high up to the ceilings, came face to face with what I imagined were special kinds of lights for growing things. There was a warm buzz in the air with the sound of life, and under the heat that saturated the room there was a gentle sound of dripping water and a rich soil flavour settling on the scent of newly budding flowers. It was beautiful and almost tropical.</p><p>A flicker of movement down the end caught my eye then, steering it to the busy-looking figure trimming leaves off a plant and laying them in a tub at his feet. He looked old from back here\u2014hunched and almost weathered, but as I drew closer, my eyes adjusted to his form, and his youthful appearance altered my first impression.</p><p>\u201cArthur?\u201d</p> <p>He looked up, laying the scissors down. \u201cAmara? What brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCame to see the new lab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you now?\u201d he asked in a tone that indicated disbelief.</p><p>\u201cYeah, um\u2014\u201d I stood beside him, wrapping myself up in my own arms. \u201cAnd to see if you\u2019d heard yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Jason\u2019s lab? Yes.\u201d He walked across to the planters opposite us. \u201cAnd I hear celebrations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Lighthouse party.\u201d I turned to watch him. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t miss it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. So\u2014\u201d I looked around. \u201cWhere\u2019s your lab?\u201d</p><p>He tapped his foot on the ground a few times. \u201cYou\u2019re standing on it.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back as though I really were actually standing on a lab, and not a dirt floor.</p><p>\u201cWe used some of the attic space,\u201d he explained. \u201cWould you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, not just now.\u201d I waved a politely dismissive hand. \u201cI uh. . .\u201d</p><p>He drew a loud breath, but kept working like I wasn\u2019t even there, letting it out with, \u201cYou want something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d I leaned against the table. \u201cI wanted to ask you about why you came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to the greenhouse, but I heard that when you signed on to this whole \u201cProject Kill Drake\u201d, the reward you were seeking was. . .\u201d</p><p>He stiffened a little, standing straight. \u201cYou\u2019ve spoken with Morgaine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I took a step closer. \u201cArthur, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to worry about, my dear.\u201d He turned and lay a firm hand to my shoulder\u2014that gentle reassurance only he seemed able to give with just a simple touch. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. She told me you\u2019d changed your mind, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t changed my mind about anything, Amara.\u201d He picked up the scissors and began trimming the plant again. \u201cI still want to die. But I won\u2019t. I promised David I would be your eternal guardian.\u201d</p><p>The regret in his tone sent an arrow into my chest. \u201cWhy do you want to die, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampires love eternally, my dear. And no matter how many remedies I mix\u2014\u201d He motioned around the greenhouse. \u201cI can\u2019t mix one for a broken heart.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, nodding to hide the rush of tears in my eyes. \u201cSo, you still love her\u2014Arietta\u2014so deeply after all this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said simply. \u201cDespite the absence of her soul from this world, I am sure I love more each passing day.\u201d</p><p>My hand moved to rest on my heart, barely containing the ache that wanted to consume me. \u201cThen why did you promise David you\u2019d stay alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know the pain you will suffer without him.\u201d He looked sideways at me for just a second. \u201cAnd I will be here to make sure you never go to join him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? If I\u2019d be happier dead, why would you stop me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame reason you\u2019d stop me, Amara.\u201d He laid the scissors down again and walked slowly over, placing one hand then the other on my arms, gripping firmly. \u201cWhere there is life, there is hope. And you are the hope of many. I cannot let that die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m sad for you, Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t waste your thoughts on me, Amara. I\u2019m an old man, and I can do enough worrying for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I reached out and toyed aimlessly with a leaf. \u201cBut, I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth\u2014\u201d He smiled lovingly down at me. \u201cI am. You make me happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Arthur.\u201d I felt my cheeks flush a little. \u201cYou\u2019re too nice to have suffered so much.\u201d</p><p>He laughed through his nose, turning away again to go about his business. \u201cSufferance does not befall the ungracious, princess; it presents itself to he who knows love and happiness, because without those, one cannot suffer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was a way?\u201d I said, running my thumb down the leaf repeatedly. I wasn't sure how he\u2019d react to this, but I had to at least ask.</p><p>\u201cA way to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if there was a way to reverse death, her death?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t show it, didn\u2019t make it obvious, but he wasn\u2019t down with it. Not one bit. All he said, in a calm voice, was \u201cMen must not dig where gods lay stones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must have at least thought about it? Even once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have. What man wouldn\u2019t? But it\u2019s not right, Amara. Deliberate reincarnation, it . . . it\u2019s against the laws of nature, and God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d</p><p>His stern gaze met mine. \u201cWhat have you found?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same spell Drake uses, Arthur\u2014\u201d I held back for a second. If I told him what I found in the Book of Shadows, there was a very real chance he might stop me from using it. \u201cIt\u2019s something else.\u201d</p><p>His lips folded inward, making a stern line.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a spell written by Lilith, we think. I found it in Morgana\u2019s Book of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, you must not meddle in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have magic.\u201d I held my hand up. \u201cYou said it yourself. You said all immortal beings, all born immortals have magic of a kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of a kind. That does not mean you can perform witchcraft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Drake can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d He laughed and turned away, propping his hands on the counter in front of him. \u201cDrake has no soul, Amara. And it is witchcraft that turned it to ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur, what if it didn\u2019t have to be that way? What if I could use white magic to bring things back to life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no magic that can bring things back to life, my girl.\u201d He spun around, his voice grumbling with rage in the back of his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s the Devil\u2019s work: trickery. You might think you hold the power, but when you cross those boundaries, you open floodways for darker things, and I can\u2019t protect you from those.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis spell I found, Arthur\u2014\u201d I took a step closer, looking up into his bright blue eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . it originally came from Aide-Memoire de l\u2019Auress,\u201d I lied.</p><p>Arthur went to speak, but his mouth just sat slightly open, caught on his words.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a page missing from the back. I lined them up perfectly, Arthur. I know it\u2019s Lilith\u2019s spell. I can feel it.\u201d I touched my heart.</p><p>He sniffed once. \u201cDo you have it on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. I know you\u2019ll take it from me.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThen you know me well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said, taking a very casual stroll around the plant tables. \u201cBut you don\u2019t know me, not like you think you do. I\u2019m not as dumb as I pretend to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you were, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you think I\u2019d dabble in the darkness of black magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you would do anything to get David back after he dies, and I think you came to me today, not to ask if I would want Arietta resurrected, but if I thought you were capable of performing the spell.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whoa. Yep. No messing about with guys this old. I let out a long, hard breath.</p><p>\u201cAmara, my dear, sweet girl.\u201d He appeared beside me, slowly taking my hand up to his lips. \u201cYou know I love you\u2014\u201d He kissed it, \u201c\u2014as if you were my own blood. But I will not stand by and see you make the mistakes your ancestors made. You cannot perform that spell, and if you do, your soul will pay the price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s white magic, Arthur. It uses the will of Mother Nature. It can bring things back if She gives them passage.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI know. And I happen to know that Drake has searched for this spell for some centuries. But I know God gives no man right to play his game. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. But I\u2019m willing to suffer any consequence to save David\u2014to bring him back. Even if it means the price for balance in the natural order of things is my own life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if it wasn\u2019t?\u201d he said, and paused. \u201cWhat if it was the life of someone you love? Your father, perhaps? Could you live with the guilt?\u201d</p><p>My eyes drifted slowly down to my feet. \u201cBut, what if the spell can also cure immortality\u2014help the Damned?\u201d</p><p>\u201cImmortality is not a disease, my dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s a curse. And it haunts those children, Arthur. I can\u2019t bear the thought of them never growing up,\u201d I cried, pointing off to the side as if the Damned House was there. \u201cI don\u2019t want any more pain for them. I don\u2019t want anyone suffering. I just want things to be normal.\u201d</p><p>He swept in and embraced me, pressing his lips to my hair. \u201cI wish I could go back and stop David before he gave you blood that first time, Amara. I want normality for you more than you could possibly know. But we have to accept what we cannot change, and change only what we can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible to change this, though, Arthur. I can do this spell. You know I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are more powerful than you realise. But I have to ask you not to try it. I\u2019ve given my reasons.\u201d He stepped back from me. \u201cAnd you will either listen or you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, Arthur, I\u2019ve heard you, but I don\u2019t agree with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you always have had a mind of your own, my dear. What am I if not a man who has lived many centuries and experienced all walks of life? Why should you believe anything I have to say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I feel it in my heart that this is the right thing, that this spell can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel that this spell can bring David back, and that is all you care about: consequences be damned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you got me then, don\u2019t ya?\u201d I said sarcastically, turning my palms up. \u201cGuess you do know everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, you know I feel the same\u2014we all do. We all want him to live as much as you do\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I held my index finger up. \u201cNot as much as I do. You cannot comprehend how badly I don\u2019t want him to die, or what I\u2019m willing to do to stop it.\u201d</p><p>He looked deep into my eyes, right past the barrier I forged, and pierced my soul. \u201cI do see what you will sacrifice for this, and I understand it. You know I do, so do not accuse me of ignorance, my dear. I know better than any man what it means to lose those you love.\u201d He wiped a hand across his mouth and turned away, the breath he exhaled coming out jagged. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose you in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d</p><p>He nodded but didn\u2019t turn around\u2014didn\u2019t look at me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d I nodded once and, with fists tight, turned away like a solider with marching orders.</p><p>The forest leaned in as I entered, watching me walk the path toward the Stone. I felt my way along the columns of trees, pulled by the force of Nature surrounding everything in this place, keeping my eyes closed until the radiant warmth emanating off the Stone marked the end of my journey.</p><p>I sat down against it and pulled the rumpled paper from my pocket, angling it so the sun lit the page. The first item the junction spell called for was something dead. I frowned, chewing my lip. I really hadn\u2019t thought this one through.</p><p>\u201cDead things . . . dead things,\u201d I said to myself, looking around. The only dead things at the manor were the drained humans in the feeding block. And the idea of digging through a pile of rotting corpses was not really all that appealing. \u201cAny suggestions?\u201d I asked the forest.</p><p>A cool breeze settled around the base of the ancient trees then, flicking crunchy leaves toward my feet in a small pile. I tilted my head back and looked up at the sky, casting my eyes quickly back to the ground after. \u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><p>The leaves flickered in the wind again, the corner of one so dry it snapped off under my bare foot, and at the same time, so too snapped a conclusion: dead leaves. Of course.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>With the spell in one hand, death in the other, I read the words aloud, feeling the pull of nature surge through my feet, up my legs, into my heart and down through my fingertips, charging them, making the energy within burn like fire. And at the point I expected the brown leaf in my palm to ignite, it came to life: green starting up the stem, spreading out like rivers of water along the veins, bringing moisture and elasticity back to its surface until, finally, I felt its spirit again.</p><p>The blue light in my fingers receded, leaving me open-mouthed and breathless. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>The leaf seemed to revel in the sunshine, the magic of life tingling against my fingertips. I put it down quickly and shuffled back, waiting to see if it shrivelled and folded in on itself, dying without the touch of my curious blue light. But it stayed there, gently blowing in the wind, green and soft and supple. Alive.</p><p>I gave life. My body, my power, I gave life.</p><p>But it was just a leaf. It had neither breath nor consciousness. Jason said this spell made a path for a soul to cross over, not that it would regenerate an aged, lifeless body. All living things had souls, even the smallest ant or rose bud, but their souls were different to a human\u2019s\u2014they went to a different place. How could this spell to create a doorway or a path be used to restore something physical\u2014to reverse ageing?</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d said a voice across the clearing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the spell that did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did?\u201d</p><p>Jason went to speak, his mouth sitting open for a second, but he closed it, shaking his head as he came to sit beside me. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d I almost laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t restore life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the kind you\u2019re hoping to restore, no. But, you are the Auress of the mortal realm. And with that comes certain abilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbilities?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re different for each of your kind. In my research, when I studied Lilithians back at college, I found that Lilith had the power to restore life to animals. She tried to extend that power to humans and even Lilithians, but it was very limited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. . .she could bring a dog back to life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what? I get plant life?\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed. \u201cI guess so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I looked down at my fingertips. \u201cThat\u2019s gonna come in handy one day, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201d</p><p>He laughed again. \u201cDon\u2019t think of it as something useful to you, but more of something that can benefit everything around you.\u201d He motioned to the forest.</p><p>I smiled up at the trees. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right. And I did see a sad-looking rose bush on my way in. Maybe I can at least help it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you can. Now\u2014\u201d He plucked the page from my fingertips. \u201cWhat were you hoping to achieve here?\u201d</p><p>I eyed the spell. \u201cI . . . I thought maybe, since David\u2019s soul will be \u2018disconnected\u2019 from this realm when he uses the dagger, I might be able to bring him back.\u201d</p><p>He slowly reached out for me. \u201cSweet girl, you don\u2019t have this kind of magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I jerked away.</p><p>\u201cThis is witchcraft, Ara. You\u2019re not a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have Nature\u2019s magic. It won\u2019t support this kind of spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . maybe I can heal his body after he dies. Maybe I can start his heart, and the soul will slip back into the human form\u2014like resuscitation?\u201d I suggested.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it, Ara. That\u2019s not what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so quick to shoot me down, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to be disappointed when it fails,\u201d he said in a slightly louder voice.</p><p>\u201cWhen it fails, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When,\u201d he repeated, lifting my chin so our eyes met. \u201cAra, I support everything you do, one-hundred per cent. But this won\u2019t save David. I know this, to my core. If you keep hoping, all you\u2019ll do is make it hurt more at the end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that it\u2019ll fail. How can you possibly know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Jase opened his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. So, try it on me: start my heart. If I\u2019m wrong, I will apologise and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d</p><p>I sat up on my knees. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He unbuttoned his shirt a little and grabbed my hand, placed it against his heart. \u201cGo on. But if I\u2019m right, you need to drop this and realise that you can\u2019t resuscitate David. And also that if the junction spell were to actually work, it would require a witch, Ara. Not an Auress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded, repositioning my hand on his chest. His body felt cool and soft under my touch, the gentle rhythm of his needless breath moving his chest up and down a little faster now than before. He waited expectantly while I focused, feeling all life move from within the forest, through me.</p><p>But nothing happened. It was as if I\u2019d poured water onto a lidded container: the power just didn\u2019t go through\u2014wasn\u2019t . . . absorbed.</p><p>\u201cI . . . oh, Jase.\u201d I looked up into his eyes, half blinded by tears. \u201cI can\u2019t save him, can I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with Nature\u2019s magic.\u201d He scrunched up the spell and tossed it over his shoulder. \u201cBut it never hurt to try.\u201d</p><p>I took a jagged breath, the air cooling the tears on my lips. \u201cArthur was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He cupped my cheek and rolled my face against his chest. And it hurt. It hurt to smell him, be this close to him. It reminded me too much of what would be gone soon, but also, deeper than any other feeling, made me miss him so terribly bad I just wanted to stay in his arms.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said one more time, and I laughed into his shirt, half crying, and completely wetting it with tears. He leaned out a little and the smile he offered made the trees and grass seem yellow with warmth. \u201cHey, cheer up, m\u2019kay. We got a party to plan.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. This is a day for celebration. Not tears.\u201d I wiped my face. \u201cI\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just. . .\u201d I nodded, sniffling. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d He stood and offered his hand. \u201cYou can come with me to the cellar to get the wine.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand in his and pulled myself to stand. \u201cNo, you go get the wine. I need to get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanged?\u201d He appraised my outfit sceptically. \u201cYou look fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou are so not a girl, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm?\u201d He looked down at his jeans. \u201cNot last time I checked.\u201d</p> <p>Vampire celebrations had a lot more class than human ones. As I trudged through the open field toward the lighthouse, I half expected to see a strobe light flashing\u2014the only thing more noticeable than the bass-thumping tunes\u2014and a bunch of drunk fools hanging off the railing on the top floor. So the gentle glow of candlelight emanating from small tea-lights in each of the six windows wrapping the giant tube, and the soft hum of Mozart, was quite a pleasant surprise.</p><p>I wiped my feet with a light scuff on the doormat and popped my head in, calling out to see if anyone was here yet.</p><p>\u201cJust us, so far.\u201d Jason trotted down the stairs with two wineglasses in hand, his light blue shirt open a little at the neck, sitting snuggly over his denim jeans. I could just make out the dark lines of the tattooed band wrapping his arm through the fabric. He looked as sweetly sexy as Jase always did, but instead of letting myself smile and tell him that, I appraised him critically.</p><p>\u201cSo even you got changed before the party.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his outfit and handed me a wineglass. \u201cCouldn\u2019t let you be the only pretty one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I can do pretty without all the cologne and hair product.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t knock the hair.\u201d He ran a hand through it. \u201cTook me hours to get it this perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d I laughed.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you got me. Actually, it\u2019s not hair product. It\u2019s just wet.\u201d His open palm showed the moisture.</p><p>\u201cI knew that, Jase. I was teasing.\u201d I saluted with the glass, then peered in at the contents.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lemonade.\u201d He sipped through a smile.</p><p>\u201cYou know me well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He nodded. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re not twenty-one yet. Can\u2019t have you breaking the law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean, what would the king say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay? Nothing.\u201d He tapped his glass on mine. \u201cIt\u2019s what he\u2019d do that I worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t care, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t know him very well.\u201d He laughed, prompting me to follow him up the stairs.</p><p>The racket of footfalls on steel sounded odd because, while I could see my own feet and Jason\u2019s ahead of mine, there was only one set of echoes. He was so ridiculously light-footed he made me feel like an elephant. \u201cDid Emily say if she was coming?\u201d I asked, hoping to drown out the evidence of my lead-foot.</p><p>\u201cYes, and Nate, and a few others, too. But it\u2019ll be a pretty small gathering tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve set out a picnic on the balcony. Now we\u2019ve got that railing fixed right \u2018round the ledge, it\u2019s a bit safer up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds great. I hope you have cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet tooth, huh?\u201d He looked down at me from the step above.</p><p>I bit my lip. \u201cYeah. Kinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThought you might say that, so\u2014\u201d He stopped and I nearly bumped into him. \u201cI took the liberty of venturing into town today\u2014bought you some chocolate.\u201d</p><p>My tongue moved out of my mouth and across my lips involuntarily. \u201cI haven\u2019t had chocolate since I first moved here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey guys,\u201d Emily called, stuffing her phone in her back pocket as she came through the door. \u201cAm I late?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in time,\u201d Jason said. \u201cCome on up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Blade said casually, coming in behind Em. \u201cDid I miss any fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, Emily only just got here.\u201d I winked at Blade.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Em asked, her nose crinkling.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the fun one\u2014of course,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d She started up the stairs. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you meant.\u201d</p><p>I huffed as she shoved past me, Blade hot on her trail, then turned to Jason. \u201cShe thought I was being mean, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d He squeezed my shoulder reassuringly. \u201cShe just doesn\u2019t know Blade likes her yet.\u201d</p><p>I looked up the stairs to the top. \u201cNo kidding.\u201d</p><p>Conversations died down and the food dwindled to scraps, and by the time Nate left, the only other people still hanging around were Blade and Em, Arthur, Jason, and I. And I liked it this way. It was peaceful and intimate\u2014even if Em was still holding a grudge for the nastiness she assumed I\u2019d expressed earlier. I was beginning to see what Mike meant about her being so moody lately.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that sleeping potion coming along?\u201d I asked Arthur.</p><p>He stood beside me, both of us leaning on the railing, our drinks in hand above the nothingness. \u201cWhy do you ask, my dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike needs to extract more venom this week for the sword-tipping, and I don\u2019t want him to do it awake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have it ready tomorrow,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cI\u2019ve made it a little stronger than last time. It seems Mike has developed an immunity to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an acclimation thing,\u201d Jase said, appearing on my left. \u201cMedicines and certain treatments very rarely work more than thrice on a vampire\u2014of any kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is much to learn,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cBut you have centuries to do so.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and leaned a little more on my arm, blowing the warm air from my mouth over my cold hands. \u201cIt\u2019s breezy up here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go back?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cI could walk you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll wait for Blade.\u201d I jerked my head in his direction. \u201cFalcon\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>Jason nodded, leaning down on the railing, too, and angled his shoulders in so his head came closer to mine. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d</p><p>All three of us turned our heads to the pair sitting with their legs dangling over the balcony ledge, shoulder-to-shoulder, whispering and giggling with each other.</p><p>\u201cHe just put his jacket on Em,\u201d Jason finished.</p><p>\u201cDoes he know she doesn\u2019t get cold?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, I do,\u201d Blade said, turning around. \u201cBut it\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d</p><p>We all laughed, and Emily just shrunk into herself a little more.</p><p>\u201cYou warm enough?\u201d Jason asked, reaching across to tighten the leather jacket around my chest again.</p><p>I angled my chin so my nose went into the collar a bit. It smelled like him, and from the moment he put it around me earlier, I\u2019d felt like I wanted to cry. Somehow, his scent conjured up some feeling\u2014some emotion that should\u2019ve had an identifying thought to accompany it. But as my brain searched for that spark, that instant of recall, I was left blank; carrying only the feeling that my heart was incredibly broken and that Jase\u2019s was too. But it was silly. So I brushed it off and nodded. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m lovely and warm, thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, but his brows moved together in the middle, forming that line.</p><p>I wanted to ask him to just spit it out\u2014say what he was thinking. I knew he\u2019d read my mind just now. I knew he knew I knew something was amiss between us, and if Arthur wasn\u2019t here, I was sure Jase would tell me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very quiet tonight, Amara,\u201d Arthur noted, pinching my sleeve affectionately. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, brushing my head against his shoulder for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I just found out about my real mom today, is all.\u201d</p><p>Jason stood from his lean, and Arthur hung his head a little lower.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me, Ara?\u201d Jason asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see that in your thoughts.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cGuess I\u2019ve had other things on my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He swept me into his arms and held me against his chest for a second, cupping the back of my head with his ultra cold hand. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible friend. I should have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Jase.\u201d I patted his chest and stood back. \u201cThere was nothing really to tell. My mom died in childbirth, and my dad was killed in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara.\u201d Arthur\u2019s hand came down on my shoulder; I turned around to face him. \u201cI am truly sorry. David and I had agreed to tell you in time, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid didn\u2019t tell me, Arthur. I called my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you knew?\u201d Jase asked.</p><p>I looked back at him. \u201cBecause, in the same conversation where I told David I knew about my mom, I also told him about the headaches, and then he approved the lab.\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled, leaning on the railing again, and Arthur and I followed suit.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s things going at Elysium?\u201d Arthur asked. \u201cHave they worked their way through most of the prisoners now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d I sipped my drink as I nodded. \u201cBut a few of them have to go to the mental asylum.\u201d</p><p>Arthur and Jason exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cPepper inclusive,\u201d I probed, keeping my gaze on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Arthur said, turning to lean his back on the rail. \u201cI saw her a year or so ago, and requested they move her then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake denied the motion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid was gone at the time. And . . . I guess Drake saw it as a method of revenge for his defection, perhaps,\u201d Arthur mused.</p><p>My lip curled. \u201cThat\u2019s so cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can be a cruel man.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at Arthur for a second and watched his blue eyes wander in thought. He looked younger when he was absent from his mind, his features so much softer and almost kind of sad looking.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you both think that, maybe it\u2019s time for me to know what happened to her\u2014to Pepper?\u201d I waited then, letting the idea sink in for them. \u201cClearly, I\u2019m not going to dump David if I find out he\u2019s a masochistic torturer.\u201d I held up my ring hand. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t left him yet, chances are, I\u2019m not going to.\u201d</p><p>Arthur smiled down at me, but when he looked at Jase, he frowned.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I caught the same vibe Arthur had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason bent down with a huge sigh and left his wineglass by his feet, standing back up again slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Ara. You should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said suggestively, his wide eyes arresting Jason\u2019s boyish confidence. \u201cShe should really know everything, shouldn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn good time,\u201d Jase said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start with Pepper, and see how we go from there.\u201d</p> <p>Arthur seemed to agree, stepping back and offering the floor to Jase while he went to grab another glass.</p><p>\u201cThey were in love,\u201d Jase began. \u201cAs much any two vampire souls had ever been, but David's desperation to be a council member started to waver from the day he met Pepper. He was missing meetings, failing to complete tasks, and staring in dreamy-eyed gazes when he should have been carrying out punishments. The last straw was when he set a prisoner free without torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe set someone free?\u201d I asked, nearly leaping over the balcony in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t always as a harsh a man as he is now,\u201d Arthur added, standing beside me again.</p><p>\u201cSo, what did the prisoner do, the one he set free? Was it a horrid crime?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019d unlawfully turned a human,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cAnd David quite simply said that he understood how love could madden a man and force him to do things he wouldn\u2019t normally do.\u201d</p><p>I stared out to sea. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like my David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the David any of us knew,\u201d Jason said. \u201cHe was even getting along\u2014or trying to\u2014get along with me.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, rubbing Jase\u2019s arm, then turned my head to look at Arthur. \u201cSo Pepper was a good influence on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn ways.\u201d Arthur nodded. \u201cWell, enough that David had planned to ask her to marry him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe had the ring his grandmother passed down,\u201d Arthur continued. \u201cAnd he\u2019d set the date and the time he would do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. . .\u201d I thought back to the day he told me about the one and only vampire he\u2019d ever wanted to marry.</p><p>\u201cWho was it?\u201d Jason asked, coming up off the railing just a little.</p><p>\u201cWho was what?\u201d Arthur asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cAra was just thinking that David told her he\u2019d only ever wanted to be with one vampire, and it wasn\u2019t Pepper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg,\u201d I said, my tone rising in question on the end.</p><p>Arthur and Jason broke into a gusty fit of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cThat is a big, fat lie, right there,\u201d Jason said, failing to compose himself. \u201cThey hated each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said, sobering a little. \u201cI suspect David told you it was Morgaine so you wouldn\u2019t keep asking.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cWell, it worked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t keep asking after that, anyway,\u201d Jason said, leaning down again. \u201cHe and Morg are incredibly mismatched.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just figured it was in another time, you know, and that people change.\u201d</p><p>Jase wiped his mouth. \u201cNot that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, what was Pepper like then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a sweet thing, very much like you in a lot of ways. Her hair was golden, her features petite, and she always seemed to be smiling, like nothing ever bothered her,\u201d Arthur said fondly. \u201cI know she reminded David a lot of his aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he was gonna ask her to marry him, right? So, why didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night before he set off for his biannual leave, Drake called him to preside over one last case.\u201d Arthur\u2019s lips rolled inward, the memory travelling across his face, painting it with emotion. \u201cI saw the look in David\u2019s eye, saw his heart break right there in a room full of people when Pepper was bound and thrown to her knees before him like some petty thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t know she\u2019d been arrested?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The way Jason said that made me look at him. \u201cI was the one who arrested her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a Warrior, Ara. It was my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho gave the order?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just. . .\u201d I rubbed my head. \u201cI can\u2019t picture David sitting there and sentencing her to torture. I just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a grim scene and it was, in many ways, a test,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cHe knew that. From the moment he looked into her eyes and then over at Drake, David knew his next move would determine the fate of his career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to leave emotion out of it from there,\u201d Jase said. \u201cHe heard her pleas, heard her reasons for turning the child, and he suddenly went stone-faced, as if he cared nothing for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she broke the law, or because it affected a child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one really knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I toyed with the stem of my glass, then popped it on the floor by my feet. \u201cSo, why does she haunt him so much? I mean, I knew he sentenced her and that he\u2019d loved her, but what\u2019s the big deal, really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe standard punishment for a vampire that turns a child is The Hot Tar,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cWhereby the vampire is stripped naked and lowered into a vat of boiling tar, burned until their flesh peels from their body, then taken away to heal again, slowly, and without blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce their skin is just pink again,\u201d Jason said, \u201cthey repeat the process. And this is done for the full term of the sentence. Often three years.\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded to confirm. \u201cHowever, Drake was so disturbed by the fact that a council member\u2019s own girl had broken such a law that he stepped in after the sentencing and added two months torture\u2014to be carried out by soldiers during the day, and by David at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . what about his leave? I thought he was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was delayed by two months as punishment for not controlling his girl,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cWow. So. . .\u201d I pictured it all in my head, seeing the room I was taken to the day Jason tortured me. \u201cHe just did it: tortured her, like, happily?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not, my dear.\u201d Arthur exhaled, looking off at nothing for a few seconds, his face scrunched up tightly. \u201cEvery day, when he would return to his chamber after her torture, he would fall to his knees and pray for forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI found him once,\u201d Jason said, his own gaze drifting off to thought. \u201cHe was on his knees, his body rigid, eyes on the brink of tears. He said he couldn\u2019t take any more. He said she cried his name out, begging him for mercy. I offered to trade places with him\u2014be the one to do it so that he didn\u2019t have to suffer. No one would\u2019ve known it was me. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he refused?\u201d I said, knowing why. He would never have let anyone else hurt someone he loved. Which, I understood then, is why he was so quick to forgive Jason for the same.</p><p>\u201cI remember, one night,\u201d Arthur added, \u201cI embraced him, tried to comfort him, and for the first time since he was a boy, he wrapped his arms around me and I heard him cry. Nothing haunted me more than seeing tears from this boy who refused to cry for even the most heinous things. Even the day his aunt died, he shed not one tear\u2014that any of us saw, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut despite that,\u201d Jase said. \u201cHe\u2019d dust himself off and go back down to that cell, because if he didn\u2019t do what the king asked, much worse would be ordered for the poor girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of torture did he . . . I mean . . . it must have been bad to haunt David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d Arthur nodded. \u201cThe final straw came one night when I found him in a corridor, his hands and face covered in blood\u2014her blood\u2014her golden hair tangled in long, broken threads around his fingers. I asked him what had happened, and he said she went mad. Told me she just couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen . . . what was the hair and the blood from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked the same thing. But he couldn\u2019t speak. So, I went down to see the girl, attend to her medically, if needed\u2014and found her huddled in the darkest corner, her eyes black, her body unclothed and bleeding. When I squatted down and inspected her closer, found her hair was torn in patches from her scalp\u2014most of the skin missing from her upper thighs and wrists, peeled away, you might say, as if she\u2019d scratched it off with her own nails.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d I asked, horrified.</p><p>Arthur looked away. \u201cDavid had found her in a similar state. He asked what had become of her, and a prisoner told how she\u2019d been quite brutally raped\u2014had things done to her that no young girl could imagine possible. She\u2019d tried to tear the skin from her own body to wash off the horrors of what those men did to her, and when David came to comfort her, she attacked him, thinking he was one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards stepped in, Ara,\u201d Jason said. \u201cEvery prisoner knows that the punishment for attacking a council leader is a grave one, no matter what state of mind they\u2019re in at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was bound,\u201d Arthur continued. \u201cThrashed with the guard\u2019s belt while David watched on\u2014bound himself by the laws he protected. When the lashings stopped, she laid there in a pool of her own blood, and before David could react, the guards grabbed her by the hair and. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSodomized her,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>I covered my mouth, knowing how David would react if that were me.</p><p>\u201cDavid tried to fight them off,\u201d Jason added. \u201cBut it only made matters worse, and he was tangled up in the process, tearing half her hair away himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards restrained him,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cmade him watch until the girl gave up screaming and just laid there sobbing his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen they released David,\u201d Jason said. \u201cHe just turned away and walked from the cells like a ghost\u2014went on leave the next day, and never spoke of her again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake recommended a two-year stint in a high school\u2014to live among those who have so few cares and worries,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cHe figured a lighter occupation would do David good after such a harrowing ordeal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool? He sent David to school after all that?\u201d</p><p>Arthur nodded. \u201cAnd it did do him good. Drake was right. We saw changes in David after just a few weeks. But, even then, everything that made that boy alive was dead. He was colder and harsher, and I worried for the young humans in his community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he met you,\u201d Jason said, smiling at something far away.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur added, and the energy in the space changed, the daunting, horrible reality lifting away a little. \u201cAfter that, he returned to council meetings\u2014smiled again. He was, you could say, more human than he\u2019d been since he was a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you can imagine what you must mean to him, Ara,\u201d Jason said. \u201cThat you were the very thing that gave him a reason to live again\u2014to believe that life wasn\u2019t a nightmare he couldn\u2019t wake from.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I thought back to everything we\u2019d been through, feeling a sense of dread for the time he walked away from us just to protect me from his world. And I was grateful to him for that now more than ever after everything Pepper went through. He always said he couldn\u2019t protect me from the horrors of his world, and this story explained so much more why the very mention of turning a child had sent him storming off to his room, slamming the door. I felt bad for even bringing it up now.</p><p>\u201cGod, I just wanna call him and tell him I\u2019m sorry for everything bad I ever said or did.\u201d I laughed. \u201cPoor guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And you can see now why, in my pursuit for revenge, I thought it so marvellous to steal you from him\u2014by pain of heart or even death,\u201d Jason said.</p> <p>\u201cWow, that was incredibly malicious, Jase.\u201d I backhanded his arm.</p><p>He rubbed it as if it hurt. \u201cI know. But, he knows I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all do.\u201d I nodded, looking out to sea, then just let it all out with a really long breath. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Jason leaned beside me again. \u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Blade came to stand beside Jason. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a story.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe never told me that,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI asked him once, but he wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see why,\u201d I said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now you know.\u201d Arthur stood tall again. \u201cAnd I must warn you, Amara, do not ever bring it up in front of him. Do not ever seek to use it against him or to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that, Arthur.\u201d I crossed my heart. \u201cNot even if I was mad with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope not.\u201d He bowed his head. \u201cBecause I could not vouch for the man you may see beneath this new David.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll never speak of it. I swear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee that you don\u2019t,\u201d Arthur said, and walked away.</p><p>\u201cWell, story time\u2019s been fun, Ara,\u201d Blade said. \u201cBut it\u2019s time for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I looked back at Jase.</p><p>He offered a sweet smile. \u201cNight, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Jase.\u201d I went to take the jacket off and hand it to him, but he stopped me.</p><p>\u201cKeep it tonight. Give it back tomorrow when you come see me for our first training session.\u201d</p><p>I snuggled into the leather again. \u201cOkay, what time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSunrise.\u201d He flashed a mischievous. \u201cNah, just kidding. Any time you like, sweet girl. I have aaaalll day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I nodded and walked past him with a big smile on my face. \u201cSunrise it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then,\u201d he called.</p><p>I started down the stairs, stopping for a sec to let Emily catch up.</p><p>\u201cCute, I\u2019m sure,\u201d she muttered coldly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Jase.\u201d She grabbed my arm. \u201cHe likes you, you know\u2014more than he should considering he\u2019s your brother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>Blade came up between us. \u201cShe knows, Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is she even hanging out with him?\u201d</p><p>Blade and I made faces at each other\u2014clear astonishment at Em\u2019s bitchiness.</p><p>\u201cSo, is that how it goes, Em?\u201d Blade said. \u201cIf you know someone likes you, you keep away from them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t know.\u201d She stormed off ahead of us. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever liked me.\u201d</p><p>Blade stopped walking and looked at me, pouting for Em.</p><p>\u201cAll that effort.\u201d I patted his shoulder. \u201cAnd she still doesn\u2019t have a clue, does she?\u201d</p><p>He started walking again with a bit of a lag to his step. \u201cGuess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might just have to be upfront about your feelings, Blade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest,\u201d he said, the little laugh accentuating his Englishness. \u201cI\u2019m afraid she might slap me if I tell her.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cNever know, you might enjoy a little slap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give you a little slap,\u201d he said, threatening my bottom.</p><p>I elbowed him in the ribs softly and we left the lighthouse behind, but I turned back and caught a wave from the blue-shirt-wearing vampire standing on the balcony before we blended with the darkness.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>She opened her eyes, the blue appearing before her lashes even parted, but as an instant smile swept her lips when she saw me, so too did the memory of what just happened. She turned away.</p><p>\u201cDon't look at me like that,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d I jumped up sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cLike you're really concerned.\u201d</p><p>I was really concerned, I thought, but it wasn\u2019t my thought. I reached across and gently smoothed my thumb down her soft skin, seeing the moment in her mind when that barbarian struck her. It wasn\u2019t a hard hit, it wasn\u2019t even hard enough to change the colour of her skin, but it scared her, shocked her, and in that instant, a part of their friendship died. I could feel that pain. I had good reason to be concerned. She knew that.</p><p>\u201cHe hit you,\u201d I said, but the words, the feelings that came with them weren\u2019t mine, either. They were Jason\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cIt was a tiny slap,\u201d she said, pulling my hand away. \u201cAnd I kinda had it coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I almost regurgitated the words, gasping them out instead. \u201cYou\u2019ve been through enough. He had no right to touch you that way. I will skin him alive.\u201d</p><p>The anger I felt in Jason then moved me outside his body, but I heard everything, saw everything the way he saw it in what was obviously a dream he was having\u2014all the way down on the second floor, tucked up tightly in his bed. So I watched, because something in this dream felt familiar somehow, like I\u2019d lived it before.</p><p>\u201cI'm okay,\u201d Ara said softly, cocking her head as though she felt sorry for me.</p><p>It felt strange to have Jason\u2019s voice in my head as if it were mine. It felt kind of disorienting. I sat back a little and just pretended he was telling the story, almost as if I were reading a book that suddenly switched perspective mid-chapter.</p><p>\u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t be. You shouldn\u2019t brush this off like it doesn't matter, Ara. He is ten times bigger than you, and he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI've got bigger things to worry about right now, Jase.\u201d She rolled away, pulling the blanket up over her shoulder. \u201cJust let it go.\u201d</p><p>My hands hovered over her body for a second, tight, almost grabbing. I wanted to shake her\u2014just dive into her head and insert all my own experiences and lessons so she\u2019d wake up and smell the damn roses. But I pressed my fingers firmly to the side of her head, sweeping her hair back instead. \u201cI love you, Ara. I won't let this go.\u201d I kissed her face, backing off. \u201cBut we\u2019ll talk about it in the morning.\u201d There was no point trying to make her see reason tonight. She was as stubborn as an ox when she thought she was right, and while this was an endearing trait most of the time, it was also downright dangerous. It would take time to make her see that her so-called best friend was in the wrong.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I tucked the blanket around her firmly, hoping it\u2019d keep her there, wrapped up safe so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted to lecture her. \u201cJust sleep.\u201d</p><p>But she rolled over and shoved the blanket back. \u201cLet it go. Mike didn't mean to do that. He\u2019s...I mean, look what I put him through. This was just the final straw, okay. He clearly can't take any more of, well, me.\u201d</p><p>Dear God. Her ability to see the good in everything had finally become a hazard. I lowered my head into my hands. \u201cI understand that, Ara, probably better than you might think, but he\u2019s not just your friend anymore. He's the head of security. No matter what you do or have done, he should have more self-control than to have slapped you.\u201d Surely she could at least see that much reason.</p><p>\u201cIt was a little tap.\u201d</p><p>I looked up from behind my hands. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding me, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase. Go to bed. You look tired.\u201d</p><p>A pattern of thought started in her head then. I couldn\u2019t grasp it enough to see what she was thinking, but I knew she was right about my appearance. I hadn\u2019t slept well since the Masquerade. I\u2019d slept even less since I tortured her, and while I was fine with that, since it felt like some kind of penance, the tiredness was affecting my self-control, decision making, even self-respect, making it hard to maintain grasp on this ever-weaving web of lies and corruption going on around us while simultaneously practicing honourable intentions toward Ara.</p><p>\u201cI am tired,\u201d I said simply.</p><p>\u201cDid you sleep at all last night?\u201d</p><p>And there it was: the thought she\u2019d started but hadn\u2019t finished. It came to life in her mind like a memory; me, the screaming, the night she came down the corridor to see Arthur leaving my room after administering some hefty drug to stop the night terrors. She\u2019d imagined me in there\u2014imagined herself beside me, holding me. She wanted to be there. But if I let her in, if I let her know I was suffering for what I did to her, she wouldn\u2019t let this go. She wouldn\u2019t let me suffer for that.</p><p>\u201cWhat would make you think I hadn't slept?\u201d I asked, planting the idea in her mind to just drop this.</p><p>\u201cYou know already, Jase, you can read my mind.\u201d She touched my arm, yanking me back from the invasion on her brain. \u201cHow long have you been having those night terrors?\u201d</p><p>I studied her carefully, wanting to let her in, knowing she could help, but at the same time knowing I didn\u2019t deserve it. Then again, she wouldn\u2019t drop this. She\u2019d lay awake all night, worrying, and probably end up coming to my room in the small hours, getting caught by Falcon then having David breathe down her neck because he doesn\u2019t trust her. She wouldn\u2019t let this go unless I either talked to her about it or did something to her brain, which I didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cYou...so you did see that dream?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>I sunk back, exhaling, as if I didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAre they always that bad, the dreams?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, feeling my heart come away from my chest in a hot spill of blood. \u201cAra, please don't\u2014just...don't say you\u2019re sorry. I'm sorry. I'm the one who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She grabbed my hand and pressed it to her chest, right over the silver locket my brother gave her as a representation of his love. I wanted to pull away, but she\u2019d never held me like that before. \u201cAll of that\u2019s in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cI know what you did for me. I know it was to protect me, Jase, I forgave you a very, very long time ago.\u201d</p><p>And she had. I\u2019d seen that in her eyes, her thoughts. It was one of the first things I noticed when we met in the field the day I returned from the dead. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don't. It hurts me for you to feel such deep regret. You\u2019re punishing yourself for something you had no control over.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was right.

In. The. Past,\u201d she said, slowly and deliberately. \u201cStop dreaming about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo do that, I\u2019d have to stop sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cHow \u2018bout you come visit me in our sleep again instead. We\u2019ll make some nice dreams for you.\u201d</p><p>Instant reaction? Lay her down and enter her head right now. Common sense reaction? \u201cI'm not sure it\u2019s really appropriate for us to be alone like that, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But I can't have you reliving that torture every night. I won't.\u201d</p><p>All very well, but what was she going to do about it?</p><p>\u201cNot to mention,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf I'm slipping into your dreams somehow, I don't really want to be seeing that every time I close my eyes, either.\u201d</p> <p>I laughed. It wasn\u2019t really funny, but she was right. She and I, we had a connection like no others in this manor. What I suffered, so too did she. I guess, in that sense alone, I owed it to her to be all right again. \u201cOkay. No more nightmares then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she said in a businesslike tone, and I just wanted to kiss her. She always had a way of making me feel better. \u201cNow,\u201d she added. \u201cI have question for you.\u201d</p><p>Oh no. \u201cShoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mind-links?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid...\u201d She tried not to smile. \u201cDid you visit me in our dreams while you were supposedly dead?\u201d</p> <p>The smile I started by seeing hers grew. I knew what she was about to ask. \u201cMaybe. Once or twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d She slapped the covers, and her mind went from our adventures in the field to the night I came to her room and danced with her. \u201cSo...the yellow dress?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if I should admit this. \u201cYes, I...\u201d I shrugged dismissively. \u201cI figured I owed you a new dress\u2014since I ruined the blue one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! I can't believe you just said that.\u201d</p><p>Neither could I.</p><p>\u201cAnd, what about the memories?\u201d she said. \u201cDid you leave mind-blocks in place, or were you actually in those dreams with me, showing me all those things yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany of those were memories of things we did before...\u201d The pictures of my childhood\u2014the things she\u2019d asked me about, things I\u2019d shown her in our life together before I let her fall into Drake\u2019s hands came to mind, so clear, so intense with the love we have for each other that I almost forgot I was talking. \u201cI never placed mind-blocks. I erased those things, but only enough to hide them from a human mind. As you grew stronger, your brain lifted the sheet.\u201d You were never supposed to find those memories again, I added without saying it.</p><p>\u201cSheet? But you said you erased them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing can ever truly be erased from a mind. It\u2019s like a hard drive\u2014unless you have some pretty high-tech equipment, there\u2019s always an imprint left behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. So, all those things you showed me about your childhood\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asked. I answered.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cDid you want me to hate David?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Of course I did. I just didn\u2019t want her to learn the hard way what kind of man he was. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if you did. But, no. I did and do want you to know what he\u2019s like, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Her soft cheeks dropped as her lips sat parted, curiosity lingering beneath a hint of fear for the truth I might offer. She was so perfectly beautiful, so soft and so fragile. I couldn\u2019t imagine how anyone could have slapped her. And then I remembered again\u2014the way I hit her, the way I screamed at her, threw her, dragged her, hurt her, and made her cry. I\u2019d stepped outside myself when I did that, but no matter how far you step away, when you come back, the truth will always belong to you, and you cannot escape your own memories.</p><p>I feared for her and her loving soul. She forgave me for an act of depraved cruelty. I knew she\u2019d forgive Mike, and I knew, if David ever slapped her, or locked her away in her room or forced her to wear the clothes he saw fit, she would accept that. She loved him enough to look past anything. \u201cYou have such a forgiving heart that, well, now I'm sure you\u2019d forgive David if he struck you in anger, and his strike would not be a tiny slap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only say that because you think I'm going to let Mike get away with it.\u201d</p><p>She would. \u201cNo, I say that because my brother can seem to do no wrong. I\u2019ve seen him raise his voice at you, and you only blame yourself\u2014tell yourself not to push him. Ara, that\u2019s a recipe for a submissive nineteen-fifties abused housewife. I just don't want to see you crying on a kitchen floor, punished because the Pavlova sunk and, sweet girl, I wouldn\u2019t put it past him.\u201d Because I remembered too clearly the events of days gone by\u2014stories I could never share for fear of breaking her heart\u2014breaking the mould she thought David fitted.</p><p>\u201cYou don't think very highly of him, do you?\u201d she said, but what she really wanted to say was, You\u2019re just behaving like a jealous brother.</p><p>\u201cI love my brother. I do. But I know him, inside and out, and he\u2019s old-fashioned. He doesn't see anything wrong with disciplining his wife. It\u2019s not a personality fault; it\u2019s a time corruption.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d never hit me, Jase.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my thumb down her cheek, right where Mike would never have hit her either. \u201cNeither would Mike.\u201d</p><p>She pushed my hand away. \u201cAnd David would never even do that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope not. And I hope, if he ever does, you would come to me. You would see it as an error on his part, and not just think yourself the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. Okay?\u201d But she knew she would; she knew she\u2019d take it to her grave because, if he ever struck her in anger, it would be so apparently out of character for him that people would ask what she\u2019d done to provoke him. \u201cI know it might seem like I let him get away with being all controlling and forceful, but if he ever did anything to me that I didn't like, I\u2019d leave. I have a no-strike policy with men, Jase. If he hits me, even once, he\u2019s gone, because that\u2019s not love.\u201d</p><p>Then how could she love me? \u201cI hit you,\u201d I said, and her mind went blank with guilt; she hadn\u2019t thought of that, but my point was made. And made strong.</p><p>\u201cJase. Don't. Okay? Just stop feeling guilty. Look\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t find the right words, no matter how hard she tried, because she knew, deep down inside, that it was true; I hurt her. She should have expelled me from her life a long time ago for that. \u201cOkay, you hit me, you\u2019re a bastard. I hate you.\u201d Her lovely white teeth showed with that special grin she did only when she was being cheeky. Her fangs had grown with the blood of the immortal being constant in her veins now, and they looked so cute on her; so small they were almost like baby teeth. I loved her so much in that moment that the tears I\u2019d held all night, from the first moment I found out what she was planning to do with my uncle, came out from hiding. I didn\u2019t want her to see them. I swiped one away as it fell onto my cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou were just so small and precious.\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop it then; the whole thing played out in my mind, forcing me to see the way Arthur touched her. To see her cry and throw up, and as my heart raged with fury, wishing I could skin my uncle, the memory of her face when I struck her, when I tortured her, came rushing back like a punishment. I broke. I had to tell her how I felt. I knew it would only make her pity me. But I needed her to know I never stopped regretting it. \u201cEvery strike felt as if you\u2019d snap, shatter, like porcelain. I\u2014\u201d I held my hands out as if she was in them, broken, crying for me. I could see her there\u2014see her in my arms. \u201cI hit as softly as I possibly could, but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her fingertips landed in mine, bringing me back, waking me. \u201cDon't go there anymore. Just, when you think about it, go to a place where we were happy, instead.\u201d</p><p>There were so many places like that; more memories of joy than pain. I flipped my hand over and held hers, knowing it was wrong, but owning her for myself in that moment, despite morals. \u201cOnly if I can take you there with me.\u201d</p><p>Her tiny fingers tightened around mine. \u201cI will go anywhere, do anything to make you okay again. It kills me that you\u2019re stuck in that torture without me, Jase. I'm okay. I'm here. I'm alive, and I...\u201d I knew what she wanted to say. I saw her reach out in her mind and tell me she loved me, but she didn\u2019t say it. \u201cI care about you. A lot,\u201d she said instead. \u201cSo, please, just...just don\u2019t go back there anymore. Move on. Leave it behind where it belongs: in the past.\u201d</p><p>In her mind, as she mentioned the past, she saw a future; she pictured it for a second, with me. Her and I, together, someday, somewhere. But she pulled the thought back, discarding it quickly, because she knew she loved David. But it was enough to cheer me up, just the hope of one day, maybe, making her mine. And suddenly, I found a new reason to live.</p><p>\u201cSee\u2014\u201d I shuffled closer, tucking her hair behind her ear to reveal her beautiful face. \u201cThis is why I love you. Look how easily you can heal my heart. See how effortless it is for you to take my terrors away.\u201d She was everything I\u2019d ever dreamed of, and my deepest regret then was not finding her first. \u201cI just...I don't know where I\u2019d be if I\u2019d not found you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t meant to add that bit; it just slipped out, leaving me scrambling for an explanation, knowing it would open my heart to her. \u201cNo one has ever cared so much before\u2014to want to take my pain away and see that I dream of things that don't leave scars when I wake.\u201d</p><p>Her delicate touch stroked my cheek, making me wish I could bear to look away from her perfection for one second just to close my eyes and enjoy the way she felt. \u201cI'm sorry you never found a girl who would see you the way I do.\u201d</p><p>She just didn\u2019t get it. \u201cBut I did find one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She smiled, but it was completely ruined by the pity in her eyes. \u201cBut, I want you to have love, like David and I do. I want you to find your eternal person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEternal person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cWell, I found her. I'm just waiting for her to realize we were made for each other, then I get my happy ending.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cThat won't happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I looked into my lap, holding on to the last of that future I\u2019d seen with her. \u201cBut eternity is a very long time. I can hope that, one day, you\u2019ll feel the way I do.\u201d Or at least admit it.</p><p>\u201cIf you really do care for me, then you won't think like that. Because, for all the confusion I have in my heart, I only want David.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was right. It was selfish of me to hope she\u2019d fall out of love with David because, for that to happen, he would have to hurt her pretty badly. I took a deep breath and let it out. \u201cOkay. Then I hope you never love me. I hope you and David live eternally happy lives together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed. It was kind of irritating to have a person who could read me almost as well as I could read others. But nice at the same time.</p> <p>\u201cI'm trying, Ara. I do want what's best for you. And if that's my brother, then, in my heart, he's who I want you to be with.\u201d Even if I will eventually have to kill myself just to ease the pain.</p><p>\u201cThen you should stop touching me like your girlfriend. If he saw that, he\u2019d be really pissed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d I sat back, sliding my hands slowly away from her body to savour the last touch. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t okay. I needed some distance. She wasn\u2019t wearing anything but a shirt under that sheet, and the instinct-driven man inside me knew that only too well. I moved away and sat on the chair again. \u201cHey, can I ask you something?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn't you demand I give your ring back?\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cI didn't know that was an option.\u201d</p><p>I scoffed. How was it not? \u201cAra, you never sit by and let things happen if you don't approve. If you wanted that ring, you\u2019d have stomped your foot until I gave it to you. So, why didn't you?\u201d</p><p>She stared at me, realizing it for the first time herself. She didn\u2019t want it back. \u201cYou're reading into it too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I?\u201d I grabbed the ring from my pocket and pressed it into her palm, folding her fingers around it. \u201cOr are you just not telling me what you really think?\u201d</p> <p>She slipped the ring back on her finger and rolled away from me, hating herself for the truth she\u2019d just admitted inside. \u201cGo away, Jason. You don't know anything about me.\u201d</p><p>But I did. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have forced her to see that truth so soon. She wasn\u2019t ready. \u201cOh, don't know anything about you, huh?\u201d Luckily, I also knew how to cheer her up. I pulled the blanket away from her. \u201cI know your ticklish spot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d She squealed, jerking around as I dug my fingers into her ribs. \u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>I laughed aloud, feeling pure joy for one of the first times in so long. It was the way she laughed\u2014such a sweet little giggle, so honest and so unguarded. I could see why my brother loved it so much. She was just so beautifully innocent.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want her to stop, so I kept tickling, gentle enough not to hurt her but firm enough to hold her down a little so she couldn\u2019t get away. Not that she wanted to get away. She looked up and her heart burned with love for me. This was exactly where we both wanted to be, no matter what the consequence.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d I pinned both hands beside her face and leaned right down, pretending to be puffed out, knowing how much she loved it when I played human. \u201cI know more about you than anyone else in this world, Ara-Rose. And I know you didn\u2019t ask me for that ring because you liked the fact that I had it. You liked knowing how it made me feel to carry it, as if I owned a part of you my brother never would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part?\u201d</p><p>All of you. Your heart, soul, mind, body\u2014future. \u201cThe truth.\u201d</p> <p>She went completely stiff under me. That was all I needed to say, and her mind would fill in the rest.</p><p>I tried not to laugh. As I moved to kneel back, the warmth off her body\u2014from between her legs\u2014brushed my knee. She was naked beneath this shirt. I knew I shouldn\u2019t look, but my eyes slowly strayed down her waist, past her hips, stopping there where the shirt rose up past her belly button. She let me look. She laid there, legs slightly apart, me kneeling between them, and for that second, she let me look.</p><p>I held my breath. Everything in the room getting hotter, including Ara. She patterned it out in her thoughts; me and her, making love. The thought stayed small enough that she didn\u2019t even know she thought it, but it was enough to send my heart and my blood into overdrive.</p><p>I quickly let go of her hand and pulled the shirt down, catching a glimpse of the horror she felt when she remembered Arthur being right where I was. \u201cWhat happened down there tonight, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the training hall. Why were you down there\u2014practically naked?\u201d</p><p>Although I already knew the truth, I just wanted her to tell me, but she wasn\u2019t going to, until her thoughts did.</p><p>I swept her hair off her brow, frowning, pretending I didn\u2019t already know. \u201cWhoa. Ara, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She pretended, too\u2014that she didn\u2019t know what I\u2019d just seen. The games we play.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you were doing down there tonight? Arthur? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d She blinked a few extra times, pretending again. But I could play this game as long as she wanted. \u201cYou saw that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet girl, I saw everything.\u201d I rested back on my knees, placing my hand to her thigh, my thumb discreetly holding the shirt to cover her so it wouldn\u2019t move if she did. \u201cSo that's what the dagger\u2019s for\u2014that\u2019s what David wants it for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why he hasn't been coming to see me.\u201d She grabbed that damn locket and held it tight. \u201cHe can't bear it. He\u2019s wanted to tell me so badly, but he knows I\u2019ll fight him on it. He\u2019s planning to just disappear.\u201d</p><p>And the game was over. I might have known in her thoughts what she planned to do with my uncle, but this was the first time I\u2019d seen that\u2014seen the pain it caused her, seen the devastation she felt because she knew she couldn\u2019t betray David that way and, in that, she would be sending him to his death. How was that possibly her fault?</p><p>I landed on top of her, our noses in line. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what?\u201d</p><p>I just didn\u2019t know what to say. No, I won\u2019t let you suffer. No, I won\u2019t let you blame yourself. No, I will not, over my dead body, see you sleep with my uncle to save David. I would rather die. I would rather be tortured at my brother\u2019s hands for eternity. \u201cNo. I won't let this happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI'm not letting you do this to yourself.\u201d I knew what I had to do. I knew she knew it too. Without even thinking, I reached down and unfastened her buttons\u2014my uncle\u2019s buttons. I needed her out of this shirt, his scent off her beautiful body. It was almost enough to make me gag. \u201cI won't see you suffer my uncle\u2019s touch then hate yourself for the rest of eternity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d She stopped me. \u201cI can't lose David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you can lose me,\u201d I said, and rolled the shirt off her shoulder, seeing her perfect white skin in a completely different light to ever before. I couldn\u2019t think about the fact that she was okay with that\u2014that, as I said it, she realised what I was going to do and accepted it, because she could accept my death before she could accept David\u2019s. I pushed the thought aside, breaking to tears beneath the external strength. I owed her this. I owed her my pain\u2014knew how it would feel to know that, as I laid between her legs, she wouldn\u2019t be making love to me, but fighting for him.</p><p>\u201cJase\u2014\u201d She saw it, though. She saw the hurt in my eyes. Her hand slowly came up along my face, and I just wanted to fold into her, cry, tell her I love her, tell her to let him die. Let him go. And you and I will be happy forever. Together. \u201cIf you father the heir, you\u2019ll be going to your death.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don't know?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cYou really have no idea what you are to me, Ara, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d So she knew I loved her, but that was it. She couldn\u2019t fathom the depths I would go to for her. And I just didn\u2019t know how to explain it, how to make her see that I would burn in a fire, drown myself in acid, peel my skin back and suffer for eternity to save her from one tear. \u201cIt would take a lifetime for me to show you how I feel. There are no words I could find to say it in one breath, and I love you just doesn\u2019t hold enough weight for the feeling I have in my soul that you are everything. You are my life, my breath, my reason to get up, to smile, to live each day. I will never let you go.\u201d I touched her soft, rose-petal skin for what might be the last time. \u201cDon't you see? One day my brother will come back here, and I won't get to be with you anymore and, eventually, that will kill me anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jase.\u201d Her pretty lip quivered. \u201cHow can I live in a world without you?\u201d</p><p>She knew the answer to that. She didn\u2019t need to ask. I tore the shirt gently away from her body and tossed it as far from here as it would fly out that balcony door. She was waiting for me to answer, unaware or uncaring that she was completely and finally naked beneath me. She stared up, her eyes so full of questions; so blue with sadness that I knew I had to answer her. \u201cBetter than you can live in a world without David.\u201d</p><p>And she broke. She may have known it before, but she only admitted it then, in that second, and she cried. It was only for a moment\u2014only a few sobs before she stopped and looked up at me, seeing my shirt come away, and pressed her hand to my stomach. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at this fragile, sweet girl below me, her milk white skin against the cream sheets, her dark hair, like silk ribbons, spilling out around her face and over the pillow. Her eyes, like sapphires, the pupils so dark and so large with the heat of desire, forced an intake of breath in me\u2014a pause to make this a memory\u2014hold it in my heart for just a while longer.</p><p>\u201cWill David really hate me if I have a baby to stop him from dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll get over it.\u201d I ditched my shirt to the end of the bed and fell on my hands over her body, keeping mine off hers enough that I could maintain control of my emotions. \u201cThink of the agony he's been going through these past few months, probably worrying whose hands he\u2019d be leaving you in once he\u2019s dead.\u201d Like mine. It was better this way. He would, eventually, forgive me, and her. I grabbed her hips and slid her down under me so she was in perfect line. \u201cHe knows this will happen, he just believes it\u2019ll be when he's gone, cold in the ground. But it doesn't have to be that way.\u201d</p><p>Her mind went white with surprise; she thought I\u2019d rather see her suffer the pain of losing him so I could have her for myself. She was dead wrong.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said, answering that thought, even though I knew she hated it when I did that. \u201cNot sad\u2014not eternally grieving him, Ara. If you really do love him more than me, then you will not ever be happy again if he dies.\u201d I reached down and unzipped my jeans. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this. I'm giving you my child, and I will die happy, knowing that I at least left a part of myself behind\u2014in you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t have anything to say. I waited for a second to see if she wanted to back out. But she didn\u2019t. She wanted this.</p><p>She wanted my death.</p><p>She wanted him.</p> <p>I pulled my jeans past my hips, floating off the bed for a second while I yanked them away with my boots and socks inside the legs, and as the air touched my skin, my knees, my thighs, it came with the warmth off her beautiful body. I felt as if our skin was touching before I even fell back down between her legs. And as I laid myself there, where only my brother should be, her thoughts changed. I expected her to be tense, unwilling, maybe even push me away, but she looked up, and her heart beat once, steadying itself, her soul crying out inside her for this to happen, making her eyes electric blue\u2014the static in her fingers charge everything with energy. She wanted me. Not him. Not Mike. Me.</p><p>And I was going to take full advantage of that. She would be the last girl I ever loved before I died, and I wanted to enjoy her as if she was mine. So many things I always dreamed of doing to her\u2014so many things I had one last chance to do. \u201cI'm sorry, but ...while I have you completely naked, I'm gonna do something I've wanted to do for a long time.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went to my lips, as if she knew what I was thinking. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I sent her an image of my plan, raising my brows. \u201cKiss you somewhere naughty.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth popped open in obvious shock, and I laughed as I moved down on the bed, tracing every one of her perfect curves with my lips on the way. I stopped above her ribs, where the cursive line of her Promise remained from her Walk of Faith. \u201cThis,\u201d I said, kissing the Mark, \u201clooks incredibly sexy on you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI'm not sure I fit in a sentence with the word sexy,\u201d she scoffed.</p><p>\u201cTell that to my body.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks flushed with the idea of what she might make me feel\u2014little, plain, ordinary, unattractive Ara\u2014her too-thin body under this man who was cute and carefree, with a sexy tattoo around his firm arm and a tanned chest bigger than her husband\u2019s. She compared herself to Emily in that breath, wondering if I thought Emily had a better body, or if I even compared them\u2014or if I\u2019d ever even slept with Emily. I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I wanted to laugh. She just had no idea\u2014could not conceive the depth of my want for her\u2014how I loved her, needed her, purely because she was my Ara. Fat, thin, short hair, no hair, zits or warts or scars. I loved her. I wanted her flat against me so badly I couldn\u2019t exhale the tightness in my chest away.</p><p>She could feel the heat coming off me, but she couldn\u2019t feel the intensity\u2014the way the lust burned through me worse than the fire that melted my skin in my 1942 plane crash. I was harder than I\u2019d ever been, more wanting than I ever wanted to be again, and as my lips went past that permanent tan line above her absent undies and onto the soft patch of hair between her legs, she flooded, too: heat and moisture spilling against my lips like melting chocolate. My brother clearly had never done this to her before, and as my tongue slipped inside, like she was some soft, ripe fruit, tasting the milky smooth sweetness of this girl I\u2019d loved for so, so long, she moaned, crying out my name. My name. I\u2019d brought her heartache and pain. I\u2019d damaged her body, her soul, but as I gently slipped my finger inside, reaching up to where the muscles tightened, I was finally the one bringing her pleasure.</p><p>Her spine arched, pushing her closer to my mouth, and I worried for a second that the stubble on my chin might scratch her, but as I checked her thoughts, she clearly didn\u2019t mind. Her legs parted further and she held her breath, trying to be quiet but not really succeeding, and each time I rubbed that delicate spot then kissed her gently after, she wanted to shake inside, not sure whether to laugh, cry, squirm or run.</p> <p>I saw a flash of blue spark her fingertips as I looked up for second, but she pinned her hands under her pillow, hiding it. And my mind raced with questions. For some reason, that spark caused no pain, no shock when it flared in this situation. I felt it warm her toes against the bottoms of my legs, but it didn\u2019t hurt\u2014not one bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s funny?\u201d I asked when she giggled.</p><p>\u201cThat kind of tickles.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, pressing my wet lips into her belly, moving firm kisses over each rib, all the way up to her breasts. They were so soft, so full, fit so perfectly into my hands, and I wanted to tell her that I\u2019d never seen such purity in a girl\u2014the pale pink of her nipple, the way it set so softly into her milk-white skin, like she was some kind of angel or white blossom I had plucked from the Garden of Eden. I traced a gentle line around it and let my tongue follow, drawing the fullness into my mouth for one sweet kiss before burying my face in her jaw, coming finally to rest my open mouth on hers.</p><p>It was too much for her. She\u2019d wanted this for too long.</p><p>She reached down and I jumped as her small hands touched me, slid me closer to the Threshold of No Return.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cArgh! You\u2019re killing me!\u201d</p> <p>I laughed against her mouth, too afraid to move away in case the kiss ended. It was perfect this way, as if my heart was finally filled with the blood it needed to survive. And our lips wanted nothing more than to stay together\u2014comfortable, warm, and familiar. I\u2019d kissed many girls before, and none of them felt this right. I just wanted to hold on and never let her go. I loved her. And it was as simple as that. No matter what I\u2019d done or would ever do to hurt her, I loved her.</p><p>She moved her knees, lifting them up, wrapping her legs around me, and I could no longer bear it. I slipped my hand between her legs and guided myself inside her, thrusting a little harder than I meant to. But she cried only with pleasure, her heart feeling what mine did: free, complete. I could see it in her thoughts.</p><p>She tangled her fingers in my hair, using all her strength to hold me close.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked, laughing into the curve of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d David was never that passionate. \u201cI'm okay.\u201d</p><p>So she liked it a little rougher. I looked down at her, smiling as I moved my hips against hers with a little more force, hearing our flesh clap each time it met. I needed to be closer, but I couldn\u2019t pump that way if our chests were touching, so I slowed things down and laid my body atop hers, resting my jaw on her brow, feeling her soft breath warm against my throat.</p><p>There was a kind of energy between us, surrounding us, that felt solid, like we were grounded by a force outside our awareness. She leaned down and kissed the Mark on my arm softly, closing her eyes as she remembered the first time she saw it by the lake that day\u2014how much she loved me even then.</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I stopped and drew back to look down at her, dead shocked. I never ever thought she\u2019d have the strength to admit that to me\u2014not in a million years. \u201cI love you, too, Ara. For forever,\u201d I said, then quickly kissed her mouth. \u201cAnd I will die loving you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled back, closing her eyes for a second as my words entered her heart and soul, killing her a little. I couldn\u2019t look. I didn\u2019t want to see her suffer for my death, then reason that it was better than losing David. Then again, maybe I deserved to see it.</p><p>I looked down to where our bodies connected, watching myself go inside her, the gentle curve of her waist and the soft white flesh on her belly colouring my peripheral. She was so petite; hips small enough to wrap my hands around, her thighs almost too bony, the joints showing where her legs parted\u2014only a soft, small handful of flesh covering it, quivering each time I brushed against her. I wanted to bite her there\u2014could almost taste the memory in the back of my throat; could still see remnants of the scar I left on the night I tried to turn her. But she wasn\u2019t thinking about that. She was ready. Her body getting hotter and wetter. I wasn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d felt an orgasm before, but I was hell-bent on making sure this was one she\u2019d never forget.</p><p>I leaned back a little and licked my thumb before pressing it to the most sensitive spot a guy can ever touch a girl. And she swore, her body almost freezing with shock. Clearly, David had never ventured to this realm, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she said, way too loud.</p><p>I looked over at her door, smiling. \u201cClitoral stimulation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Such a sweet innocent thing she was.</p><p>Her eyes met mine, and past the obvious pleasure she was feeling, I saw curiosity. She wondered why I was smiling that way, what I found so funny. But it wasn\u2019t amusement, not at her expense anyway. I was just happy. Happy to be here, with her, feeling her this way.</p><p>I felt her tighten inside. And her mind told me to move left, when I knew I needed to move right. I shifted my thumb, making softer circles, pressing firmer each time she groaned, and when the tightening reached the highest point inside her, I let go, thrusting myself toward it, falling down hard on top of her.</p><p>Moisture flooded between us, making everything deliciously wet, scented with her sweet smell. She could hardly breathe, hardly focus on anything, and her fingernails went deep into my ribs, cutting, her legs firmly around my hips, pulling me into place, holding me exactly where she wanted me.</p><p>And I let go\u2014felt myself release, emptying every ounce of love, lust, desire, pain, sorrow, regret and longing into her, imagining my life force race through, deeper and deeper to a place where miracles happened and life was conceived. We were one.</p><p>One soul.</p><p>One heart.</p><p>One love.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>A lifetime of eternity folded out in the seconds before us, and she was mine for all that time. I saw it all\u2014the future, the past, the world that could and never would be. I was not in it. And a part of me wondered, as much as it hoped, that she would not move on from me\u2014she would not be okay without me, because I knew that each day that would pass until my death, I would not be okay without her. A threshold had been crossed, and I never wanted to go back to before. Back to wondering what life would be like loving her. I\u2019d tasted it now, and I would never again be the same.</p><p>I could feel her fragile body beneath mine, feel her tight and warm around me, feel every move, every twitch inside her, but the only thing my heart focused on was her hand against my chest, placed there so absently; a touch of love, her thin fingers so precious and delicate, so fiery and dangerous, so sweetly and wonderfully mine. I closed my eyes and focused on our last seconds together before all this would end. If I could have taken her life in that breath and given mine at the same time, and it would\u2019ve meant we\u2019d stay like this forever, I would have.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d I slipped my hand beneath her spine and rolled her body up, cradling her face to my chest, feeling her soft, lustful breaths brush my bare skin as tears fell past my lashes and into her hair. \u201cI wish I could hold onto you like this forever.\u201d</p><p>She kissed my chest, running a finger over the wet spot her lips left, then wrapped herself around me so tightly I held my own breath. I never wanted her to let go, but I knew it was time. I knew the heat would die down any second now, allowing room for regret, fear, concern...sorrow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>I shuffled back, slipping out of her. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis won't make it okay.\u201d</p> <p>My gut sunk. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean...I love him.

I can see the way he\u2019ll look at me when I tell him the baby\u2019s yours.\u201d She shut her eyes around that thought.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I kissed her eye, running my thumb over her lashes. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll tell him together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked up at me. \u201cWe can't. He needs to be free to have an emotional reaction.

I've goddamn well seen him hit a girl before.\u201d I stood beside her, wishing I could touch her, make her see reason. \u201cWhy won't you listen to me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s irrelevant, Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook what we did.\u201d She pointed at the bed. \u201cWe betrayed him. We loved each other in his bed. He\u2019d be right to hurt me for that, Jason.\u201d</p><p>I ran forward and gently grabbed her arm. \u201cNo, Ara. He wouldn't.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust get off me.\u201d She shrugged away. \u201cI don't want this anymore. I don't want the confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not confusing, Ara. You love me. You said it yourself.\u201d I tired to touch her again, but she pushed me away.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don't want this! I don't want to love you!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>Her words moved across space and time, coming to rest in the deepest, most tender part of my heart; she meant that.</p> <p>I stood taller, scanning her thoughts, feeling the ache go deeper, appearing in salty pools in my eyes when the confirmation only stared back at me again and again.</p><p>She meant that.</p><p>She may have loved me, but it wasn\u2019t what she wanted.</p><p>She sent the thought to me, standing strong, looking so beautiful and perfectly pale there, completely naked in front of me, that I refused to believe it. \u201cAra, I can't read you right now,\u201d my voice shook. \u201cI need you to tell me you don't really mean that.\u201d</p><p>Her lip quivered as she looked into my eyes, and I felt her soul break free of her heart\u2014felt this icy rush of agony tear through her. She sunk to her knees and covered her head. She looked so small and fragile and ...hurt. I hurt her. Again. And again. And again.</p><p>\u201cI don't know what I feel,\u201d she said. \u201cI just need you to go. I just need to be alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Okay.\u201d I grabbed my jeans and slipped my legs into them, my heart breaking so deep I grabbed a pillow off the floor instead of my shirt. \u201cI\u2019ll uh\u2014\u201d I wanted to say I\u2019ll see you later, but I wasn\u2019t sure I would. I wasn\u2019t sure she would ever look at me again, nor was I sure I could hang around to see her hate me tomorrow.</p><p>I opened the door and took one last look at that broken, beautiful girl, and closed it behind me, checking the corridor for onlookers.</p><p>The halls, the rooms, every corner of the manor was more isolated, more unbearably empty that morning than any day I\u2019d ever spent alone or in pain. I walked slowly back to my room, holding my breath and her pillow to my chest, my jeans hanging low down my hips, the rest of my clothes tucked under my arm.</p><p>I\u2019d just spent the most wonderful night of my life in the arms of the only girl I would ever love, and today, I would mourn that mistake.</p><p>I stood outside the dream, watching Jason through my own eyes again, and when I blinked, saw myself sitting on the floor in my room. My naked body flickered with blue light each time I heaved the sadness from my lungs. But I didn\u2019t stay there. I rose, covered my body with a thin nightdress, and tiptoed from the room.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I asked myself, but she didn\u2019t hear. And I no longer felt like this was just a dream. It was too real. I felt the air, the chill, the tears fall from her eyes and down my own cheeks\u2014felt the wind whip my hair out then, coming off the ocean in a violent swirl. A storm raged above us, making the lighthouse we were suddenly standing on feel rocky and unstable. I bent at the knees, reaching both hands out as if to grab on to something, but she didn\u2019t. She stood at the cusp of the roof, her toes hanging over the abyss, her heart-shaped locket in an outstretch hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I yelled over the wind.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. She didn\u2019t need to. Both this girl of the past and the one of the future knew what came next.</p><p>Her hand opened, releasing the locket a second before she threw herself over the edge.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I jumped for her, but I missed, and her thick dark hair slipped through my fingers, following her to the rocky depths beneath. \u201cWhat have you done, Ara? Please\u2014please let this just be a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t a dream. I knew, as I looked over the edge and saw David lift her in his arms, fall to his knees and cradle her mangled body to his chest, that all this had already happened. I slept with Jason, loved him as I\u2019d never loved any man before, and I threw myself off this lighthouse because I didn\u2019t want to face that pain. I didn\u2019t want to love him.</p><p>Months had gone by since that day, and things had changed so much that everything David and I once were had now become something new\u2014built on something entirely different to what our love had been built on before. I didn\u2019t want to lose that. I didn\u2019t want to be that girl who died for the pain of loving two men equally. I wasn\u2019t her anymore.</p><p>\u201cLet her die.\u201d I stood in the field as David carried her toward the manor. \u201cDavid, you won\u2019t love her anymore. Please don\u2019t cry for her.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to reach out and make him okay. I wanted to touch him and let him see what she\u2019d become\u2014show him what she\u2019d done with his brother while he was searching for a way to save their future child.</p><p>\u201cAnd now you see,\u201d she said, standing beside me in the air of the stilled morning\u2014the trees in the field unmoving, the breeze having retreated with the storm almost as quickly as it came. \u201cThis is why I jumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She clutched the bloodied edges of her nightgown. \u201cBut, I\u2019m not going back to my body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll make you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it already happened.\u201d We both looked off to the manor then, and everything went pitch black.</p><p>I opened my eyes to the dawn touching my room\u2014my fingers tangled around the sheets under me, and took a few heavy breaths, trying to compose myself. But I couldn\u2019t. I\u2019d slept with Jason. That feeling\u2014the empty feeling like I\u2019d forgotten something\u2014that was it. All this time, my heart was trying to tell me what I\u2019d done.</p><p>I sat up and hugged my knees, folding myself into a small ball at the head of my bed.</p><p>It was all just too late. My love for David had changed, and far outweighed what I felt for Jason now. But the damage had been done, and couldn\u2019t be repaired or clouded by a stolen memory. I was a monster\u2014not fit for this world, not fit to be queen, and certainly not fit to be David\u2019s wife.</p><p>The sun rose and fell again. My door opened, faces came and went, stared at me, touched me, talked at me, but I ignored them all, even Jason, who squatted by my side, brushed his fingertips over my hairline then stiffened all over. He knew. He saw that I\u2019d had the dream\u2014saw that the block he\u2019d put in place wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep my inquisitive mind out if it was searching for something. Problem was before was, I just didn\u2019t know I needed to be searching for something. But he should have guarded his own dreams with more care, knowing I could sometimes enter them. And then again, maybe he meant for me to find that one. Maybe he was just tired of carrying that burden on his own.</p><p>He sat down beside me and said nothing for the longest time, and I didn\u2019t mind his company. In a few days, we\u2019d be separated for good. It had to be that way. In this short time David and I were allowed to be together, free of restrictions, I\u2019d grown to love him greater than I ever imagined possible. And if I was going to lose that now, I never wanted to see another man, or feel another happy feeling, as long as I lived.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to tell him, Ara,\u201d Jason said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to destroy your last few months together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d I whispered, and he was so shocked I spoke that he gasped, coming up on his knees. \u201cOnce he finds out,\u201d I added, \u201che won\u2019t have a reason to die for me anymore.\u201d</p><p>I heard him sigh my name out, but when I looked up, the sun was suddenly gone and so was Jason.</p><p>\u201cAra, please?\u201d Morg stood in front of me like some sour-faced old hag at a nursing home, jamming a plate in my face. \u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten for two days. Just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d I said numbly, my face dry and sore from tears.</p><p>\u201cFine. I will. But you can\u2019t keep this up. David\u2019s called three times. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall him.\u201d My eyes met hers, and the blackness of her pupils expanded. \u201cCall him, tell him to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, but. . .\u201d She looked down at her phone. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>The tears spilled out over my cheeks then, without having filed a request. \u201cJust tell him to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him yourself.\u201d She held the phone to my ear.</p><p>I heard his breath, heard him ask Morgaine several times what was wrong with Ara, but I couldn\u2019t speak. I couldn\u2019t tell him over the phone. I wasn\u2019t even sure I could actually find the words to say it.</p><p>He let out a long, soft sigh. \u201cMy love? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease come home,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cAra, I can\u2019t. Look, if this is about the dagger, I swear I\u2019m not planning t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust come home!\u201d I screamed down the line, hearing David's short gasp before I threw the phone at Morgaine. She caught it, her eyes white with shock, and gently stuffed it in her pocket, taking backward steps until she closed my bedroom door behind her.</p><p>I heard his voice down the hall. I heard Falcon brief him on the \u2018situation\u2019 as they stood outside my door. My heart beat in my throat, knowing what would come next\u2014knowing how my world would come undone like a loose thread, and there would never be any way to wind it back together again.</p><p>The door opened and David just stood there for a second, taking in this form on the mattress\u2014all cuddled up to the bed-head, her face probably red and swollen.</p><p>He squatted down by the bed, reaching out for my leg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo!

What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I. . .\u201d I sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cAw, Ara?\u201d he said, half laughing, cupping my chin. \u201cSweetheart, just tell me what it is and we\u2019ll fix it. Please?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix it, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He laughed again. \u201cMaybe we can\u2019t. But I can at least make you feel better. Come here\u2014\u201d He reached for me but I jerked away and looked up\u2014looked him right in the eye, holding back all the tears, the self-pity, the quivering lip. He didn\u2019t need to, nor would he want to see it.</p><p>\u201cDavid. . .\u201d The world stopped. \u201cI slept with Jason.\u201d</p><p>His smile widened, a breathy laugh escaping through it before his eyes darkened and he slowly looked down at the ground. \u201cYou did what?\u201d</p> <p>I wanted so badly to say I was sorry. I was sorry. But that was the last thing he\u2019d want me to say, and I was sure it would result in his hand across my face. \u201cI slept with Jason.\u201d</p><p>He stood up. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>My gaze travelled past him to the five figures standing stunned and still in the room behind him. I closed my eyes, hiding from the ache in theirs. I hadn\u2019t heard any of them\u2014not one of them walk in the room.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d Jason stepped forward, but Falcon grabbed him by the arms, holding him in place at command of a single pointed finger from David. \u201cJust let me explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. Not,\u201d David said, angling his face away. \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI said, shut up.\u201d The cool in David\u2019s voice sent shivers through my body. He turned and looked at me. \u201cGet her up. Get her on her feet.\u201d</p><p>Blade gently hoisted me to stand by my arm; my legs tingled where the blood rushed back into them after so many hours sitting in the same position, and my feet went so numb Blade pulled me closer to hold me upright. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, but I didn\u2019t answer. My eyes were locked onto David, gauging his every move against my expectations. I shouldn\u2019t have been afraid, because anything he chose to do to me would be fair. But I was scared as hell anyway.</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d David said.</p><p>Mike looked up from his hands where he\u2019d fallen to sit on the coffee table. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know?\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t even speak. He was completely lost for words, and I couldn't decipher what I saw in his eyes\u2014the hurt, the anger, the worry\u2014whether it was for what I\u2019d done, or for what David had the legal right to do next.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago?\u201d David looked at me.</p><p>\u201cThe lighthouse.\u201d</p> <p>He folded forward ever so slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s why you were out there? That\u2019s how you fell?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd . . . what? You . . . you were just gonna. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know.\u201d Jason took a step forward, stopped instantly by Falcon. \u201cI erased it.\u201d</p><p>David just nodded, his jaw so tight his cheeks hollowed. \u201cThat\u2019s real fucking convenient, isn't it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to be that way,\u201d Jason said softly. \u201cShe couldn\u2019t carry the burden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe burden?\u201d David said, pointing at me. \u201cThe burden is hers to carry. She . . . oh god!\u201d He dropped both hands to his knees, catching his breath. \u201cI can have you both stoned for this. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d Falcon added, looking at me with that stern disapproval he\u2019d seemed to have traded for friendship over the last few months. It was all destroyed now. Everything. All the faith they had in me, just gone, like sudden death.</p><p>\u201cJust. . .\u201d David stood tall again. \u201cJust get out. Everyone.\u201d</p><p>No one moved.</p><p>\u201cI said out!\u201d he screamed, grabbing my arm as I went to pass. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d Mike\u2019s hand came down on David\u2019s wrist, making a tight grip as he forced it off me. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will do as you are told, or I will have you whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019m not afraid of a lashing.\u201d He stood halfway between David and I. \u201cYou might be the king, but she is still my best friend, and I will not leave her at your mercy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I officially relieve you of your duties.\u201d He walked over and opened my door, leaning out to look down the corridor. \u201cGuards!\u201d</p><p>Mike took a step back, his eyes holding the deepest, most feared apology.</p><p>\u201cArrest him for violation of matrimonial rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, please? Don\u2019t take this out on\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilence.\u201d He pointed right in my face. \u201cOr this gets worse for all of you.\u201d</p><p>I backed down, shaking my head at Mike.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ara,\u201d he said, laying both hands behind his back as the guard cuffed him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for her, it won\u2019t,\u201d David said coldly, and before Mike could react, his eyes going wide, his foot lifting only an inch to move toward me, the guard cupped his chin and the back of his head, twisting until his neck snapped and he went down hard.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s arm shot out and blocked me off. \u201cStay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay, Ara,\u201d Blade said, dragging me backward. \u201cHe\u2019ll recover from that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d I hid my face in my hands. \u201cHe was just trying to protect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the same fate awaits anyone else with any stupid ideas,\u201d David said, turning to me. \u201cYou are entitled to the protection the law allows, Ara. Nothing more. And it does not protect you from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Jason?\u201d I asked.</p><p>David\u2019s eyes darkened, his lips parting to say something, when Falcon cut in, his knuckles going white where they fought to restrain Jason. \u201cOrders, Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrow him in a cell.\u201d David waved his hand at them. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with him later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d Falcon bowed.</p><p>\u201cDavid, please,\u201d Jason begged. \u201cPlease. Do what you want to me, but don\u2019t touch her. She\u2019s ca\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlade,\u201d David ordered. \u201cSee that Falcon gets him to the cell without incident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you will it.\u201d Blade bowed his head, obeying, but his soul and heart would never be at David\u2019s command. He looked Jason in the eye, muttering an apology, and twisted his arm up behind his back.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d Jason yelled. \u201cBlade, you know what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t protect her, mate,\u201d Blade said, his voice strained with the fight. \u201cNone of us can.\u201d</p><p>But Jason wouldn\u2019t give this up, not even for his friend. Limbs tangled and blurred between them, like cars moving fast down a freeway, the rest of us watching on, just waiting for the uneven odds to work in someone\u2019s favour.</p><p>\u201cAra, just run,\u201d Jason screamed. \u201cJust\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Morgaine groaned, tossing the dagger from her belt to Blade. \u201cJust shut him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot it.\u201d He caught it with one hand, forcing his arm down over Falcon\u2019s as they slammed Jason face first into the doorframe, pining him there. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mate. This is gonna hurt me a lot more than it\u2019ll hurt you.\u201d</p><p>Jason cried out, the dagger slipping between the bones in his neck, paralysing him to submission in one strike.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I screamed, but the door slammed shut on the empty room.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry for him,\u201d David ordered, shoving my hand down from my mouth. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare shed one tear for him, Ara. He will get more than a dagger to the spine when I\u2019m done with him.\u201d</p><p>I let my hands fall to my sides, my fists tight. \u201cIf you touch one hair on his head, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll what?\u201d He moved in, startling me with the speed of which he came up. \u201cYou\u2019ll what, Ara? Leave? Good. Fuck him to hurt me? Already done that, so what else can you do? What else can you possibly do that\u2019s going to make me give two ounces of shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d My mouth hung open, nothing coming out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to deal with this, Ara,\u201d he said, his voice softer than before. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with you\u2014what to say, what to feel. I\u2014\u201d He touched his chest, swallowing like his throat had narrowed, and sat down on his side of the bed\u2014his head in hands.</p><p>\u201cDavid? I don\u2019t know, either. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk. If you know what\u2019s good for you, do not let one word come out of that fucking slut mouth of yours.\u201d</p><p>I was so taken back by those words that I forgot everything I planned to say.</p><p>The silence lingered in the room for so long then. I tried not to breathe, not to do anything that would alter the pattern of his thoughts. My life, and Jason\u2019s life, rested on his decisions right now, and he was so clearly hurt I was sure he was capable of anything, even carrying out my punishment himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over,\u201d he said suddenly in the quietest breath, as if the very notion had just struck him, bringing down all the realisation of the lonely centuries to come on top of it.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I whispered, but it was so low he wouldn\u2019t really have heard it.</p><p>\u201cYou made a promise, Ara. That\u2019s it. I trusted you, believed you. I. . .\u201d He stood up and faced me, touching his chest. \u201cI gave you the one part of myself I never ever gave to anyone else because I believed you would hold it sacred, protect it, cherish it like I did yours. I would never have hurt you that way, Ara. Never in a million years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I sobbed, sucking the streaming tears from lip. \u201cAnd I loved you too, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my eternal love just wasn\u2019t enough for you, was it? And who\u2019s the fool?\u201d His voice broke. \u201cIt\u2019s not you, is it? No.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m the fool. I\u2019m the one stupid enough to believe this was real\u2014that anything outside death, murder, hatred, loneliness was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was real.\u201d I stepped a little closer.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was stupid. All of it.\u201d He laughed, closing his eyes. \u201cAnd I knew it from the start. What did I say to you that day, Ara\u2014what did I say the day I left you in the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll dreams eventually die,\u201d I muttered, seeing his face\u2014the way he loved me back then\u2014so different to how he looked at me now. Because, now, he really believed those words.</p><p>\u201cI should have listened to my own wisdom then. I should never have given everything up for you. I left my Set, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t give up the Set for me. You gave it up because justice failed you, and\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d he asked, incredulous. \u201cIs that what you honestly think?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re even stupider than I thought, Ara.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr maybe there\u2019s just always been this miscommunication between us.\u201d I reached for him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d He jerked away. \u201cDo you think I want you to touch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what? What should I do, Ara? You tell me, because I\u2014\u201d His eyes drifted off to one side, coated thickly with tears. \u201cI just don\u2019t know anymore. I . . . for the first time in my life, I just . . . I got no answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just need to think, to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThink about what?\u201d He offered both palms. \u201cYou won. What d\u2019you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay. I want you to think about things before you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d His shoulders lifted once\u2014his heart completely breaking under the stern gaze he tried to hold. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone. I was wrong. I . . . I had this idea in my head. God!\u201d He tapped his temple a few times, folding over. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I just listen? I should have known love like that was too good to be true. And I believed it, Ara. I did. I believed it to my core\u2014to the point where I was blinded enough to actually think the feelings you had for my brother were plutonic\u2014that it was just confusion or maybe that he felt more for you than you did for him. I never\u2014\u201d He paused and looked out the window, sniffing once. \u201cI never, for one second, believed you actually loved him, that you could actually. . .\u201d His voice broke and his hand came up to cover his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have known, David. And you shouldn\u2019t have even had to imagine it was possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I should\u2019ve seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. It\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t. I blame you. And I blame him. And you are goddamn well lucky you told me, Ara, because I\u2019d found out for myself, I\u2019d have beaten you to death with my own hands.\u201d</p><p>My heart skipped a beat, restarting again a little faster. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, David. I get that. But I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re capable of murder.\u201d</p><p>Very slowly, and with what looked like hesitation wrought with an awful lot of anger, he moved his gaze onto me, rolling his shoulders back so he stood as tall and strong as a king\u2014his uniform broadening his shoulders, the sword in his belt glistening in the afternoon sun, as if whispering its evil will. \u201cI\u2019m the king,\u201d he said, seeming to find the meaning in those words only as he spoke them. \u201cYou are guilty of treason, and I have a duty to uphold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, please. It\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! Say. A word, Ara.\u201d He turned to the window, his lips fighting their own battle with his thoughts. \u201cI\u2019m not going to charge you with this crime because, right now, the monarchy is unstable, and your people need an honest, strong queen.\u201d</p><p>My throat opened with the sudden breath of shock. I covered my mouth.</p><p>\u201cEven if it is a lie,\u201d he said, his lip turned in disgust. He held my gaze for a second, then made a very stiff, very slow about-face and walked away, closing the door gently behind him.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p> <p>I opened my door and Falcon stepped into sight, his head hung low.</p><p>\u201cGo away, Falcon.\u201d I pushed past him. \u201cI have nothing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what you think, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I stopped dead and spun around to face him, my words coming out through my teeth. \u201cDo not address me in such an informal manner. You are a soldier in the Queen\u2019s Guard, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I acted as such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You sided with the king. You did his bidding. You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did what I had to to protect you, Ara,\u201d he yelled, then stood taller, sobering himself. \u201cUnder the laws of the Lilithian Monarchy, you and all your guard are bound by the sacred right of matrimony. We cannot go against your betrothed. How he sees fit to punish you is out of our control. He could place you over his knee and spank you right in front of us, and we can\u2019t do a goddamn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? But. . .\u201d My eyes flicked over every inch of Falcon\u2019s face. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why Blade and I have spent the better part of this morning amending those laws. There was never need for a bylaw that gives a guard the power to protect his queen from her own husband. It just hasn\u2019t been done in this monarchy before, and we never imagined it would. I\u2019m sorry. I know we let you down, but even if that hadn\u2019t been the case, I still would\u2019ve arrested Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019d have gotten you both killed. If he\u2019d stepped in and tried to defend you, the king absolutely would have lost his temper. Why do you think Blade was so quick to knock Jason out, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>He touched my shoulder. \u201cThe best thing for you, for all of us, was to get Jason out of sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you left me alone with him\u2014not knowing what he\u2019d do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I never\u2014\u201d He slashed his pointed finger through the air, \u201c\u2014not for one instant, left you alone with him. As soon as Blade had everything under control, I was outside, on your balcony, making sure he did nothing to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>I softened, dropping back on my heels. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>His lips pursed to hold his jaw tight, and I saw the faintest shimmer in his eyes. \u201cWhat kind of man do you think I am?\u201d</p><p>I folded my arms. \u201cI guess I just don\u2019t really know who I can trust anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can trust me.\u201d He stepped closer. \u201cIf the king had so much as even thought about raising a hand to you, I\u2019d have smashed that glass door and been under his fist before it struck your face, Ara, even though, to do so, would mean I faced the death sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe death sentence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the punishment for acting against the king\u2019s sacred rights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d go to that length for me?\u201d I said, half laughing as though it was preposterous.</p><p>He grabbed my arm again. \u201cI am sworn by my own blood to protect you. But even if I undid that oath, Ara, I would still die for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve it or not, I care about you. You\u2014\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cIn truth, you remind me of someone I lost many years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnie,\u201d he said, moistening his lips. \u201cMy little sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you ever had a sister.\u201d</p><p>He smiled fondly. \u201cShe was just as naive and pigheaded as you, but I loved her, Ara. And I . . . I don\u2019t want to admit it, but I goddamn well love you too\u2014as if you were my own sister.\u201d</p><p>I just about melted into a puddle of reverence on the floor, but I reached out and hugged Falcon instead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Fal. How did she die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was hit by car. She was only seventeen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me back. \u201cJust . . . just don\u2019t ever think that I don\u2019t have your back, Ara. I am always on your side.\u201d</p><p>I nodded against his chest and backed away. \u201cOkay, then you need to come with me right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo rescue Jason.\u201d</p><p>He winked down at me. \u201cAlready on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He nodded to the end of the corridor. \u201cBlade\u2019s got a release order drawn up for you. He\u2019s waiting in the Great Hall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA release order?\u201d We started walking. \u201cWhy do we need that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been imprisoned, Ara. Not just locked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what grounds?\u201d</p><p>Falcon smirked. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, the king has no right to hold him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless he either fabricates a crime, or tells the truth about the affair.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard, looking to the path ahead. That was the first time I\u2019d heard our act of sin referred to as an affair. And it made me feel dirty, but also lucky David saw the need for a queen in our monarchy, or this evening could\u2019ve been spent in a very different environment. \u201cWhat about Mike? Where\u2019s he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn bed, sleeping it off.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a bit then. \u201cDid the guard hurt him?\u201d</p><p>Falcon shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat about Jase . . . did they. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason\u2019s been banged up pretty bad, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking and covered my mouth. \u201cBy . . . David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure. But he left about half an hour ago. No one\u2019s seen him since.\u201d</p><p>I started walking again. \u201cWill David come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said suddenly, closing his door as he stepped out of his room.</p><p>My footsteps halted just in front of him.</p><p>\u201cAmara\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t, Arthur.\u201d I put my hand up between us. \u201cI know I\u2019m a disappointment, and I know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t what I was going to say.\u201d He leaned down a little, placing his hand on my back. \u201cI already knew about the affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortly after you fell from the lighthouse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean jumped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He looked up at Falcon for a second. \u201cMy dear girl, for what happened that night with Jason, I do not blame you. And I do not blame him. You were in love. And, yes, you committed an act of sin. But for all the morals and conventions in the world, Amara, I cannot find it within my heart to place blame on either one of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet, we\u2019re both guilty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr, perhaps, it was meant to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeant to be?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his gaze to the floor. \u201cYour heart always has been torn between the two boys. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not anymore, Arthur.\u201d I tapped my chest. \u201cMy love for David has changed so much. I don\u2019t want to love Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do love him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I took a small step back. \u201cI said I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I love his brother.\u201d I swept past him and started down the stairs quickly.</p><p>Blade was in the doorway to the Great Hall before I even reached the base, wearing a huge smile, holding up a stack of papers. \u201cReady then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take me to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Morgaine said, coming up behind Blade.</p><p>\u201cMorgaine,\u201d I warned. \u201cI have nothing to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I had to do what I had to do. You should never have slept with Jason if you wanted to protect him,\u201d she said, grabbing my arm as I dashed past.</p><p>And the sudden contact of her hand on my skin made the anger inside me, made the vision of her tossing that dagger to Blade, boil up in my body like compounded steam. I swung around to knock her hand away, deciding at the very last second to hook my right fist across her jaw instead. She hit the ground like a sack of apples, dead shock widening the eyes of our onlookers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Morg said, clambering to her feet. \u201cMaybe I deserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and a lot more.\u201d I pointed in her face. \u201cLet me make this clear to you, Morgaine.

Morgaine, however, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The entourage charged forward, with the queen at the helm, our shadows menacing the walls, and as we reached the end of the cellblock, even the guard on duty felt the threat. He stood to attention, his hand on his belt. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlock this door.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, My Queen, I have orders from the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnder article three, section five,\u201d Blade started, stepping in. And Arthur grabbed the keys off the guard\u2019s belt and unlatched the door, shoving it open.</p><p>Our eyes darted across the dark space, moving from one corner to the other, but Jason wasn\u2019t there. \u201cArthur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in there,\u201d he said, offering me the path. \u201cI can smell his blood.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth, noticing it then, too. \u201cWhat have they done to him?\u201d</p><p>He lowered his cheek to mine and aimed his finger to the centre of the room for me to follow. And there, at the end of my gaze, was a beaten, bloodied man\u2014his arms chained, back flat to the wall, head hung loosely between his shoulders. His cuts had healed, wherever they had been, aside from the deep gashes cuffing his wrists where they\u2019d clearly been tugging at the chains for too long, but he wasn\u2019t conscious, and the blood of his agony still smothered his skin.</p> <p>I was by his side before my eyes even closed into their next blink, and had the chains torn off, his head in my lap before Arthur noticed I was gone.</p><p>\u201cWhat have they done to him?\u201d I screeched.</p><p>\u201cOnly what was asked, Your Majesty,\u201d the guard said, looking up from the Release Order.</p><p>\u201cBarbarians,\u201d Arthur said, stepping into the cage. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>The man ignored him. He was clearly a vampire and really didn\u2019t have all that much compassion.</p><p>\u201cIs he gonna be okay?\u201d I looked up to where Arthur squatted in front of us.</p><p>He examined Jason and nodded, giving me a reassuring smile. \u201cHe\u2019s already done most of the healing himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d I sat back against the wall and tangled my fingers in Jase\u2019s hair, holding him close to my heart, as if maybe the beat would rouse him from sleep. The wall was still warm where his body had been against it for so long, and sticky with blood. I just didn\u2019t care how gross it felt under my shoulder, though. He didn\u2019t deserve this. I got yelled at\u2014lost my marriage, but my fate was in no way equal to his. And I knew this was just the beginning. David wouldn\u2019t let Jason live now, and he certainly wouldn\u2019t let him stay at the manor and support our cause any longer. This embrace, this moment holding him while he was unconscious was, I knew, one of my last.</p> <p>\u201cAra?\u201d he mumbled, trying to lift his hand.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d I leaned down and kissed his bloody hair. \u201cIt\u2019s me. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, are you okay?\u201d He looked up suddenly with panicked eyes.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m fine, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you? I\u2019ve been so worri\u2014\u201d He coughed, cupping his ribs after\u2014the sound ending in a short whimper.</p><p>\u201cYour ribs. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think my lung might be punctured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I slid my wrist past my teeth, ignoring the sting as the skin tore open, and pressed it Jason\u2019s mouth.</p><p>He looked at it for a second, then at my eyes.</p><p>I smiled down at him. \u201cJust drink. If David wants to kill me for sharing blood with you, so be it. He shouldn\u2019t have had you beaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Jase said, and started drinking.</p><p>I stroked his hair back lovingly, revelling in the warm rush of blood leaving my veins. \u201cWho did then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d He sat up a bit, shifting rigidly to the wall beside me, not even bothering to wipe my blood clean from his mouth. \u201cI deserved it, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you and I slept together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cJase . . . you did it to save David.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm around me and held me close. \u201cAnd that still doesn\u2019t make it okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t. It was stupid and impulsive, but. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to slide my fingers into his hand and hold it. I wanted to tell him I wasn\u2019t sorry, wanted to say that I loved him, that I jumped off that lighthouse because I couldn\u2019t live in a world where my heart was torn. I wanted to tell him that I could be his now that David didn\u2019t want me. But I wouldn\u2019t have meant any of it. Truth was, I did love Jason\u2014loved him more back then than I did now. And all I wanted in the world was to go back to that night and stop myself from doing what we did, even if it meant David would have to die. Because I could live with that a lot easier than I could live with his pain.</p><p>I rested my head on Jase\u2019s shoulder and just sat with him, the guard, Arthur, and Blade all watching on, until the air cleared and Jason started breathing properly again.</p><p>\u201cKnock-knock,\u201d I said, tapping on Mike\u2019s bedroom door.</p><p>He looked up from the cardboard box on his bed, laying a shirt in it as he turned around. \u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre. . .\u201d I walked in with my arms folded, eyeing the ten or so staff that were packing things down and closing up boxes, the evening sun setting quickly in the sky behind them. \u201cAre you leaving me, Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned away again and added the rest of the shirt pile to his box. \u201cI\u2019m being evicted\u2014moving down the barracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese rooms are for the highest ranking members in the monarchy, Ara. David ranks higher than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s moving in here?\u201d I stepped forward in one sweeping move, my jaw leading the way.</p><p>\u201cGuess so.\u201d Mike rubbed his neck. \u201cOh, by the way, we\u2019ve called an emergency council meeting\u2014just the private council, to discuss our next move. We\u2019re meeting in the Round Room in twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, okay.\u201d I looked at the clock on Mike\u2019s wall. \u201cBut it\u2019s almost dinner time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings need discussing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think, Ara? How \u2018bout that little confession you made this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t realize there was anything to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is.\u201d He sighed, shaking his head. \u201cLook, just let me get this finished, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, But. . .\u201d I stood back and let him pass with his box. \u201cWell, how\u2019s your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d He dusted his hands off and slid his thumbs into his pockets, dropping his head while he let out a huge sigh. \u201cWhy\u2019d you do it? Why\u2019d you sleep with Jason?\u201d</p><p>I closed my mouth and drew a really long breath through my nose. \u201cHonestly, Mike, because I loved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLoved. As in . . . past tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of.\u201d I bit my lip for a second.</p><p>\u201cSo, what, your feelings changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so much changed for how I feel about Jason, but . . . for how I love David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what? You didn\u2019t love David before you slept with Jason?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cYeah, I did. I just . . . see, when David and first I met, I came to realise one day, well, to believe, that I couldn\u2019t live without him. Then he told me he had to leave and I could never see him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he was a vampire and didn\u2019t want you to hate him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I stepped back so a maid could carry a box out the door. \u201cI was so crushed. As you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>Mike nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen, he told me I could be with him forever, but I had to be a killer, you know, leave all my family and friends behind. Which, you know how I felt about that, right?\u201d</p><p>Mike scoffed, turning away to fold another box as I spoke.</p><p>\u201cBut, after I nearly died\u2014you know, with the whole masquerade thing, I decided I wanted to go with him\u2014be a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t have the gene.\u201d He nodded to himself.</p><p>\u201cYeah. So, he left me for my own good. And it hurt.\u201d My voice broke. \u201cAnd then he came back, but even then we still weren\u2019t free to love each other because, at any minute, the Set could\u2019ve come for him and taken him away. We\u2019d had nothing but stress and worry, and it wasn\u2019t until he came back from \u2018the dead\u2019 and lived here at the manor that we ever had a chance to just be together, as every couple should.\u201d I smiled, thinking about the better times. \u201cThings changed for me, Mike. There were some humps in the road as we figured out how to love each other, but we did figure it out. And I was happy. I didn\u2019t, for the first time since I met him, want anyone else in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this realisation happened after you\u2019d already slept with Jason?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t really matter what you feel for him now, baby, does it?\u201d he said absently, sealing another box with clear tape. \u201cYou destroyed that door when you slept with Jason. He won\u2019t ever take you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that. But, it. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHurts to admit?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cDo you hate me?\u201d</p><p>He breathed out, looking down at both of his big hands, then back up with a sympathetic half-smile. \u201cWhat happened on the lighthouse, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I stared out the window, reliving a flashback, blinking against the light when my mind returned to this day.</p><p>\u201cDid you fall?\u201d he asked accusingly. \u201cOr did you. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI jumped.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, wetting his lips. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was mad at myself. I . . . I didn\u2019t think I deserved to live after what I\u2019d done. And I didn\u2019t like the truth I realised when I was with Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was in love with him.\u201d</p><p>He nodded again. \u201cSo you tried to kill yourself to escape it all? To just, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, please.\u201d I took an absent step back from him, just needing some air. \u201cEveryone hates me now, okay. Everyone is mad enough as it is. Please don\u2019t be one of them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to say?\u201d He walked calmly over to stand in front of me. \u201cI love ya, baby, but you messed up something cruel, and then you went and tried to take the coward\u2019s way out.\u201d</p><p>I blinked rapidly, sending the tears back where they belonged, trying so hard to breathe in a gentle rhythm, but the pain of regret made my chest cave. I folded over, holding my breath.</p><p>\u201cLook, don\u2019t get me wrong, Ar.\u201d He placed one hand to my back and the other around my arm, and gently made me stand straight again. \u201cI feel for you. I do. And I hate to see you like this, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did this to myself. I know.\u201d</p><p>He patted my shoulder. \u201cThis too shall pass.\u201d</p><p>I nodded up at him, forcing an odd kind of smile.</p><p>The corner of his lip pressed into his cheek and he patted my shoulder again, leaving me to find my own way out.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t move out,\u201d Blade said, and I stopped walking, pinning my back to the wall in the shadows of the rounded stairwell. \u201cWe have to keep up appearances or the Upper House will start asking questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe they should,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cMaybe the people should know what their queen did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you insane?\u201d Mike jumped in. \u201cThey\u2019ll butcher her, Morg. You know what the punishment for infidelity is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Emily said. \u201cMike, what is it\u2014what will they do to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could be whipped, at the very least,\u201d Falcon informed.</p><p>\u201cBut the old favourite for Ancient Lilithian times, still in practice today,\u201d Quaid said, \u201cis La Br\u00fblure de la Chastet\u00e9.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Em said.</p><p>\u201cThe Burn of Chastity. It\u2019s where the victim\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccused,\u201d Morg corrected spitefully.</p><p>\u201cThe accused,\u201d Falcon said, pausing after. I heard him swallow hard, even from all the way back here. He cleared his throat and started again. \u201cThe accused is held down on a bed, with her legs strapped into stirrups.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, then they heat this small iron club,\u201d Blade said, his jagged tone suggesting hand demonstrations to go with the explanation. \u201cAnd they insert it into the vagina to melt it shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe accused would often die of infection,\u201d Falcon added.</p><p>Emily gasped. \u201cDavid wouldn\u2019t let them. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cEven the king and queen are bound by certain rules. If the House find out, Em, they decide her fate, not David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut, surely he has some say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome, yes,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cBut the fact remains. This needs to be swept under the rug like every other act of infidelity in the political history of mankind. There can be no leaked secrets or expos\u00e9s.\u201d He paused for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a media frenzy, here. We\u2019re talking about brutal mutilation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d heal in six weeks,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cMorg?\u201d Mike cut in. \u201cWhose side are you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m neutral. She did wrong, Mike. Maybe, just maybe, this time the punishment fits the crime.\u201d</p><p>I heard a chair scrape out. \u201cI\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m gonna\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit down,\u201d Falcon said in a slightly louder voice. \u201cBoth of you. This is counterproductive.\u201d</p><p>Everyone in the room sighed as if the day had just been too long and they were all wrought with too many problems. And they were. And I caused it.</p><p>I slid down the wall and sat on the cold stone step, listening while they all decided my fate.</p><p>\u201cShe needs to own up to the truth, Falcon,\u201d Morgaine said. \u201cShe can\u2019t hide from this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get that, Morg,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand that it will eventually come out. All things do, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, as her council, we should advise her to stand tall before her people and admit her mistakes. They might be lenient,\u201d she reasoned.</p><p>\u201cAnd what if they\u2019re not?\u201d Blade said. \u201cShe needs to lay low until David calms down. Maybe he\u2019ll just forgive her and all this will be over.\u201d</p><p>A few people laughed.</p><p>\u201cI know her better than anyone,\u201d Emily said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get her out of here for a few weeks? She can pretend to take leave, give David time to calm down, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe needs to face this head-on,\u201d Morg said. \u201cDavid won\u2019t calm down, Emily. That\u2019s beyond ludicrous. I\u2019ve known him for over a hundred years. And the fact that he hasn\u2019t beat her already is a sheer miracle, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know him, too,\u201d Emily yelled. \u201cAnd he loves her, Morg. If he found out the House performed that sadistic ritual on her, he\u2019d rip every last one of them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Morg laughed condescendingly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him at all, Emily. He hates Ara. If she wants to avoid such a \u201csadistic\u201d ritual, then she needs to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat she needs is to know she\u2019s still got friends,\u201d Falcon said, slamming something down on the table. Everyone shut up. \u201cBecause she\u2019s gotta be feeling like just about the loneliest person in the world right now, and she needs to believe that, at least in our eyes, her mistake does not define her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it does define her,\u201d Morgaine continued in the same tone, as if Falcon had said nothing. \u201cShe cheated on David. Cheated, Falcon. We can\u2019t excuse that because we love her.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything for a few seconds, until, in a very small voice, Mike piped up with, \u201cI can.\u201d</p><p>Blade laughed breathily. \u201cAs can I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d said Ryder.</p><p>\u201cYeah, same here,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cI got her back. She\u2019s young, impulsive and makes some downright dumb mistakes. But she\u2019s a good girl, Morg.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s just it,\u201d Falcon added. \u201cShe is just a girl. Almost every person in this room, aside from Emily, is at least five years older than her. She\u2019s been through Hell and back again. She\u2019s had nothing but tragedy since she turned seventeen, and she\u2019s not had a goddamn second to process any of it. She slept with Jason,\u201d he added, exhaling loudly after. \u201cBut I\u2019d bet my life she\u2019d take it back if she could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s the shitty thing about mistakes, isn\u2019t it, Falcon?\u201d Morg said flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we just let them brutalise her?\u201d Blade said, his voice breaking.</p><p>No one had anything to say. Morgaine was right, though; I did this. Not them. I did deserve to be punished. There was no argument to be had. And my council should not have been bearing the weight of my mistake.</p><p>I stood up, dusted my butt off and composed myself into a picture of sovereignty, then walked slowly into the room. They all looked up, their faces changing when they realised I would\u2019ve heard them.</p><p>\u201cDavid wants to move out of our room,\u201d I said calmly. \u201cI understand that, and I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the House, they\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll find out,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, and I will have to stand trial for my crimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, they\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what they\u2019ll do.\u201d I walked stiffly over and sat down on my chair. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay, Em. I\u2019m strong, and I\u2019ve suffered worse.\u201d I smiled over at Mike. \u201cBut I can\u2019t hide from this. It will come out eventually, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t have to be now.\u201d Emily placed her hand over mine. I looked down to where she now squatted on the floor beside me, her caramel eyes reaching to the deepest part of my heart where I knew she hoped to find common sense. But this couldn\u2019t be reasoned with.</p><p>\u201cAlways do the right thing,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd let the pieces fall where they may.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPieces?\u201d she cried. \u201cAra, you heard what they said, what they\u2019ll do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I deserve it, Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stood up. \u201cYou made a mistake. You don\u2019t deserve to be brutalised like that.\u201d</p><p>I looked around the room at each of the faces. \u201cDavid knows what they\u2019ll do to me if they find out. And he knows that his moving to another room will raise questions. This is inevitable, guys.\u201d I shrugged, holding my hands out. \u201cYou can only run from your problems for so long. They always catch up with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they will certainly follow you wherever you go,\u201d David said, and we all turned around to look at him; he leaned on the wall in the doorway, one hand in his pocket, his dark gaze cooling the room. \u201cThe House will know what you did. But not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Mike asked. \u201cWhat are you planning, David?\u201d</p><p>The king curled his fingertips inward, inspecting his nails. \u201cI\u2019m not an entirely cruel man,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I see even the most heinous beast suffer, I feel empathy. But\u2014\u201d He took a stroll across the room. \u201cI refuse to feel empathy for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid? You\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will sit down, Emily Pierce, or you will suffer the queen\u2019s fate along with her.\u201d</p><p>Emily sat down.</p><p>\u201cI will leave instructions with the Upper and Lower House after I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGone?\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d David stopped walking and placed both hands on the back of Morg\u2019s chair. \u201cOnce Drake is dead\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still going to kill him?\u201d I gasped.</p><p>David\u2019s eyes flicked my way once in annoyance, then he continued without answering me. \u201cThen I will have the guards arrest her and she will bear the full weight of the law. Once she\u2019s endured her punishment, if she does so with grace, she will be reinstated and continue to rule the Three Worlds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do what I see fit, Emily,\u201d he said through his teeth. \u201cShe will suffer the consequences of her actions, and there will be no argument. This meeting is over.\u201d</p><p>Everyone stayed put, their mouths hung like frogs waiting for flies.</p><p>\u201cAnd what about Jason?\u201d I asked, turning in my seat to face David. \u201cWhat are you going to do with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said,\u201d David repeated in a clipped tone. \u201cThis meeting. Is. Over.\u201d</p><p>Forks scraped piercing sounds down china plates, while the gentle clatter of wineglasses and murmured dinner conversations gave the candlelit evening a sort of comfortable, almost homely feel, almost as if I could imagine nothing bad had happened yesterday, or as if weeks had passed instead of only hours since I told David about Jason and I.</p><p>At breakfast this morning, Margret and Walt openly discussed David\u2019s move to a new room and how David had laughed it off, said it was nothing but a minor argument between he and I that would resolve itself in a few weeks. And now we sat at dinner, such little time having passed but with so much on my mind, that it felt like I\u2019d never left the table after breakfast. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>David chose to avoid me today, even going as far as to miss Court, with a very valid excuse, of course. I\u2019d been looking forward to that moment when I might sit beside him on the throne, though, perhaps gauge his reaction to me, maybe see if there was any hope at all for forgiveness, even one day, years from now. But the way he looked at me as we sat down to dinner killed all that hope. I swallowed each bite of my meal with the massive lump that had formed in my throat, not sure anything of substance was actually hitting my stomach. I felt wildly sick and hungry\u2014about as hungry as a pauper roaming winter streets, and every time I tried to join conversations, either David just flat-out ignored me, or Morgaine cut me off whenever I opened my mouth. She\u2019d taken a side long before this Jason business began, and it clearly wasn\u2019t mine. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all if I woke to find her leaning over me in the dark with a dagger in her hand.</p><p>David looked up from the other end of the table then, and raised his glass, bowing his head as if to say, \u201cI welcome the idea.\u201d</p><p>Stay out of my head, I thought.</p> <p>I\u2019m not there by choice, he thought back. I\u2019d rather lick Walt\u2019s moustache than be forced to listen to anything you have to think.</p><p>I slinked lower in my seat, looking to Jason for a single moment of reassurance. But his seat was empty, its occupant now assigned to stable duties until David decided what to do with him. Even Arthur was too distracted to offer a quick smile. In fact, the whole room was full of life and laughter, vampires and Lilithians freely interacting and getting along, but the yellow of candlelight and the peaceful hum of conversation slowly turned into grey clouds and pouring rain above me, spitting my own misery out all over the table\u2014wetting the food and the tablecloth, and flattening the hair to the head of each guest. But none of them noticed.</p><p>David performed as his usual kingly self, talking with members of the Upper House, his charming smile and glittering green eyes holding a captive audience as if everything he might say could be of great value. He was glowing, even though the night around us was otherwise shadowed with doom. No one would\u2019ve known by looking at him that he just had his heart ripped out of his chest. And that only made me love him more: he was always so good at playing the game\u2014hiding things away on the inside for the greater good of the world outside. I could learn a thing or two from him. If he\u2019d ever speak to me again which, judging from the last twenty-four hours, I no longer existed as far as he was concerned. Which one would expect, anyway\u2014after what I did. But it still hurt so amazingly bad that everything we had just blew away in the wind, like the flash from a camera. Just gone. Never was. Never will be again.</p><p>None of that mattered to me, though, not the way he\u2019d acted today, or anything cruel he\u2019d said to me. I knew, deep in my heart, that love couldn\u2019t die overnight. He still loved me somewhere in that soul of his, and I wasn\u2019t about to give up on him. Not yet. Not while\u2014</p><p>\u201cMorgaine?\u201d David said, laying his wineglass on the table just above his plate.</p> <p>\u201cYes, Sire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur queen looks rather ill, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>Morgaine appraised me critically, then nodded in agreement. \u201cI think she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe looks fine,\u201d Blade cut in.</p><p>\u201cNo, in fact, I rather think she looks as if she needs to lie down,\u201d David said, and winked at Morg. \u201cSee that she makes it safely to her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Sire.\u201d Morgaine wiped her mouth and stood, huffing impatiently at me. \u201cAmara?\u201d</p> <p>I looked at Mike, then at Falcon, who stood and pushed his chair in.</p><p>\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t follow, Falcon.\u201d David said, raising a hand. \u201cMorgaine will attend to the queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell she will,\u201d Falcon snapped, bowing politely after. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><p>The fire of authority flamed in David\u2019s gaze. He practically scorched Falcon with it, clearly plotting a million punishments he could inflict on my overprotective guard for daring to go against him\u2014in public especially. My heart beat so fiercely in my chest I could taste the blood in my throat. I knew David wanted to challenge Falcon, but he calmed himself instead and took a more honourable approach.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He offered me to Falcon. \u201cSee that she stays in her room for the remainder of the evening. Wouldn\u2019t want anyone else catching whatever she\u2019s carrying.\u201d</p><p>A few dinner guests nodded and chattered in polite agreement, not seeing David\u2019s dismissal for what it was.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d Falcon appeared at my side, shoving Morg away as he hauled me gently to stand by my arm.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I slammed my hands on the table. \u201cI\u2019m not sick, David. And I\u2019m not going to bed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong, Ara. You are sick, disgustingly sick. And unless you care to tell our guests what your ailment is, perhaps you should take my advice.\u201d He presented the room full of people, flashing me a grin so smug I wanted to hit him.</p><p>I grabbed a potato off my plate instead and ditched it hard toward his head, realising what I\u2019d done only as it left my hand and flew past the stunned guests, making the flames on the candelabra\u2019s flicker momentarily before exploding on the back of David\u2019s chair, right beside his ear.</p><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d He stood up, tossing his napkin down, but before he could storm over here and punish me, Mike, Blade, Quaid, and Ryder stood, too, ready to challenge him.</p><p>I eyed my Guard nervously, looking from each one of their stern gazes locked to David, then back at the king. It was a standoff. None of them had the right to challenge him, but all of them were more than willing to. And I loved each of them so dearly in that moment.</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d Arthur said softly, wiping his mouth before slowly standing up. \u201cIt seems our young queen is overtired. I\u2019ll take her up to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest you do, Uncle,\u201d David said coldly, dusting potato mash off his shoulder. \u201cBefore I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Falcon took my arm, leaning in close to whisper, \u201cYou better just go.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, stepping away from my chair, walking backward a few steps until the guests slowly began their gentle, polite chatter again, acting as if nothing happened, while David stood at the head of the table, his eyes black with fury.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say he didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Arthur said, catching up on the other side of the doors. \u201cBut you should have more self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a human-being, Arthur, in part. And I have rights. He can\u2019t order me to bed like some child just because he doesn\u2019t want to listen to my thoughts.\u201d I pointed back toward the Great Hall. \u201cImagine if I tried to do something like that to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cHe was being petty, but you mustn\u2019t stoop to his level.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier said than done,\u201d I scoffed.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I think she went a little below his level, Arthur,\u201d Falcon said, holding back the obvious humour in his tone. \u201cBut she gets points for the look on David\u2019s face when that potato hit the chair.\u201d</p><p>Even Arthur laughed then. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say no girl has ever been brave enough to do that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel bad now, though,\u201d I said, hugging myself.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Falcon guided me along with a hand to my shoulder blade. \u201cHe really did have that coming, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it were me,\u201d Arthur said, \u201cI\u2019d have thrown the steak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it was a bit tough tonight, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Falcon agreed, both of them laughing again. But I couldn\u2019t laugh. I didn\u2019t even want to.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>The majesty of life made the ancient trees feel taller, the wind cooler, and the nakedness of my body pure and unsullied. I was never any freer or any more beautiful than when I left the confines of human convention behind and wandered under the great evergreens of the Enchanted Forest. Nothing changed about my physical appearance when I came here: my feet still connected with the earth, my toes sticking to the dewy leaves carpeting the floor, but somehow I just never felt quite as solid.</p><p>The night still owned this part of the forest, daylight only showing in small flickers here and there in the distance, or through waving leaves in the canopy above. The sun was well and truly up now, but my heart, I think, kept the forest shadowed, hiding things inside me that I wasn\u2019t ready to awaken. Fears. Worries. Heartache.</p><p>I walked on, taking the long way to the stone altar, in no hurry today to get back to my life, but it came into sight up ahead before I expected: a simple grey boulder, seemingly unremarkable, yet as I reached the clearing, the warmth emanating off its surface, rising from the very core, reached out to greet me, healing broken parts of my soul in a way no other living thing could. Ideas and thoughts that had previously only been suspicions felt like shiny marbles behind glass partitions\u2014finally visible. None of it looked as confusing. And while I hadn\u2019t drawn any conclusions about the questions I asked when I came to visit the Mother, I did get the sense that they were leading me down the right track to the answer. Sometimes, Jase had told me once, reaching a conclusion is not so much about seeking the answer, but knowing which questions to ask.</p><p>\u201cHe always was a smart boy, that Jason.\u201d</p><p>I looked down from the treetops to a pair of shiny black eyes, set on the sides of a very scaly face. \u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean, it\u2019s you: you\u2019re the one who was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuiding you on your Walk of Faith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2014\u201d I stepped closer. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>It looked off to one side like it was exasperated, shifting its long body then from where rested on the Stone to an almost standing, kind of human position, changing, reshaping until wings popped out on its back and its body shrunk before my eyes, resembling a butterfly. \u201cI am the mother of earth\u2014of all life, young goddess. You\u2019ve spoken with me many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are still yet to be allowed that privilege, Auress,\u201d she said, changing again, her form wavering like heat on pavement at a distance, and when my eyelids shifted up from a blink, a tiny blue bird sat before me. \u201cI have many faces. Some you have seen before, some you will see again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you come here today?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cChild, you understand so little of the world you rule.\u201d She looked around. \u201cI have not come here today. I am in all things. I am life, breath, I am the trees and the grass. I am you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yeah, but what I meant is...\u201d I walked a little closer. \u201cWhy have you chosen a physical form for me to address?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am here to give an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question you just asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked a question?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She leaped off the Stone with a graceful flap of her wing and appeared behind me as a butterfly again. \u201cFollow me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo seek the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was the question?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen you see the answer, you may remember the question.\u201d</p><p>I followed her, walking slowly through this sacred land, both of us greeting the birds and the bugs as we passed. When we came to the border where I left my clothes, the butterfly perched itself on a tree branch.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook beyond the answer to find the question, Auress. You ask yourself this many times a day, and every visit to this forest has had the one question in mind, beneath all others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will I know if I\u2019m asking the right question to the answer you give? And what is the answer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook up, Auress. The answer is staring at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you do that?\u201d Jase asked, leaning on a tree nearby with his arms folded.</p><p>\u201cOh, shit.\u201d I covered my breasts with my hands, squatting down on the spot to hide the other bits I didn\u2019t want him to see.</p><p>Jase laughed and appeared behind me, wrapping his over-shirt around my back. \u201cSeriously? Why do you walk naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s. . .\u201d I stood up, closing the shirt across my front. \u201cClothes are a distraction, sort of. When I\u2019m naked, the, I guess, \u201cvoice of Nature\u201d comes through so clearly. It\u2019s almost like I can hear the whispers of the universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKind of like why the Walk of Faith was always done naked?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded, folding over a bit so the shirt covered any hair I wouldn\u2019t normally show. \u201cIt\u2019s out of respect, really, as if to hide your true form is to be ashamed of it.\u201d</p><p>He bit his lips together, trying not to laugh. \u201cAnd now you\u2019ve lost your clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Jase.\u201d I slapped his chest.</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d He laughed, jumping back a few steps. \u201cI\u2019ve already seen you naked.\u201d</p><p>We stood there then, just looking at each other, and the longer we looked, the less naked I felt. I stood a little bit taller, letting my arms fall loosely to my sides.</p><p>Jase took a jagged breath as the shirt parted slightly and showed my milky white skin in places he didn\u2019t usually see\u2014just a thin line down the centre of my body, revealing the bone between my breasts, my belly button, and the apex of my thighs. And he wasn\u2019t strong and noble and wise to me then; he looked scared and young, and so adorably timid I almost laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to me as it does to you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNakedness,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexual for me. Not out here.\u201d</p><p>He looked around the forest, nodding. \u201cCan\u2019t say I feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. No one was supposed to be around.\u201d</p><p>He kept the nod going, clearly suffering under his external cool. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I am suffering.\u201d He took a few steps away and started digging under leaves and branches. \u201cLet\u2019s just find your clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, a little shocked that I was suddenly behind him, and closed the shirt as he stood up right in front of me.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be nervous around me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I am in love you. It might not mean anything to you to be naked right in front of my eyes,\u201d he said with a small laugh. \u201cBut it just makes me wanna hold you, and I can\u2019t. I know that. I know it\u2019s not right. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain, Jase.\u201d I lay my hand over his where it tightly capped the shirt closed. \u201cI know how you feel about me. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, turning away. \u201cLike I said, let\u2019s just find your clothes, because I\u2019m not really sure how much longer I can control myself, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I wet my lips, shaking my head. \u201cYou don\u2019t need control. You have honour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonour means nothing when I just wanna slide my hand inside that shirt, all the way along your soft, naked hips, and pull you in close\u2014hold you until all that pain I know you\u2019re feeling goes away or, at least, doesn\u2019t hurt so bad.\u201d</p><p>My skin practically left my body then and jumped into his arms. I wanted that so badly, too. But more than I wanted Jase, for once, I just wanted him to be David.</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He nodded, his whole face shadowed with a frown. \u201cI. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never changed, Ara.\u201d He held both hands up when I went reached for him. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not mad at you, or anything. I just . . . it\u2019s never gonna change, is it? Not even now you\u2019re free to be mine?\u201d</p><p>I slowly moved my head from side to side.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he whispered so low I almost didn\u2019t hear. \u201cGuess I should\u2019ve accepted that a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase, wait,\u201d I called, but he turned and walked away at human pace, without looking back.</p><p>The kitchen was quiet. All the staff were having lunch below the manor, my knights were all at training, and all my friends were off doing something of value. I sat at the table in the centre of the room, tapping my fingernails against the ceramic mug to make some noise and maybe blend out the loneliness I felt today, but it didn\u2019t work. Mike\u2019s brownies, however, did. Well, maybe not with the loneliness\u2014I took another bite and closed my eyes to savour the flavour\u2014but they at least gave me a second of joy. Eating something Mike made, I guess, was like going home to visit your parents after growing up and moving out.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to eat your problems,\u201d David said, leaning in the doorway.</p><p>I threw the brownie down and wiped my mouth. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anyone was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d He walked in. \u201cThat\u2019s the fourth one you\u2019ve eaten.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the plate. Sure enough, I\u2019d gobbled up pretty much the whole batch. \u201cGuess I was hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t.\u201d He moved over and stood beside me, closer than he\u2019d been to me in days. \u201cYou\u2019re eating your problems, and it\u2019s showing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShowing?\u201d I looked down, following his smug stare.</p><p>\u201cDo think I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s noticed how fat you\u2019ve gotten?\u201d</p><p>My blood ran cold. I sucked my gut in. \u201cIt\u2019s just a little. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was gonna say pot.\u201d I patted my belly. \u201cAnd, can you blame me?\u201d</p><p>His brows moved up his forehead and he scratched just beside his nose. \u201cNo, I suppose not. You never really did have any self-control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have plenty.\u201d I stood up. \u201cSo what if I\u2019m putting on a little weight? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m fat.\u201d</p><p>The smugness swathed his face then. He folded his arms and looked me up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re the fattest I\u2019ve ever seen you, and I gotta say, Ara, it really doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d I said through my teeth, the rage moving through my chest, taking control of my arm. He caught me before my hand impacted his face, though, and held my wrist tight, his eyes locked to mine like stony caverns.</p><p>\u201cYou ever try something like again,\u201d he said, gliding into me. \u201cAnd I will do more than just catch your hand. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t frighten me,\u201d I said, but my voice quivered. I came to rest with my spine against the wall, my gaze gridlocked with his\u2014hiding nothing of the fear he created in me. Once, I knew him well, knew he\u2019d never hurt me. But now, I wasn\u2019t really so sure.</p><p>He looked down at my hand, his eyes fixing on the lone gold band around my ring finger. \u201cWhy are you still wearing that?\u201d</p><p>I jerked downward, trying to pull out of his grasp, but he held my hand in an iron grip and capped his fingertips around the ring, forcing it from my finger. \u201cDavid, don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no right to wear this.\u201d He held it up, taking a few long strides away from me. \u201cYou lost that right the day you bedded my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still married,\u201d I said, squaring my shoulders. \u201cAnd Lilithians don\u2019t believe in divorce. So, like it or not, you\u2019re stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get one thing monumentally straight\u2014\u201d He stepped closer, his shoulders rounding to lower his face to mine. \u201cI am stuck with nothing. Our bond may be by that of the law, Ara, but you are in no way my wife. You mean nothing to me nor do the promises this ring symbolises.\u201d He held it up in a circle between his fingers. \u201cWe may not be allowed to divorce, but make no mistake, we are not, nor shall we ever be again, husband and wife. And if I see this on your finger again, I will cut it off with the blade in my scabbard.\u201d He placed a hand to his knife for good measure. \u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, squeaking instead of speaking.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He rolled to stand tall again, ditching the gold band at my feet. \u201cNow pull yourself together. We have Court in ten minutes, and unless you want to be mutilated before my eyes, on this very day, we\u2019d better convey a united front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know you cared.\u201d</p><p>He stopped walking, but didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d I said. \u201cCan you really just fall out of love with me that quickly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the boy I met at school?\u201d I went to walk forward, deciding to stay put instead. \u201cWhat would he think to know you felt this way? Go back, David. Remember us. Remember what we felt then. Do you really hate me so much you can\u2019t ever forgive me\u2014forgive that girl you fell in love with?\u201d</p><p>Both of us stood silently then. I could see his memories flashing and fighting against reality and perception\u2014see him picture me in my yellow dress on the driveway of my dad\u2019s house that first day I arrived. He\u2019d never seen anything so uniquely and perfectly matched to him and all his desires in his hundred years on this earth. He loved me then, and I felt the love surround that thought, but he cast it away quickly, smothering it with images he\u2019d clearly stolen from Jason of the night he and I slept together, making me draw a breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ara,\u201d he said to the floor, still not turning around.</p><p>\u201cYes to what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, love can die in an instant,\u201d he muttered coldly, walking away. I stood motionless, horrified over what he\u2019d seen in Jason\u2019s thoughts. It wasn\u2019t much, just a few stilled images, clearly stolen when Jason wasn\u2019t in control. But it was enough to haunt David. And to haunt me.</p><p>I toed the ring then, seeing the distance from here to floor as much greater than it actually was. And for that moment, I didn\u2019t even feel as if I had the right to pick the damn thing up. He took it from me\u2014threw it to the ground like it was nothing. Because it was nothing, I guess. He was right. All the promises we made gave that ring life, and without them, it was just a plain gold band. It meant nothing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I turned and walked away, too, leaving it behind on the floor.</p><p>Despite personal grievances, neither David nor I let them get in the way of our duty to the people. We politely took the back seat when the other was standing before the Court, deciding the fate of lawbreakers, and it seemed we\u2019d worked out an unspoken system for who ruled on what. David left the humanitarian cases up to me, and anything involving or requiring harsher punishments were left for him. But when those doors closed at the back of the Throne Room and Court had ended for the day, cold, dark David returned, speaking no words to me. I\u2019d turned and offered him a smile\u2014a kind of truce, but he did not accept. He just checked my finger to see that I\u2019d obeyed him and, once satisfied, hurried from the room.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even bother to tell him I left the ring on the floor in the kitchen where he threw it. I didn\u2019t have the heart to touch it again, not when it now symbolised so many mistakes and so much heartache. Someone would find it and return it to me, and I could play dumb\u2014say I\u2019d lost it when I was washing my hands. But at least, for now, I didn\u2019t have to tell anyone David forbid me to wear it. And the lie\u2014losing it\u2014was easier to carry than the truth. Then again, maybe I should have picked it up and kept it in my pocket. It\u2019d only been three days since my confession. I couldn\u2019t really expect miracles. The fact that we could rule with civility between us was divine intervention enough.</p> <p>I rolled onto my back, fluffing my pillows under my head, then just laid watching the sky outside change from black to dark blue\u2014the stars slowly fading out group by group until dawn was on the horizon. I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to walk out and meet with Mother Nature this morning. Although it always recharged me, made me feel as though I\u2019d slept when I hadn\u2019t, or that I was well when I felt ill, I just didn\u2019t feel as if I could be bothered. I went there day after day, trying to find a way to stop David using the dagger on Drake, but the mother only seemed to want to talk about Jason. I thought maybe Jase was the answer, the key to saving David, but I just didn\u2019t know how. Then again, maybe she wasn\u2019t all that concerned about losing David. Maybe she was trying to tell me I should be with Jason. Who knew? I was never really good at riddles.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I sat bolt upright, searching the darkness for the voice when, across the sitting room, a creaky door slammed shut and someone whispered profanity at the sudden loud noise.</p><p>\u201cJase? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d A lamp came on beside him. He stood there by the secret entrance beside the fireplace, his charmingly sheepish smile sending the jitters and ghosts of my instant reaction away.</p> <p>I flopped back for a second and breathed out. \u201cYou scared the crap out of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost dawn.\u201d He nodded to the window. \u201cFigured you\u2019d be headed out for your usual walk soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I sat up and hugged my knees to my chest, resting my chin on them \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on going today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked, strolling over, with both hands concealing something behind his back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid never really had a great life. I mean, neither of you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d He sat down beside me, making the bed dip a little, as if he were human and gravity had any bearing on him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good king. He loves what he does, and he. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still don\u2019t want him to die for you, do you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cSeems pointless. There\u2019s never gonna be a baby now, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it, Ara,\u201d Jason said. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing this to protect the child. He\u2019s doing it because he\u2019s got nothing left to live for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe has a monarchy. He has his uncle. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it.\u201d He smiled at me, making all his lovely white teeth visible. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got you.\u201d</p><p>I thought about that for a second. \u201cI understand that. But why does he care? He doesn\u2019t want me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s . . . he\u2019s lost faith. He never believed in happiness until he found you, Ara. And now that\u2019s gone, he thinks he\u2019ll never find it again. He doesn\u2019t really see any reason to stick around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t get to make that decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry to stop him,\u201d Jase said, and we both smirked, shaking our heads.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s impossible, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to grow up with him.\u201d</p><p>I laughed out through my nose, then nodded at the package behind his back. \u201cSo, what you got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of gift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you,\u201d he said, presenting it with a nod of his head.</p><p>I took it in my lap and considered it for a second: it was square, fat, velvet-red, all bound neatly with a silky black ribbon. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen it, silly.\u201d</p><p>The knot slipped apart like water over glass, and fell away from the velvet with only one small pull.</p><p>\u201cI thought you could wear it when you go walking in the forest, rather than trying to find your clothes again every time,\u201d Jase explained. \u201cIt\u2019s bright, easy to see, and I figure you can hang it off a branch or something.\u201d</p><p>I held up the cloth and my mouth opened in shock as it unravelled in heavy layers. \u201cIt\u2019s . . . Jase, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna try it on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>He stood up and took the cloak, holding it out for me. I wriggled out from under my warm covers and pulled my nightdress down over my undies, turning my back so he could cloak me. And it wrapped my shoulders like a blanket, kind of heavy and warm, with that new fabric smell to it, as if it\u2019d just come from the tailor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect, Jase.\u201d I turned around to face him.</p><p>He tied the ribbon up just under my collarbones, drawing the hood over my head after. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll keep you warm, too, when it gets colder out.\u201d</p><p>I looked up at him from under the cloak, changing the smile in his eyes. \u201cThank you, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Ara.\u201d He leaned in and kissed my head, then pulled away as if gravity were forcing us together. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya later, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>I watched him leave through the secret door, standing in the darkness of a dawning day as if I could slow it down or make it go away. This one would be like the next, and so on and so on, until, one day, David would take that dagger and kill Drake, and I would wake up to the rising sun, but I\u2019d never really see the light again. David didn\u2019t want to live now that he\u2019d lost hope. And I didn\u2019t want to live in a world without him.</p><p>There was only one way to solve this issue now\u2014one way I could save David. If there was no contract, Drake wouldn\u2019t be a threat. And if there was no me, there could be no contract.</p><p>I tossed the cloak aside and ripped my clothes off.</p><p>The solution had been staring me in the face the whole time. He didn\u2019t need to die if there was nothing to die for. He could have the life he always wanted. It would be my gift to him for saving me from the darkness I sunk into all those years ago after I lost my mom\u2014the same darkness I\u2019d never really escaped. I owed him this much. For all the pain I\u2019d caused him, and for all the love I would eternally feel for him, I at least owed him a future as king.</p><p>Quaid stood as I opened my door. \u201cMorning, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning, Quaid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff for your dawn walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d I closed my door, fastening the cloak around my naked body. \u201cYou can head off for a coffee break, if you like.\u201d</p><p>He stuffed his phone in his pocket and flashed me a toothy grin. \u201cI\u2019ll see ya in an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I tried to smile. \u201cSee ya then. Oh, and, Kumar?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d taken leave quite eagerly, but when I addressed him like that, he stopped and very slowly turned around to face me. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you hold onto this for me?\u201d I reached into the little side pocket and pulled out a small handwritten note. \u201cI was going to give it to Jason later, but I don\u2019t want to lose it in the forest.\u201d</p><p>He took the note and thumbed the edge, his eyes staying on it. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a letter,\u201d I said casually and walked past him, holding my head high, even though I just wanted to break apart inside. Of all the people I was leaving behind, I knew it would hurt Jase the most. I didn\u2019t know who to write a farewell letter to, but I knew anything I wanted to say to anyone I cared about would be passed on by Jason. He was the only one I could truly trust. And I knew I could trust Quaid to give it to him.</p><p>The red cloak brought me comfort as I glided like frost over the slated floors toward the Throne Room, passing beneath the cold arches of the manor, blending with the blue shadows of dawn. The words to my letter moved across my lips like a prayer, travelling with the hopes that each farewell would find its recipient. Especially David. There were few words I could offer him as goodbye, and not once did I use the word \u2018sorry.\u2019 He knew, deep down, that I was sorry and that what I did would slowly and surely have destroyed me more than it did him. I didn\u2019t need to tell him that. One day, centuries from now, when he found someone else to love, he would wake and realise all that I would have said anyway. Only then would it mean he was ready to listen.</p><p>The great Throne Room doors opened gracefully, as if welcoming my footfalls to the road ahead. Here, I began my journey home again. Here, I would farewell my past and all the mistakes, and move forward. Finally free.</p><p>I left the cloak at the base of the hill outside and entered the forest in my pure form, closing my eyes and feeling the energy of Nature guide me, gliding through the base of the trees like wind at my feet. It moved me forward quickly, sending word a breath ahead that I was on my way home\u2014that I was coming to return to the place we all once began.</p><p>\u201cSpirits of the forest,\u201d I whispered, \u201cShow me how to return to that which created me.\u201d</p><p>The world went silent, the breeze dying away with the song of birds, and the leaves in the trees coming to a standstill, all waiting as if holding their breath, watching as the spirit of Mother Earth made herself known in this place. I closed my eyes and imagined her there by the Stone up ahead, with open arms welcoming me.</p><p>And I knew what to do\u2014as if her voice itself whispered the answer in my ear.</p><p>One foot over the other, I walked at a pace respectful to the flow and ease of all things living, existing, breathing this world of life in the rhythm of Nature. And as I came upon the Stone, fell to my knees and swiped a nail tip across the centre of my palm, drawing blood to the surface of my skin. She wanted it back\u2014Mother who guarded the gateway between worlds. One must offer blood for anything asked of this Stone. I understood that now. Life, knowledge, magic: all of it could be mine for the exchange of this substance inside me that was connected more richly to the earth at our feet than this very platform in front of me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laid my hand to the Stone and felt it reach up, felt the life force inside it move to the blood on my palm and draw it away. \u201cTake me home,\u201d I whispered my hot breath into the rock. \u201cFree me from the binds of this world so that I might save my people\u2014save the king.\u201d</p><p>I waited, imagining for a moment how Jase would react to my letter, imagining how relieved he\u2019d feel. I knew relief wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d be leaving behind, but after some time passed, I knew everyone would see that this was for the best. One day they would come to understand why I did this. I\u2019d failed at so many things, and for once in my life, I would die getting something right.</p><p>\u201cAuress,\u201d a ghostly voice said.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t need to look up. Didn\u2019t need to see where She stood. I could feel her beside me, feel her touch on my skin. I closed my eyes and smiled. \u201cMother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYoung Auress, defender of all natural things, protector of this realm. Why do you seek to free yourself of your claim?\u201d</p><p>I placed my other hand to my bare chest. \u201cI broke him. I hurt him deeper than any soul should ever hurt, Mother. I can\u2019t save his heart, but I at least owe him his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise decision, young goddess. But not the only path that was laid at your feet.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYet, it\u2019s the one I\u2019m choosing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what of her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer?\u201d I asked, trying hard not to open my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no child.\u201d</p><p>I felt her touch become warmer, almost as if I could feel her smile. \u201cWould you still want to die if I told you I foresee a child in your future?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, my bleeding hand stinging now, going cold as the connection to the earth flickered, fading. \u201cDavid won\u2019t give me a child now, and even if he did, I can\u2019t stop Drake from taking her, not if he lives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAra!\u201d A desperate voice hollered through the dawn shadows, stealing the tranquillity for a second.</p><p>I turned my head and looked for the mother, but there was only warmth there where I imagined her. \u201cHurry,\u201d I pleaded. \u201cTake me now before they come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra!\u201d It called again, and beyond the fog I saw faces, sharpening and taking shape before my eyes: Mike, Quaid, Emily, Arthur, and Jason.</p><p>\u201cGrab her, Mike!\u201d Emily cried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d I ordered, my voice coming through my lips in a deep, almost baritone whisper. \u201cOnly an Auress can enter here now. You\u2019ll die, Mike.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, please,\u201d he begged, taking a step closer.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d I aimed my finger toward him, the command of my voice stopping him in his tracks. He looked down at his feet, trying to move them, but they wouldn\u2019t shift. \u201cI\u2019ve made my choice,\u201d I said, searching their eyes as my gaze travelled over each face. \u201cThis is the only way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason stepped into sight, reaching out to me but not daring to come close. \u201cI read the letter. I know,\u201d he said, his eyes holding the weight of everything I told him. \u201cI know, okay, and you don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one nobody will miss, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ara.\u201d He dropped quickly to a squat, covering his mouth. \u201cPlease don\u2019t think that way. You matter to me, okay. More than anything in this world, sweet girl, and I\u2019ll die without you. You can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>I turned back, laying my other hand on the Stone. \u201cIt\u2019s already done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he cried, and my heart skipped a beat when Arthur sternly said David\u2019s name, telling him to do what he had to do.</p><p>I could feel David here with me then\u2014feel him connected to the earth through me. But it didn\u2019t matter. None of them could touch me. None of them had the power. I was completely wrapped up in the hands of my maker, already wedged between this world and the next.</p><p>I focused harder on my hands, feeling my wrists and arms go through and touch the world on the other side. And it felt like magic, like a warm, happy feeling right in the centre of my chest. Every problem I ever had just fell away then, like petals off a dying rose, making me laugh for that moment. We all took things so seriously there in that world, and as I looked upon the other realm, I realised as deep as my soul was living, that on this side, nothing mattered\u2014not the past, not our mistakes, not our failings as humans, and not our regrets. Here, we were all just life without consciousness.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>I looked down to the cool, familiar hands wrapping my ribs\u2014smooth against my pale, naked skin, and both of us stared for a moment, open-mouthed as the black Mark of my betrayal faded under his touch, bubbling and reseeding back into my body. \u201cDavid, let me go. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go, Ara. I need to take you back.\u201d</p><p>I looked up from his hands at the blue light surrounding my body shining across his face. \u201cOne of us has to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s not going to be you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have a responsibility to your people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re your people now.\u201d I turned back to the Stone, readying myself for the last breath.</p><p>\u201cRight. Now, we do this my way,\u201d David growled, and the skin peeled suddenly from hands, detaching at the elbows as he tore me away, my own cries of agony drowning out the horror in those around me.</p><p>\u201cLet me go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He cradled my body to his, carrying me from the circle of light to the darkest patch of forest by the trees. I screamed for the searing in my arms and soul\u2014feeling it snap back into my body like a sharp elastic band. I couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn't get a grasp on this realm\u2014slipping between death and life intermittently.</p><p>David dumped me on the ground and stood back.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d Arthur cried out, falling to his knees, his hands hovering over my body.</p><p>\u201cShe was too far gone.\u201d David stood above me, a shadow in the now red light of the Stone\u2019s protest. \u201cI had to rip her from that world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve left half the girl\u2019s goddamn flesh behind,\u201d Arthur yelled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll survive,\u201d David said calmly.</p><p>I shuddered, feeling my soul connect completely with my body again, making the agony real\u2014fiery, like Hell had risen through the crack in the gateway David left open, and now ran fury among my limbs. \u201cMake it stop,\u201d I cried, folding in on myself. \u201cMake it stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMove.\u201d David pushed Arthur and Emily aside, and bent down to pick up a rock; my eyes followed his hand to the rise above his shoulder, closing as the stone came down bluntly across my head.</p><p>Long, dark hair wavered along a breeze I couldn\u2019t feel, the pale pink dress, like torn threads of ancient fabric, weaving and waving with a life of its own from her delicate, feminine form. Her warmth spoke her name to a place inside me where faces were not identifiers of those we know, but rather the \u2018knowing\u2019 that showed us who we were by seeing those we were familiar with.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn the world beyond thought,\u201d the mother said, showing me all that surrounded us\u2014just a foggy white world with no ground or sky to show up from down.</p><p>\u201cAm I dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You will wake soon to a room of people who love you\u2014people who refused to let you walk with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She tilted my chin upward. \u201cYou must not be sorry, child, for anything. You are a great and wise queen, and you have done those before you proud.\u201d</p><p>I smiled softly. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it comes as a shock to you to get something right, for once, but everything you have done up until now\u2014all the good and the bad\u2014has been written in the stars, Amara. Your spirit had much to learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was all a lesson? Everything? The suffering, the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it is for all God\u2019s creatures.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head for a second or two, remembering suddenly what she told me before I crossed over. \u201cYou mentioned a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d Her lips closed, her eyes shrinking into a pleasant smile. \u201cShe will bring an end to everything that began centuries ago, and we have gone to great lengths to preserve that future for you, Auress\u2014called on the mightiest power of nature to ensure its survival.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurvival?\u201d I frowned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Her hand moved slowly across the space between us and landed on my belly. \u201cYou will see soon enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you open your eyes, your world will change, and you will walk a new path now, child\u2014one you are finally ready for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou faced many truths in coming to the decision you made this morning. Each one of those showed us how much you have truly grown into the woman we hoped you\u2019d become. And, one of those truths, as fate would have it, has set you free from a bind you tied yourself in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat bind?\u201d</p><p>She removed her hand from my belly. \u201cYour greatest gift in this realm is the heart, Auress. You betrayed yourself, your birth right, and your crown by denying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDenying it?\u201d I thought for a second, then rolled my eyes, keeping them closed after. \u201cJason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a sin against God to lie to those you love, but an even greater sin to lie to yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is the lie, Mother? What did\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to love him.\u201d She shook her head, a smile warming her whole face. \u201cYou do love him, and you cannot deny this any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t deny it. But I don\u2019t have to accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you do not. You, like all God\u2019s creatures, were born with the gift free will. But, Jason\u2019s love is a gift also, and you can do with it what you wish, however, you must not hide the way you feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I need to admit it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already did, and you admitted it to yourself. Now\u2014\u201d She presented my waist, \u201cyou are free.\u201d</p><p>I looked down and slowly lifted my top, but she stopped me.</p><p>\u201cYou are blessed in that your soul is not bound to one eternal love. You can bind yourself to any soul you see fit. You will not spend your life seeking that significant other in order to find peace. But do not waste this blessing on lies. Live for those you truly love\u2014the ones who truly deserve your love in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about David? Is he blessed with a free soul\u2014one that has no significant other?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly.</p><p>\u201cAm I. . .\u201d I touched my chest. \u201cAm I his significant other, his soul mate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I turned and went to cry into my hand, stopping with the warm touch of the mother on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou must not cry for him. For, if you do, you must shed the same tears for the other who is tied to you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait . . .

What one loves, the other will die for, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s . . . me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>I dropped my hand back down to my side. \u201cOh God. Those poor boys.\u201d</p><p>Even the mother of all life had to laugh at that. \u201cMy dear little goddess. This will not be an easy decision for you, but you must know that, when the time comes to choose, you will lose the one you push away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be losing Jason,\u201d I said. \u201cBecause, even if the day comes where I decide I love him more than David\u2014\u201d I shook my head, \u201c\u2014I can\u2019t be with him, Mother. I could never hurt David like that.\u201d</p><p>She touched my shoulder. \u201cThen be prepared to suffer for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve let her go,\u201d Emily sobbed.</p><p>I looked up\u2014looked past the shimmering pink light of life before me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not her time,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cBut how can she live now\u2014in this world. How can she open her eyes and possibly ever smile again after what he just did to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had to do that, Emily,\u201d Mike said dully. \u201cShe was in agony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it shouldn\u2019t have been him to do it.\u201d Emily sobbed again. \u201cHe enjoyed it too much. Didn\u2019t you see his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so stupid,\u201d Falcon said. \u201cHe acted out of duty. That\u2019s all\u2014or I\u2019d have been the first to step in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I know him, Falcon. He enjoyed it. If he really cared about stopping her pain, he should\u2019ve asked Jason to get in her head and knock her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t. No one but the king could touch her. She was still connected to the other realm,\u201d Morgaine said.</p><p>Emily\u2019s lips were cold on the back of my hand with the tear-soaked kiss she placed there. \u201cIt just breaks my heart that she thought that was the only way to end her suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why she did it, Emily. She was trying to save David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to be saved,\u201d she said, and my eyes flew open.</p><p>I drew my hand away, scowling at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide that, Emily.\u201d</p><p>She sat back, sniffling, her eyes small with confusion. \u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Because I am Queen.\u201d</p><p>Emily went to speak, but she stopped when she saw what I felt radiating from my eyes, my skin, and my soul: I was right. I was the powerful being deemed godly by Mother Nature, and I was not to be trifled with. The decisions I made were in the best interests of my people, and that was the only reason even the mother of all life Herself allowed me the passage to the other side. Emily could argue with the old, human me all she wanted, but she could not argue with Mother Nature.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Arthur stood and touched Emily\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEveryone out. I need to talk with Amara.\u201d</p><p>Em hesitated, but Arthur\u2019s eyes had this strong, kind of no nonsense edge to them then that offered a polite warning not to question him. He meant business, and everyone in the room knew it. They filed out one by one; Morg behind Emily, Quaid behind Blade, and Falcon last, offering me a sad kind of smile as he closed the door. I looked away, watching Arthur instead as he took the seat beside me where Emily had been.</p><p>\u201cAre you mad at me, Arthur?\u201d</p><p>His eyes warmed, crinkling slightly on the edges. \u201cNo, Amara. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProud?\u201d I looked up at the glass dome, confused. I hadn\u2019t expected that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up so much since I first met you.\u201d His warm, so David-like hand took mine. \u201cI am . . . my gratitude toward you for doing everything in your power to save my nephew is beyond words. You\u2019ve not given up on him, Amara, ever, and I don\u2019t know even one person who\u2019d have had the strength or the heart to give their own life in exchange for a man that no longer loves them.\u201d</p><p>I pouted mockingly. \u201cI\u2019ll never give up on him, Arthur. And I\u2019m not done trying to save him. There has to be a way. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read your letter.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened a little. Goodbye letters were never supposed to be discussed after death. \u201cThat\u2019s . . . kind of awkward.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed.</p><p>\u201cAmara, what you told Jason in that letter\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him the truth.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI hope so. Because he loves you, and those words have given him reason to want to live again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll believe that when he starts drinking Lilithian Pure blood at dinner.\u201d</p><p>Arthur scratched just beside his eye. \u201cHe put his name on the list for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>I drew my hand away from his and sat all the way up. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake giving that letter to Quaid if you intended it to be read after you were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took it straight to Jase, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t born yesterday, Amara. How do you think he ended up on the Core in the first place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn having all these smart buggers around.\u201d I slapped the mattress, my still raw hand searing after. \u201cDid anyone else read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd David?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cHe refused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason offered it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Jason running toward the Throne Room with Quaid, no queen in sight, and I called to him, asked him what happened. His words echoed through the manor then, Amara, that you\u2019d gone to take your own life, and before I could react, David was behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe heard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did. I offered the letter as proof. But he scrunched it up and pressed it into Jason\u2019s hand again, said farewells should not be written by those not going anywhere.\u201d He stopped for a second, his eyes narrowed as the memory clearly replayed. \u201cAnd he ran toward the Stone alongside his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . . although Miss Emily was pleased David had rescued you, I don\u2019t believe it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he loves me?\u201d I said, nodding to myself. \u201cMore like so I don\u2019t get the easy way out, right?\u201d</p><p>His lips made a thin line for a second. \u201cYou know him too well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, being married to someone will do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said simply and his attention slowly wandered to the balcony and the morning outside. \u201cAmara, my dear, when David pulled you away from the Stone, I noticed something . . . missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d His eyes narrowed, fixing on my waist. \u201cThe Mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I smiled, running my hand over the blankets as if rubbing the Mark away. \u201cIt\u2019s gone? All of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApart from the smallest symbol just above your tailbone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it look like\u2014or say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get the chance to inspect it. I only saw it as Jason lifted you from the ground to carry you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, do you want to look now?\u201d I sat forward a bit and motioned to my lower back. \u201cI\u2019m curious to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot now, my dear. The Mark wasn\u2019t what I needed to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it then, Arthur?\u201d I lay back on my pillow, twisting my long hair into a knot beside my jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t like that worried look.\u201d</p><p>He changed it to a soft, reassuring smile. \u201cNothing is wrong, but I fear I have some news that. . .\u201d He seemed to stop and think for a second, rewording that: \u201cThat may or may not upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut more likely will?\u201d</p><p>He sat back, but as he went to speak, my door popped open and Jason said, \u201cKnock-knock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase.\u201d I pushed my good hand into the mattress under me and sat up again. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClose the door,\u201d Arthur said, waving a hand across the air.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d The door shut and Jason appeared on my other side, dragging a chair closer to the bed. \u201cHow\u2019s the hands?\u201d</p><p>I held them out. \u201cBetter. This one\u2019s healed, but\u2014\u201d I showed him my left hand.</p><p>He cringed melodramatically. \u201cWant some blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I really do. But I better order a Sacrificial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Arthur cussed. \u201cJason, feed the girl, and let\u2019s get on with it.\u201d</p><p>Jason shrugged as if to say, \u201cDon\u2019t argue with the boss,\u201d and I drew a long breath to steady my heart. His vein was open and his wrist at my lips before I exhaled, and the sweet, mildly aphrodisiac quality of his life force ran down my throat, through my body, and made my damaged hand tingle. I didn\u2019t want to look at Jase\u2019s face while I drank from him\u2014didn\u2019t want to see those eyes, see how much he was enjoying this, because I knew it would only make me want to bite him and, after tonight, he would finally be immune. We were finally free to be together, if I decided to take that road. And that just sent a hundred hot ideas into my mind.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d he said, one hand sweeping my hair back softly, over and over.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t made any noise, that I knew of, so I could only figure he heard all of that. I drew my lips away from the wetness of his skin, wiping my mouth with the cup of my palm. \u201cThanks, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mention it,\u201d he said, his eyes locked with a smile onto mine, his hand staying firmly on my head. \u201cHow\u2019s it feel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt?\u201d</p><p>He motioned down to my hand.</p><p>\u201cOh. Um.\u201d I frayed my fingers and watched the last of the raw skin heal over like clouds passing the sun. \u201cIt\u2019s good now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Arthur cut in. \u201cThen we need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I settled down in my bed a bit. \u201cBad news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Ara. Brilliant news,\u201d Jase said, his eyes lighting up then in an almost opposite way to Arthur\u2019s. \u201cSweet girl. You\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I went to sit up again, but just stayed there with my hands poised to prop me up. \u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince June, approximately,\u201d Arthur said dully.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re about seventeen weeks,\u201d Jase added.</p><p>\u201cSeventeen? But\u2014\u201d I counted in my head. Jason and I slept together, like, eight weeks ago. It was. . .</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s David\u2019s baby, Amara,\u201d Arthur said.</p><p>\u201cBut. . .\u201d It didn\u2019t make sense. None of it. \u201cI. . . the pregnancy test was negative. I don\u2019t even have a belly. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Lilithian. Those tests measure certain hormones in human pregnancies. But, immortals don\u2019t change the way humans do. Yours won\u2019t show up on a test. And, as for the belly, well\u2014\u201d Arthur smiled fondly at my waist. \u201cYou have a bit of bump.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laid both hands across it. It was so small it felt only as if I\u2019d exhaled heavily and puffed it out a little. I wasn\u2019t anywhere near as big as my mom when she had Harry. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s David\u2019s? I mean, this belly is more like a. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cA first trimester belly,\u201d Arthur nodded. \u201cLilith was the same, so I\u2019m told. At thirty weeks gestation, she barely looked twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I covered my mouth. \u201cI was pregnant when I tried to kill myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she\u2019s okay.\u201d Jason pulled my hand gently down from my mouth. \u201cShe survived it, Ara. She\u2019s strong, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were only a few weeks pregnant when you jumped,\u201d Arthur said. \u201cIt is my opinion that the life force in the blood of immortals kept her alive for that few minutes your heart stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the fall alone could\u2019ve\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is well protected inside your immortal body. And she has an immortal body of her own. Even if she did, in fact, die with you, she is clearly as restorable as her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur actually thought she was dead.\u201d Jase pointed his thumb at his uncle, half laughing.</p> <p>\u201cAnd with good reason, too,\u201d Arthur defended. \u201cYour abdomen was torn open on one side. Upon closer inspection, I noticed that your uterus was enlarged. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was a pregnancy or swelling, but I was bound by time, so I stitched you back up before anyone could notice, and left what I hoped was a child with a fighting chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I came in to see you after you woke, the old man let his thoughts slip for a second,\u201d Jase said with a grin. \u201cHe was trying to find a way to tell you the baby was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you think it was dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d examined you after everyone left the room\u2014confirmed you were pregnant, but. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still couldn\u2019t hear a heartbeat,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>I looked at Arthur.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Jason\u2019s initial shock about the child\u2019s death, he looked at me as if I\u2019d gone insane and asked why I would tell you the child was dead, when he\u2019d just heard pulses coming from her tiny little brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPulses?\u201d I looked at Jase.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They\u2019re the electrical signals all living things give-off. You should know, Ara. You feel it when you walk in the forest, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I\u2019m in a room with a vampire.\u201d I nodded to myself.</p><p>\u201cYeah, or a human.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can sense them, too?\u201d I asked. Jase</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a talent we share.\u201d He grinned. \u201cSo, I knew she was still alive. We just . . . we can\u2019t hear her heart beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSomething to do with your skin, we figure. It not only protects her from savagery, but conceals her, too.\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand to my belly. \u201cI\u2019m . . . how come I didn\u2019t sense her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you didn\u2019t?\u201d Jase asked, his smile growing.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t felt anything\u2014at all. Aside from hungry.\u201d</p><p>Arthur and Jason laughed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty good news, huh?\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but. . .\u201d The crease on my brow deepened as I looked at Arthur. \u201cWhy did you make plans to use the turkey baster if you knew all along I was pregnant?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI never actually made plans, my dear. I put you off repeatedly, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t ready to tell you about the child, Amara, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it meant there was no way to save David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But now it seems we will lose him anyway.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Jase. His face was stone white and expressionless. \u201cJase, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so cut up when I realised you were pregnant\u2014when. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he realized he\u2019d bedded you for no good reason other than his own primal needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle, it wasn\u2019t like that,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>Arthur stood and moved away.</p><p>\u201cSo, I was pregnant when we. . .?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Jase said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Ara. You know that if I\u2019d known that, I would never have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stole his hand and kissed the knuckles. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. And it\u2019s in the past. None of it matters now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept that David is still hurt,\u201d Arthur muttered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I sat up more. \u201cI messed up\u2014bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us did.\u201d Jase smiled softly at me, squeezing my hand.</p><p>\u201cBut I can either move on from it, or wallow in it. And I have a baby to worry about now, so I\u2019m sorry, if David can\u2019t forgive and move on, too, even enough to be civil to me, then that\u2019s his loss. Not mine.\u201d</p><p>Arthur sat down on the couch across the room. \u201cThen I pray he finds civility before he leaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Jase waited until I looked at him. \u201cArthur\u2019s handing the dagger over to David tomorrow. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I threw my covers back and leaped out of bed. \u201cHe can\u2019t. Not yet. He hasn\u2019t . . . I mean, does he even know?\u201d I clutched my stomach. \u201cHas anyone told him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows,\u201d said a dry, cool voice. I looked across the balcony to where the long-legged king leaned sideways against the railing, his arms folded.</p><p>\u201cDavid, please tell me you\u2019re not going to kill Drake tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He looked at his uncle. \u201cGive us a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Arthur appeared across the room and opened the bedroom door. \u201cJason?\u201d</p><p>Jase sighed, touching my arm as he passed. \u201cI\u2019ll be right outside if. . .\u201d He looked over at David. \u201cIf you need me.\u201d</p><p>I reached down and squeezed his hand. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Tension spread around the room then as the door grated in its frame, coming to a complete stop with me on one side, and my protector on the other.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here to hurt you,\u201d David muttered angrily. \u201cI may hate you, Ara, but I will not cause you physical harm.\u201d</p><p>My shoulders relaxed. \u201cDid you know?\u201d I asked. \u201cBefore today?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, his cold stare staying on my face as I moved across the room and stepped out into the white sunlight.</p><p>\u201cGuess this explains why none of my jeans fit,\u201d I said, relieved.</p><p>\u201cYour jeans don\u2019t fit because you\u2019re fat, Ara. Don\u2019t use pregnancy as an excuse.\u201d</p><p>My lips fell apart a little. \u201cDavid, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up. I didn\u2019t come here to debate your lack of self-worth.\u201d He turned away, leaning his elbows on the marble ledge, the world below his canvas for thought.</p><p>\u201cThen why did you come? Just to taunt me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to make something very clear to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, by all means,\u201d I said, standing beside him, knowing I was crossing the boundaries by getting this close. \u201cEnlighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for the dagger, I promised my uncle I would stay for the birth of the child.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, trying not to laugh with joy.</p><p>David pretended not to notice. \u201cBut that gives you no right to attempt contact with me. Gives you no right to look at, talk to, or even address me as anything more personal than your king. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s ridiculous, I\u2019m your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are nothing to me!\u201d He spun around, yelling in my face.</p><p>\u201cWell, I may not be, but she is your daughter.\u201d I touched my belly to emphasize her tiny little existence.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders back, growing taller inch by inch, his bottom lip coming forward with detest. \u201cA fact I\u2019m forced to accept. And you are lucky she bares my blood\u2014not my brother\u2019s, or I\u2019d have ripped it from your womb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare you spea\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d He moved closer. \u201cI care nothing for you, or for it. I am not your husband. I am not her father. I am a man forced by his word to stay and witness something he does not condone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t condone your own daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014\u201d He pointed at my belly. \u201cIs no daughter of mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? She has your blood. We made her. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was spawned under false pretences, Ara, in a relationship I believed to be love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing but a lie.\u201d He waved a hand through the air to shut me up. \u201cAnd she is as tainted as you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s innocent, David!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer body was growing in you when you betrayed me.\u201d His voice broke. \u201cI will never touch her. I will never touch you. And I will certainly not accept her as my own.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize I was crying until my chest shook and a cold tear dropped down, landing on my bare foot.</p><p>David looked into me with nothing but hatred in his eyes\u2014not one shred of compassion shining through.</p><p>\u201cWhy would Arthur make you stay then?\u201d I asked. \u201cIf you hate us so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my uncle is hoping that by forcing me to wait for the dagger, I may find it in my heart to forgive you,\u201d he said stiffly, looking down his nose at this sobbing mess. \u201cBut he\u2019s a fool.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d he spat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry he forced those terms on you. That\u2019s. . .\u201d I shuddered. \u201cThat\u2019s really cruel.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat.</p><p>\u201cThank you, anyway\u2014for stopping by,\u201d I said, going blank-faced after. I wasn\u2019t really sure why I said that. \u201cYou can see yourself out, I\u2019m sure?\u201d</p><p>He bowed his head once and walked away.</p><p>\u201cOh, and . . . David?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell Arthur and Jason I\u2019m sleeping now.\u201d I folded over a little, standing tall again quickly. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>His answering response was a door closed and a wordless, sad nothingness left in his wake. I looked out at the field in the distance, seeing the tip of the lighthouse, thinking back to the first time I saw this place. Nothing about the landscape had changed, yet everything within it was upside-down and no longer fit the way it should. His anger at me went beyond hatred and worse, because of my crimes, he would not only hate me for the rest of forever, but he\u2019d hate our little girl too.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, little baby.\u201d I touched my belly, sending my words and all the love I had in my heart through to her. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>The day went so slowly, with me stuck on bed rest, that I read every book in my room before lunch, and found myself trolling the library shelves for more I could read up on about my people and the laws of our society. But a pair of arms suddenly wrapped my neck, stopping me dead in my tracks, Emily\u2019s shrill voice echoing my name in my own ears. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d she trilled.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I stepped back, rearranging the pile of books in my arms.</p><p>\u201cAre you excited?\u201d she asked, patting my belly. \u201cYou must be so excited. What did David say? Oh, my God, was he totally excited, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe, uh\u2014\u201d I started, but what was I supposed to tell her? To tell everyone? That he disowned both our child and me? \u201cHe just said that nothing had changed between he and I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hadn\u2019t expected that much.\u201d An eager smile replaced that frown. \u201cBut I bet he\u2019s thrilled to finally have his own little baby.\u201d</p><p>I moved my mouth into an awkward attempt at a neutral smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least you got the baby before all the. . .\u201d She patted my arm. \u201cYou know?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at her hand. Why had everyone suddenly started doing that to me? Every second person I passed that knew the truth about David and I patted my arm. It was the worst form of pity one could offer.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d I said coldly and walked past her, hugging my new study materials.</p><p>\u201cWell, enjoy your books,\u201d she called casually. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget they\u2019re announcing the ball today.\u201d</p><p>I stopped again. \u201cBall?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Didn\u2019t David tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe House are holding a ball in honour of our new princess.\u201d She presented my midsection. \u201cThey\u2019re making the formal announcement at Court today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGreat.\u201d I rubbed my temple. \u201cWhat did David say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there when they discussed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why wasn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuh,\u201d she said, shaking her head. \u201cYou were unconscious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Arthur told everyone else I was pregnant before he told me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He told David first, and David told the House. I didn\u2019t even find out until after Nate did. He told me.\u201d</p><p>I settled back on my heels, noticing I was leaning toward Emily a bit much, as if I were about to attack her. \u201cThey\u2019ll expect us to dance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDavid and I. Our people will expect us to dance at the ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . . he\u2019ll probably \u2018accidentally\u2019 squeeze me too tight and pop my lung.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll get one to match,\u201d Blade said, forgetting for a second that guards are supposed to guard, not join the conversation.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him, then turned back to Em.</p><p>\u201cYou could always ask Jason to be your date,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cAnd how will I explain that to my people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell them you\u2019re courting\u2014that there may be an intent to marry. It doesn\u2019t have to be true,\u201d she added, as I was about to freak. \u201cBut at least you could dance the night with someone you trust, and no one would turn their head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I spun on my heel and started walking again. \u201cThe less I see of Jason, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2014\u201d Em started, but Blade shushed her sweetly with a finger to his lip as he passed, following me up the stairs.</p><p>My door swung open, no one having knocked first, and a group of people entered without invitation. I lowered my book into my lap and watched three giant, gold-rimmed mirrors wander over to my sitting room, followed by a flow of portly women with folds of fabric over their arms, lead by an older woman, whose slim glasses and tape-measure-scarf gave her away as the seamstress who fitted my coronation dress.</p><p>\u201cMrs Hemsley,\u201d I said, standing up to be polite. \u201cNice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pleasure is all mine, dear.\u201d She pushed her glasses up her nose, appraising me. \u201cThe announcement for the ball has just been sent to the Lilithian Times for tomorrow\u2019s print run, and I thought I\u2019d get a head-start on your fitting. Falcon let me in.\u201d She turned and motioned to my guard standing guiltily in the doorway.</p><p>He showed both palms and backed away. Something told me he wasn\u2019t given much choice but to let the old woman in. I laughed. \u201cWell, you\u2019re welcome any time, Mrs Hemsley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagda, please,\u201d she reminded me.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Magda.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow, if you\u2019ll just set your pretty little self over there on those boxes, we\u2019ll get these measurements done and then we can talk fabrics.\u201d She cupped both hands together, turning to the mirrored pedestal area they\u2019d set up just by the windows, and stood waiting.</p><p>I sighed and wandered over, stepping up onto the pink velvet box wedged between the three mirrors, holding my arms out as if I were an airplane.</p><p>A tape measure wrapped my waist first, Magda making a face then that I saw too clearly in the reflection. \u201cMy, you have put on a few centimetres, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed, studying my fuller figure. Now that I could see myself from three different angles, I finally saw what David meant. My butt and thighs were at least one size bigger. But it didn\u2019t look terrible. I looked. . .</p><p>\u201cYou look so healthy,\u201d Magda said, stepping back a bit. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that lovely pregnancy glow, and your immortally seventeen-year-old body has finally taken on the shape of a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d I ran my hand down my hip.</p><p>\u201cMy darling little girl, this is you all grown up.\u201d She offered the scene before me.</p><p>I took a good, long look at myself in the mirror, and in the kind tone of the way she presented me, I actually saw the beauty in my reflection. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll stay like this even after I have the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could not be sure, sweet. Does it really matter to you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI kinda like having curves.\u201d</p><p>Magda laughed. \u201cTry eating a bit more then, and those curves will stay on your hips as long as you want. Now\u2014\u201d She lifted my arm and laid the tape measure to my rib. \u201cLet\u2019s get this done.\u201d</p><p>I twisted and turned and jerked about as she measured every inch of me, keeping my eye on the length of the shadows outside. It was getting dark, and I hadn\u2019t had time to discuss a very important matter with Jase yet. If this took much longer, it\u2019d be dinnertime before we knew it, and then I\u2019d have to wait until tomorrow. But time was running out. David was meeting Arthur in the morning to get that dagger. And yeah, he promised to wait until the baby was born before he used it, but I didn\u2019t trust him. Not one bit.</p><p>\u201cLift your top up there for me, lovey. Just want to get a proper measurement of that belly.\u201d</p><p>I slowly drew my shirt up to my ribs, noticing a slight chill in the air as it touched my bare skin.</p><p>\u201cNow don\u2019t go sucking yer gut in, girl.\u201d She slapped my bottom softly. \u201cIt won\u2019t help your dress fit any better on the day.\u201d</p><p>I let my stomach out to its natural position, and both Magda and I drew a quick breath. I hadn\u2019t seen my belly when I was standing up like this, uncovered by baggy shirts, and it seemed to disappear if I laid flat or sat down, like it almost tucked itself in. So, seeing the almost bowl-like bulge coming from just between my hipbones was a little of a shock\u2014for both of us.</p><p>\u201cThere it is,\u201d she said kindly. \u201cYou mustn\u2019t try to hide it so much, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I only just found out I was pregnant. I thought I was just fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d I asked, running both hands down my belly.</p><p>\u201cI prefer a time when women stayed hidden until they birthed,\u201d David said.</p><p>Magda and I turned quickly to where he stood in the now open doorway.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in \u2018ere?\u201d Magda said, waving him off like a fly. \u201cNo men allowed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the king. I can go where I please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, make yer business known and be off with ya, lad; I\u2019ve a fittin\u2019 to finish and a dress to make in just three days,\u201d she tittered, and lifted my top again, tossing the measuring tape around my waist.</p><p>I tensed, wishing I could pull my shirt down or suck my gut in again. \u201cDid you need something, David?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t answer, I dared to look at him through the reflection, but his eyes were on my belly, his lip lifted in disgust. \u201cPregnancy really is quite offensive. I fail to see the beauty in a heinous protrusion sticking out from one\u2019s abdomen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Magda gasped. \u201cYou\u2019ll break the poor girl\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t worry, seamstress. Ara doesn\u2019t have a heart to break. Look at her\u2014\u201d He angled his head toward me. \u201cNothing I say ever matters to her.\u201d</p><p>Magda looked up at me, shaking her head.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I\u2019m fat and disgusting.\u201d I tried to sound pragmatic, but I just sounded kind of angry. \u201cWhat else did you come here to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a swatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Mr Granger?\u201d Magda asked, jotting numbers down on her page.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ve not talked fabrics, yet, so Mr Granger will need to meet with me later to coordinate the outfits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d David laid both hands behind his back and turned on his heel, leaving the door open after he left.</p><p>\u201cNever mind him, lovey.\u201d Magda lowered my top for me. \u201cMen are like pet dogs; once you get pregnant, they \u2018ave to play up a little to make sure they\u2019re not left out.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, wiping a small, cool tear from my cheek.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have none of that. This is happy times.\u201d She patted my hip, bending to measure my leg again. \u201cNow, we\u2019ve got these measurements all sorted. Time to talk fabric.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, just wishing this was over so I could go down to the Training Hall and toy around with my powers for a while. That chat with Jason would have to wait until tomorrow. Right now, all I wanted to do was bust up a few boulders\u2014and maybe any unsuspecting vampires that happened to pass.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>For a vampire, he wasn\u2019t really all that alert. I half expected that, as soon as I pushed the creaky secret door open and then closed it, he\u2019d jump up and put a blade to my throat, dropping it in shock when he realized who was in his room at this hour. But he just laid there, sleeping peacefully, breathing deeply like all his worries had been blown away in the wind. And I knew it was my recent confession of love that had eased his soul so much. A big part of me wished then, in seeing him this way, that I could forget David and just love Jason. It hurt him every time I tried to hold on to David, I knew that, but David had my heart first. I guess I just needed to be sure all hope for us was gone before I could give my heart away again. Jase understood that. He was good like that.</p><p>I wandered over and climbed up on his bed, a huge smile sweeping my lips for how cute and kind of sweet he looked when he was sleeping. \u201cJase,\u201d I whispered, poking him softly in the arm. \u201cJase.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He groaned and rolled over a little, snapping awake when his eyes met mine. \u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019, sunshine.\u201d</p><p>The sheet slipped down his bare chest a bit as he pushed up on his elbow. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?

Get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He grabbed my arm before I could climb off the bed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe answer\u2019s been right in front of me the whole time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. If you face a battle with swords but hold only a stick, sneak away in the middle of the night and even the odds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that something Arthur said to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, ages ago, but I got to thinking. We\u2019ve been trying to find a way to save David\u2014trying to stop him from using that dagger. Well\u2014\u201d I leaned forward ever so slightly, grinning like a little kid. \u201cIf there is no dagger, he can\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He rubbed his face again, his eyes heavy, half closed. \u201cIf we can\u2019t kill Drake, he comes in here in a few months and steals our baby\u2014\u201d He presented my stomach.</p><p>\u201cOur baby?\u201d I raised a brow at him, folding my arms slowly.</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He sat up more, reaching across to sweep his hand along my waist, cupping the other one right over my belly. \u201cOur baby. I might not\u2019ve put her in there, Ara, but I love you, and I love anything inside you, and since I see no one else around here making a claim to her, I\u2019m officially putting mine forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase.\u201d I placed my hand over his. \u201cDon\u2019t do this to yourself. My greater plan here is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo give David no way out in the hopes he\u2019ll one day forgive you and come back to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and sat back, dropping his forearm over his brow. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll help you. But I don\u2019t think your plan\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever love you again, Ara, even if he has to stick around forever,\u201d he said softly. \u201cAre you prepared for that?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p> <p>\u201cAnd what about Drake? He will come for the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m. . .\u201d I hesitated. I knew I could trust Jason, but even he would go to great lengths to protect me, which could include hindering my plan.</p><p>\u201cYou arranged a meeting with Drake,\u201d he said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cDamn it! Stop reading my mind.\u201d I slapped his arm.</p><p>\u201cStop being so transparent.\u201d He playfully slapped mine back.</p><p>A wave of silence rolled over the bed then. I sat back on the pillows beside Jase and stared forward.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t stop you, Ara, if this is what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He scooped my hand up in his. \u201cI know Drake won\u2019t hurt you while you\u2019re carrying the child he\u2019s waited centuries for. But if you plan to talk with him, at least do it on manor grounds\u2014where we can protect you if he tries to kidnap you, or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready the plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed his hand. \u201cHey . . . thanks, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor letting me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to thank me. I\u2019m not letting you do this, Ara. I don\u2019t control you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you do give your blessing.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, patting my hand. \u201cI think we should\u2019ve negotiated with Drake from the start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, see?\u201d I presented Jase in all his shirtless glory. \u201cThis is why I want you on my council.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWhen the world spins on its axis and Mike and Falcon see I\u2019m not the enemy, then we can talk about that. But, right now, we need to discuss what you\u2019ll do if you don\u2019t like Drake\u2019s terms of agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready got that figured out,\u201d I said chirpily.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He folded his fingers together in his lap, leaning slightly sideways. \u201cThen reveal to me your diabolical plot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he refuses to negotiate within what I consider reasonable terms, my expert team of military operations specialists will find a way to lure him into a trap and imprison him for eternity. Then, once you and I have researched my powers a bit more, we\u2019ll come up with a way to kill him\u2014without taking someone else\u2019s life in the process.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm.\u201d He pressed his lips into a thin line. \u201cGuess you have thought of everything. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>He sat taller, lifting the blanket so he could shuffle closer. \u201cI want you to take Nhym with you when you meet Drake. It might not kill him, but if you use your light through the blade, it\u2019ll stun him long enough for you to escape.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, trying to remember where I put that sword.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under your bed,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cOh. That\u2019s right. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d He nodded. \u201cNow, when do you want to steal the Dagger of Yahanna?\u201d</p><p>I grinned. \u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>We snuck back up the secret passage to my room and stood by the door, peeking out to where Quaid sat\u2014guarding me while I apparently slept.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cPlaying on his phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan?\u201d</p><p>He shut the door a little. \u201cI can put him to sleep, but if anyone happens by, they\u2019ll raise an alarm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll just have to be quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but . . . do you even know where the dagger is now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. David had it before he went to Elysium, but he gave it back as a show of his love for me.\u201d I kind of laughed at how long ago all that felt now. \u201cBut that was the fake, anyway. Arthur never gave him the real dagger.\u201d</p><p>Jase frowned. \u201cThere\u2019s a fake?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, how will we know which one\u2019s which?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d I smirked. \u201cWe take them both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, where\u2019s the real dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s . . . the hard part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d He shut the door completely, glaring down at me, unamused. \u201cYou want me to put my uncle, whom I love and respect, into a deep sleep, then you want me to sneak into his mind and find the daggers?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, half shrugging as though it was no big deal.</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d He nodded and opened the door again. \u201cThe things I\u2019ll do for a girl.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, but it was bit too loud.</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Jase shut the door again. \u201cHe\u2019s standing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Do something.\u201d</p><p>His smile moved slowly across his lips. \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d you do?\u201d I pushed past him and looked out into the hall: everyone was sleeping\u2014Quaid and the five otherwise usually invisible guards lining the halls. But lying on the floor like that, half of them snoring, all of them sprawled out, they were very noticeable indeed. I turned back and grinned at Jase. \u201cYou are so cool.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his collar. \u201cAll in a day\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, come on.\u201d I grabbed his hand and dragged him from the room. \u201cWe need to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore for Quaid\u2019s sake than our own. If Falcon sees him, Ara\u2014\u201d He motioned behind us to the lump of a guard on the ground.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I stopped right outside Arthur\u2019s door, momentarily reconsidering this. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna get anyone in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s no sense in turning back now, sweet girl. Let\u2019s just get it over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I reached out to touch Arthur\u2019s door handle, but stopped. \u201cHe\u2019s not an early riser is he?\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed breathily. \u201cMost days, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d I said nervously. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll turn the handle, and you put him out as soon as the door\u2019s open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. One . . . two. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree.\u201d I pushed the door open and readied myself for Arthur to look up and ask what we were doing, but he was sound asleep in his bed, just a pile of blankets and pillows: snoring blankets and pillows. I shut the door behind Jase and I. \u201cHe snores?\u201d</p><p>Jase just laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Who\u2019d have thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, wait for it.\u201d He grabbed my wrist and stopped me. \u201cJust wait . . . about . . . two seconds.\u201d</p><p>I waited and, there it was: a deep, thundering roll of a sound like a handful of pebbles had been thrown down the back of Arthur\u2019s throat. It peaked to a high whistle, his breath stopping for a second. And I held my own, pausing until his started again, hissing out of him like the deep groan of an angry cat.</p><p>Jase and I burst out laughing. I covered my nose with the back of my wrist so I wouldn\u2019t snot all over the place. \u201cI have got to stop laughing through my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant a wipe?\u201d He offered his sleeve.</p><p>I bumped it away. \u201cI\u2019m fine. Let\u2019s just find this dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Jase turned all business. \u201cI\u2019ll get inside Arthur\u2019s head while you get the fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d I nodded and tiptoed off to Arthur\u2019s dresser drawer, slowly and quietly pulling it open while Jason positioned himself on the bed, placing both hands to his uncle\u2019s head. The dagger was there, in its box, just where Arthur had left it\u2014open to any who might want to get their hands on it. I was certain it was the fake. \u201cHow\u2019s the hunt going?\u201d I asked, stuffing the box under my shirt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He squinted. \u201cJust gimme a sec.\u201d</p><p>I huffed a little impatiently, looking around the room. The sun was peeking over the hills outside, bringing the dawn and all that came with it. The Guard would change over soon, and if we hadn\u2019t finished our mission and climbed back into bed by then, someone would come along and find six men sleeping in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jase said, but he sounded kind of nervous. \u201cYou\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hands away from Arthur\u2019s head and looked at me, then at the lump under my shirt. \u201cThat\u2019s the real dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding.\u201d He appeared by Arthur\u2019s long oak table and waved me over. \u201cLay it out here. I wanna see it.\u201d</p><p>I drew the box out from under my shirt and handed it to Jason. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s the real one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs sure as the sun will rise,\u201d he said, thumbing the lid open.</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause there is no fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He grinned, closing the box again.</p> <p>I looked back at Arthur. \u201cThat cheeky devil.\u201d</p><p>Jase just nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty clever. I did wonder how he had time to forge a fake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn't have surprised me either way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d He tucked the box under his arm. \u201cBest we get this somewhere safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny ideas?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn plain sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in plain sight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe weapons room.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>It was still dark down this end of the island, the sun hidden behind the tops of the trees, leaving the shelves, the rows of swords in stands, and the shields lined up around the space all shadowed and grey. The guard on duty had fallen asleep at his post before we even got here, so sneaking in hadn\u2019t been tricky at all. Knowing where to put the dagger, however, wasn\u2019t as easy.</p><p>\u201cSo much heartache over such an ordinary blade,\u201d I said absently, running my fingers along the jewelled handle.</p> <p>Jase reached down from the towering shelf he was climbing. \u201cPass it up.\u201d</p><p>As I went to close the lid, though, a small corner of yellowing paper caught my eye. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, I\u2019m hanging on with one finger right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, just . . . hang on for longer,\u201d I said playfully and put the box down again, ignoring Jase\u2019s sigh as I dug the frayed parchment out from under the velvet lining.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I read it for a second. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just the page describing how to use the dagger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d He showed a flat palm. \u201cDon\u2019t put it back in. I wanna see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I tucked the page into my jeans pocket and closed the box, tossing it all the way up to Jase.</p> <p>He caught it awkwardly between his chest and the side of his forearm, then reached both hands up to the very top of the shelf, shifting and shoving things aside until he dropped back to the ground with a graceful bend of knees, dusting his hands off on his jeans. \u201cAll done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. And no one will know it\u2019s up there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless they take inventory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I grinned.</p><p>\u201cShow me the page.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Um\u2014\u201d I pulled it from my pocket and handed it to Jase.</p><p>He scanned the symbols slowly, his lips closing, eyes getting smaller and smaller. \u201cI need light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I whispered in a kind of loud voice. \u201cWhat are you doing? We need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see properly, but\u2014\u201d He laid the page on the table and waved his phone over it, lighting the up the small space around us. \u201cThis isn\u2019t right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ink. It doesn\u2019t match the date on the parchment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I spun the page around so I could see.</p><p>\u201cLook.\u201d He pointed to a weirdly shaped letter. \u201cTo the average vampire, this is just an ordinary document, but to my expert eye, this symbol, which indicates the text was written at some point in the fifteen-hundreds, doesn\u2019t match the age of the ink. This ink\u2014\u201d He licked his thumb and rubbed the corner of the page a few times. \u201cIt\u2019s less than ten years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that? Wait\u2014\u201d I put both hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. I probably don\u2019t want the lengthy explanation.\u201d</p><p>He touched my arm softly. \u201cLet\u2019s just say it has a lot to do with pigment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what does that mean\u2014if this document is a forgery?\u201d</p><p>He stood straight again slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think maybe the dagger isn\u2019t what we think it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything could be possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, wouldn\u2019t Arthur have known the document was forged?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed and folded the page up, handing it back to me. \u201cIt\u2019s just not his area of expertise.\u201d</p><p>I smirked, catching the swagger in his tone. \u201cOh, big-noting yourself, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBig-noting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUrm, yeah, it means . . . like, to boastfully exaggerate your own worth.\u201d</p><p>His lips turned down with thought. \u201cWell, I am pretty darn clever.\u201d</p><p>I wrapped my arm around his waist and we wandered out of the weapons room. \u201cYeah, even I have to admit that.\u201d</p><p>Quaid walked me all the way down to the secret garden, giving tips on how to swing my sword and position my feet, stating that I didn\u2019t really need to practice privately because I was a better \u2018swordsmen\u2019\u2014his words\u2014than any of the men in the Core. And I knew that, but the \u2018private\u2019 practice was merely a clever cover.</p><p>I farewelled him, asking him to wait outside in case I \u2018cut\u2019 myself, and pushed the heavy door to the Garden of Lilith open, holding my breath the whole time.</p><p>The door closed with an eerie echo, sealing me in, and a dark figure showed itself, his familiar black cloak brushing the ground as he stood and cast his gaze upon me. I stopped to take him in: his short dark hair, set in thick, wavy locks around his face; his pale skin, so youthful it was almost painful to look at, and then there was his eyes: the cobblestone path under me led the way in pale blues and creams to his feet, the grey bark of leafy green trees behind him creating a backdrop of nature\u2019s pleasantries, all lit warmly by the golden rays of the midday sun, making the water in the fountain beside him sparkle\u2014but none of it compared to the brilliant blue of his eyes, how they drew me into him without need for footsteps, leading us face to face, as if our eyes had locked but an inch away.</p><p>\u201cAmara,\u201d he said, bowing his head.</p><p>I snapped back into myself then, noticing the sudden distance that lay between us. \u201cHello, Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease\u2014\u201d He turned and offered the small white garden table behind him. \u201cTake a seat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d I nodded to wake myself up, readjusting Nhym in her belt as I walked. Brown boots over shadow over cobblestones, I took the two steps leading up to the garden and offered my uncle a smile.</p><p>He smiled back, drawing a chair from under the table for me. \u201cYou look lovely in yellow,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like my little sister.\u201d</p><p>I sat down, turning my sword belt so Nhym aimed at the ground, not my knee. \u201cYellow\u2019s my favourite colour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d He sat down, his brows moving up in surprise. \u201cIt was Lili\u2019s too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were related.\u201d I leaned an elbow on the table, removing it quickly so I didn\u2019t seem ill-mannered.</p><p>\u201cYes, you were, weren\u2019t you?\u201d He considered me for a second. \u201cAnd I must say that, of all her descendants, Amara, you are by far the prettiest. I can only pray my child will be just like her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour child?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, motioning to my belly. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited such a long time for this miracle. In fact, I brought a gift for her.\u201d</p><p>I sat back a bit, preparing myself mentally as he reached into a small leather bag on the side of his belt. Clearly he and I were in for a bit of an argument today since he\u2019d already claimed my baby as his own.</p><p>\u201cThis belonged to my beloved wife when she was alive.\u201d He laid something on the table, keeping his long, youthful fingers over it for a second. \u201cI thought you should have it. Wear it while she grows inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Hold on.\u201d I put my hand up and, at that moment, Drake drew his away, revealing a giant oval, almost gaudy-looking emerald stone, set into a fine weave of golden chain. \u201cThat\u2019s beautiful, Drake, but . . . did you just say your wife is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrowing inside you,\u201d he stated factually, his eyes moving then to my belly as if he looked upon her for the first time in centuries\u2014his beloved Anandene.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I blocked his view, crossing two hands over my midsection. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight here. This is not, nor will it ever be, that witch!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWitch!\u201d He shot up out of his chair and stood over me, darkening the sun with the mere presence of anger. \u201cYou will do well to remember that I loved that witch, and have gone to great lengths to see her reborn, Amara-Rose. Speak ill of her again and I will knock you unconscious. Do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>I could only nod a few times, both arms wrapping my baby, sheltering her from the raw emotion emanating off that vampire.</p><p>He sat back down, and the sun came out again, the birds in the trees making merry little songs around us once more, while the leaves on the trees danced in the wind. \u201cYou have heard many stories about this contract, I am sure. But only one is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which one is that?\u201d I asked spitefully, still sitting to attention.</p><p>\u201cMy sister Lilith gave her soul to see Anandene reborn, and I have waited many centuries for all the pieces to finally come together. You carry inside you the blood of my sister, mixed with oldest, most pure blood of nobles known to mankind, but she will bare the soul of my long-dead wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I looked around as if there was something I could say or do to weaken the meaning in his words. \u201cShe can\u2019t. I won\u2019t let that happe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt already has. The moment she was conceived, you broke the curse you carried to bear only females, and you opened a portal for Anandene\u2019s soul to cross over\u2014carried along the path all souls travel when a new child is conceived.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s just it? She\u2019s already Anandene? You don\u2019t need to do a ritual or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He laughed. \u201cThere are many ways to reinsert a soul, but this is the only way that ensures permanent success. If I simply reinserted her into a body that shared the blood of her lineage, she could not have been immortal. She would still be a witch, but would not live forever. And it is that desire that got her killed in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe attempted a spell, using the Stone\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lilith had to kill her to undo the curse she invoked?\u201d I nodded when Drake did. \u201cSo, you what? You devised this plan over centuries just so you could have forever together?\u201d</p><p>He smiled simply. \u201cYou\u2019re in love, are you not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat lengths would you go to?\u201d</p><p>I leaned back, exhaling. \u201cAnd this is why the contract promises you the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt promises the baby will be born, yes, and in exchange I will give back what I took. But it does not promise me possession of the child. She will come for me when her memories return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMemories?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, everything she was in her past life will come back to her, and she will look for me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We both sat silently for a second. I pictured my daughter all grown up: long, dark hair, blue eyes\u2014just like mine, just like Drake\u2019s\u2014seeking him out and then . . . marrying him. \u201cThat is so gross, Drake! You\u2019re her uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeparated by generations of genetic interference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s disgusting, and you are so not ever getting anywhere near her.\u201d</p> <p>He closed his eyes slowly, breathing out long through his nose. \u201cMy dear, sweet niece. I did not come here to argue or negotiate. You are bound by law to have this child, and she will one day know me. There is nothing you can do to stop this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can take her away, far away, so she\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you do that, you will be signing your own death warrant.\u201d</p><p>I stopped mid-sentence and frowned at him. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>With an impatient groan, he drew something from his belt and laid it on the table beside the shimmering emerald.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d It looked just like the Dagger of Yahanna.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dagger you\u2019ve all been driving yourselves crazy over these last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>He knocked my hand away as I reached to grab it. \u201cIn the weapons room. I know. Well, at least . . . it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you get that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, without the astonishing talents of Jason Knight, it would still be in Arthur\u2019s possession.\u201d He winked at me. \u201cYou two practically gift-wrapped it for me.\u201d</p> <p>I silently cursed my own so-called brilliant plan.</p><p>\u201cI have not been brave enough to attempt stealing it right from under Arthur\u2019s nose, and I must say, I too believed he had, in fact, forged an imitation,\u201d he said, sitting back, slowly drawing his hand away from the dagger and just leaving it right there on the table in front of me, with nothing to stop me jamming it through his heart. \u201cGo ahead,\u201d he offered. \u201cPick it up. Jam it through my heart. It won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d I said through my teeth.</p><p>\u201cBecause I fabricated a purpose for this dagger in the hopes that some vengeful vampire, one day, would return it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr try to kill you with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. At which point I\u2019d take it from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if they got it in your heart first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you miss the part where I said I made up that entire story? Parchment and all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very notion that this dagger severs the connection of an immortal soul from this realm of life is ludicrous. It does nothing of the sort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you make up a story like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the dagger had been stolen by a woman I trusted. I needed it back, and the best way to acquire something valuable is by hand-delivery. Unfortunately, I sent Arthur to find it, knowing it was here somewhere, but\u2014\u201d he sighed, looking down wistfully at the table, \u201c\u2014it seems even my oldest and most trusted friend fell victim to the appeal of my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. . .\u201d I aimed my thumb at the dagger, its shimmering jewels looking suddenly dull as all hope faded from its blade. \u201cIt won\u2019t kill you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even when steered by the hand of a king.\u201d He laughed. \u201cBut it is very important to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>He picked it up, considering the handle. \u201cInside this hilt is a very vital piece of a puzzle\u2014one that is key to finalising the terms of the contract with my sister. Once you give birth and the child is safe, I will uphold my end of the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo resurrect Lilith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat forward excitedly. \u201cYou can bring her back?\u201d</p><p>He nodded once, laying the dagger down again.</p><p>\u201cAnd the dagger is the key?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So, that\u2019s what you agreed to restore in the contract: Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>I sat back in my chair, shaking my head at the dagger. \u201cSo much trouble was caused over that damn thing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYes, I heard you even went as far as to give yourself to the king\u2019s brother.\u201d</p><p>I made a weird, awkward kind of face. \u201cYeah, I kinda did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha-ha!\u201d He patted my hand. \u201cOh, Lili, not much about you has changed after all these centuries.\u201d</p><p>My tongue dried up a little, stuck on a word. \u201cDid you just call me . . . Lili?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, holding the same loving smile I\u2019d seen in the glass mural on my ceiling. \u201cThat is your name or, at least . . . was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d Gravity sunk my shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy little sister, bless her heart, gave up her soul to see Anandene reborn. We needed a pure womb to grow the child\u2014one not marred or tainted by any man before. But Lili had had several children by this time, so we created a curse or, rather, a spell that would see her bear only females\u2014soulless females, since our contract, and my Anandene, was bound to Lili\u2019s soul. When the child was born, Lilith\u2019s soul was placed into the vessel and, sixteen years later, bred with noble blood to give rise to Anandene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, whoa, hang on. So, you had to wait sixteen years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPowerful spells take time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, what happened? If you had Anandene back then. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we were ignorant. We thought that a man of noble title would suffice. But gods do not care for the importance man places on himself. The child needed to be of true noble blood. So, another soulless child was born in place of what was supposed to be Anandene, and we moved Lilith\u2019s soul to the new vessel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the sixteen more years we had to wait, a close friend of mine devised a cleansing ritual\u2014to see a male born of such pure and noble blood that none other would compare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of. . .\u201d I swallowed, \u201critual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sent to trace bloodlines back to the days of Christ\u2014find one that had been noble of title and ordainment as far back as possible. Safia would give a potion to the wife of this man, and his bloodline would, from that day forth, bare only sons that would bear only sons, and so on and so on, until two sons were born to one mother. One, the purest and noblest child man had ever known, and the other\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the bad things in one little boy.\u201d I nodded, sitting back in my chair, my eyes glazed and lost on the day. \u201cSo this noble knight, it was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cArthur\u2019s bloodline. But, since he never fathered a child, I was forced to use his brother\u2019s descendants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you let him watch over them all these years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I let him protect and keep them safe because it was a promise he made to his dying brother. However, that fact did work to my advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes . . . does Arthur know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve suspected for some time. But I\u2019m not sure he knows the full story. He knows enough to draw conclusions\u2014enough to have told David\u2019s mother she would bring an evil child into the world, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Arthur started that story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and I know he feels great regret for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, when Thomas Knight learned of it, he cast the demon child out, treated him poorly, as if the boy would bring Hell rising to the earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Drake laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s not evil. Just impure\u2014everything undesirable filtered out of mankind. Seven deadly sins, you might say: greed, lust, all that stuff. But even creatures such as this are given the gift of free will. And I believe Jason has chosen the path of light and good, has he not?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, thinking about him. \u201cYes. He has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re proud of him?\u201d he asked, but it was more of a statement.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, let me ask you something.\u201d He waited until I looked at him. \u201cHow would you feel to know that your actions cost him his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, if you, say . . . chose to steal my child away, I couldn't vouch for the safety and freedom of your people, Amara. How would it feel to know that, just to keep this child from coming to me, you\u2019d sacrificed all those lives\u2014including your beloved Jason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely outlining the options.\u201d He picked up the dagger again and slipped it into its leather strap. \u201cYou cannot save yourself, but you can secure the freedom and eternal safety of your people\u2014friends and family included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by I cannot save myself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you didn\u2019t catch on?\u201d he asked, scooping up Anandene\u2019s emerald. \u201cYou\u2019re the re-manifestation of my sister\u2019s soul\u2014inserted into one baby after another until the Knight twins were born. God knows, we had no way of knowing it would take centuries, but all\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see what that has to do with my death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe contract, my dear. When the child is born, I am bound by my word to resurrect Lilith. Her body will be pieced back together, and her soul\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill leave my body.\u201d I went numb right through, sitting back so slowly I almost couldn't feel the back of the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But you have. . .\u201d he considered my belly, \u201c\u2014seven months to get your affairs in order. No pun intended.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>I looked up at him. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p><p>He stopped laughing. \u201cDo not get me started on fair, my dear. How fair is that every time I\u2019ve come close to achieving my goal, something or someone has gotten in my way? I had to wait centuries for the Pure Knight to be born, not knowing when he would come, and on that day, the Lilithian descendant was missing. You would have conceived her on your wedding night had my Warriors not been so good at their job. You would never have even been born had my father not kidnapped the original child.\u201d He slammed his fist on the table. \u201cI searched for you for over thirty years, only for my Warriors to find the infant, Amara, and bring her to be killed. And I thought it would be over. David bonded with her, chose to leave her alive, and he goddamn well lost her before I could get her back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d I sat back, smiling at nothing. \u201cSucked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next time I found her,\u201d he continued as if I hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cshe was being born to a sixteen year old Rose! Do not talk to me about unfair, because I have had more than my fair amount of unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s why you made Arthur turn the boys\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn David, yes. I cared not what he did with the other one. But I needed David immortal in case I found the bloodline of my sister a century later.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd you found me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNineteen years ago, yes.

And I saw to it that both you and David ended up in the same place at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you told David to go to school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and had you agreed to spend the summer at your father\u2019s that year, I would not have had to place you in his custody. But I was not going to let a moody, spoiled teenager get in the way of my success.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He eyed me mockingly. \u201cDid you really think your mother\u2019s death was an accident?\u201d</p><p>I coughed out, folding over, hearing his explanation run through me but pass nowhere near my ears. \u201cYou killed her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might say I shifted the pieces on the board in my favour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game, Drake!\u201d I got to my feet, shaking. \u201cThese are peoples\u2019 lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd many have been lost!\u201d He stood too. \u201cNone more heartbreaking than my wife. I will kill thousands more, Amara,\u201d he said, his teeth like a cage. \u201cThousands, to see her safe and in my arms again. Do not test my resolve.\u201d</p><p>I sat back down again, tears streaming my cheeks, pooling and dripping under my chin. \u201cWhat will happen to my baby if you take me away from her when she\u2019s born?\u201d</p><p>Drake sat slowly. \u201cShe will be raised by her father, who will know nothing of what I\u2019ve told you here today.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicked onto his. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gone to great lengths to protect this one truth all these centuries, Amara, twisting and reshaping the stories until no one remembered anything about a contract. If anyone were to find out, they would use Anandene against me\u2014possibly kill her.\u201d</p> <p>I gasped.</p><p>\u201cIt serves you well not to tell a soul, because you will be putting your own daughter in great danger.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my hands on my belly, drawing my top up just a little to see the way the sunlight made my hands so golden against my pale white stomach. \u201cShe needs a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will have Lilith in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would you have me do? Break the agreement I made with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d he started.</p> <p>\u201cThen don\u2019t break it. Just. . .\u201d I thought hard, trying to find some medium ground. \u201cGive me time. Give Lilith back her soul, but let me keep it\u2014just until the child is old enough to cope without a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old?\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the belly again. \u201cEighteen. Maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEighteen?\u201d He nearly leaped out of his seat. \u201cYou want me to delay my promise to my sister for eighteen years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the child\u2019s best interests, Drake. She can\u2019t grow up without a mother. She\u2019ll never feel complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has a mother. Safia is her mother.\u201d</p><p>My head rolled forward, my jaw nearly touching my chest. \u201cThe witch is Anandene\u2019s mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think she\u2019s helped me all these years?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to throw my hands up and shake my head. Nothing surprised me anymore. \u201cWell, the baby won\u2019t know that until she gets her memories back. She needs her birth mother until then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cI will give you eighteen years with the child, but you must let me see her in that time. She must know me.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cFine. But, once I\u2019m gone, David stays on the throne, and everyone I love remains free and unharmed.\u201d</p><p>He laid a hand to his heart. \u201cI give you my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding Arthur.\u201d</p><p>His smile changed. \u201cI will not promise him immunity. He betrayed me, Amara, he must pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen the deal\u2019s off.\u201d I folded my arms and sat back.</p><p>\u201cVery well.\u201d He stood. \u201cSend word when the child is born and, the next time we meet, you will be my sister once more.\u201d He bowed and turned on his heel, walking away. Just leaving it at that.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Wait.\u201d I jumped up and ran after him, grabbing the edge of his cloak. \u201cJust . . . what do you want with Arthur? You won\u2019t hurt him, will you?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and cupped my shoulder. \u201cSweet niece, you must never ask me such things\u2014for your own good. I do not wish to upset you and, in turn, upset the baby. I will come for Arthur soon, and you can either take our previous agreement, or you can die the day your child is born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I stepped back, nodding. \u201cI\u2019ll take the agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wise choice.\u201d He leaned over and kissed my brow. \u201cTake care, Amara. You will hear from me soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake?\u201d I called.</p><p>He stopped and turned to face me.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Vampirie? You said he stole the child, endlessly ruined your plans. How do we know he won\u2019t try to kill the baby now I\u2019m carrying it?\u201d</p><p>He moved toward me again, graceful as water over sand, and slid his knuckles softly down my cheek. \u201cBecause he loves you. He would never do anything to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, who is he? I mean, do I know him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will reveal himself in time.\u201d He turned away. \u201cBut do not fear for the child, unless you share anything we\u2019ve talked about here today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t. But . . . can I at least tell David he doesn\u2019t have to die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Providing you leave out as much detail as possible,\u201d he said without turning around, and the wind brushed softly across my cheeks then, blowing dust into my eyes. I rubbed them, blinking rapidly, but when I opened them again, Drake was gone and the buzz of life in the garden had come out of hiding. I stood for a while, listening to it all and, despite knowing my life would end in eighteen years, I felt strangely happy and, for the first time since I met David . . . safe.</p><p>But I just couldn\u2019t believe David and Jason were a plan all along\u2014the result of a spell\u2014two lives I was never intended to be a part of. Drake said it was unfair and that luck had not befallen him, but it had for me. I was lucky to have been born, and so lucky to have been the one to love David, even if it had all fallen apart. I had a lot to think about right now, yet I shoved it all down and let the single moment of joy that David didn\u2019t have to die consume me, running for the door. Pretty much none of what Drake said was good news, but that one bit was enough to stop me falling to the ground and crying my eyes out right now.</p><p>\u201cFalcon.\u201d I marched toward him quickly, checking the manor entranceway for other ears. \u201cCall a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, with the private council, but\u2014\u201d I grabbed his arm, \u201c\u2014don\u2019t let Morgaine know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I checked over my shoulder. \u201cShe\u2019s fired.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went wide. \u201cIs this because of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t trust her anymore, Falcon. And I don\u2019t have to give a reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He bowed his head. \u201cI\u2019ll organise the meeting for twenty minutes\u2019 time, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>Falcon disappeared beyond the archway to the east of the manor, and I stood in the middle of the entranceway with my eyes closed, searching for that feeling\u2014the little buzz I always got around Jason. And when it tingled deep within me, I sent a thought out. \u201cJase?\u201d</p><p>The energy changed.</p><p>\u201cJase? Meet me in the\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d He grabbed my arm gently, snapping me aware. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for? And how did you know how to reach me like that?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI can always feel you, so . . . I just searched for that feeling\u2014aimed my thoughts in that direction.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his eyes wide with wonder. \u201cYou are amazing. Can you do that with anyone else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeel them? Yeah. But not call to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Tell me where. . .\u201d he looked around, \u201c\u2014tell me where Arthur is right now.\u201d</p><p>I groaned. \u201cJase, I don\u2019t have time for circus tricks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d He sunk lower into his knees, closing his hands in prayer. \u201cCome on. This is cool.\u201d</p><p>I groaned again, rolling my eyes, and then closed them, picturing Arthur, feeling him. \u201cHe\u2019s . . . in his room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be amazing later.\u201d I tugged his sleeve until his thoughtful gaze came back down to earth. \u201cRight now, I want to offer you a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA position on my council just opened up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His tone rose, half with shock, the other half with joy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just about to fire Morgaine, and I need a new member that I trust implicitly. I couldn\u2019t think of anyone else in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ara.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t, sweet girl. David will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m dividing the councils, now, Jase. David is no longer on this council. Being king doesn't give him right to advise me\u2014never has. I gave him a position on my council because I trusted him. But, now, well, he can get his own council, and he has no say over who is on mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to you?\u201d he asked, his eyes shrinking.</p><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine. But . . . if you\u2019re on my council, he can\u2019t do anything to you. It gives you protection, gets you off stable duties, and. . .\u201d I grinned suggestively.</p><p>\u201cI get a new room.\u201d He nodded, catching on.</p><p>\u201cYup. You\u2019ll be right next to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet that\u2019ll piss David off.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not really sure I care right now, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being cruel, isn\u2019t he?\u201d he asked, sweeping my hair back behind my ear.</p><p>I nodded, but before I even looked up, my face was against Jason\u2019s shirt, his arms around me tightly.</p><p>\u201cYou need to tell me, Ara. Every time he does or says anything that hurts you, you need to tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point, Jase. I know he\u2019s hurt and just doing anything he can to make me suffer. It\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>He clicked his tongue. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure about that, sweet girl. He\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Falcon cut in, leaning around the wall. \u201cCouncil\u2019s in session.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, already?\u201d I flipped Jason\u2019s hand over and looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll be there in two minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Falcon looked at Jason. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I thrust my shoulders back. \u201cWe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in. . .?\u201d He motioned between Jason and I.</p><p>\u201cYes. I just hired Jason.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He groaned, standing off the wall. \u201cI\u2019ll prepare the others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I called, then smiled up at Jase. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He slipped his hand into mine. \u201cAs long as I\u2019ve got you, I can face anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara?\u201d Arthur called from the top of the stairs, his voice sharp with a sense of urgency.</p><p>Jase and I stopped walking. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2019s David?</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d I looked around. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dagger.\u201d He appeared beside me. \u201cIt\u2019s gone. I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not gone.\u201d Jason said, and we smiled at each other.</p><p>\u201cDrake took it,\u201d I cut in.</p><p>They both looked at me in shock.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Since when?\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I was calling the meeting. I wanted to inform my council first that I met with Drake, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cJust now. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, what were you thinking? He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Arthur. Everything is fine,\u201d I assured him, patting his arm. \u201cAnd we have a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake and I. We came to an agreement.\u201d</p> <p>Jason closed his feet, making himself a little taller. \u201cAnd you\u2019re happy with the terms?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cAs much as I can be, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he has the dagger?\u201d Arthur asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmara, how will we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t kill him, Arthur. That\u2019s not what the dagger does.\u201d</p><p>He stopped the protest short of his lips and just stood there frowning. \u201cWhat does it do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better start at the beginning,\u201d David said from behind us.</p><p>I groaned loudly, more annoyed than shocked that he was there, and slowly turned around. \u201cWe need to call a House meeting. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you need to tell me, right now, what you\u2019ve done.\u201d He walked coolly over and stood before me like a towering lighthouse with angry green lanterns for eyes.</p><p>\u201cWell, for one, you don\u2019t have to die now.\u201d</p><p>His mouth came open, his tongue moving to the inside of his cheek. \u201cWhere\u2019s the dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake has it.\u201d</p><p>David looked at Arthur accusingly. \u201cYou gave it to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUncle, the lengths you\u2019ve gone to to keep it from me all this time, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you set that meeting up for her and Drake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t, okay?\u201d I took a step closer, kind of moving between David and Arthur. \u201cI called him on the phone and I arranged the meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know about this?\u201d David looked at Jason.</p><p>\u201cI knew she\u2019d arranged it, but didn\u2019t know it was today.\u201d</p><p>David stepped back and ran his hands through his hair. \u201cSo what now? You\u2019re just gonna hand your child over to him and let him rule our people again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what did you agree to, Ara?\u201d He reached out and grabbed both my arms; it hurt a little but I was, in a really sick way, just happy he\u2019d touched me again.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight the contract, David. We never could. When he told me that the dagger has no use\u2014\u201d I said, leaving off the bit about it resurrecting Lilith, \u201c\u2014I was given little choice but to agree to uphold the original deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d David yelled. \u201cAra, how could you be so stupid? Do you realise what you\u2019ve done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I made an agreement to keep our monarchy safe for eternity, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn exchange for a living being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot entirely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d He held out an upturned palm, offering me the floor. \u201cDon\u2019t be cryptic with me, Ara. Get to the point.\u201d</p><p>I blinked a few extra times, trying to keep my cool. \u201cI would get to the point if you\u2019d shut up and let me speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen speak!\u201d</p><p>Grrr. \u201cInstead of Drake coming for my baby when she\u2019s born, raising her in that hell hole, he\u2019s agreed to let me keep her until she\u2019s eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what then?\u201d David asked sarcastically. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna take her away from us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d I said, half laughing with incredulity. \u201cThere is no us, David. You said it yourself, she\u2019s not your daughter.\u201d</p><p>Arthur looked at David quickly. \u201cYou said that to her?\u201d</p><p>David looked away. \u201cSo, he\u2019s gone? Drake? He\u2019s gonna leave us alone until she\u2019s eighteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, David, we get eighteen years of safety and. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then we lose our daughter, Ara! Do you think you\u2019ve fixed this? Did you think that by swearing over your own flesh and blood it\u2019d make you a good queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said through my teeth, stepping into him with fists tight. \u201cIt makes me a great queen, David. Because I am willing to put the safety of my people before my own flesh and blood\u2014as every great leader before me, in the human and the supernatural world has or should do. What does a president do if his daughter is kidnapped and held for ransom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does not negotiate!\u201d David yelled.</p><p>\u201cAnd I did not negotiate, either. I could run. I could take the child away, but our people will die\u2014my family, my friends, and for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne life,\u201d I yelled. \u201cOne life that will likely grow up and seek him out anyway, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why on earth would she do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she is the reincarnated soul of Anandene.\u201d</p><p>David stumbled back a few steps, staring down at my belly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I was given a choice to keep my people safe at the expense of myself, and I chose that road. I could not put our blood, our hopes or dreams before my people. And if I had it to do over, I\u2019d do it all the same.\u201d</p><p>He turned away and looked out through the windows above the door.</p><p>\u201cAt least, this way, there is still hope. We can train her to be a fighter. We can spend the next eighteen years searching for a way to kill Drake\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no way to kill Drake!\u201d He spun around. \u201cHe\u2019s a monster. A godforsaken immortal demon, Ara. And you promised him our\u2014\u201d He broke then, holding his fist to his mouth.</p><p>In the silence that lingered, the staff hurried past, busying themselves in the Great Hall, setting up for the ball tonight. We all stood there lost in our own thoughts, trying to find reason among the grey of uncertainty. None of what I\u2019d just told David could go any further than the four of us standing here right now, yet all of it had been exposed in open quarters. I worried then for the concealment of this secret.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d have done the same, son,\u201d Arthur said, and all eyes turned to him. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>David didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked at me, then back at his uncle, and turned away, walking swiftly off toward the west wing.</p><p>When he disappeared, finally out of earshot, I lowered my voice and muttered, \u201cIt gets worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does?\u201d Arthur moved in a step, obviously catching on that whatever I was about to add wasn\u2019t for all ears.</p><p>\u201cDrake told me that the dagger had been stolen once before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, many decades ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said it was a woman he trusted\u2014that she brought it here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Arthur said, nodding once, though he didn\u2019t seem to be following me.</p><p>\u201cArthur, there is only one girl I can think of that\u2019s linked both to Drake and to the Lilithians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgaine,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cYes. And you said she knew about the dagger early on, that she changed the contract and made it look like a prophecy. I think she\u2019s been plotting against us this whole time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve all had our suspicions about Morgaine at one point, Amara, but we\u2019ve no proof she\u2019s against us\u2014or a motive. She may have taken the dagger to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect me?\u201d I scoffed. \u201cFrom what? The dagger is useless,\u201d I lied. \u201cWhat I want to know is, if she took the dagger from Drake, did she know all along that it wouldn\u2019t kill him? And if she did, why did she let us believe it would? What the hell is she playing at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her,\u201d Jase said simply.</p><p>\u201cAsk her?\u201d I looked all the way up at him. \u201cWhat, just storm in there and ask her what the deal is?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cWhy not? I could come with you, read her mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I touched his arm. \u201cI need to take care of this myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d He took a step back, offering the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the meeting. Want me to fill everyone in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d I offered a smile and wandered away, practicing what I\u2019d say to Morgaine in my head. It was time for a little clever leading.</p><p>\u201cMorgaine?\u201d I shoved her door open without knocking, startling her.</p><p>\u201cMy Queen?\u201d She dumped her book on the bed and stood up. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re off the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. You are officially fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Amara?\u201d</p><p>I stepped closer, lowering my voice, though I wanted to shout and scream in her face; she wasn\u2019t proven guilty yet, but my gut was very rarely wrong. \u201cYou and I both know why. You\u2019re a liar and a traitor, and while I promised Drake not to expose you,\u201d I lied, \u201cthat affords you no place in my good graces, nor among a group of people I trust implicitly. You\u2019re the enemy, Morgaine, and I want you out of this manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me many things. I know all about the dagger. I know all about the contract, and I know that this child I carry is. . .\u201d I paused, hoping she\u2019d fill in the rest. I needed to see just how much she really knew.</p><p>\u201cAnandene,\u201d she said to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known? How long have you been aware that David and I would bear the Antichrist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be the Antichrist, Amara.\u201d She moved closer, dropping her reaching hand when she read the very clear signal I gave off not to touch me. \u201cShe\u2019s a pure vessel. She\u2019ll be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine until her memories return, and then she\u2019ll be an evil witch that\u2019ll seek to marry her own uncle.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She tucked a strand of her cherry hair back, shaking her head. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this any more than you, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you knew? You forced David and I together so we\u2019d have this child\u2014letting us believe she\u2019d kill Drake\u2014bring peace? Why?\u201d</p><p>A frown crinkled her brow, narrowing her eyes as they moved onto my face. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the answer to that, then Drake didn\u2019t tell you anything about who I am or what I\u2019m doing here. Nice try, Amara.\u201d She opened her door. \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d</p> <p>My hand shot out and slammed the door closed again, holding it in place. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until I get the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe truth?\u201d She took a few steps back. \u201cI don\u2019t owe you anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat. Is where. You are wrong,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cYou owe me for your safety. Your freedom. And you will either tell me the truth, or I will torture it out of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She stormed off and sat down heavily on her bed. \u201cBut you won\u2019t like it. And when you find out what it is, you can\u2019t touch me. You can\u2019t force me to leave, and you cannot tell a soul, because if you do, my uncle will see to it that the dagger is used for its true purpose.\u201d</p><p>The floor fell out from under me. I stood frozen on the spot, clutching my tummy to stop the tightening. \u201cYour uncle?\u201d</p> <p>She drew a breath and let it out, averting her eyes. \u201cMy name is not Morgaine, Amara. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorgana.\u201d I exhaled the word, standing there like a fool for a few seconds after as it all sunk in.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not helping Drake because I want him to have a happy ending, Amara,\u201d she said, folding her legs up under her on the bed. \u201cI just want my mother back\u2014want the life back that he took from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTook from you?</p><p>\u201cYes. Took.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m gonna need you to elaborate, Morgaine.\u201d</p> <p>She kind of groaned, rolling her eyes as most people did when I didn\u2019t \u2018catch on\u2019 to the full story immediately, despite not having any of the facts.</p><p>\u201cFrom the moment he met Anandene,\u201d she began, \u201call he cared about was being with her. He stopped caring about his little sister, and when he became my guardian, he didn\u2019t even care that I was left without anyone to love me\u2014a small child dumped in a cottage on the outskirts of town until I was twenty-five, with nothing but monthly visits from my uncle to tell me I\u2019d see my mother again when she\u2019d completed her task. I never even got to say goodbye to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Morgana. That\u2019s. . .\u201d I walked over and sat down slowly beside her. \u201cI can\u2019t even imagine how awful that would've been.\u201d</p><p>She offered a smile. \u201cMy grandmother lived there too. I guess I wasn\u2019t really alone. And she taught me witchcraft and told me stories, but I never saw any other children, never saw the world. Never really knew my mother. Never even knew why she left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrake didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until I was old enough to leave the cottage on my own. By that point, he\u2019d lost the child of my mother\u2019s re-manifested soul, and all hope with it. He told me I\u2019d never see her again but that he could feed me blood\u2014make me immortal\u2014if I promised to hide my true identity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you became Morgaine, a Created Lilithian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I built an army\u2014destroyed the last page of the contract, and made it look like a prophecy so that, if Drake\u2019s Warriors ever found another Lilithian, my army could \u201csave\u201d her and keep her safe, without Drake being implicated and the truth about Anandene coming out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, he knew you built the Core?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt was his idea.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my brow. \u201cWhy did you need to hide the truth about Anandene so deeply?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause many would seek to stop it happening\u2014on the belief that bringing things back to life in that manner is the devil\u2019s work, that it\u2019s unnatural and will bring a curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any truth in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone,\u201d she said with a gentle laugh.</p><p>\u201cBut there are so many lies,\u201d I said, looking off at nothing, amazed at the depth of it all and how the hell she kept up with it when even I couldn\u2019t. \u201cYou\u2019ve clearly had to rearrange the story every time we turned over a new leaf, right\u2014reformat them to make them fit?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy not just tell me the truth in the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you thwart a mission that has taken centuries to complete?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorg,\u201d I said, and waited for her to look at me. \u201cIf you told me it would be my life instead of David\u2019s, I\u2019d have signed the dotted line myself. Don\u2019t you know that?\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes studied mine intently, flowing past them and over the shape of my cheekbones, my lips, and back to my eyes again. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that then. I thought the only way to bribe you into ruling the people and having a baby would be if you could kill Drake. When that wasn\u2019t enough, I had to find your currency.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurrency?\u201d</p><p>She nodded solemnly. \u201cI realised that life was more important to you than death, so I told you about freeing the Damned. And that\u2019s the moment everything changed\u2014when you finally snapped out of that trance you\u2019d been in and found the will to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you used my love and compassion to make me do what you wanted, just so you could have your mother back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I don\u2019t regret it, Amara. I never cared about the safety and freedom of the Lilithians\u2014every one of them can die for all I care. And, as for the Damned . . . they\u2019re better off dead.\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground tightly in my mouth. I just wanted to hit her. \u201cWhy tell David he had to die then? Why make up the lie about the dagger?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. That was Drake and Jason\u2019s fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few centuries after I realised Drake had failed and this child would never be born, I took the dagger as an insurance policy\u2014to put my mother back together. All I needed was the key to her tomb and the child who had her soul. Drake knew I took the dagger and hid it here, but he didn\u2019t know where. He created a parchment that told of the dagger\u2019s power, said that it would kill him, in the hopes someone might try to do just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019d get it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He sent Arthur to find it for him so I couldn\u2019t ruin his plans and bring my mother back before the child was born. But Jason found the document and sent it to David anonymously. From then on, everything changed, and it was no longer about using the power of the child to free the Damned and kill Drake. It was suddenly about David being the martyr.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI had to go to great lengths to slow things down,\u201d she added. \u201cI made up the bit about the hand of the king needing to drive the dagger to give us time. Otherwise, he\u2019d have left to kill Drake that day, and he wasn\u2019t even planning to say goodbye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, I guess I owe you thanks, then?\u201d I asked sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWell, no, because it wouldn\u2019t have worked. And Drake wouldn\u2019t have killed David. He needed him to make a baby with you.\u201d</p><p>My hands went absently across my belly. \u201cThis is all so messed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagine how I feel then?\u201d Her neck jutted forward a bit. \u201cI wasn\u2019t built to lie, Amara. And this whole thing has been one big lie after another. I lost track so many times I don\u2019t how any of you possibly believed me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, though I wasn\u2019t amused. \u201cYou did a pretty good job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan now, Morgana? Are you helping Drake or trying to resurrect Lilith?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d Her brows rose, prompting my response.</p><p>\u201cA shred of honesty would be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need the key to her tomb. I have the soul, I know where the dagger is, and all I need is that damn key, and then I\u2019ll free my mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll die.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged dismissively.</p><p>My shoulders dropped. \u201cWhere\u2019s the key then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Her arms wrapped both her knees. \u201cDrake has one key, which I will never, in a million years, get my hands on. And the other key . . . it was held by the goddess Lilith, my great grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo. . .where is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She motioned around the place. \u201cShe\u2019s the guardian of the earth. You call her Mother Nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d My stomach dropped into my feet. I was pretty sure then that I knew exactly where that key was. \u201cAnd . . . what does the key look like?\u201d</p><p>Morg shrugged again. \u201cAll I know is that it\u2019s enchanted\u2014has a life force of its own. You know it only by the energy it carries\u2014something that makes it seem . . . alive.\u201d</p><p>I laid a hand to my chest, right over the key I\u2019d found on my Walk of Faith. Silence hung in the room for a while then, the clock on her dresser keeping the time with a steady tick. \u201cWhat if you never find the key?</p><p>Her dark eyes moved onto mine. \u201cThen I go with plan B.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlan B?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp Drake get Anandene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither of which will be possible for you now, Morgana,\u201d I snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t just let you walk around freely, plotting against us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no choice,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cActually, I do, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I bet Drake threatened you, forced you to keep everything a secret on pain of death, and I doubt it was your death but, rather, someone you love,\u201d she suggested.</p><p>My nails formed deep impressions on my palms. \u201cYou know him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d She tapped my hands, making me unfold them. \u201cA few centuries alongside one man will do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlongside?\u201d I asked, hinting on the rumours I\u2019d heard about her Drake having been . . . together.</p><p>\u201cYes. Alongside. But not in the manner your tone suggests, Amara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you slept with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe started that rumour because it was the only convincing reason why he would be so protective of me, you know\u2014allow a Lilithian to walk freely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it\u2019s not true? You never, er\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI did spend many nights in his bed, but not for impure reasons. I just . . . I was safe there\u2014with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe? Weren't you safe anywhere in the castle if you were Drake\u2019s girl?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved sideways. \u201cI killed a man once\u2014a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilled?\u201d I frowned, and then it clicked: she had venom like mine.</p><p>\u201cI was asleep one night when I heard my door open and then close again. I called out to see who it was, but no one answered. Next thing I know, there\u2019s a man pinning my arms down. I screamed out, tried to fight him off. But no one came. So . . . I bit him. And he died. Uncle Drake had to go to great lengths to cover it up. He hid the body in the floorboards and that\u2019s where it stayed. It\u2019s still there now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I rubbed my head. \u201cSo you had venom, vampire-killing venom, all this time? And you never helped the Damned, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about the Damned, Amara! If I used my venom to help anyone\u2014if Drake used it to help anyone, it would have given me away. The whole mission could've been compromised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you let them suffer because you wanted your mom back?\u201d</p> <p>Her jaw went tight, eyes small and sharp. \u201cWhat would you do, Amara, to bring your mother back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t even be a question if Drake hadn\u2019t killed her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d she started, but mashed her lips tightly together and folded her arms like a smug little brat. \u201cIt was a means to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA means to an end!\u201d I stood up. \u201cA means to an end?\u201d</p><p>She stood, too. \u201cYour life means nothing, Amara. You are a means to an end\u2014all of this is. And as soon as that child is born, none of you will exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you're wrong,\u201d I said smugly. \u201cDrake swore to leave David on the throne, and that all my friends, my family and my people would be safe for eternity. And. . .\u201d I paused to build suspense, just enjoying this moment: when she found out what else he promised, it would hurt her just as deeply as it hurt me to know my mother died for this cause. \u201cHe promised me eighteen years to raise my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. He has the dagger now, so you won\u2019t be seeing your dead mommy any time soon, Morgana. And, in the meantime, you need to find yourself a new job\u2014and a new home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t kick me out!\u201d</p><p>I turned toward the door. \u201cI just did.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed my arm and spun me around. \u201cIf I leave, people will ask questions. And Drake will just put another spy in place to watch over you.\u201d</p> <p>My eyes closed involuntarily around the truth.</p><p>\u201cBetter the devil you know,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I opened my eyes, hearing the old idiom in my head: keep your enemies close. \u201cStay. But you\u2019re no longer on my council. Neither is David. And you will move your things out immediately and take them down to Jason\u2019s old room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld room?\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhere\u2019s his new one?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my head slowly higher, smirking. \u201cYou\u2019re standing in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have twenty minutes.\u201d I turned on my heel and walked from the room, leaving the door open on my way out.</p><p>Life is never lonelier than when you hide a truth that\u2019s weighing you down. I looked across the dinner table at Falcon, then at Jason, just wishing I could tell someone, anyone what Drake had told me. All my council even knew was that Morgaine had been fired for siding with David too often and that we\u2019d recently discovered the Dagger of Yahanna was useless. I didn\u2019t tell them I\u2019d met with Drake and I didn\u2019t tell them I was the living re-manifestation of the former queen\u2019s soul. I did lie and say Jason might have a toxic potion that could kill an original, and that was the only thing that kept them in their seats when they realised David couldn\u2019t. The people, however, would remain under the impression that the dagger was safe and still as useful as before.</p> <p>With time to think after the meeting today, everything Drake said sunk in bit by bit\u2014pieces I didn\u2019t want to think about rising to the front of my thoughts all afternoon. I wanted to fight\u2014to find some way I could stop him from killing me in eighteen years, but that would mean putting the baby in danger and possibly making Drake angry enough to break our agreement.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t just that. I slumped on my hand. He killed my mom and my baby brother, and he did it because I refused to go to my dad\u2019s that year. If I\u2019d just gone\u2014if I\u2019d just stuck to the plans we made every year, they\u2019d still be alive.</p><p>\u201cBaby?\u201d Mike laid his hand over mine.</p><p>I looked up from my lap and smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he mimed, not actually speaking.</p><p>I nodded, rearranging my napkin in my lap.</p><p>\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to cry.\u201d</p><p>My stupid chin quivered then. I drew a quiet but jagged breath and forced another smile, catching Falcon\u2019s eye when he looked up. He gave me that look\u2014the one asking what was going on, and when Jason frowned, noticing the exchange then turning his worried eyes on me, I couldn\u2019t help it; a soft breath burst from between my lips, and I sobbed hard at the dinner table, with Mike\u2019s arms suddenly wrapping me, my tears falling onto my plate.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d David stood and threw his napkin down.</p><p>\u201cUh, just . . . pregnancy hormones,\u201d Emily said casually, running over with her arms flailing about in the air.</p><p>A few people laughed affectionately, and I was swept out of the room, not really knowing whose hands were guiding me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Mike said, answering some question I hadn\u2019t heard. \u201cI asked her what\u2019s wrong, and she just. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike, don\u2019t you know? Never ask someone what\u2019s wrong if they look they\u2019re about to cry,\u201d Emily said, sliding her arm around me. \u201cAra? What happened? Did David\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I moved away from her. \u201cDavid didn\u2019t do anything. I . . . I just needed some air.\u201d</p><p>She looked at Mike, and he threw his hands up, backing away. \u201cGirl stuff. Got ya. I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to grab him and ask him to stay\u2014wanted to tell him that the woman he grew up with beside me died for no good reason. It wasn't an act of God or Fate. It was murder. Senseless murder. But he would, at the very least, cause a scene over it. No one would understand my anger and agony better than him. But I just couldn't trust him to stay calm if he knew. So, I let him walk away, Em and I smiling as he gave some obviously hilarious explanation to smooth things over back in the Great Hall. David made a smart remark that I didn\u2019t hear, but I also didn\u2019t care what he said about me.</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d Falcon turned me to face him, closing Emily out of the circle. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, his hands going tighter on my arms for a second, his eyes narrowing in question, slightly flicking on to Emily.</p><p>I shook my head. She wasn\u2019t the reason I couldn\u2019t talk.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d he said, \u201cYou know you can trust me with anything, even if it was something you weren't allowed to tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I trust you not to do anything about it, to act as if I never told you?\u201d</p><p>He went to say something, closing his mouth with a little pop after, his shoulders sinking. \u201cYes. If it\u2019s just an ear you need, of course.\u201d</p><p>I turned and glanced back at Emily. \u201cThanks, Em. I\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get it.\u201d She reversed away. \u201cNot for my ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for your own protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like so I won\u2019t tell David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Em,\u201d I started, but she disappeared.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Ara. If that\u2019s the attitude she has, she\u2019s better off outside the circle of trust.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s just got her nose out of joint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, she\u2019s also still very close to David. Anything you don\u2019t want him to know, you probably shouldn't tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019d never say anything to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but he can read her mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I looked at my shoes. \u201cI really hate that \u2018special connection\u2019 they have.\u201d</p><p>Falcon laughed through his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty odd. Drives Blade crazy, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he told her, yet\u2014that he\u2019s. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, his lips staying in the shape of the O for a bit too long. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better not say anything, either.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my heart. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Now\u2014\u201d He laid his hand firmly on my shoulder, almost like a gentle slap. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you so upset?\u201d</p><p>I looked back into the Great Hall. \u201cNot here. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Bedroom.\u201d</p><p>We walked in silence up to my room and, once there, Falcon barely even shut the door before I broke down and told him the whole story\u2014everything I needed off my chest and everything I wasn\u2019t allowed to tell him, even about Morgana. I let it all pour out.</p><p>And he just stood there while I paced back and forth, holding as still as a statue until I finished and looked at him, tears streaming down my cheeks and said, \u201cSo? What do I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He stumbled clumsily backward and sat down on my blanket box, rubbing the tops of his thighs. \u201cAra, I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my face, just waiting for a word of wisdom or maybe even comfort.</p><p>\u201cHave you told David any of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cGod, no.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, too, then stood up and wandered over, drawing me in for a very needed hug. His big hand squeezed my hair flat to the back of my neck while the other rubbed my back, just leaving everything unsaid for a few moments. \u201cYou poor kid.\u201d</p><p>I sunk into him a bit more then, drying the corner of my eye on his shirt.</p><p>\u201cI just . . . I\u2019m so sorry he killed your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut. . .\u201d He looked down at me, leaving his hand on the side of my neck. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not your fault, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His grip tightened. \u201cDrake chose to kill her. Drake lost Anandene and he created a contract, and everything he has done in pursuit of that is on his head, Ara, not yours. You did not do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to believe that, but if I\u2019d never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen believe it. Because if I thought you were to blame, I\u2019d tell you that, counsel you on that. But you\u2019re not. No matter how much you convince yourself, Ara, you didn\u2019t kill her. You were a spoiled teenage brat, but that wasn\u2019t the reason she died. Drake was the reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, to force me into Dad\u2019s custody.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cStop trying to lay blame where it won\u2019t fit.\u201d</p><p>I stared at the floor, reversing the situation in my head. What would I say to him if this were his problem? \u201cYou\u2019re right. You are. I know you are. The fact is, Drake ordered her death, like she was some pawn. And he needs to pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill him. I\u2019m gonna go over there right now, and I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa, little lady. Let\u2019s not go that far just yet.\u201d He steadied me with a stop-sign hand. \u201cControl those crazy pregnancy hormones.\u201d He laughed, making me laugh a bit, too. \u201cYou have nothing to back you here. If you go against him, he\u2019ll take your soul and give it back to Lilith. He has the dagger, remember.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo, what am I supposed to do?\u201d I shrugged, hands out. \u201cJust let him get away with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But don\u2019t go rushing in there waving the sword of revenge,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have eighteen years to devise a plan. Let\u2019s be smart about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d I started, then stopped, shaking my head. He was right again. \u201cSee?\u201d I pouted mockingly, bringing one shoulder up. \u201cThis is why I always come to you. You\u2019re good at this.\u201d</p> <p>He grinned. \u201cNo, I\u2019m good at Ara-Control.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSo, any ideas on how we can get revenge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, wait until little bubba is born.\u201d He touched my belly. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll discuss it. But I want her safe and alive before we do anything that might put you or your soul at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean Lilith\u2019s soul,\u201d I said spitefully.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grabbed both my shoulders again. \u201cYour soul. She gave it to you\u2014well, your mother gave it to you. Possession is nine-tenths of the law, don\u2019t you know?\u201d He grinned.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but right now I\u2019m possessed by a raw need for vengeance.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, throwing his head back a bit, and the tension in the room eased so much then. Even my own need to cry had lifted, the weight a little less overbearing, especially since I knew that pathetic attempt at a joke wasn\u2019t even funny.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll sort this out, m\u2019kay?\u201d He looked me in the eye, lowering his chin a little to prompt a response.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Okay. Thanks, Falcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny time.\u201d He stood back again. \u201cAnd what about Morgana? What are you doing with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeeping an eye on her. That\u2019s all I can do.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded in agreement, taking a really deep, shoulder-lifting breath. \u201cWhat a mess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me.\u201d</p><p>We both laughed then, more to blow out the tension than because of amusement. And Falcon just smiled, standing tall again like the knight I\u2019d come to respect so much, his expression alight with a mix of compassion and something else I didn\u2019t recognise. \u201cYou might want to consider telling David some of what you told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich bit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bit about your mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s devastating, Ara. I know he\u2019s been a prick to you since this Jason thing came out, and I really don\u2019t think you, or your baby\u2014\u201d he presented us, \u201c\u2014need him treating you that way. If he knew the grief you were suffering right now, I think he\u2019d back off a bit.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head at the ground. \u201cHe won\u2019t let me speak to him long enough to tell him something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to tell him?\u201d</p><p>For a moment, I considered it, considered the reaction David would have. But something told me it wouldn\u2019t be compassion. He wouldn\u2019t back off if he knew the truth. This horrid David that\u2019d taken over the man I loved would probably use it to hurt me. \u201cNah,\u201d I said, meeting his eye. \u201cLeave it to me. I\u2019ll tell him when the time is right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. If you\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cIf I change my mind, I know where to find you.\u201d</p><p>He placed a hand to his chest and bowed. \u201cAlways at your side, My Queen.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cThis ball will be the same as every other formal event,\u201d Falcon advised. \u201cDavid will escort you from the second floor into the ballroom and, once there, you\u2019ll engage in the first dance of the evening. After a few turns on the dance floor, the guests will be asked to join you.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, repositioning my crown where it slipped a little toward my brow. Magda had designed my dress around this gold headpiece, combining the style with the pale colour scheme of the \u2018Winter Falls\u2019 decorations in the ballroom, creating a final product that was worthy of Elizabeth I, Queen of England. Fine gold weaving ran in two lines down the front panel of the dress, like woven glitter, while the silky cream fabric caught the light just so, showing the delicate floral pattern within. The dress had come together nicely, mentioned in the Lilithian Times as, \u201cA gold and cream Victorian gown with a modern Amarian edge to it.\u201d It looked like a ball gown one would\u2019ve worn with a high grey coiffure in the eighteenth century, but instead of long sleeves and a puffy bottom, we\u2019d removed the sleeve all together, making it strapless, falling from the waist in a smaller, more elegant puff. My tiny belly was hidden completely under the drop of the skirt, and my hair had been tied up and stacked high on my head, with curls dangling softly around my face. The only thing I hated was the horrid gold heel they\u2019d put me in to account for both David\u2019s height and the length of the dress. I wasn\u2019t sure I could walk in the shoes, let alone dance.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you worrying about, Ara?\u201d Falcon asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing.\u201d I forced a smile, noticing suddenly that he\u2019d been studying my face. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He drew his hands from behind his back and placed one around me. \u201cYou look a bit pale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>I checked over my shoulder then off to both sides, making sure David wasn\u2019t around. \u201cDancing with the king.\u201d</p><p>Falcon didn\u2019t say anything to that. He just exhaled loudly, directing his attention to the crack between the slightly open doors to the Great Hall, where, from up here on the second floor landing, we could both watch the scene beyond. Hundreds of people, by invitation only, had gathered to celebrate the miracle of life. Round tables decked in white cloths occupied the left side of the room, the giant picture of Lilith overlooking, while the right of the room, just by the piano, had been left open as a dance floor. Couples waltzed around the space, all smiling and radiant, with the candlelight echoing warm sentiments around them, charming the pale-coloured clothing like strings of gold. I couldn\u2019t see Jason anywhere in there. He had the right to be there now that he was on my council, though, but I hadn\u2019t spoken to David yet\u2014hadn\u2019t been told what his reaction was, and wasn\u2019t sure if he was going to willingly stand by and allow it, or if he might think to stop it by any means necessary. Including by locking Jason up for tonight.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Falcon,\u201d David said dismissively, stepping up out of nowhere. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you inside.\u201d</p><p>Falcon glanced back at David, and lowered his head to mine, keeping his arm around me. \u201cYou be okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be on the dance floor, right below you. Just whisper my name if you need me,\u201d he hinted.</p><p>I nodded again, my chest too full of air to speak.</p><p>\u201cI said, I\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d David reiterated.</p><p>\u201cGood luck, Ara.\u201d Falcon moved back as the king stood between us. \u201cAnd be careful on the stairs in those shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d I smiled softly at him. \u201cStop worrying, Falcon. Go enjoy yourself. I\u2019ll be fine, I swear.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled, trying to smile, but he didn\u2019t like leaving me up here, alone, with David. Especially since the amendment of the marital laws hadn\u2019t been passed through the Upper House yet.</p><p>\u201cAmendment, or not,\u201d David said to Falcon. \u201cI would never do anything to physically hurt the girl.\u201d</p><p>Falcon bowed once and trotted down the entranceway stairs behind us.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d David asked, slipping a white glove onto his hand.</p><p>\u201cYup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Then let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d He walked forward, not even offering his arm, and the doors swung open, the footmen on the other side bowing their heads as we entered the room. The flow of dancing stopped below like a swirl of water ending suddenly, a few still going until they looked over their shoulders at the announcement of the king and the queen. All the pale colours, warmed with the yellow light, made the room look like a painting, something too fantastical to be real.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d David said, bowing to our guests. \u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>We stood atop the stairs for a moment then, giving them all time to take us in.</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d I said under my breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t condone this,\u201d I said simply, touching my belly. \u201cIt must be hard for you to celebrate something you despise.\u201d</p><p>David said nothing in return, but even if he did, I wouldn\u2019t have heard, because my attention was swept away from our private conversation to Arthur, sitting behind the piano, tossing out the traditional entrance lullaby and replacing it with a Muse song.</p><p>\u201cIs he mad?\u201d I said excitedly. \u201cI love this song!\u201d</p><p>David frowned down at me. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you knew it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? You know how much I love Muse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome then. It\u2019s time to enter,\u201d he muttered, and took off.</p><p>I grabbed hold of the railing and placed my wobbly heel to the first step, searching my peripheral for David\u2019s arm in case I needed to grab it. But his hands were behind his back, clearly being kept away from any risk of touching me. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to touch me when we\u2019re dancing, you know?\u201d I said, hiding my moving lips behind the smile I offered the crowd.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I wore gloves?\u201d</p><p>I scoffed in the back of my throat, not meaning to. \u201cYou know, you don\u2019t have to be so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCareful.\u201d His hand wrapped my back suddenly; the other one grabbing my arm, hitching me upright again as I nearly flew forward, and the quiet gasp of the crowd forced my eyes onto all the shocked faces below. My heart thundered in my chest, my gaze meeting Falcon\u2019s then, who closed his eyes, clutching his own chest.</p><p>David lifted my dress angrily, yanking the skirt out from under the toe of my shoe. \u201cThis dress is too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to lift it at the front when you walk, Ara. Didn\u2019t anyone teach you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a handful of fabric and stuffed it in my hand, closing my fingers around it. \u201cWalk carefully. I will not catch you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn't have anyway, were it not for all these people watching.\u201d</p><p>He looked over the room, resuming his kingly posture, and started walking. I followed, this time holding my dress above my shoes. And we entered the ball with a bit more grace than we\u2019d started with, David offering his hand on the last step and drawing me finally close to him as we fluttered like a breeze onto the dance floor. He positioned our arms widely, with absolutely perfect form, and I caught a glimpse of us in the giant glass windows overlooking the gardens: a man in a suit of black and white, his not-so-beloved queen standing a few inches shorter than him\u2014their backs so straight, their steps so swift and graceful, the whole scene like something from a fairy-tale. He looked nice in a suit, his kingly sash across his chest, distinguishing him from the rest of the men in the room, and I felt proud to be in his arms and also sad, because I knew this would be the last time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The other guests joined the dance floor then, David and I stepping in smaller circles to make room for them, changing our stride so effortlessly one would think we\u2019d danced together for centuries.</p><p>I looked up at his face to take him in; he was clean-shaven, his dark hair brushed back, tidy and almost too clean. But the coldness in his eyes made the green stand out more, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile as he looked down at me.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that look for?\u201d I asked, noticing a very coy kind of almost smile on his face, too.</p> <p>His hand moved slightly more around my rib. \u201cYou\u2019ve filled out since I last held . . . since we last danced.\u201d</p><p>My smile dropped. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you about those brownies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagda says I\u2019m not fat\u2014that it\u2019s just a part of being pregnant, you know, that you lose your child\u2019s figure and become more of a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing pregnant does not make you more of a woman, Ara. That\u2019s done by your actions alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, but, she meant that the body changed\u2014became more womanly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since when is Magda the expert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not. I guess.\u201d I lowered my gaze onto David\u2019s white bowtie. \u201cHow much longer is this dance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been too long already.\u201d He stiffened just a little, angling his chin so it sat further away from the top of my head. But his eyes kept drifting downward, brushing over my face, my hair, my gown.</p><p>My smile returned. \u201cYou know, I can read your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I can. And you won\u2019t say it, but you think I look pretty tonight.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at me, his face suddenly devoid of all emotion. \u201cI think no such thing. I barely even noticed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I get it. I know you hate me, but you don\u2019t have to be so mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not my intention to be mean, Ara. Simply to state that you\u2019re fooled if you think you enter even one of my thoughts in a day\u2014particularly when it comes to my opinion of your appearance. Quite frankly, if I\u2019m honest, cream makes you look washed-out, and your head looks too big for your body when you do your hair that way.\u201d</p><p>That hurt. Deeply. But I brushed it off, flicked him a quirky grin and said, \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t really notice me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust dance, girl. Or this will end with you tripping and accidentally snapping your ankle\u2014rendering you useless for the evening.\u201d</p><p>I shut my gob then and just danced, letting out the breath I\u2019d held when the song finally ended and Mike stepped up to take over. \u201cMay I?\u201d he said with a bow.</p><p>I grabbed his arm and practically ran away with him.</p> <p>\u201cYou okay, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe threatened to snap my leg,\u201d I whispered, leaning close.</p><p>Mike laughed, turning to face me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted me to shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it work? Did you shut up?\u201d</p><p>I nodded, glancing back at David; he was holding Emily close now, the girl throwing her head back, laughing at something he whispered into her hair.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll have to remember that one,\u201d Mike said playfully.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you start.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed again. \u201cYou know he wouldn't actually do that, Ara, right?\u201d</p><p>I felt myself shrink a little. \u201cI\u2019m not really so sure about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ar.\u201d Mike dropped my hand from position and wrapped me up in a very informal hug. \u201cIf he does anything to hurt you or upset you, you come tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? What can you do about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still buddies. I\u2019ll talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. Otherwise he\u2019ll think I\u2019ve been complaining about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, then he\u2019ll just make life harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarder?\u201d He raised a brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s he doing to make it hard now? You two are never even in the same room.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to roll my eyes. \u201cNothing. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it does matter.\u201d His voice peaked higher on the end. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Ara?\u201d</p><p>A few guests passed us and offered congratulations on the baby, Mike and I taking a moment from our conversation to humour them, and as they danced away again, the music stopped suddenly, Mike looking off to his right when a man tapped his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d Jason asked, stepping into view.</p><p>\u201cYou may.\u201d Mike laid my hand in Jason\u2019s, patting his shoulder. \u201cJust return her in one piece this time, mate\u2014unlike the last ball.\u201d</p><p>Jason stiffened, catching my eye quickly. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was just joking, Jase.\u201d I smiled, watching Mike blend in with the crowd.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t funny,\u201d he said, taking me up in his arms like I was some precious stone.</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s just trying to show us that he\u2019s passed all that now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s not. He\u2019s just holding it together for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, feeling my crown brush Jason\u2019s jaw. \u201cHow did the meeting go today\u2014before I got there? Were they nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprisingly?\u201d he said, pausing for a second. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas Mike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was quiet, but I think he knew there was no point arguing my position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have something to say about it in private, but I\u2019m ready for him.\u201d</p><p>Jase shook his head, smiling distantly. \u201cJust don\u2019t upset yourself over it. I can always counsel you privately, if need be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe need won\u2019t arise,\u201d I said, and left it at that, focusing on the rhythm of our dance for a while instead. Jase always was such a magnificent dancer. He had a kind of grace and fluidity that David lacked. I guess it came from being so in touch with his emotions\u2014not being afraid to feel or being seen to feel. There was this strange sensation that always came with it, too, much like that connection David and I had one of the first times we went out to the lake: the . . . gravitational pull.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone told you how beautiful you look tonight?\u201d Jase asked, distracting my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down a little and kissed my head. \u201cWhen I saw you up there\u2014\u201d he nodded to the top of the stairway, \u201c\u2014I was sure I felt my heart beat for the first time in a century, Ara. I mean, every time I look at you, I think you\u2019re the most beautiful girl in the world but, tonight, even you\u2019ve outdone yourself.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back the tiny pool of tears around my lashes. \u201cThank you, Jase.\u201d</p><p>His lips pressed firmly into my head again. \u201cYou\u2019re welc\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreak it up, you two,\u201d David snapped, drawing us suddenly apart.</p><p>\u201cDavid!\u201d I shrieked, looking around to see if anyone noticed. Only a few people looked up, but politely went about their own business.</p><p>\u201cYou both know the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRules?\u201d Jase asked.</p><p>\u201cYou two are not allowed contact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d Jason stepped between David and I a bit.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no say who she\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, Jason is one of my council members now. We can dance if we want.\u201d</p><p>I went to step into Jason again, but David grabbed my wrist, yanking it away. \u201cThat\u2019s it, you\u2019re coming with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, let go of me.\u201d I tugged against him.</p><p>\u201cStop wriggling. You\u2019re making a scene.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the one making a scene, brother,\u201d Jason said, blocking his path. \u201cYou have no right to order her around this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo right?\u201d David asked in a high tone. \u201cI am her husband. I have every right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jason moved closer, lowering his voice so it came as just a whisper through his teeth. \u201cYou left her. You are bound only by a contract that states she is queen and you are king. Nothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d David shoved past him, dragging me along again. \u201cI have every legal right to do with her what I see fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you touch her, I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead, brother.\u201d David spun around, warding Jason off with an icy gaze. \u201cHit me. Give me a reason to arrest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d Arthur called, sending a very stern gaze across the crowd and into Jason\u2019s intentions, altering them. Jase didn\u2019t move or shift in any way, but something in his eyes said he\u2019d backed down.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have the guts,\u201d David said, and led me away.</p><p>I stumbled along, checking over my shoulder, but Jason was gone. \u201cWe were just dancing, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo dance, one does not need to kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were watching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed,\u201d he said dully and shoved me into a chair in the corner under the stairs. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>I landed hard, my teeth clucking as the chair slid an inch and hit the wall. No one looked up. No one even noticed. Or maybe no one really cared.</p><p>\u201cYou will stay here for the remainder of the evening, Ara, unless I say otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said sit.\u201d He forced me down again by aim of that stern, pointed finger. It made no physical contact, but I wasn\u2019t willing to challenge it. \u201cI want you where I can keep an eye on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me sit here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can, and I am. I will not have you making a slut of yourself in front of all these people. Now sit here and behave.\u201d</p><p>He turned away, dusting his hands off, and I heard the tail end of some smart remark about disciplining his wife, shrinking into myself when everyone nearby laughed. They waited until he walked away before casting their judging eyes on me, sending shrink rays onto the surface of my body.</p><p>I turned in my seat, hunching over a little. I didn\u2019t care if my posture slacked or if I looked less than noble. I just wanted to hide in the darkest corner I could find.</p><p>\u201cWould this pretty little girl in her party dress care to dance?\u201d</p><p>I looked up to Arthur\u2019s kind, smiling eyes. \u201cArthur, I can\u2019t. David said I have to stay here.\u201d</p><p>He drew my hand toward him anyway, helping me stand. \u201cLet\u2019s see him challenge his old uncle, ehy.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, but it wasn\u2019t Arthur David would challenge; it was me. Except, I knew he\u2019d wait until we were alone. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to make him mad right now. He needs time to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can have all the time he needs to heal, Amara.\u201d He drew me closer, positioning our arms in an elegant sweep outward. \u201cBut he does not need to hurt you and degrade you in the process. Now\u2014\u201d We moved away and stepped onto the dance floor. \u201cLet us dance.\u201d</p><p>As we circled the room, couples dancing nearby bowed their heads, stepping in wider circles to give us room, as if I were some kind of royal entity or something. I smiled up at Arthur, so grateful he\u2019d come along when he did. I wouldn\u2019t challenge David in a room full of people: he\u2019d only make more of an effort to hold strong and put me in my place, and that would just create a massive scene, degrading David\u2019s pride even more in the process and hindering any hope I had of sorting things out with him. But Arthur, I could tell, was more than up for that challenge. Except, David wouldn\u2019t dare challenge his uncle. I wondered what it was about him that the boys feared and respected so much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw.\u201d Arthur laughed, looking down at his foot.</p><p>\u201cOh my God. I\u2019m so sorry, Arthur.\u201d I smiled sheepishly.</p><p>\u201cNever mind, my dear. I imagine your centre of gravity has shifted slightly with the being you now grow inside you.\u201d</p> <p>I looked down at the gap between Arthur and I where our bodies remained apart because of my bump. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t really concentrate on the steps tonight.\u201d I glanced over my shoulder. \u201cI can feel David\u2019s eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>Arthur\u2019s lips and brow crinkled as he looked over at his nephew, and the feeling, the energy of David, faded.</p><p>\u201cDid he look away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, exhaling the breath I didn\u2019t know I was holding.</p> <p>\u201cI will talk to him about this, Amara. It won\u2019t go unaddressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat won\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis behaviour toward you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cIt was. He was cruel, Amara. And I\u2019ve heard several people mutter the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded, tilting his head then as if listening to something. \u201cIf you can spare a moment, Jason wants to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s waiting for you on the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I . . . I can\u2019t. David will have him arrested if we keep seeing each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry not, my dear. I\u2019ll distract David. You need to hear what Jason has to say.\u201d</p><p>We circled the dance floor again, my feet finally obeying my brain, but I stayed quiet, wondering what Jason wanted. When we reached to doors to the balcony, Arthur made a cheeky turn and swept us out of the room, twirling me straight into Jason\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cAll my prayers answered in one twirl,\u201d Jase said, both arms gently wrapping me up.</p><p>I stood on my toes for a second and touched my nose to his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologise for anything, Ara.\u201d He kissed my nose. \u201cDavid was the jerk.\u201d</p><p>My heels touched the ground again and I turned to thank Arthur, but he was gone. \u201cWhere\u2019d he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s playing Distraction with the king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will he keep him away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you worry your pretty little head about that.\u201d He tucked a curl behind my ear. \u201cI need to talk to you about something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can protect you,\u201d he said, his eyes round and so dark with hope. \u201cI could have legal right to step in when he\u2019s mistreating you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarry me.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cJase\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, the queen is allowed more than one husband. Make me your second. Let me protect you, love you, be there every time you\u2019re hurt or sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I get shut out\u2014told I have no right to comfort you or make decisions for you. I am the one person here who cares more about you than myself, and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase, I know, okay,\u201d I cut in, pressing my hand flat to his chest. \u201cBut I\u2019m not marrying you just so you can be my bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m asking you?\u201d</p><p>My smile copied his.</p><p>\u201cAra, that\u2019s my convincing argument to make you say yes.\u201d</p><p>I laughed through my nose again, wiping under it after.</p><p>\u201cSee, I love you even if you snot on yourself every time you laugh.\u201d</p><p>This time I blew the laughter out through my lips, and stepped into him, slowly sliding both arms along his waist. \u201cI said I didn\u2019t want to love you, Jase, because I needed to make a decision. I needed to choose and commit to one guy, for once in my life. And I know it\u2019s too late for David and I, but this is my commitment, whether he wants me or not. I won\u2019t marry another while he\u2019s still breathing, even if I legally can have two husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, I don\u2019t think you do. I think you know that you and I make a much better couple and that you\u2019re better for me in so many ways but, Jase\u2014\u201d I looked through the doors at David, distracted by a group of Lower House members. \u201cYou have so much heart and you\u2019re so easy to love. And, David . . . he\u2019s got a darker side that I worry for\u2014that I don\u2019t think anybody else in this world understands. I just feel like. . .\u201d I looked at Jase again, moving my shoulders up once. \u201cIf I don\u2019t love him, who will?\u201d</p><p>Jase let out a hot breath across the night sky and twirled me gracefully into his arms, cradling my spine to his chest, both of us just watching the candlelight from inside flicker shadows around the garden below us. \u201cYou're going to be okay, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>He pressed his lips to the top of my head, his warm breath making me hold mine. \u201cBecause I'm going to make sure of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how will you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, things will be different for us, Ara. I believe that somewhere out there under those stars is a future for us, and maybe it\u2019s decades away into eternity, but I love you. I\u2019ve loved you under the most insane conditions, and I won't ever give up hope for us.\u201d He turned me to face him again. \u201cThings are going to get worse before they get better, but I'm here, and I just need you to know that you\u2019ll always have a home to come to in my heart, Ara. It belongs to you eternally.\u201d He touched his chest. \u201cJust hold onto that when things get dark.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, standing on my toes as he pressed his lips to my head. \u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I'm the man who destroyed my brother. I'm not good, but I love you, and I\u2019d die for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d David roared, thrusting both doors open at once.</p><p>We broke apart, Jason tucking me safely behind him. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whose fault it is. She is to come inside at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just talking. She\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not test the lengths I will go to to keep you and her apart, brother. I will\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d I patted Jason\u2019s arm, stepping out from the shadows. The moonlight moved up from the ground, over my dress and lit my face, and the anger in David slowly simmered down. \u201cI\u2019ll go inside now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will do no such thing.\u201d David rushed forward and grabbed my arm. \u201cYou\u2019re to go to bed. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>I tried to twist my wrist from his grip, searching everywhere for one of my Guard. But they were all distracted\u2014even Falcon. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me go if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI. . .\u201d I studied my feet. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Arthur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s he going to do about it?\u201d</p><p>I looked David right in the eye this time, pursing my lips, then said, \u201cTry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Falcon cut in, wrapping my hips and drawing me away from David.</p><p>But David wouldn\u2019t let go. In one tug, he yanked me back onto his side of the line.</p><p>Falcon\u2019s hand fell onto the sword in his own belt. \u201cWhere are you taking her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo bed,\u201d David said coldly, then motioned to the guards by the door. \u201cSee that my brother makes it back to his room, and stays there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Majesty.\u201d They bowed, and the jig was up.</p><p>\u201cForget it, Ara,\u201d Jason said with a dismissive headshake. \u201cHe\u2019s not worth it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. Jase was right. We could sort this mess out tomorrow. Now wasn\u2019t the time. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Falcon. I\u2019m just gonna go to bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t even eaten yet, you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can grab an apple on the way out.\u201d David turned and dragged me along behind him, snatching a red, shiny piece of fruit from a bowl as we hurried out the doors by the fireplace, the painted Lilith looking down on me like she found it all so amusing.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you smiling at?\u201d I asked her spitefully.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like having to treat you like a child, Ara,\u201d David said, pulling me up the stairs by my wrist. \u201cBut you can\u2019t expect me to stand by and let you fraternise with the very man who ruined your marriage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t ruin it, David. I did.\u201d</p><p>David stopped walking and looked back down at me. The music lilting out from the doors of the Great Hall just in front of us carried all the joy and excitement of those still allowed in the room. I felt cold and empty and left out from where I stood now. \u201cIt takes two to tango,\u201d he said coldly.</p><p>\u201cYes, but his reasons for \u201cdancing\u201d in the first place weren\u2019t the same as mine.\u201d</p><p>His brow slowly creased in the middle and he moved down a step so our eyes aligned. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>I tried to wriggle free from his grip, but it tightened. \u201cHe wanted me to carry his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, his voice cracking with confusion.</p><p>\u201cBecause then he could use the Dagger and kill Drake, and I would never have had to lose you.\u201d</p><p>His grasp on my wrist loosened, but didn\u2019t drop. \u201cBut the law doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But we didn\u2019t know that at the time, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he tried to tell me\u2014that day in Eve\u2019s room, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d He stepped closer, grabbing my other wrist, the apple tucked between his pinkie and his ring finger. \u201cAra, that\u2019s what he wanted to say. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe realised then that he\u2019d made a mistake. That even if he had got me pregnant, it still wouldn\u2019t have saved you.\u201d</p><p>He dropped both my wrists and took a step back, turning away with the back of his hand over his mouth. \u201cBut . . . he\u2019s in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s why he chose to die and leave me with the only man I wanted.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me then, but the hatred was still fierce in his eyes. \u201cAnd what about you? You said you that your reasons for sleeping with him were different to his. What\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie.\u201d I clutched the edges of my dress, looking down. \u201cI\u2019ve lied enough to you, David. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at me when you speak,\u201d he said, thrusting my chin up. Our eyes met and mine filled with tears, not ready to see him break all over again.</p><p>\u201cThe truth is, I laid with him because I wanted to save you. But at some point in . . . in that time, I realised I loved him too much to lose to him. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>He sighed and stepped away again.</p><p>\u201cAnd then, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to love him. And I was angry at myself for feeling anything for him. I thought\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust stop.\u201d He put his hand up. \u201cI can\u2019t hear any more of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to know the truth, though, David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the truth,\u201d he yelled. \u201cYou love him. And that\u2019s all there is to know.\u201d He grabbed my arm again and spun me on the spot, leading me up the stairs faster than before. I tripped on the front of my dress, stumbling a little as my shoe slipped off my foot and fell a few steps down. David didn\u2019t notice, though, or he didn\u2019t care. He just dragged me along, tossing the apple he was carrying in the first plant he saw. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken everything away from me, Ara,\u201d he said as we reached the third floor corridor. \u201cI have no reason to live now, and no reason to die. The Dagger is gone. My wife is gone, and I\u2019m nothing but a king without a purpose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, at least you\u2019re still king,\u201d I said spitefully.</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s all that matters to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems to be.\u201d I folded my arms as we stopped by my bedroom door. \u201cIt was always your greatest dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra. You. Were. My. Only dream.\u201d He laughed incredulously, looking off to one side for a second. \u201cYou just never understood that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you\u2019ve done everything to prove so far that that\u2019s a lie, David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the way you treat me, and how much you hate me for telling you the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate you for telling the truth, Ara. I hate you for sleeping with my brother,\u201d he said, leaning in so his face was right in front of mine. \u201cAnd, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I may have little reason left to live, but I\u2019ve even less reason to let you or my brother live. I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t rule this monarchy if I have to look at you every day.\u201d He opened my door and shoved me inside. \u201cYou need to stay in here until I decide what to do with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, wait.\u201d I ran forward before he could close the door. And I wanted to argue or plead with him, but his eyes had gone completely black, like he wasn\u2019t even alive in there anymore\u2014as if the vampire had stepped up to save his heart from the complication of feeling, and completely wiped my David away in the process. I took a humble step backward and spoke to the floor. \u201cI . . . I can\u2019t get this dress off by myself. Can you send\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can sleep in it,\u201d he barked and slammed the door shut in my face. I heard the keys rattle in the lock, and when I tried the handle a second later, it wouldn't turn.</p><p>But my stomach did. I laid my hand over it, waiting for the quivering to stop. I could\u2019ve ended it. I could\u2019ve lied and told David the only reason I slept with Jase was to save his life\u2014that I didn\u2019t love Jason anywhere in my heart. But we\u2019d founded our love on lies from the beginning: the truth I carried back then for loving Mike. The truth he carried for the man and the creature he was that he would never show me. One lie after another had come between us, and I just couldn\u2019t look him in the eye and tell him I didn\u2019t, and that I never loved Jase. I didn\u2019t want to love him, but what did that mean, really? It was stupid and it couldn\u2019t be classed as a real emotion in any way, shape, or form. But it was how I felt. I loved both of them equally once, and my love for David grew beyond what I felt for Jase. Only, now, David was killing that love off just a little bit every day. I knew he was hurt. I knew he needed time to deal with how he was feeling, but a part of me wondered if maybe this was just it\u2014this was how it would be forever now.</p> <p>How little could he have loved me before if he wasn\u2019t willing to at least try to forgive me?</p><p>Then again, how little could I ever have loved him to expect that?</p><p>All I could hope for now was a quick and painless death for Jason. I didn\u2019t even have a hope that I might join him one day, because as soon as my baby turned eighteen, I\u2019d be killed, and my soul would belong to Lilith again. And the fact that I knew, so deep it was almost a part of me, that David would find comfort in my death made the heaving in my gut quicken. A blast of vomit spilled into my fingertips, landing in the toilet only by the pure miracle of the vampire speed I used to get to the bathroom. I sobbed as hard as I vomited, my stomach churning and burning like a hole was being ripped open inside me.</p><p>\u201cShh,\u201d said a quiet voice, and my hair moved back off my face under soft fingertips. \u201cJust breathe, sweet girl. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase?\u201d I coughed and spat into the toilet again, wiping my hand along my mouth.</p><p>\u201cJust breathe.\u201d</p><p>His smiling face was there waiting for me when I turned around. \u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWent out the window,\u201d he said casually, a half smile turning one corner of his lip.</p> <p>I stood up just a little, still cramped and sore. \u201cYou could get in big trouble, you know?\u201d</p><p>He just nodded and said, \u201cI know,\u201d then handed me a facecloth.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I blotted the smudged mascara from under my eyes first, then wiped my mouth clean.</p><p>\u201cCome on then.\u201d He spun me at the shoulders so I faced the mirror on the wall above the sink. \u201cLet\u2019s get this dress off you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to undo it?\u201d</p><p>He stopped for a second and leaned forward to whisper in my ear. \u201cI\u2019ve undone my fair share of corsets, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I laughed timidly, reaching down to hold the counter top. Pull by pull, the corset came loose and my lungs expanded, revelling in the simplest form of freedom. \u201cYou\u2019re a lifesaver, Jase.\u201d</p><p>His arm circled my waist, a flat hand holding the front of my dress to my ribs as he turned me slowly to face him, pressing a very warm, very sweet kiss to my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about what happened tonight.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and moved my face along his lips, feeling them brush so softly over my skin that it tingled. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Jase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am all the same. He shouldn't treat you like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d I snuggled into his chest, holding my breath as his warm hands cupped my spine and the dress fell downward, held there by my hips, leaving my bare breasts against Jason\u2019s shirt. \u201cI tried to defend myself against him, but he\u2019s so. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cForceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t own you.\u201d He smoothed his hand down my waist and pushed the dress away, helping me step out of it. \u201cIf he keeps this up, I\u2019ll kidnap you, and he\u2019ll never see you again. I swear it on my mother\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, tossing the dress off to the side. \u201cI\u2019d kinda like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jase pulled me closer by my bare hips. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve made plans, Ara. All you have to do is say the word, and we\u2019ll be gone so fast they won\u2019t realise it until we\u2019re in another country.\u201d</p><p>I thought long and hard in that few seconds as I laid my cheek to his chest and let out a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t run from my problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can.\u201d He laughed, tangling his fingers in my hair and sliding a few pins out so it all dropped loosely down my back. \u201cBut, let\u2019s just get some clothes on you and get you to bed for now. We\u2019ll talk more about it when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d I said, but instead of moving away, I slowly lifted one arm, then the other, up to his neck and wrapped them tightly around him, angling my head so my crown wouldn\u2019t chill his jaw. \u201cThank you, Jase. I really needed someone just now.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed me a little tighter, breathing me in deeply. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>The song of summer birds was gone when I opened my eyes, having retreated with the day that began before this one. Only rain owned these skies now, leaving a very clear, very stern warning that winter was on its way. I\u2019d never seen the snow at the manor, but people had told me there was nothing like it in all the world.</p><p>I flattened my covers to the bed beside me, wishing I could reach across and hold Jason\u2019s hand. He stayed only long enough for me to drift away last night, then disappeared out the window, leaving me safely tucked up in bed. I could sense Falcon nearby, despite the hour being too early for him to be on duty. I wanted to rap on my door and ask if David had unlocked it, but I wasn\u2019t really sure I wanted to know.</p><p>The mother of nature called to me from the forest outside, her angelic voice a whispering patter among the rain. She wanted to see me, needed to see me. But unless I jumped from the balcony, I would remain a princess in a tower, guarded by a dragon, for who knew how long.</p><p>Or maybe not as long as I thought. . .</p><p>The door latch clicked then and I drew the sheets to my chest, sitting up a little as it swung open and David ushered the butler in.</p><p>\u201cMorning, My Queen.\u201d The old man bowed, placing a tray at my feet.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Edgar.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again and turned, leaving the room quickly.</p><p>\u201cDavid,\u201d I called before he shut the door.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not planning to lock me in here again, are you?\u201d</p><p>He looked at the door handle, then at me. \u201cFrom this day on, you will eat in private quarters. You may leave your room for council and court sessions only and, for anything else, you will need my approval.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re imprisoning me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m keeping you out of my sight so I don\u2019t kill you and, in turn, the child you\u2019re carrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid?\u201d</p><p>He sighed, opening the door again. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake, but I don\u2019t deserve to die for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, if you wanted to punish me, it\u2019s working. I feel like hell inside, okay?\u201d I motioned to my tight chest. \u201cIt feels like you\u2019ve ripped every part of my beating heart out and put it in a blender. But I\u2019m a living being, and I can only take so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what? Because I don\u2019t have a heartbeat, that means you can do whatever you want to hurt m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d I pushed the covers back and sat up on my knees, holding the \u2018I am queen; now do as I say\u2019 card back for if really needed. \u201cI . . . I know you hate me. You have every right to. But please don\u2019t lock me away. I\u2019ll stay out of sight, I swear. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, how did you get your dress off?\u201d</p><p>I looked around the room. \u201cI . . . I ripped it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned.</p><p>\u201cIt was too tight,\u201d I lied, shrugging innocently.</p><p>He just groaned and backed away, leaving the door open. I wasn\u2019t sure if that meant I could come out, but I even if it didn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t staying in here any longer. I grabbed my red velvet cloak from the closet, undressed, and darted from the room. There was only one place on this earth I was safe from the wrath of David\u2019s broken heart, no matter what, and if he wanted me gone, invisible, then that\u2019s where I planned to stay\u2014at least for the rest of the day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The mother offered comfort as I cried my eyes out, lying naked, curled in a ball at the base of the Stone, my bloody hand against it. The forest swarmed around me, birds and small animals showing themselves, forming a protective barrier between me and the rest of the world. I knew the depth of my agony was multiplied by a million hormones my body didn\u2019t understand, but that didn\u2019t make the pain any less real.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I do, Mother?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cI already gave you the answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you came to us and asked the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe question?\u201d I thought about it for a second, scraping a few leaves off my cheek to stop the slight itch there. \u201cDo you mean when you said Jason was the answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>I pictured that day\u2014his smile\u2014the way he broke when I said I would never be with him. \u201cHow is he the answer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she said, appearing atop the stone in the elegant form of her mortal self. \u201cYou\u2019ve asked the right question.\u201d</p><p>I sat up, drawing my bloodied hand away from the Stone and tucking it in my lap. The dirt and leaves shifted under me, cushioning my bare bottom, while the rich scent of soil grounded my floating heart. \u201cThen tell me. Just tell me what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to follow your heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heart still wants David.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, her blue eyes, so like mine, shining bright with the life of the forest. \u201cYou are destined to be with Jason, Auress. It has been written now for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I shook my head, standing up quickly. \u201cI love him. I can\u2019t help but to love him. He\u2019s amazing and kind and sweet, but it\u2019s not right.\u201d</p> <p>She just nodded, her thin smile offering me no alternative.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll kill David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will save him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the time comes, the love you offer that boy\u2014that sweet Jason\u2014will give him the strength and courage to save you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave us?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved down, then up, slowly.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . I have to love him to save David.\u201d I frowned, looking down at the Stone. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVery little does in life before we cross the line of Fate and see everything for the lesson or important event it always was. Even the tiniest setback in life can often be for the greatest benefit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it is to our benefit\u2014to be with Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the benefit of all.\u201d Her form wavered a little as the cut in my hand healed over and the blood on the Stone faded.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . wait.\u201d I tried to touch her to bring her back. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to let go of David yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen talk with him,\u201d she said, becoming an echo and nothing more than a flickering fog. \u201cHe will help you cross sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk with him. You will be surer of your path every time you hear him speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d I stopped when my words fell on an empty forest. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose him,\u201d I muttered to myself. I didn\u2019t want this path. I loved Jason because he was hard not to love. But I loved David no matter what, even when I hated him.</p><p>Why would the mother of Life ask me to throw that away?</p><p>I spent the better part of the day pacing the halls, thinking about my walk in the forest. When I passed Walt near the Great Hall and he said David had gone into town, I took the perfect opportunity to go and visit with Jase, who still hadn\u2019t come out of his room. He hadn\u2019t been locked in, like me, but he was keeping a low profile.</p><p>\u201cHoping to find something different to the last few hundred times you\u2019ve read that?\u201d I asked, leaning on the doorframe.</p><p>Jase sat up and tucked my suicide letter under his thigh. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear you come in. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s because I didn\u2019t knock first.\u201d I pushed up from my lean and wandered into his room.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to knock, Ara. You\u2019re welcome in here any time.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and sat down on the foot of the bed. \u201cSo, why are you still reading that letter?\u201d</p><p>He drew it out from under his leg and flattened the page. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy you said, and I quote, \u2018I love you, Jase. I\u2019ve loved you for so long and, in a different life, we would have been married, had a family, and lived together forever.\u2019\u201d He looked up from the letter. \u201cHow can you feel that and then, the minute you\u2019re free from David, deny me the chance to be with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJase.\u201d I sighed, flopping back on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m not free. I told you. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re committing to him even if he doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d he said in a mock girl\u2019s voice. \u201cI know. I remember all too clearly. But why? I don\u2019t understand why, after everything he\u2019s done\u2014the way he\u2019s treated you, you can\u2019t see that he\u2019s not going to come \u2018round, Ara.\u201d</p><p>I thought about it for a second. \u201cForgiveness takes time.\u201d</p><p>Jase laughed. \u201cAra, David and I are still fighting over who broke the bottle of Port in Uncle Arthur\u2019s study sixty years ago.\u201d</p><p>I laughed too.</p><p>\u201cHe can hold a grudge for hundreds of years\u2014especially against a girl he let into his heart. He\u2019s feeling exposed and damaged in ways even he doesn\u2019t understand and, Ara, if he was capable of forgiveness. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be decades away. I know.\u201d</p><p>Jase huffed, and I heard the drawer in his nightstand close, his shadow coming over my face a second later. I looked up into his smiling green eyes.</p><p>\u201cIf he. . .\u201d He juggled the words in the back of his throat. \u201cHe can be mean, Ara. If he wants you to hurt, you can be damn sure you\u2019re going to hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d I said positively. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but . . . eventually he\u2019ll do or say something to hurt you beyond repair. And I don\u2019t want this to happen, Ara, but I have no control over it. Just\u2014\u201d He sat back, and I rolled onto my side to watch him. \u201cIf the day ever comes where you decide you don\u2019t want his forgiveness anymore, do you think you\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise.\u201d I reached across and cupped his hand.</p><p>\u201cPromise what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll marry you then.\u201d</p><p>His face split into a wide, pearly grin. He looked up from our hands, making me smile too. \u201cI will hold you to that promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t need to. If I believe things are truly over for David and I, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to marry you, Jase. And it\u2019d take hell to stop me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen\u2014\u201d He kissed my hand. \u201cUntil that day, I pray you fall out of love with him, but I hope it\u2019s not for the cruelty he shows you. I don\u2019t want you to suffer that way.\u201d</p><p>I flopped onto my back and stared up at the ceiling, softly rubbing my belly. Then, quietly, without warning, the vampire beside me placed his hand over mine. It felt warm and safe and so comfortable I moved my own hand away and let him feel the baby inside me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna take care of her, Ara. She\u2019ll never want for love a day in her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019d be willing to take on a kid that\u2019s not yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, she is a part of you, and that makes her a part of me. As far as I\u2019m concerned, she is of my own flesh and blood.\u201d</p><p>I pouted, half smiling. \u201cSometimes, I wish she was yours.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and kissed my belly, hovering there for a few seconds after. \u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>My gaze left his lips and the soft skin of my belly under them, and moved onto the side of his face. So much had happened between us. His face was one I used to fear and yet, now, it was the one I looked for when everything was falling apart. I slid my thumb down his cheekbone, thinking back to the day I confessed our affair\u2014how I found him bruised and beaten in the cellblock. \u201cHey, Jase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho hurt you the day David had you arrested?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, his smile blending with a frown. \u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho didn\u2019t tell me what?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, sitting back. \u201cFalcon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I sat up. \u201cHe did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe . . . he was pretty pissed off. As soon as David left you alone in your room, Falcon came down and made sure I paid dearly for every inch of flesh I ever touched on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jase.\u201d I touched his hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I kinda deserved it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you didn\u2019t. And why didn\u2019t you tell me who did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Ara, I wasn\u2019t gonna do that,\u201d he said simply. \u201cYou love Falcon. I didn\u2019t wanna upset you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am upset. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he said smugly. \u201cYou really can\u2019t believe he\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip, huffing my hair off my brow. \u201cI guess I can believe he\u2019d beat you senseless. But it\u2019s not like him to take the law into his own hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t really thinking then, Ara. You might say he was blind with rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I grabbed Jase\u2019s forearm. \u201cHe\u2019s not bound by the Curse of Lilith, is he? Like Blade was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head, smiling. \u201cHe just cares about you and wanted to deck the guy who ruined your life.\u201d</p><p>I relaxed a bit then. \u201cLike a big brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Come here\u2014\u201d Jase reached out and tugged my sleeve until I crawled over and laid between his legs, my spine to his chest, his back leaned against the bedpost. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him you know. Just let him have this one, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, okay then.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI just can\u2019t make sense of it, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really adore Falcon, but the Curse of Lilith is supposed to befall any man with a heartbeat who is unlucky enough to be cared for by me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless they\u2019ve been in, or are, in true love with someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalcon\u2019s been in love before,\u201d he stated.</p><p>\u201cHe has?\u201d</p><p>Jase nodded once against the side of my face. \u201cI read all of his thoughts\u2014past and present\u2014when he was laying in to me. He lost his fianc\u00e9, Felicity, a few years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCar accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSerious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He called her over to help him sort out an argument with his sister, Annie. But she stormed off in a hurry before Felicity got there, didn\u2019t even check the road before crossing it. She hit Felicity\u2019s windshield and the car swerved into oncoming traffic. . .\u201d His lips pursed into a thin line. \u201cFelicity got just the smallest knock to the head, but she died in hospital shortly after Annie.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The scene played out in my head, probably pictured all wrong, but the grief that came with it was unmistakeable. \u201cWhat was their fight about?\u201d</p><p>His closed lips angled up on the edges into a smile. \u201cShe\u2019d been with a boy Falcon didn\u2019t approve of and . . . she got pregnant.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes for a second. \u201cThat\u2019s just so tragic.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cSo, go easy on him. In a lot of ways, what he did to me wasn\u2019t just for you\u2014it was for Annie, too.\u201d</p><p>I angled my head and kissed the side of his jaw. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he did that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you just made it all worth it.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and lay my hands on his where he rested them over my belly.</p><p>Despite David hating his brother, thankfully, he hadn\u2019t revoked his approval for the lab. Jase was ordering parts and pieces, and I was supposed to meet him in the field to demonstrate my new rock-blasting tricks at their best. But as I walked into the Great Hall, the round, shiny surface of a golden apple caught my eye, just sitting there on the dining table for anyone to find.</p> <p>\u201cHow did you get out here?\u201d I asked the apple, walking over.</p><p>\u201cI put it there,\u201d Eve said, flickering and waving suddenly in front of me like smoke.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Eve? Someone might see it. What are you playing at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeeded to get your attention. You don\u2019t see me so much anymore when I\u2019m in the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She shook her small head.</p> <p>\u201cWell, why did you need my attention?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted you to see something,\u201d she whispered, then reached across and flicked the apple onto the floor. It hit with a mighty thud, leaving a small dent in the wood.</p><p>\u201cReally, Eve, was that necessary?\u201d I bent down to pick it up, and two pairs of feet came charging into the room from under the stairway. I stayed put for a second, hoping they\u2019d pass, otherwise it might look like I was hiding down here under the table, and I wasn\u2019t about to show them the apple, either.</p><p>\u201cEmily. Just\u2014\u201d Blade ran after her, spinning her around in one swift, knightly move. \u201cPlease don\u2019t walk away from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you expect me to say, Blade?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything,\u201d he said, and that accent made me wish for a second that he was talking to me. \u201cEm, just let me hold you. Let me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to make this better. Don\u2019t you get it? It doesn\u2019t matter what you feel for me. I\u2019m damaged goods!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, Em.\u201d He rolled his head to one side. \u201cYou\u2019re not to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can you say that? How can you want me after what he just told you?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders dropped and he looked down at the ground, then off to one side.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Em.\u201d He grabbed her wrist. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m not upset about that. I\u2019m upset because I don\u2019t know how to make you see that none of that matters to me.\u201d</p><p>She stopped trying to pull away from him and just stood there. \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . repulsed by me?\u201d</p><p>Blade laughed. \u201cYou could sleep with Arthur and I wouldn\u2019t be repulsed by you. It\u2019s gonna take a lot more than sex with that creep to keep me from you. And, besides\u2014\u201d He braved another step closer. \u201cYou were human then, and it was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for me, it wasn\u2019t. It feels like only yesterday.\u201d She hugged herself, looking at her feet.</p><p>Blade wrapped both arms around her, his shoulders tense for the first few breaths until it became clear Emily wouldn\u2019t push him away. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he did that to you, Em,\u201d he whispered into her hair. \u201cBut he\u2019s the fool. Not you.\u201d</p><p>And now I was very curious about what Em had told him.</p><p>\u201cMike couldn\u2019t look at me after,\u201d she whimpered. \u201cHe said he still loved me but he just needed time to make sense of it all.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. That boy needed to read Relationships, for Dummies.</p><p>\u201cI know that makes you feel like he doesn\u2019t care about you, but they were friends\u2014close friends. And he\u2019s had to come to terms with this new David he\u2019s seen rise as king, and then with all of this.\u201d He squeezed her a bit tighter. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t blame you. And he didn\u2019t mean to tell me, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She nodded against his chest.</p><p>\u201cHave you told Ara?\u201d</p><p>Her head moved in a no. \u201cI\u2019ve never found the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo tell me what?\u201d I asked, standing up then to make my presence known.</p><p>Emily spun around in Blade\u2019s arms, her brown eyes going wide. \u201cAra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily.\u201d I moved a bit closer, stepping cautiously. Somehow, right now, I got the sense that I was the last person she wanted to see. \u201cWhat were you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were listening?\u201d she yelled, jerking forward.</p><p>\u201cI was passing by, and I. . .\u201d I smirked at Blade. \u201cI thought Blade was finally confessing his love for you. I just wanted to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiving vicariously through me now, huh?\u201d she said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cIf you must know\u2014\u201d I propped both hands on my hips, checking under the table quickly to see if the apple was hidden enough. \u201cYes. And I\u2019m sorry for that, but . . . I just wanted to see you happy. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Her dead-straight spine relaxed again, and Blade and I followed suit.</p><p>\u201cSo you knew he was in love with me, too?\u201d she asked, jerking her head at Blade.</p><p>I couldn't help but smile.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but I knew the action didn\u2019t fit the feeling. She was happy\u2014happier than I\u2019d seen her in ages.</p><p>\u201cSo, what was it Mike couldn\u2019t handle, Em? Why did you break up?\u201d</p><p>She sighed, looked at Blade, then moved over and took my hand. \u201cI need to show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO . . . kay.\u201d I noticed her nervousness enough to check Blade's reaction, too. He was about as tense as a lamb in a field of wolves.</p><p>Emily ducked her head and lifted it again, sweeping her hair back off her shoulder. \u201cLook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see a scar and\u2014\u201d I looked a bit closer, and just above the little silver scar left from the day Jase turned her was a tiny greenish-black dot\u2014like a tattooed freckle. \u201cA Mark?\u201d</p><p>She drew her hair back over her shoulder. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom . . . like what humans get when they have sex with a vampire?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . Mike was your first and last. And he was Lilithian by the time you guys had sex. And Lilithians don\u2019t leave\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMike was not this poor girl\u2019s first.\u201d Blade exhaled his words.</p><p>An invisible rug came out from under my feet. \u201cWhat do you mean? Who was?\u201d</p><p>Blade cleared his throat. \u201cYour husband.\u201d</p><p>A vacuum slowly sucked the air from the room, my mouth going completely dry.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Emily stepped forward, but I waved her off, walking blindly toward the glass doors.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Blade tried, too, his voice going straight to my inner message bank.</p><p>David and Emily.</p><p>David and Emily.</p><p>He slept with her.</p><p>He held her like he held me.</p><p>His hands on her hips; his lips touching hers; his naked body completely wrapped up in hers.</p><p>All the images of them dancing together at my house\u2014Emily in her green dress; David, so tall and so handsome\u2014came rushing back to haunt me, blending and mixing with my own images of David\u2019s naked body, scattering everything I thought I knew and replacing it with her. And him. Naked. Together.</p><p>The ground changed from wood floors to stone steps to long, swishy grass under my feet, until I reached the sunny clearing and fell to my knees a few hundred feet from my oak tree, sinking my hands into the ground to hold myself up.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily,\u201d I said into the earth, watching another tear fall between my knees.</p><p>\u201cI'm sorry you had to find out that way.\u201d Her shadow darkened my hands as she stood over me.</p><p>I sobbed a little harder. \u201cWas there a better way to find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason\u2019s arms wrapped my body and he swept me into his chest. \u201cDamn it. Don't run off like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>He leaned out, wiping his thumbs down my tear-soaked face. \u201cI called to you several times. You just ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, Ara. You just scared me, is all.\u201d</p><p>I looked at Emily then, and the pity in her eyes made it all hurt so much more. She knew. All along. She knew what it was like to be with my husband. She lied to me. He lied to me. Why would they do that?</p><p>\u201cHow did she find out?\u201d Jason asked Emily in a very short, almost harsh tone.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I pushed away from him, falling back in the grass on my palms. \u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly recently.\u201d He reached for me again.</p><p>I moved away. \u201cHow recent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I turned Em.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat's not really what I call recent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I tried to tell you, but everything happened after that. Then I was supposedly dead. And there hasn\u2019t really been a good moment to break your heart like that with the news, Ara. Not to mention\u2014\u201d He sat down on his butt with a huge sigh. \u201cDavid really should have been the one to tell you.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lips and turned my gaze on Em. \u201cWhy didn't you tell me? You could have told me from the first day we became friends, and it would\u2019ve been okay, Emily. But you lied to me, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn't lie, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid erased it,\u201d Jason said, offering Emily his hand; she took it and sat down across from him. \u201cEmily didn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know you slept with him?\u201d I asked accusingly, drawing the rest of that spiteful attack back in since, continuing would make me a hypocrite. \u201cBut you. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was a virgin, yes,\u201d Jason answered the question I wanted to ask.</p><p>\u201cThen you were\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBound to him.\u201d She nodded, resting her chin on her knee. \u201cI was obsessed with David, Ara, believed it was love, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, how come you suddenly remembered? Or did David actually tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn't suddenly remember,\u201d Jase said. \u201cWhen she came to me, the day I bit her, it...she was so upset. She was mad at me for what I did to you at the masquerade, but her anger went beyond caring for a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got in a fight about how he left me,\u201d she added.</p><p>\u201cAnd then the truth came out,\u201d Jase said, \u201cthat she never loved me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him I was always in love with David\u2014that I used Jason to get past that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Jase.\u201d I cocked my head, eyes of sympathy offering him wordless condolences.</p><p>\u201cI was okay. But it didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense\u2014for her to be in love with David. She didn\u2019t really even like him that much.\u201d He laughed when he looked at Emily, and even she managed a small smile. \u201cI read her mind\u2014saw all the times she just wanted to whack him with a baseball bat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it was wrong to feel that way,\u201d Em added. \u201cTo hate someone so much but find yourself crying every night because they won\u2019t ever love you. I mean, every time he looked at me, I\u2019d wish he\u2019d see that I was the one for him but, inside, if I really thought about it, there was nothing I actually liked about David.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen I realised this, I swept her hair back and, sure enough, she was Marked,\u201d Jason said. \u201cI could\u2019ve given her the memory back. I could have made her aware that this obsession was purely a spirit bind, but it would\u2019ve eventually killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d been admitted into psychiatric care already,\u201d Emily said, her voice shaking. \u201cWhen I told you I\u2019d seen a counsellor over losing Jason, I lied\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was always about David.\u201d I nodded to myself.</p><p>Jason slid over to wrap his arm around me. \u201cShe would\u2019ve killed herself eventually. So, I immortalised her to break the bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that's why you never told me the reason you bit her.\u201d I looked up at him quickly. \u201cThat's why you avoided it.\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cI always planned to tell you, though, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you. . .\u201d I eyed Emily\u2019s neck. \u201cYou ripped her apart when you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to make it look like an attack. She wasn\u2019t conscious at the time. I wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d I covered my lips with the very tips of my fingers. \u201cJase, I hated you so much for turning her like that. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He took my hand away from my mouth and kissed it. \u201cBut I knew you\u2019d learn the truth eventually. It was better for you to hate me at the time than David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou were so fragile. You thought you needed him to survive, which\u2014\u201d He laughed, looking away for a second, \u201c\u2014turns out wasn\u2019t just a psychological dependence, like I thought. It was physical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhysical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You literally needed him to survive. Without his blood, Ara, you\u2019d have gotten pretty sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I rolled my eyes at myself. \u201cSo . . . does David know you remember, Em?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe first memory that came back to me was . . . that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night they had sex,\u201d Jase said.</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you attacked him when you first woke as a vampire. Was that because of\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI was kind of reliving it.\u201d</p><p>I got up on my knees and crawled a bit closer to her. \u201cEm? What did he do to you?\u201d</p><p>She wiped the side of her wrist down her nose, her eyes sparkling with a coat of tears.</p><p>\u201cEmily, did he rape you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, holding a very tight breath, her whole jaw quivering.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to tell her?\u201d Jason asked softly.</p><p>She nodded, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cAra,\u201d Jase said, \u201ccome here.\u201d</p><p>I crawled over and snuggled into his waiting arm, then reached across and took Emily's hand; she was so tense, her small hand wet with tears, tight and almost unwilling to be against mine. Like I was the enemy. Or maybe she was afraid I\u2019d hate her. But, right now, I only felt more love for that poor girl than I ever had before. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Em,\u201d I said, shaking her hand a bit. \u201cI'm not mad at you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded against her knee, chewing her thumbnail.</p><p>\u201cShe knows that, Ara. But she just can\u2019t bear to look you in the eye.\u201d</p><p>I squeezed her hand again. \u201cWhy? I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so upset if you know I\u2019m not mad with you.\u201d</p><p>Jason began with a sigh. \u201cShe\u2019s never talked about this with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept Mike,\u201d she said coldly. \u201cAnd he hates me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just. . .\u201d She sobbed inaudibly. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m disgusting for letting it happen.\u201d</p><p>Jason pulled her into his chest, too, giving her a long kiss on the head, tightening his hold around me at the same time. \u201cYou are not disgusting, Emily Pierce. And Mike has no right to blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe blames her?\u201d I nearly barfed the words out.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen when I tried to explain. He just thinks I did it because I loved David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that not the reason?\u201d I asked innocently.</p><p>Her and Jase winced.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, Ara, and I guess the event doesn\u2019t really have a point of origin. It kind of all led to them having sex, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe event? I\u2019m lost,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cEm had been given a hard time at school by a few of the jocks,\u201d Jase explained. \u201cThere was this club...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had no choice but to be in it,\u201d Emily cried. \u201cIf you wanted to be a cheerleader, you had to run with the jocks.\u201d</p><p>I nodded in understanding.</p><p>\u201cThey were about sixteen at the time,\u201d Jase continued. \u201cAnd a couple of girls started bragging about losing their virginity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, naturally, the boys wanted in.\u201d Em half smiled, rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThey came up with this lottery where they\u2019d put girls\u2019 names in a hat and draw them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, what, you\u2019d sleep with that guy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cEveryone did it. We . . . if any of the girls were against it, they never said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d be labelled a frigid outcast.\u201d</p><p>My brows went high and I exhaled loudly. I remembered too well the lows you\u2019d stoop to to fit in at school.</p><p>\u201cOne day, just after I first met David, my name was drawn,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cTo be with David?\u201d I asked, nodding to myself.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cBrody, that big guy that always threw food.\u201d</p><p>My lip turned. \u201cGross.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, laughing once. \u201cI went to the locker room at lunch, but Brody wasn\u2019t there yet. So, I waited. And I was so scared I just wanted to leave.\u201d</p><p>I pictured her there in the boys\u2019 locker room, tugging her mini cheerleading skirt down her legs, shuffling her feet, checking the clock then the door. \u201cDid he chicken out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe brought friends,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>I stiffened.</p><p>\u201cThey just wanted to watch\u2014film it, you know?\u201d Emily said, barely able to control her obvious upset. \u201cI tried to back out, so they. . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey pinned her down.\u201d</p><p>I covered my mouth. \u201cWas David one of those guys?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe was in the club, but he never drew from the hat.\u201d</p><p>And I strangely felt relief.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said. \u201cI screamed and tried to fight them off. But they were too strong for me. Then, next thing I know, Brody hits the locker and your dad\u2019s there pinning him against it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dad?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThe boys scattered, and Mr Thompson wrapped me up in his jacket and took me to the office\u2014called my mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose boys got a two-week suspension,\u201d Jase said, his eyes narrowing with fury. \u201cAnd that was it. They weren\u2019t even forced to make an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey told the principal they were just kidding\u2014an April Fool\u2019s joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she believed them?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Emily nodded. \u201cJust \u201cboys being boys\u201d was what they said. But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey looked at me like I was nothing,\u201d Emily said. \u201cI think they thought that, because my name had been drawn, I wanted it or something, you know?\u201d</p><p>I could only drop my head against my fingertips, shocked but also not surprised.</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how David and I became friends.\u201d</p><p>My forehead crinkled. \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe ran up to me the next day at school and said that what happened wasn\u2019t fair. He said he\u2019d make sure those guys never touched me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to them?\u201d</p><p>Emily shrugged. \u201cBut they never touched me again.\u201d</p><p>Jase\u2019s eyes shrunk with a knowing smile.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, we started hanging out more, you know. He and I, we . . . well, we just kind of got along really well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean because you ignored all his dark ways?\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, kinda.\u201d Her gaze went distant. \u201cBut, word had gotten out that I was frigid, and people started picking on me. Those jocks were the least of my problems then, and I was even kicked out of the cheerleading squad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, lemme get this straight.\u201d I held my hand up. \u201cYou nearly get raped by a bunch of boys, and you end up the outcast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil the night of Summer\u2019s birthday party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI walked into her house, and everyone just stared at me. But . . . I always went to Summer\u2019s party. I just never even imagined I\u2019d be uninvited, you know? She was my best friend at the time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, taking her hand again.</p><p>\u201cOne of the guys told me to get out, and David comes running up, grabs my hand and says, \u2018She\u2019s with me\u2019. And that was it. That was the last time anyone ever picked on me. On Monday, at school, Summer came up and said I was back on the team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, they thought you were going out with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They knew he didn\u2019t date anyone. But they knew he was \u2018okay\u2019 with me. So they kind of had to be too, but I knew they were all faking it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you were so quick to jump on all the new kids.\u201d I nodded to myself, thinking back to our first day. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t have any real friends left?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and . . . it kind of made me latch on to David in a lot of ways, too, since he was the only one who was genuinely nice to me. Well\u2014\u201d She brushed a strand of hair from her cheek. \u201cSometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you ended up having sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She looked at Jason and they both smiled. \u201cDavid could be really horrible when he wanted. I mean, he was nice in the David-sort-of-way, but he\u2019d make me feel stupid and worthless and, for some reason, that only made me want him more.\u201d</p><p>I cringed along with her, knowing too well how easy it was to fall into that.</p><p>\u201cBad thing was, I didn\u2019t care what he did to hurt my feelings because, on the days he was nice, it far outweighed all the horrid things he said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe was traumatised by what those jocks nearly did to her, Ara,\u201d Jason said. \u201cShe had no one to talk to that even believed her, aside from David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven my own mother didn\u2019t believe me,\u201d Emily said.</p><p>\u201cThe only other person who did was your dad, Ara.\u201d</p> <p>I saw my dad\u2019s face in my mind\u2014saw the way Emily used to look at him, and it all made sense.</p><p>\u201cThings weren\u2019t good for me at home,\u201d she continued. \u201cI tried to go hang out with David as much as possible, but he likes his space, you know.\u201d</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd he had rules,\u201d she said, her thoughts making her eyes distant. \u201cI broke one of those rules, and that\u2019s what started everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat rule?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wasn't allowed to tell anyone I was at his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in case he killed her,\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Emily shivered a little, her hand tightening on mine. \u201cAnyway, one afternoon my mom got in my face about a few things, and I stormed out. She asked where I was going and, without thinking, told her I was going over to David\u2019s. But, when I got there, he was in one of his moods, as usual. And when he found out that I\u2019d told my mom where I was, he was so mad that I actually got scared. So, I left and told him I never wanted to see him again. He demanded I come back, but I didn\u2019t. Later, he showed up at my house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong story short,\u201d Jason said, \u201cEmily was his little lamb\u2014the wide-eyed innocent creature that would follow him anywhere. For her to stand up to him like that\u2014\u201d Jase shook his head, exhaling. \u201cHe needed the upper hand again. He needed control of her.\u201d</p> <p>Emily shrunk a little more. \u201cHe was my first, Ara. And I really\u2014\u201d She closed her eyes for a second, her lips turning down so deeply her chin crinkled. \u201cReally wish I could take it all back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he regret it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think he never wanted you to know?\u201d Jason said.</p><p>\u201cWas . . . did he ever plan to turn her?\u201d I asked. \u201cKnowing she\u2019d die after being bound to him.\u201d</p><p>Jason shook his head. \u201cHe\u2019s done this to so many girls, Ara. I\u2019ve lost count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEvery time he took his biannual leave, a trail of girls were left in his wake\u2014usually committing suicide within about two months of him leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you were gonna be his next tragic summer romance,\u201d Emily said. \u201cLucky for you, he fell in love with you instead.\u201d</p><p>All the pictures of my past flitted to mind, so bright with the yellow light of the sun that every breath of summer filled me with nothing but joy, suddenly dying under the rolling cloud of revelation. But I wasn\u2019t that surprised, not after everything I\u2019d learned about him since the day we met. I\u2019d seen the signs. I knew what kind of man he was. I also knew he was remorseful. Yet it hurt so deeply that he didn\u2019t tell me any of this. And I just wanted to smack him. \u201cWhy would he lie to me? I asked him directly if he\u2019d been with you. Why didn't he just tell me the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, Ara,\u201d Jason said, \u201che regrets it all so deeply he can\u2019t even say the words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moment he fell for you, all that human compassion he\u2019d pushed aside came rushing to the surface,\u201d Emily said. \u201cAnd he was dead ashamed of himself. He still is.\u201d</p><p>David\u2019s own words rang through me then, healing a small chunk of my heart, but not enough for me to forget the lies: Love me for who I am now, not what I was then. \u201cWhy is he so ashamed? Just for sleeping with you?\u201d I kind of laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re not that hideous, Emily.\u201d</p><p>She laughed too, but the smile fell away quickly and she just sat there toying with the hem of her dress. \u201cIt was more because of . . . how it happened.\u201d</p><p>My eyes flicked unconsciously onto Jason, who bit his lip. \u201cJase? How did it happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something you need to ask him,\u201d Emily cut in.</p><p>\u201cEm, you know he\u2019ll never tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll never know,\u201d she said, holding my gaze.</p><p>Jason\u2019s green eyes stood out in my peripheral, slightly warmed with a hint of a smile he could never erase, but cold with the concern he had for me right then. I held Em\u2019s gaze as long as I could, but she wasn\u2019t backing down. Whatever David did to her, she was protecting him, and I wanted to know why.</p><p>\u201cFine?\u201d I said, standing up. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me. I\u2019ll ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Jason called.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d I heard Emily say. \u201cJust let her go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut she shouldn\u2019t be near him, he might\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped listening. I just didn\u2019t care what David might do. My limbs were driven by a force much stronger than fear or curiosity; they were driven by undiluted anger\u2014years worth of lies and betrayal all rolling into one giant ball of fury.</p><p>I slept with Jase, and that was bad, yeah, but this . . . well, at least I didn\u2019t knowingly carry the lie from beginning to end.</p><p>\u201cAra?\u201d Arthur called as I passed at full human speed on the stairwell. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo find David.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in his new room. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>My fists clenched tighter by my sides. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, wait?\u201d he called, but I didn\u2019t wait. I marched step by step to the third floor and turned the corner, seeing David by the window outside his room; he stood in casual clothes with his hands in his pockets, his troubled gaze on the yard below. The afternoon sun lit his face, making his hair glow with those golden tones I\u2019d always loved, and it just made the pain go so much deeper. He\u2019d turn and look at me, maybe hear what I had to say, but his eyes would never smile at me again. I\u2019d never see love there again.</p><p>He laid something on the windowsill, looking up in shock when he saw me coming. \u201cAra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou asshole!\u201d I lashed out to slap him across the face, but he spun and grabbed my wrist before contact, hooking his foot under my ankle to flip me onto the floor at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Ara?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d I wriggled out of his grip. \u201cI'm so mad at you. You looked me in the eye, and you lied to me.\u201d</p><p>He stood back, his eyes shrinking, focusing then smiling as realisation flooded through him. \u201cHurts, doesn't it?\u201d</p><p>I hugged my knee to my chest. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I'm glad they told you. I'm glad it\u2019s out now, and it couldn\u2019t have come at better time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you deserve to suffer. What I did was a long time ago. I never even knew you then, so you have no right to comment. But what you did, well\u2014\u201d He shook his head. \u201cYou pretty much deserve to burn in hell, you worthless little whore.\u201d</p><p>I looked up quickly into his icy green eyes. \u201cHow can you say that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy. I have absolutely no care anymore for how you feel.\u201d He jammed his hands in his pockets, rocking back on his heels. \u201cIt\u2019s rather liberating, really.\u201d</p><p>I made myself smaller.</p><p>\u201cOh, get up.\u201d He dragged me to stand. \u201cDon't sit there and wallow in it. No one\u2019s going to care.\u201d</p><p>I jerked my arm from his grip. \u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. People do care about me, David. Some of them care no matter what mistakes I\u2019ve made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess they\u2019re the fools then, aren't they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I turned away. \u201cThey\u2019re ones worthy of my love in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t know that was possible,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>My footsteps halted. I spun slowly around and marched back up to him. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re a jerk, and the truth is, I do have a right to be hurt about what you did to Emily\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Emily?\u201d he cut in. \u201cYou mean with Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean to. Because I don\u2019t think it was consensual. The way she talked about it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d He grabbed my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you ask that?\u201d I peeled his fingers off me. \u201cIf it was mutual, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I raped her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot raped her.\u201d I held his gaze. \u201cI know you, and despite you having been this monster in your past, I would never label you something horrid. But I don\u2019t believe she wanted to do it wholeheartedly. And I don\u2019t believe you cared all that much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t really care what you think.\u201d He gazed out the window again, severing the conversation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my opinion that matters here, David. It\u2019s the facts. You used her. You took her virginity so you could control her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I did. So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad you told me you slept with her before we started dating, I would have been okay with it. I would have,\u201d I repeated when he grunted. \u201cHad you told me you forced her so you could make her do whatever you wanted. . .\u201d I took a few steps away from him. \u201cI would\u2019ve avoided you like the plague.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d I added, my lip lifting in disgust. \u201cAnd everything you\u2019ve done\u2014the way you\u2019ve acted since I told you the truth about Jason and I, has only proven to me that nothing about that monster you were back then has really changed. And a part of me, David\u2014\u201d I looked him in the eye for a very long moment, \u201c\u2014is glad you broke it off with me, because I can\u2019t stand to look at you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet back here, Ara!\u201d he yelled as I walked away. \u201cAra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave me alone,\u201d I muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t ever talk to me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He grabbed my arm and spun me around. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t end like this. You don\u2019t get to walk away and think whatever you want about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I tired to pull free but he wouldn't let me. \u201cBecause you want the upper hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou swore to me, Ara, that you would love me no matter what; that you would not look at the things I\u2019d done in my past and judge me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you swore to love and honour me, too, David. But as soon as that love was tested, as soon as I told you one of my dark truths, you threw that in my face. You didn\u2019t even try to understand. In fact, you\u2019re going as far as to have me punished for it. But what do I get to do? How do I get to free myself from the anger I feel for the lies you told me\u2014repeatedly? I never looked you in the eye and told you I hadn\u2019t slept with Jason. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, worse, you just kept it from me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t keep it from you,\u201d I yelled, shocking David a bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it\u2019d happened. And if I had, I would\u2019ve told you immediately after.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t. You went to the lighthouse. You took your problems there, and you were careless. You let yourself fall, and I don\u2019t think it was an accident. I think you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Jumped?\u201d I laughed like that was ludicrous.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have saved you, you know,\u201d he said quietly, looking out the window again. \u201cIf I\u2019d known then, I would have drowned you myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, I can\u2019t comment on you sleeping with Emily, but it\u2019s okay for you to say you\u2019d kill me\u2014it\u2019s okay for you to hurt me, torture me because I had another man inside me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just another man, Ara! My own brother\u2014someone I\u2019ve hated all my life. How could you? How could you stand the feel of him between your legs? How could you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not as repulsive to me as he is to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what?\u201d I threw my hands up. \u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. I can\u2019t undo it, and I don\u2019t have to put up with you being an asshole to me. I did wrong. Yes. I deserve to lose my marriage. Yes. But I do not deserve to have you in my face reminding me of that mistake every day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you admit it?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, what is your problem? Do you really think I lay awake at night reliving it like some fantasy I wish I could repeat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you clearly don\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs recent events would indicate.\u201d</p><p>I let the silence hang for a second. But I always let him have the last word. And it just wasn\u2019t good enough anymore. \u201cI won\u2019t be the victim, you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means I won\u2019t put up with you taking your anger out on me anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one said you had to.\u201d He graced me with some eye contact then. \u201cBut you can\u2019t expect me to be civil to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can,\u201d I said, for once feeling strong enough to stand up to him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to love me. Hell, you don\u2019t even have to like me, but you will respect me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then let me rephrase that.\u201d He stepped into my territorial bubble, his height suddenly intimidating. \u201cIf you think, for one second, that I\u2019m going to be anything but cruel to you, do anything but torture you for the rest of my days, you\u2019ve got a lot of learning to do. And since the only way you ever learn, Ara-Rose, is the hard way\u2014\u201d He smiled malevolently. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d I said, taking another step back. \u201cI had no idea just how deep your darkness went. You\u2019re like a spiteful little girl. And I know it\u2019s because you\u2019re hurt.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI get that. But what you\u2019re showing me right now, David, is that you still love m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove?\u201d He slowly cupped both my arms and walked me back toward the wall. \u201cIs it love when a man lies awake in his bed at night, comforted by the horrid acts he could perform on a girl\u2019s body? Is it love when he finds himself standing over her with a dagger in his hand while she\u2019s sleeping? Is it love when he contemplates throwing her to a pack of rabid prisoners and watching them defile her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did to Pepper?\u201d I spat.</p> <p>His eyes widened, the contents of his stomach seeming to come up in his throat until he swallowed them down, gripping my arms so tight my fingers went numb.</p><p>I tried to count backward in my head, to go back in time and just stop myself from saying that. I\u2019d wanted to hurt him, but the pain I saw eat his soul then just wasn\u2019t worth it. It was childish and stupid. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, David. I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d</p><p>He was frozen, though, his fingers locked onto my arms like a cursed statue.</p><p>\u201cDavid, please. You\u2019re hurting me.\u201d</p><p>My back pressed more firmly into the wall with each second passing, the plaster dipping under my weight, but he didn\u2019t back down. The anger in him was growing\u2014flashes of Pepper\u2019s suffering flickering in his thoughts for me to see. I closed my eyes, turning my head to block them out, but they were there, and they were too real: her golden hair, turned almost orange with blood, her face mashed into the dirt floor under her naked body, her eyes catching David\u2019s as the fat, dirty man pinning her down entered her, tearing her so deeply she screamed for her beloved. But he just stood there, pinned back by the guards, frozen by a veil of knowledge mixed with shock that he couldn\u2019t lift\u2014couldn\u2019t escape long enough to find some common sense and free her.</p><p>The man entered her again, but she looked away this time, ashamed, hiding her face. She knew David wouldn\u2019t help her. She didn\u2019t care that he clearly couldn't, all she knew was that he wouldn\u2019t. And she hated him then.</p><p>She dug her fingernails into the earth and just held her breath\u2014lying there and letting them punish her, crying only his name and the sobbing remnant of the word \u2018why.\u2019</p><p>As the replay stopped and the rushing of wind in my ears and the echo of her haunted screams died down, the day around me returned. I looked up at David, seeing tears in his eyes for the first time since he learned what I did to betray him.</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing of what Pepper suffered,\u201d he said in an eerily calm voice, and let go of my arms, pulling me up off the wall just a little first.</p><p>\u201cDav\u2014\u201d I started, but he walked away, ignoring me. Fear kept me where I stood, fighting the voice in my head that told me to run after him. Everything I said\u2014everything\u2014was the hurt in me talking. And I regretted it deeply, all of it. Especially saying I would never have loved him if I\u2019d known what he did to Emily. I didn\u2019t mean that. I felt it at the time, but I didn\u2019t really mean it.</p><p>I swore then, that no matter what he did next to make me suffer, I would never stoop to that level again, never say anything I knew would kill him inside. He wasn\u2019t the monster anymore. I was.</p><p>And that was all I needed to move my feet. I darted after him, blocking his path on the narrow stairwell, both my arms reaching across to either side of the railing. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, get out of my way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You need to listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you have to say is of any consequence to me. You wanted me to leave you alone, never talk to you again, well . . . you got your wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want, David. I was angry. And I\u2019m so sorry for what I said about Pepper.\u201d</p><p>His glassy green eyes softened a little then as he saw the truth deep inside me. \u201cThat will never suffice, Ara. You knew, before you said that, the extent of the damage it would do. So don\u2019t try to take it back now.\u201d</p><p>I crossed my hands over my heart, guilt eating it up until I couldn\u2019t feel it beat anymore.</p><p>\u201cNow, get out of my way before I do something to hurt you,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of you, David. I know you won\u2019t hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know nothing about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I faced him as he pushed past. \u201cI know you\u2019re ashamed of what you did to Emily.\u201d</p><p>The vampire in him surfaced, stopping him in his tracks, changing the way he held himself. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed, Ara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are.\u201d</p><p>He turned slowly and walked back up the stairs, stopping on the one just above me.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me why you never talked about it with me, David\u2014why, even after I asked you, you lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur marriage is over. You deserve no explanation from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He went to walk past again. \u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed his arm. \u201cI do, David, because, despite what I\u2019ve done wrong, I married you. We shared a life together and I am the mother of your child. You do owe me an explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet away from me,\u201d he yelled. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to explain.\u201d</p><p>I blocked his path again. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere until you answer me.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at me, a little surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re really not going to let this go, are you?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He leaned on the wall and folded his arms. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you because, when we first met, you and Emily were already friends, and I never planned to be with you past the summer. When that changed, it was too late to tell you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d have gone crazy, Ara. You\u2019d never have trusted me after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I would have, David. I would\u2019ve trusted you more knowing you would always tell me the truth\u2014even if I didn't like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bull crap, Ara. You would\u2019ve hated me\u2014left me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I jerked forward. \u201cDavid, you know me! Look at me. Look at who I am inside,\u201d I said, tapping my chest. \u201cEven if you\u2019d slept with her while we were together, you know I\u2019d have found it in my heart to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh!\u201d he scoffed, looking away.</p><p>\u201cDavid.\u201d I touched his wrist and he looked back at me. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>His folded arms dropped slowly to his sides. He couldn\u2019t deny the truth in that statement. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I should've told you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Those words moved in through my ears and made everything in me feel warm and kind of renewed, taking the anger and diluting it until it was nothing. \u201cI forgive you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t need my forgiveness, but . . . you and Em, it\u2019s in the past, David, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra.\u201d He stopped me. \u201cDon\u2019t say that until you know the full story.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cWhen I decided to be with you, I accepted you then for everything you were and had been in your past. Good or bad. I can\u2019t take that back now just because I find out that you\u2019ve done something you\u2019re not proud of. You didn\u2019t rape her. You might not have been what she wanted her first to be, but I know you\u2019re good inside, David, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it, Ara. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>My mouth stayed open, still shaped to my last word.</p><p>\u201cShe cried,\u201d he started, shifting awkwardly to a new position. \u201cShe said it hurt, and I just rolled her over and told her to shut up\u2014hid her face because I didn\u2019t wanna see her tears.\u201d</p><p>And with his words came images, ones I made up in my own mind. \u201cDid she ask you to stop?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI told her the pain was normal for the first time. But it wasn\u2019t. If I\u2019d been gentle . . . if I\u2019d. . .\u201d He folded the back of his hand to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d been like you were with me.\u201d</p><p>A quick memory lit his thoughts up\u2014of he and I in my room\u2014our first time, and he smiled, shaking his head until a frown came over like a grey cloud. \u201cI hurt her, and I made her feel ashamed of herself, made her feel like she was worth nothing to anyone. And, the worst part was, Ara, I just didn\u2019t care.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you had no human compassion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t. Which made being friends with her after the compassion set in really hard. So hard I . . . I just wanted to forget it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny, I\u2019d kinda like to forget it, too.\u201d I rubbed my head as if I could erase the last hour of my life.</p> <p>David laughed. It was so nice to hear that laugh again. \u201cPerhaps we can all just move past it, then.\u201d</p><p>I lowered my hand to my side and nodded up at the king. \u201cI\u2019m not sure Mike will feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>Reality moved back in to this vortex we\u2019d stepped in then, and everything crappy my life had become in the last week surfaced again. David breathed out through his nose, accepting that fact and many others that had changed his life lately, too. \u201cI have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid, wait.\u201d I went to grab him, but he tugged away.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t, Ara. You know about Emily now, and it\u2019s very kind of you to say you forgive me, but...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNothing has changed. I still hate you. I\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, I need to discuss something else with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it had better be some royal matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a royal matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen make it quick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the king and queen.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were on something other than me, but I caught the slightest glimpse of a half smile as he shook his head. \u201cVery well. What is it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just wanted you to know that . . . Jason asked me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondered how long that would take.\u201d He huffed, clearly not surprised.</p><p>I let silence own the moment for a second, waiting to see if he\u2019d ask what my response was.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to ask, Ara,\u201d he said, stealing that thought. \u201cYou\u2019re not wearing a ring. Clearly, you declined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now,\u201d I said, leaving it at that.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>I toyed nervously with the key on my necklace. \u201cIt means that . . . one day, I\u2019ll probably say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne day, huh?\u201d He folded his arms again.</p> <p>\u201cIf he keeps asking, and I\u2019m still single . . . yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this some kind of prompt to force me into begging you to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, David, it\u2019s not.\u201d I raised a hand to shut him up. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to hear it along the grapevine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen consider me informed.\u201d He bowed, turning away.</p><p>\u201cSo, you don\u2019t care if I marry him?\u201d I called.</p><p>He stopped at the base of the stairs, eyeing a man in his peripheral until he passed out of sight. \u201cFrankly, I have no opinion. I never could stop you from doing stupid things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would it be stupid?\u201d I walked a few steps downward. \u201cIf he loves me and I love him, why\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, throwing his hands up. \u201cGuess it makes perfect sense. I hope you\u2019re both happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I want you to say, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen, what, Ara?\u201d He turned back to face me. \u201cWhadda you want me to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to tell me not to. I want you tell me that you still love me enough that, one day, even years from now, you might forgive me for what I did.\u201d</p><p>He just laughed. \u201cThat will never happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You forgave Arietta when she betrayed her husband\u2014with your uncle.\u201d</p><p>I could see his eyes narrow as he calculated a response. But what could he say to that? \u201cWell, Arietta wasn\u2019t my wife. Had she been, she would have suffered the same fate Victor served.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that,\u201d I called, running after him. \u201cDavid, please tell me you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAra, just back off!\u201d He shoved my hand off his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve put me in a corner here. I don\u2019t want to hurt you, but if you don\u2019t leave me the hell alone, I cannot be held responsible for what I might do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you are angry then?\u201d I refused to step back, despite his body language warning me to move. \u201cAbout the proposal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, when are you going learn, Ara?\u201d He pushed past and headed back up the stairs.</p><p>I followed. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone until I get some kind of communication breakthrough with you, David. You can\u2019t just shut down and refuse to discuss things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd which scroll states that law?\u201d he asked, walking away almost faster than I could keep up.</p><p>\u201cNot everything is about the law. Maybe it\u2019s just wrong to end a marriage and never give the other person a chance to have their say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I, Ara?\u201d He spun back, barring me with his cold stare. \u201cYou talk things through with someone when you want peace, want to sort things out. But I don\u2019t care what you have to say. Nothing will ever make me want to forgive you. Nothing will ever make what you did okay, not on any level. We can never be friends again, Ara. We can never even be in the same room without me wanting to strangle you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how you really feel.\u201d I moved between him and the path to his room. \u201cYou want to break me down emotionally, but you won\u2019t put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you know that, Ara, if you\u2019re so sure of that, then why keep pushing me?\u201d He tried to move past me again but I blocked him. \u201cWhy torture me by giving me no way out of this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s no other way I can make you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want that? Why would you want to talk when you know how much I hate you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m hoping I can change your mind\u2014hoping the David I love is still in there and that you\u2019ll see I\u2019m still the girl you love, that I just made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will not ever happen, Ara,\u201d he said stiffly, and for the first time, something about the way he said that made me truly believe him.</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s just it, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, his shoulders dropping with relief. \u201cSo just leave me alone and let me get on with my life, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I said, and watched him disappear into his bedroom, wishing I\u2019d never come up here to talk with him. That brief moment where we spoke as equals would forever be the little piece of hope I held onto that prevented me from truly moving on. I knew that. We\u2019d survived torture, separation, immortality and heartbreak, but I was beginning to think maybe it was time for me to admit that we couldn\u2019t survive the damage done deeper than skin\u2014leaving the heart scarred and unidentifiable as what it once was.</p><p>I wandered over to the windowsill to watch the night rising, and a glimmer of light, just a flash in the corner of my eye, caught my attention, stopping my footsteps. There, settled on the white oak sill was a tiny gold band, turning orange under the evening sun: my wedding band\u2014the one David ripped from my finger.</p><p>I picked it up and angled it to the sky, catching the first star of the evening within the golden circle. All my wishes had come true with this little gold band, and it all had come undone so easily with just one mistake.</p><p>Just one night of letting my heart run free.</p><p>But, although I wished I could take back the argument I had with David, I no longer wanted to take back what I did with Jase, no longer wished it hadn\u2019t happened. For the first time since I moved to my dad\u2019s and started my first day of school, I felt alive and free. I knew who I was, where I belonged in the world, and I didn\u2019t need anyone: not David, not Jase, not even my dad, to make me feel safe, or like I deserved to be here. I made mistakes, and I still had a lot of learning to do, but I was strong, and learned fast, and no matter what anyone thought of me now, I knew I deserved to be alive. And I deserved to be happy.</p><p>I turned and walked away then, taking the stairs to the second floor, back to my life, leaving the past, and the ring, behind on the windowsill where David had. I wasn\u2019t sure anymore what tomorrow would bring, or if I\u2019d ever talk to him again the way we had on the stairs just now, but one thing I did know was that his absence from my life would no longer make or break me. I didn\u2019t need him anymore to know who I was. I didn\u2019t need him anymore to be okay. I was finally free. Finally, just me. </p> </body></html>"]
