Lost somewhere in the alley where</p><p>that bastard had tried to rape her as \u201cdown payment\u201d on the protection money her family refused to pay.</p> <p>Something fluttered over her shoulders and was tucked around her, warm and thick. A blanket. She gripped it tight, then winced as her bloodied palms made contact with the wool. Her hands spasmed open. Released, the blanket began to slide to the floor of the large paramedic van.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d Following the deep voice, she blinked into a face she didn\u2019t know. The changeling who\u2019d thrown her attacker against the wall had been blond and blue-eyed, reminding her of the cocky youth of her younger brother, Ken. This man . . . he was hewn out of rougher material, his jaw shadowed, his eyes the rich amber shade of aged whiskey, his hair thick and dark, a hundred shades of brown and gold intertwined. \u201cCome on, sweetheart, speak to me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, tried to find words but they lost their way in the chaos of her brain, leaving her dumb. Instead, her mind filled with the terror of the lifetime she\u2019d spent in that alley only minutes from her family home, in one of the streets surrounding the bustle of Chinatown. It had taken mere seconds for</p><p>everything to change. One moment she was smiling, and the next, her excitement at finishing her final night class had given way to pain and shock as he hit and pawed\u2014</p><p>A smooth burst of Mandarin, so unexpected, so welcome that it broke through the haze of pain and fear. She looked up again, astonished. This man, this stranger was speaking to her in the language of her grandmother, asking her if she was okay. She nodded, found the words to say, \u201cI speak English.\u201d</p> <p>She rarely had to say that. Unlike her half-Caucasian mother, Ria had inherited little from her grandmother but her bones. Her hair was stick-straight, but a dark brown instead of jet black. Her eyes were faintly almond-shaped, but only if someone was really looking. She\u2019d gotten the majority of her features from her brown-haired, brown-eyed All-American father.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, darling?\u201d A hand cupping her cheek.</p><p>She flinched, but this hand, though big, was gentle. And patient. She relaxed into the warmth after long minutes, reassured by the calluses that spoke of a man accustomed to working with his hands. \u201cRia. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett,\u201d he said, his voice holding nothing of laughter. \u201cAnd I\u2019m in charge of you.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed, the real Ria fighting her way through the fog of shock. \u201cWho\u2019re you to be in charge of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m big, I\u2019m strong, and I\u2019m pissed as hell that someone dared touch a woman on my watch.\u201d</p> <p>She blinked. \u201cYour watch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDorian\u2019s part of my team,\u201d he said, nodding to the blond man who\u2019d turned her attacker into a sack of broken bones. \u201cWish he hadn\u2019t done such a</p><p>good job\u2014I would\u2019ve liked to bloody the piece of shit myself.\u201d</p><p>Ria wasn\u2019t used to violence, but she knew without a doubt that this man was a changeling, that he could turn into a leopard with a single thought\u2014and that the leopard had no problem with the most brutal kind of justice. When she looked into his eyes, she saw rage . . . and the flickers of something that wasn\u2019t quite human. \u201cHe can\u2019t hurt me.\u201d Somehow, she found herself trying to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cBut he did.\u201d An implacable statement. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to sniff out the nest this little viper came from no matter what.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at her assailant\u2019s unconscious body. He was alive, barely. But he wouldn\u2019t be talking for a while yet. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t working alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndications are he\u2019s with a new gang.\u201d Emmett tucked her blanket gently around her feet when it came loose. \u201cDark-River\u2019s done a hell of a lot of work to clear the city of this kind of scum, but sometimes, they pop back up.\u201d</p><p>Ria knew of DarkRiver. Who didn\u2019t? The leopard pack, based in the Yosemite forest, had claimed San Francisco as part of their territory when Ria had been a child\u2014no other predatory changelings could enter the city without their permission.</p> <p>But in the past few years, they\u2019d gone further and begun to wipe out human predators, too.</p><p>\u201cI can tell you a little about him,\u201d she said, her voice gaining strength on a cresting wave of anger. \u201cHe came to my mother\u2019s shop, left an account</p><p>number where she was supposed to wire \u2018protection\u2019 money. We thought he was just another thug.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get the number from you tomorrow. Right now, you need to be seen to.\u201d Sliding one muscular arm under her legs, he curved the other around her back, just below her shoulders, and scooped her up before she knew what was happening.</p><p>She gave a startled cry.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t drop you.\u201d A soothing murmur as he shifted her deeper into the van. \u201cJust getting you out of the wind.\u201d</p><p>She should\u2019ve protested, but she was tired and achy and he was so warm. Resting her head against his heart when he sat down with her in his arms,</p><p>she breathed deep. Her body sighed. He smelled good. All hot and male and real, his after-shave something clean and fresh. Though he clearly needed to shave more than once a day. His jaw rasped against her hair as he settled her more firmly on his lap. Not that she minded, she thought, her eyes</p><p>fluttering shut.</p><p>Emmett stroked his hand over the hair of the mink in his arms. She was a little thing, and right now, she was at the end of her resources. Enraged at the thought that someone had dared harm her, he held her with conscious gentleness until he felt her begin to relax. When she sighed and snuggled closer, the leopard in him gave a pleased growl\u2014right as Dorian looked into the van.</p><p>The blond soldier nodded at Ria. \u201cShe okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are the paramedics?\u201d Emmett snarled.</p><p>\u201cWith the piece of shit.\u201d Dorian shrugged. \u201cI should\u2019ve killed him.\u201d</p><p>The feral part of Emmett wanted to tell the man to go out there and finish the job, but he forced himself to think past the leopard\u2019s need to maul and tear.</p><p>\u201cWe need any information he can give us on the Crew, so let\u2019s hope he can talk later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is when a Psy would come in handy,\u201d Dorian muttered, referring to the psychic race that was the third part of the triumvirate that was their world.</p><p>\u201cOne of the telepaths could rip the information right from the bastard\u2019s head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guys are gruesome,\u201d said a drowsy feminine voice.</p><p>Emmett looked down to find Ria\u2019s eyes closed. \u201cYeah, we are.\u201d But he had a feeling she was already asleep, her lashes dark-moon crescents against</p><p>skin so creamy, he wanted to taste it. Returning his attention to Dorian through sheer force of will, he said, \u201cDid you find any emergency contact details in her wallet?\u201d He\u2019d left the young soldier to handle that while he took care of Ria.</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014parents are on their way.\u201d Dorian\u2019s smile was sharp. \u201cHer daddy sounds like he\u2019s itching for a fight, so maybe you shouldn\u2019t look at her that way.</p><p>\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind your own fucking business.\u201d He tightened his hold.</p><p>Raising his hands, Dorian backed off, laughing. \u201cHey, your funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo get a paramedic here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think Tammy just arrived\u2014she can stitch up your girl.\u201d</p><p>The DarkRiver healer popped into the van on the heels of Dorian\u2019s statement. \u201cLet me have a look at her,\u201d she said in a soft voice, putting her kit on the floor.</p><p>Ria\u2019s eyes snapped open at the other woman\u2019s first touch. Emmett ran a hand down her back in reassurance. \u201cRia, this is Tamsyn, our healer. You can trust her.\u201d To his leopard\u2019s delight, he felt her body relax almost at once.</p><p>\u201cCall me Tammy.\u201d Tamsyn smiled. \u201cEveryone does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you,\u201d Ria said an instant later. \u201cYou bought a chunk of jade from my mom\u2019s store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex is your mom?\u201d Tammy smiled at Ria\u2019s nod. \u201cI told her I needed something to threaten my mate with when he got blockheaded, and she said, why</p><p>not a block for a block?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds more like my grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Tammy grinned. \u201cAll women sound like their mothers after a certain age.\u201d A wink.</p><p>Ria found herself smiling despite herself. \u201cThen I\u2019m doomed.\u201d She held out her hands for Tammy to clean. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually really hurt anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, let me see. You got this falling on your hands?\u201d Tammy was cleaning the dirt and debris from the wounds as she spoke.</p><p>Ria nodded, wincing at the sting of the antiseptic. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>The healer looked at her now clean palms. \u201cNo cuts that need stitching,\u201d the gorgeous brunette murmured. \u201cLet me look at your face, sweetheart.\u201d Her hands were incredibly competent and careful, for all that she looked like a fashion model, with her height and her elegant bones.</p><p>Ria had always wanted to be tall. That was the one thing she hadn\u2019t inherited from her father.</p><p>Instead, she was stuck with her mother\u2019s diminutive height</p><p>\u2014but not Alex\u2019s naturally slender body. No, Ria had gotten stuck with short and \u201ccurvy.\u201d</p><p>Hah, more like generously padded. Her mother ate six dumplings in a row and had room for more. Ria ate three and put on five pounds.</p><p>\u201cYou asleep?\u201d It was a rumble against her ear.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAwake.\u201d Sort of.</p><p>\u201cYour face is going to bruise some,\u201d Tamsyn told her, \u201cbut there\u2019s no permanent damage.\u201d</p><p>She soothed something over the skin. \u201cThis\u2019ll help keep the bruising down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cXie xie.\u201d It came out automatically, a response to this healer\u2019s touch. Tamsyn had hands like her grandmother. Caring hands. Trustworthy hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d A smile she could hear though her eyes were closed. \u201cEmmett, you need to leave us alone for a few minutes.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She felt the big body around hers tense. Forcing open her lids, she patted him on the chest, not quite sure where she found the courage. The leopard</p><p>changelings were lethal when roused. But, in spite of the fierce scowl on his face, she had a feeling this cat would never hurt her. \u201cI\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTammy,\u201d Emmett argued, scowl darkening even further, \u201cshe\u2019s half asleep.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI need to ask her some personal questions,\u201d Tamsyn said in that calm, capable voice, \u201cso I can see if she needs any other meds.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s fuzzy brain cleared. \u201cHe didn\u2019t get that far. Just knocked me around some.\u201d</p><p>A growl filled the air. She jolted upright, heart thudding at a hundred miles an hour. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett.\u201d</p><p>Blinking at Tammy\u2019s tone, she glanced at the man who held her. \u201cYou?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am a leopard,\u201d he said, as if surprised by her surprise.</p><p>\u201cForget him,\u201d Tamsyn said, catching Ria\u2019s gaze as she disinfected the scratches on her knees. \u201cYou sure about what happened, kitten? No one\u2019s going to judge you.\u201d</p><p>It was impossible not to trust this woman. \u201cI threw my handbag at him, kneed him in the balls.</p><p>After that, he was more interested in hurting me than . . .</p><p>you know.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn nodded. \u201cAlright, then. But if you ever need to talk, you call me.\u201d She slid a card into the giant handbag someone had retrieved and put in the</p> <p>ambulance while Ria hadn\u2019t been looking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u201d Ria began when there was a commotion outside.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my daughter? You! Where is she? Tell me right now or I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom.\u201d Ria felt tears rise for the first time as her mother entered the ambulance, pushing Tammy out of the way as if the other woman wasn\u2019t stronger and taller.</p><p>\u201cMy baby.\u201d Alex patted her all over, kissing her forehead with a mother\u2019s tender warmth.</p><p>\u201cThat piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Her mother never swore. When Ria\u2019s grandmother was feeling wicked, she called Alex a \u201ctightass\u201d simply to see her explode\u2014her</p><p>grandmother was a firecracker.</p> <p>\u201cYou!\u201d Alex fixed a gimlet eye on Emmett. \u201cWhy do you have your hands on my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Those hands cuddled her even closer. \u201cI\u2019m looking after her.\u201d</p><p>Alex huffed. \u201cDidn\u2019t look after her very well, did you? She got attacked right here, almost on the main road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom,\u201d Ria said, intending to stop the diatribe, when Emmett calmly nodded and said, \u201cIt was my fault. I\u2019ll fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was not your fault,\u201d Ria said, but no one was listening to her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Alex turned back to Ria. \u201cYour grandmother\u2019s waiting for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you manage to make her wait at home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her you\u2019d want her special jasmine tea when you got back.\u201d</p><p>Emmett had grown up in a strong and vibrant pack. He\u2019d figured he could handle Ria\u2019s family. That was before he met her grandmother. Five feet nothing of pure fury and a tightly held rage that was all the more impressive for its control. Ria came first, of course. Emmett would\u2019ve allowed noth-Ria came first, of course. Emmett would\u2019ve allowed nothing less, even if her grandmother hadn\u2019t ordered him to carry Ria\u2014who was protesting that she could \u201cwalk, for goodness sake\u201d\u2014into what looked like the grandmother\u2019s bedroom, so she could wash up and change. Soon as he\u2019d completed that task, he was</p><p>banished to the kitchen to wait.</p><p>Ria\u2019s father was still at the site, being restrained from giving the near-dead attacker even more of a beating. So was Ria\u2019s older brother. Which left him in the kitchen with Ria\u2019s mom and sister-in-law. Alex and Amber looked more like sisters than anything else. Ria\u2019s mom was a pretty woman, petite and</p><p>graceful. Amber was cut in the same mold\u2014even heavily pregnant as she was now, her features were delicate, her arms slimly fragile.</p><p>Emmett stayed very carefully in the chair where he\u2019d been ordered to sit. He was afraid he\u2019d break one of them if he accidentally touched them. Now</p><p>Ria, Ria he wanted to handle.</p><p>\u201cDrink!\u201d Something slammed in front of him.</p><p>He looked down at the puddle of jasmine tea around his little cup and decided not to mention Alex\u2019s temper. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t see it?\u201d She poked him in the shoulder. \u201cYou, the way you look at my baby?\u201d</p><p>Nobody dared attack Emmett. He wasn\u2019t one of the more volatile leopards in DarkRiver, but he was beyond dangerous when riled. And wouldn\u2019t all his</p><p>trainees just love to see him now, not daring to lift a finger for fear of bruising Alex. \u201cHow do I look at her?\u201d</p><p>Alex narrowed her eyes. \u201cLike a big cat with its food.\u201d She hooked her hands into claws and made as if she was shoving others aside. \u201cLike that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a problem with every man who wants to date my daughter.\u201d With that, Alex turned and walked back to the counter. \u201cAnd her father, he has twice the problem.\u201d</p><p>Emmett wondered if Alex expected that to scare him off. \u201cI grew up in a pack.\u201d He was used to nosy packmates, snarling fathers, ferally protective</p><p>mothers.</p><p>Amber smiled when Alex sniffed and turned away. \u201cThey have problems with women, too,\u201d</p><p>she said in a mock-whisper. \u201cWhen I started dating Jet, Alex told me if I broke his heart, she\u2019d beat me with a rolling pin.\u201d</p><p>Alex waved the very same implement in Amber\u2019s direction. \u201cDon\u2019t you forget it.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Amber hugged Alex. \u201cShe\u2019s okay, Mom. Ria will bounce back\u2014better than you or I ever would.\u201d</p><p>That was when Ria\u2019s male relatives returned. Her father\u2019s first question was, \u201cWho the hell is he?\u201d</p><p>TWO</p><p>Ria sat back in the bubble bath her grandmother had drawn and sighed.</p><p>A light knock came moments later.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Popo.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother came in. Though tiny, with a face that bore the million marks of a life well-lived, her stride was steady and her eyes clear. Miaoling Olivier had a whole heap of decades left in her yet, as she liked to say. Now, she walked in and took a seat on the closed lid of the toilet as Ria\u2019s father began yelling in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Miaoling said, rolling her eyes. \u201cSometimes, I think we accidentally opened our home to the inmates of an insane asylum.\u201d</p><p>Ria felt her lips twitch, her eyes water. \u201cThey\u2019re just angry and scared for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart girl.\u201d Reaching over, her grandmother took one of Ria\u2019s ravaged palms and brought it to her mouth.</p><p>The kiss was soft, loving. It healed Ria from the inside out. \u201cI love you, Popo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know,\u201d Miaoling said, \u201cyou\u2019re the only one who calls me that. Ken and Jet both say nana.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re not your favorites and I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d Miaoling\u2019s eyes twinkled as she put Ria\u2019s hand back down on the edge of the bath.</p><p>\u201cDid you thank the young man who found you? Maybe you</p><p>should bake him a cake.\u201d</p><p>That made Ria smile. \u201cNot interested,\u201d she told her ever-hopeful grandmother. \u201cHe\u2019s a little too beautiful for me.\u201d The blond DarkRiver male was clearly a highly trained member of the pack, but slender, looked more like a teenage surfer than a grown man. Emmett on the other hand . . .</p><p>Her grandmother sighed. \u201cYou go on like this, your female parts will dry up.\u201d</p><p>Ria snorted with laughter. \u201cPopo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I say only the truth.\u201d Miaoling\u2019s speech shifted, going from Harvard-perfect English to a rhythm she only ever used with those she was</p><p>comfortable with. \u201cYour age, I had your mother on the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTimes have changed\u2014and I\u2019m twenty-two, hardly shriveled up.\u201d She rested her head against the wall. \u201cTell me how you met Grandfather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You know that already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d The story comforted her, and right now, she needed comforting.</p><p>\u201cAlright, for my Ri-ri.\u201d A deep breath. \u201cI was living on a farm in Henan Province and my family was trying to arrange my marriage. But, ai, I was a terrible one. I wouldn\u2019t marry any of the boys they brought around\u2014too skinny, too fat, too stupid, too tied to his mama\u2019s apron strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let you get away with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only girl after three boys. I was spoiled.\u201d Said with a fond smile. \u201cThen one day, my father comes home and says, Miaoling, today you dress nice, American doctor is coming to the village to check old people\u2019s eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCataracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My father says, maybe crazy American will want crazy Chinese wife who doesn\u2019t listen to anyone. Of course, that makes me want to not like</p><p>American at all.\u201d</p><p>Ria giggled, as drawn into the story as she\u2019d been as a child. \u201cThen Grandfather came to the house for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wore brown dress, ugly brown dress, with ugly brown shoes.\u201d Her grandmother\u2019s hand stroked over Ria\u2019s hair, hair that Miaoling had once said held the silk of China but the lush chocolate shade of an entirely different culture. \u201cBut he\u2019s so handsome. Pretty green eyes, yellow hair. And he\u2019s nice. He laughs at me silently all night across the dinner table. He knows what I\u2019m up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he asked you to marry him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter one week. And crazy Miaoling said yes, and we came to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo quick,\u201d Ria said, shaking her head. \u201cWeren\u2019t you scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPah, why scared? When in love, no scared. Only impatient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Popo!\u201d</p><p>But it was too late. \u201cImpatient to use woman parts!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emmett hid his grin in his jasmine tea.

No wonder Ria\u2019s grandfather had married her.</p><p>Glancing up, he caught Alex\u2019s expression as her husband folded her into his arms.

She\u2019s taken.\u201d</p> <p>Emmett raised an eyebrow. \u201cShe\u2019s not wearing a ring.\u201d And if some moron had been stupid enough not to claim her when he\u2019d had the chance, that</p><p>wasn\u2019t Emmett\u2019s problem.</p><p>\u201cShe will,\u201d Simon said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends with Tom\u2019s family, the Clarks, for years. The marriage proposal is a formality.\u201d</p><p>Emmett could hear Ria and her grandmother even now, giggling in the bathroom. Neither of them had mentioned this Tom in their discussion of utilizing</p><p>\u201cwoman parts.\u201d The leopard gave a feline grin of satisfaction, though the man kept his face expressionless. \u201cI have a feeling that nothing is a given with your daughter\u2014she\u2019ll make her own choices.\u201d Of course, he had every intention of making sure she chose him, but no need to tell her parents that. Not yet.</p> <p>Two hours later, after a quick meeting with the DarkRiver alpha and a number of other soldiers, Emmett rubbed at gritty eyes as he accepted the beer Nathan threw him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to head home, get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a few minutes to relax,\u201d the sentinel\u2014one of the pack\u2019s highest-ranking soldiers\u2014told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve been taut as a bow all night. Everything go</p><p>okay with the girl who was attacked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Emmett had no intention of discussing Ria further with anyone. Not tonight. \u201cWhat was that Luc was saying about the Psy?\u201d Changeling</p><p>concerns rarely intersected with those of the unemotional psychic race, but from what he\u2019d caught tonight, it might in this case.</p><p>Nate took a swig of his beer. \u201cYou know how they dominate politics. We\u2019ve heard they might try to neutralize the Crew themselves.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? They don\u2019t give a shit about human and changeling casualties.\u201d The sole reason the other race stayed in power\u2014aside from the fact that their competitors had a way of withdrawing from the race after the publication of one scandal or another\u2014was their ability to make money, money that did</p><p>occasionally trickle down to the voters.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to step on their toes,\u201d Nate said. \u201cPsy like to be the top dogs in any given situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess we\u2019ll have to move fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little time.\u201d The other man put down his beer. \u201cApparently, not everyone in the Psy ranks is convinced we pose a credible threat.\u201d</p><p>Emmett snorted. \u201cThey really can\u2019t see beyond their ivory towers, can they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans and changelings don\u2019t figure much on their radar.\u201d Nate\u2019s smile was distinctly pleased. \u201cAnd while they\u2019re busy deciding whether or not to bother paying attention to us, we\u2019ll take this city.\u201d</p><p>Emmett raised his bottle in a toast. \u201cTo a successful campaign.\u201d However, right then, he was thinking less about Dark-River\u2019s takeover of the city, and more about a very private campaign of his own. Come on, mink, play with me.</p> <p>Ria lay in bed that night and sighed. She\u2019d been cosseted, petted, and smothered half to death by her family in the hours since her return home. Most days, it would\u2019ve made her certifiable. Today, she\u2019d needed that warm blanket of love.</p><p>Warmth. Heat.</p><p>Her body softened, remembering what it had felt like to lie curled up in Emmett\u2019s lap. She\u2019d never found herself in a man\u2019s lap before. Most of the men who\u2019d dared run the gauntlet of her family\u2019s protectiveness to ask her out were nice boys from the neighborhood. She had nothing against them. But the thing was, she\u2019d grown up with a father who was fierce in his care of his family, and an older brother who hadn\u2019t deviated far from the paternal mold when it came to looking after those who were his own. They ate those nice boys for breakfast.</p><p>Ria dreamed of a man who\u2019d occasionally chew them up instead!</p><p>Hugging her pillow, she smiled at her own thoughts. You\u2019d think she didn\u2019t like her family.</p><p>That was far from the truth. But well, they were overwhelming.</p><p>They kind of took over everything. How was she supposed to respect a man who let himself be taken over?</p><p>I\u2019ll be back to check on you tomorrow.</p><p>Emmett had said that right in front of her father.</p><p>Goose bumps broke out over her entire body. She wondered what those big, strong hands of his would feel like smoothing over her skin, all hot and\u2014</p><p>Her phone beeped. She groaned when she saw the caller ID.</p><p>Tom.</p><p>Sighing, she went to answer, but the well-concealed devil in her made her turn off the cell instead. There was nothing wrong with Tom, except that he wanted to marry her. Her father liked Tom. Even Alex liked Tom. Ria had no problem with Tom. She just didn\u2019t want to marry him. No, what she dreamed of was a love story like her grandmother\u2019s\u2014and Miaoling was the only one in the family who supported Ria\u2019s resistance to the \u201cGreat Match.\u201d</p><p>From Alex\u2019s and Simon\u2019s point of view, it truly was a great match. Like her, Tom was part Chinese. Like her, he\u2019d grown up in the States, and had a very Western outlook on life, without having forgotten the other side of his heritage. Best of all, the Clarks and the Wembleys had been friends since before</p><p>either Ria or Tom had been born.</p><p>It was all perfect.</p><p>Except Tom would never laugh with her over a secret joke as her grandfather had done with her grandmother. He\u2019d never hold her with the furious</p><p>tenderness with which Simon held Alex when he thought no one was looking. And he\u2019d never pick a fight with her just so he\u2019d get to make up, as Jet did with Amber.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t they see that she wanted the same thing? All her life she\u2019d been content to let Jet and their younger brother, Ken, take the spotlight. Being the middle child was actually kind of nice\u2014she got the best of both worlds, and her relationship with her siblings was airtight. But with her man, with her husband, she wanted to be number one.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, Ria,\u201d she muttered to herself, knowing she was obsessing because she was afraid of nightmares.</p><p>But when she did sleep, it wasn\u2019t to fall into a nightmare . . . but into the powerful arms of a man who looked at her with eyes gone cat-green.</p><p>Emmett studied his face in the bathroom mirror the next morning and scowled. It was a wonder Ria hadn\u2019t run screaming from him when he\u2019d taken her into his arms. She was all soft and silky, a luscious armful. He, by comparison, looked like he\u2019d had a few run-ins with both fists and walls. The fists were true, but like all changelings, he\u2019d healed the damage fast. No, this was simply the face he\u2019d been born with. It had never really bothered him before, but now he rubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw and decided he\u2019d damn well better shave before he went to check up on Ria.</p><p>The shave and shower cleaned him up, but he was aware he still looked like a thug when he knocked on the door to her family home. He most definitely looked nothing like the pretty boy walking up the drive with a huge bouquet of roses.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Why the hell hadn\u2019t he thought to bring flowers?</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d the other man said in an Ivy League-educated voice. \u201cI\u2019m Tom.\u201d</p><p>Emmett held out a hand. \u201cEmmett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimon mentioned you on the phone,\u201d Tom said with a friendly smile that failed to hide the calculation in his eyes. \u201cYou helped Ria last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a friend of the family?\u201d Emmett asked to see what Tom would say, just as the door opened.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s my daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9,\u201d Alex said, pulling Tom down for a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>Emmett glanced at Tom. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in rings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not official yet.\u201d The other man was calm, confident, clearly sure of his suit.</p><p>Emmett didn\u2019t smile, but the leopard snapped its teeth inside him. This human cub was about to learn that leopard males didn\u2019t recognize any claim not acknowledged by the female. And Ria didn\u2019t consider herself bound to this one. Even if he hadn\u2019t overhead her conversation with her grandmother,</p><p>nothing about her had spoken of a commitment to another. She didn\u2019t carry Tom\u2019s scent . . .</p><p>and she hadn\u2019t pushed Emmett away last night.</p><p>Saying nothing of that, he turned to face Alex. \u201cCould I speak to Ria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Alex\u2019s eyes narrowed, even as she pulled Tom inside and put her hand on the opposite doorjamb as if to bar Emmett\u2019s way.</p><p>\u201cI need to see if she remembers anything else about her attacker.\u201d Emmett\u2019s leopard knew a worthy adversary when it saw one. Alex was one hell of a</p><p>protective mama-bear. But Emmett had tangled with plenty like her in the pack. \u201cIt\u2019ll help us make the streets safer for all daughters.\u201d No, he wasn\u2019t above using emotional blackmail to talk his way in.</p><p>Alex dropped her arm. \u201cHmm. Come in\u2014but if you upset Ria, I\u2019ll beat you up myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fragile, Mom.\u201d A familiar voice, a familiar scent\u2014soft, fresh, but with a lingering spice to it.</p><p>He drew the contradiction of it deep into his lungs, his leopard keeping careful watch as Ria hugged her mother, then took the flowers from Tom. No</p><p>kiss. Good. His claws scratched inside his skin, wanting out, wanting to do damage. Pretty Tom with his slick hair and flawless skin irritated him.</p><p>\u201cEmmett.\u201d Ria looked to him, all big brown eyes and hair. \u201cWe can talk in the living room.\u201d</p><p>As he nodded, Alex took the roses. \u201cI\u2019ll put these in water. Tom can sit with you for moral support.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d Ria said, making Alex freeze, \u201cI think I\u2019d rather go out for a walk\u2014I can show Emmett where I was ambushed. Grandmother wants</p><p>to talk to Tom.\u201d</p><p>Grinning inwardly at how neatly she\u2019d cut off all options but the one she wanted, Emmett stepped out onto the drive and waited for her to join him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before,\u201d he said when she came up beside him and they headed off.</p><p>\u201cYou have to grow a fairly strong personality in my family,\u201d she said, a smile flirting with her lips. \u201cIt\u2019s a survival mechanism.\u201d Reaching into the pocket of her coat, she passed over a folded piece of paper. \u201cThe account number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He glanced at her features, frowning at the bruise she\u2019d tried to hide under makeup. \u201cShow me your hands.\u201d</p><p>She turned them palm-sides-up. \u201cHealing okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bastard is in a coma,\u201d he muttered, cupping her hands so he could inspect the damage.</p> <p>The leopard hated seeing her marked up. So did the</p><p>man. \u201cYou know a Psy we could chat up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said when he forced himself to let her go, \u201cmy mother\u2019s accountant is Psy but I don\u2019t think Ms. Bhaskar is into interrogations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, last night . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you talk about it?\u201d He paused to look down into her face. \u201cIf it\u2019s too hard, we can delay it for a few days.\u201d</p> <p>A hint of open irritation flared in her eyes. \u201cWhat about making the streets safer for all daughters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s important,\u201d he admitted. \u201cThis gang, Vincent\u2019s Crew, they\u2019re taunting us. If we don\u2019t get them out of the city soon, we lose the right to hold it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lines marked her forehead. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about power,\u201d he told her. \u201cA predatory changeling pack can only legitimately claim territory it can hold\u2014and that means clearing it of all other predators. The Crew calls our authority into question. Another changeling group could decide that means we have no right to this area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then blood would spill,\u201d she said, voice solemn. \u201cThe SnowDancer wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut they\u2019re holding a massive amount of territory already. Our intel says they haven\u2019t got the manpower to push us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re not the only ones are they?\u201d Sliding her hands into the pockets of her vivid red coat, Ria nodded left. \u201cThat\u2019s the alley where he grabbed me.</p><p>I was walking home after a night class. My last class actually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy were you alone?\u201d he asked, a slight growl in his voice. \u201cIt was after dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was barely eight.\u201d Irritation sparked again\u2014Emmett was starting to show the same overprotective tendencies as her parents. \u201cAnd I\u2019m an adult in case you haven\u2019t noticed.\u201d</p><p>A slow blink. \u201cOh, I noticed.\u201d</p><p>THREE</p><p>Heat curled up from her stomach, spread through her limbs, threatened to color her face.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t patronize me.\u201d Steeling her spine against the impact, she met those gorgeous eyes of his. \u201cMy decision was a solid one. There were a lot of people around, heading out to restaurants or coming home from work. That excuse for a human being took me during a split-second respite in the foot traffic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeans he had to have been following you, just waiting for an opportunity.\u201d Emmett stared into the dark maw of the alley, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>She wondered if he\u2019d even heard her first two sentences. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019m always careful when I get off the skytrain, but it\u2019s hard to pick up that sort of thing when so many people disembark at the stations.\u201d Last night, the mass of humanity had spread out as soon as they hit the ground, but there\u2019d been enough of a crowd going her way that she hadn\u2019t really paid attention to anyone in particular.</p><p>\u201cUntil we neutralize the Crew,\u201d Emmett murmured, still staring into the alley, \u201cyou don\u2019t go anywhere alone.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Death,\u201d he said, turning to face her, \u201cthat\u2019s their motto. They follow their quarry to death.</p><p>They\u2019ll come after you again and again. It\u2019s a matter of</p><p>\u2018honor.\u2019 \u201d He all but spat on the street. \u201cWhat the fuck kind of honor is it to hurt a woman?\u201d</p><p>The unflinching conviction of his words reached straight through to the warm feminine core of her. But\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t sit at home. I have to start interviewing for jobs for one.\u201d Work was her ticket to freedom, a freedom she\u2019d worked hard to gain. \u201cAnd I take my grandmother to her appointments\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said you have to sit at home?\u201d An intent stare.</p><p>Ria didn\u2019t react well to any kind of intimidation. \u201cWell, if I can\u2019t go anywhere alone\u2014and I\u2019m not going to put my grandmother in danger\u2014then what else</p><p>am I supposed to do, hire a bodyguard?\u201d The minute, the second, her father found out about this, he\u2019d use it as an excuse to stop her from finding a job.</p><p>Simon and Alex Wembley loved their only daughter. They loved her so much, they couldn\u2019t bear to have the world put a single bruise on her soul. As a result, Ria had grown up being protected and cosseted. If it hadn\u2019t been for her grandmother, she might have turned into a spoiled brat. Instead, she\u2019d grown up cherishing her parents\u2019 love . . . while understanding the sadness that lay behind its protective fervor. That\u2019s why she hadn\u2019t gone away to college like Ken\u2014she hadn\u2019t been able to put that much worry in their hearts. But she couldn\u2019t live in a cocoon forever, not even for her mom and dad. It would</p><p>never suit her\u2014it would, in fact, destroy her.</p><p>However, her parents hadn\u2019t yet figured that out. In Simon\u2019s and Alex\u2019s minds, marriage to Tom would provide the ultimate protection\u2014as a Clark wife, she\u2019d be expected to do nothing more strenuous than look pretty and maybe arrange a few flowers. \u201cEmmett?\u201d she prompted when he remained silent.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as it takes.\u201d</p><p>She almost took a step back at the sheer untamed power of him. \u201cYou can\u2019t be with me twenty-four/seven. I won\u2019t say no to an escort from the skytrain at night, though.\u201d She was independent, not stupid.</p><p>\u201cThe Crew\u2019s been known to kidnap people off the street in broad daylight.\u201d His skin pulled taut over his cheekbones. \u201cThey intimidate any witnesses into silence, so their victims seem to disappear into thin air.\u201d</p><p>The need for freedom came up against the logic of what he was saying. \u201cWhat about my family?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already posted pack soldiers at your mother\u2019s store and around your home. The Crew\u2019s M.O. is to hit the women in the family, so your mother, sister-in-law, and grandmother are most at risk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber\u2019s over eight months pregnant,\u201d Ria began.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d A teasing smile. \u201cI thought she looked a bit different.\u201d</p><p>She felt a flush stain her cheekbones. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been going out much anyway\u2014if we tell her about the Crew\u2019s tactics, she\u2019ll probably be okay with staying inside for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would definitely make our job easier. Your mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way. She\u2019ll go to work\u2014she refuses to surrender to intimidation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say that\u2019s exactly a surprise.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not even going to ask about your grandmother. Just make sure she knows someone will</p><p>be shadowing her every time she goes out alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnowing her, she\u2019ll get them to carry her shopping.\u201d</p><p>Emmett\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cAnd you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ignoring you,\u201d she said, feeling an odd sense of excitement in her gut.</p><p>No smile, no hint of softening in his face. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to try.\u201d</p><p>Emmett finished fixing the computronics inside his mother\u2019s car and picked up his cell phone to call her. \u201cI\u2019ll drop it off tomorrow morning. It was a short circuit, nothing big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby.\u201d His mom was the only one Emmett let get away with calling him \u201cbaby.\u201d The one time he\u2019d tried to question her about it, she\u2019d simply stared at him until he\u2019d sighed and given in.</p><p>\u201cHas Dad gotten in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she told him, her voice holding a rare kind of clarity. \u201cHe\u2019s running an extra training session for some of the new soldiers. If things keep going the way they have been, I think there\u2019ll come a time when we\u2019ll have to take a stand against the Psy\u2014we need to be prepared.\u201d</p><p>Since his mother was the pack historian, her words carried real weight. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking the Psy Council\u2019s actions since I was a teenager,\u201d she told him, \u201cand year by year, I see more and more darkness creep into their</p><p>world. They\u2019re slowly going beyond cold, to a place that makes me scared for the Psy race as a whole.\u201d</p><p>Emmett felt no pity for the Psy\u2014not given what he\u2019d seen of their tactics, but his mother had always had a soft heart. \u201cLucas is obviously listening to you</p><p>\u2014I\u2019m scheduled to teach more sessions as well.\u201d Somewhat to his surprise, he\u2019d inherited his father\u2019s way with the younger members of the pack.</p><p>His mother chuckled. \u201cI hear he gave you the ten- to fourteen-year-old crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey teach me patience.\u201d It was a deadpan comment.</p><p>\u201cOh, Emmett.\u201d Another laugh. \u201cWhy are you single? You\u2019re gorgeous, good with children, and you adore your mother.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he fixed the timecode on the dashboard computer. \u201cNot that you\u2019re biased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI get to be biased about my baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere is someone,\u201d he found himself saying, \u201cbut she\u2019s being stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her already.\u201d</p><p>Ria did try to ignore Emmett as she\u2019d vowed.

The thought caused her stomach muscles to clench.</p><p>Miaoling made a face at Ria\u2019s response.</p><p>Ria kept talking, knowing she was protesting too much. \u201cHe\u2019s only protecting us because the Crew poses a threat to DarkRiver\u2019s control of the city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPah!\u201d Miaoling waved a hand. \u201cI know when a man\u2019s hungry.

Ria had no idea what they discussed at these conferences, but her grandmother always had a Cheshire cat smile on her face</p><p>when she left Mr. Wong\u2019s.</p><p>At first, Ria had thought the two were . . . well . . . but her grandmother had put her straight with an unexpectedly solemn response.</p><p>\u201cNo, Ri-ri. I\u2019ve loved only one man my whole life. I love the same man still.\u201d</p><p>The depth of devotion in that single sentence had brought tears to Ria\u2019s eyes. Her grandfather had been twenty years her grandmother\u2019s senior, and had taken his last breath when Ria was fifteen. His death had devastated Miaoling, but she hadn\u2019t ever broken down where Ria could see her. Instead, she\u2019d used the memory of her love as a shield.</p> <p>Miaoling still spoke to her husband as if he could hear her. Though she never did it when pragmatic Alex was nearby, she was open with it in front of Ria. Because Ria understood. Truly, when she was with her grandmother, she sometimes thought her grandfather was in the room with them, watching over the wife who, he\u2019d often complained, had always made him wait.</p><p>Going to be slow coming up to heaven, too, aren\u2019t you, my darling?</p><p>Words her grandfather had said on his deathbed, his hand wrapped around his wife\u2019s.</p><p>Miaoling had smiled and kissed him, teasing him to the last.</p><p>Now, as Ria watched Miaoling ascend to the second floor of the shop, she felt her heart contract. \u201cGrandmother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Miaoling looked over her shoulder, her eyes warm, full of silent encouragement.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps three hours. We\u2019re having lunch today as well.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen maybe I will go for a stroll.\u201d</p><p>Her grandmother smiled and continued on her way.</p><p>Heading out of Mr. Wong\u2019s, Ria found Emmett standing to her left, scanning the street. \u201cHave you got someone who can stay here with my</p><p>grandmother?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s already inside,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cMr. Wong\u2019s planning to tell your grandmother she\u2019s his new assistant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beautiful brunette minding the shop?\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t look dangerous enough to swat a fly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only can she swat flies, she can kill most men with a single blow.\u201d</p><p>Ria felt a sudden sense of inadequacy. \u201cI wish I could do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re serious,\u201d he said, looking her up and down in a way that was distinctly professional,</p><p>\u201cI can teach you enough self-defense that you won\u2019t ever</p><p>feel helpless again. You\u2019re fit and you move well. You should pick it up quick.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she stared. \u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d A few tentative tendrils of hope wrapped around her heart\u2014she\u2019d begun to believe that Emmett was as</p><p>suffocatingly protective as her father, but this argued differently.</p><p>\u201cHow much time do we have now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hours.\u201d</p><p>He straightened away from the wall. \u201cWe can practice in a small basement gym members of the pack use when they can\u2019t get out of the city for a good hard run. You\u2019ll need workout gear.\u201d</p><p>Ria thought about it. \u201cI\u2019ll buy some. There\u2019s a shop two blocks over.\u201d That way, none of her family would even know about the training. Not that their objections would\u2019ve stopped her\u2014but she didn\u2019t have time to have the argument.</p><p>Emmett slid his hand along Ria\u2019s arm, positioning her as she needed to be, and asked himself\u2014for the hundredth time\u2014why he was torturing himself like this. Even in the loose sweats and T-shirt she\u2019d changed into, the woman who currently stood with her back to his chest set his body on fire. But the little mink didn\u2019t seem inclined to play\u2014she\u2019d been all business since the moment they got to the gym. The leopard wasn\u2019t pleased. Neither was the man. But no way was he going to push himself on Ria and make her uncomfortable. Not after what that bloody waste of space from the Crew had done to her.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d He released her. \u201cPerfect. Now kick.\u201d</p><p>Ria brought up her leg in a forceful, fast kick. It wasn\u2019t graceful or poetic. It was hard, rough, dirty. Emmett didn\u2019t care about pretty. He cared about</p><p>making sure she could protect herself. \u201cI want you to practice for ten minutes while I go make a few calls.\u201d</p><p>Giving him a nod, Ria began to go through the beginner routine he\u2019d devised. She was a fast learner, but as a human, her strength was much less than</p><p>a changeling\u2019s. Added to that, she was small and female\u2014so the next time they worked out, he planned to teach her to fight using anything at her</p><p>disposal, as she\u2019d used her handbag two nights ago. That is, unless she had the option to turn and run. A physical fight would never be the smart first choice for her.</p><p>Walking a short distance from where she moved that sweet little body with such focused determination, he brought out his phone and coded in a call to his alpha, Lucas. \u201cWere you able to track the source of the hang-ups to Amber\u2019s cell phone?\u201d</p><p>Ria had told him about the calls this morning.</p><p>\u201cDisposable.\u201d Lucas\u2019s anger was clear. \u201cBut we got another one of the bastards. He made the bad decision to try to shake down a couple while Clay was running patrol.\u201d</p><p>Emmett\u2019s leopard smiled, its teeth razor sharp. \u201cIs he dead?\u201d Clay didn\u2019t see the point in keeping vermin alive.</p><p>\u201cClay thought we might want to question him, so he only broke a few ribs. Man\u2019s refusing to talk, but I\u2019ve had Clay prowling around him in leopard form</p><p>\u2014he\u2019ll break when those teeth get too close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your gut say\u2014small fry or big gun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery small fry. He\u2019s not likely to know anything important.\u201d A sigh of frustration. \u201cKeep on the girl. They\u2019ll do anything to get to her, because the longer she remains alive, the more traction Vincent loses.\u201d</p><p>Emmett traced Ria\u2019s form with his gaze as she went through her routine. The curve of her butt was the perfect shape to fit into his hands. \u201cI\u2019m not letting her out of my sight.\u201d</p><p>FOUR</p><p>Having done two reps of the routine Emmett had shown her, Ria turned to see him walking back to her.</p><p>The savage edge in his eyes raised every hair on her body.</p><p>The man looked hungry. No one had ever looked at Ria like that. It was almost terrifying. But she stood in place, waiting, wondering.</p><p>\u201cReady for the next step?\u201d His voice was deep, holding the beginnings of what sounded like a growl . . . a leopard barely contained.</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He padded to a spot opposite her, still dressed in the jeans and T-shirt he\u2019d been wearing earlier. It was obvious why he hadn\u2019t bothered to change\u2014he hadn\u2019t so much as broken a sweat with what they\u2019d done so far, while her muscles were starting to protest. Now, he crooked a finger. \u201cCome on, mink, use what I just taught you.\u201d</p><p>She was so startled by what he\u2019d called her that she completely lost her focus. He was in her face an instant later. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cIf you blank out in a fight, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me a mink!\u201d She refused to back off.</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d Moving at inhuman speed, he closed a hand around her throat before she knew what was happening. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure you\u2019re not a dead mink.</p><p>\u201d</p><p>Eyes narrowed, she reached up and tried to break his nose using the flat of her hand. He caught it using his free hand. Her knee was already aiming for his crotch, and when he blocked that, she leaned forward and sunk her teeth hard into his forearm.</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d The hand around her neck remained in place, but he released her other hand. She immediately went for his eyes and his crotch again. Her knee brushed against something very hard, before he twisted away and swore. She kept going, kicking, trying to scratch, even attempting to break the pinkie of the hand he had around her throat.</p><p>He finally let go. \u201cTruce.\u201d</p><p>Her heart was in her throat, exhilaration in her bloodstream. She knew he\u2019d been playing with her\u2014with his strength and training, he could\u2019ve had her on the ground in one second flat. \u201cHow did I do?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at his forearm. \u201cI didn\u2019t teach you the biting.\u201d It was a snarl.</p><p>Or maybe he hadn\u2019t been playing the whole time. \u201cI decided to add it on my own,\u201d she said, though in truth, it had been an instinctive response to his arrogant provocation. Her eyes went to the marks she\u2019d made. Deep and red and perfectly formed. Guilt invaded. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bite you that hard. But .</p><p>. . I\u2019m not sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh?\u201d He walked over, slow, so slow. This time, she backed up. It was one thing to play with a predator who was keeping his claws sheathed, quite</p><p>another to know you were prey. He kept coming. She knew the door out of the basement was only about a foot away. Making a quick move, she went to dart left.</p><p>Too late.</p> <p>He was there before her and somehow, she found herself pasted up against the closed door, very aware she was all alone with a big, dangerous</p><p>leopard in human skin. Except instead of fear, it was a vivid excitement that beat in her blood as he placed his hands palms-down on either side of her</p><p>head and bent until their breaths mingled. \u201cBoo.\u201d</p><p>She jumped, then wanted to slap herself for it. \u201cStop acting like the big bad cat.\u201d</p><p>A blink, and when he raised his lashes, the eyes that looked back at her were in no way human. \u201cMmm, I smell a pretty little human in my territory.\u201d A soft whisper against her lips, bright green-gold eyes daring her to respond.</p> <p>Her breasts brushed his chest as he pressed closer, her breath coming in jagged pants.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re behaving very badly.\u201d It was a husky reproach.</p><p>\u201cYou bit me.\u201d He angled his head a little to the left, and though she couldn\u2019t see those amazing eyes except for a glint through his lashes, she knew he was looking at her lips. \u201cSay sorry.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what made her do it. Parting her lips, she said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>His mouth was on hers before the syllable ended. She found herself being kissed as she\u2019d never been kissed in her life. He took over her mouth,</p><p>slicked his tongue in, and tasted her like she was the finest candy and he was starving.</p> <p>Against her, his body was a hot, hard, impregnable wall. Her hands were somehow under his T-shirt and on his back, touching skin that burned with a wild fever that made her moan in the back of her throat.</p><p>A sound akin to a growl rolled up from his chest and into her mouth. Before she could process it, his hands were at her waist and he was lifting her up against the door. Wrapping her legs around him, she gave herself up to the possessive demand of his kiss. It fed fire through her body, a hot, pulsing storm. Then one of those big hands stroked down her back to squeeze her bottom.</p><p>She gasped, breaking the kiss.</p><p>He followed, taking her mouth again before she could do more than suck in a breath. Oh, Lord. He was stroking her butt, cupping and petting even as he devoured her mouth. It was wild, raw, primal. The heat in her stomach was matched only by the dampness between her thighs. Part of her was</p><p>scandalized at her response, but that part was drowned out by the wild thunder of her pulse as pleasure sizzled through her veins, pure liquid flame.</p><p>Emmett broke the kiss just as her head was starting to spin. An instant later, she felt those delicious male lips along her jaw, down her throat. And that hand on her bottom . . . she swallowed, tried to think, lost the thread when Emmett shifted his hold so that his fingers brushed the heat between her legs.</p><p>She cried out. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>A fluttering stroke that arced electricity right through her. \u201cPlease tell me you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d His stubble brushed her throat as he leaned in to nibble at her ear. \u201cCome on, mink. Just a little more.\u201d</p> <p>God, the man was a devil. And he smelled so good. A faint hint of sweat, the luscious warmth of male body heat, and the unique scent that was Emmett.</p><p>She found she was kissing his jaw, fascinated by the contrast between the stubble and his skin. \u201cRandom sex isn\u2019t my style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about random?\u201d Another teasing brush, another rush of exquisite pleasure. \u201cI plan to have sex with you on a regular basis.\u201d</p><p>The arrogance of the comment should have snapped her out of it. Instead, her mind bombarded her with images of naked limbs intertwined, a heavy male thigh pushing between her own. He\u2019d be no gentle, easy lover. He\u2019d demand and he\u2019d take. He might even bite. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming an awful lot,\u201d she somehow found the willpower to say.</p><p>A press of his fingers this time, not a brush. She sucked in a breath, her eyes closing as she waited for it to pass. But he didn\u2019t stop. Instead, he lifted her until she was positioned just right . . . and began to rub himself against her in slow, grinding circles. She almost screamed. And then his fingers were on her again and she did scream.</p><p>Emmett caught Ria\u2019s scream with his mouth as he continued to tease her with his body\u2014</p><p>torturing himself in the process. But the scent of her damp heat, it was pure ambrosia. He wanted to sit her down\u2014no, lay her down\u2014on a sprawling playground of a bed, spread her thighs wide and taste. His cock pulsed, the leopard\u2019s hunger threatening to overwhelm the man\u2019s control.</p><p>Fighting the urge to tear off her sweats, he concentrated on driving her over the edge of pleasure. He hadn\u2019t needed her to tell him\u2014he\u2019d known</p><p>instinctively that Ria wasn\u2019t a woman who took sex casually. He\u2019d have to coax her into his bed. Taking her against the scarred door of a basement gym was hardly going to reassure her that her pleasure mattered to him. Mattered enough that when her body tightened, he grit his teeth and stroked her through the orgasm.</p><p>Her fingernails dug into his shoulders through his T-shirt\u2014he wished like hell he\u2019d taken the damn thing off. He wanted those marks on his skin, wanted to know she\u2019d put them there. Next time, he promised the cat. Next time. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling at her neck as she shuddered against him, her body going limp. \u201cPretty and soft and beautiful.\u201d And mine. The leopard bared its teeth at the thought, even as the man bit back a rawly possessive</p><p>smile.</p><p>Finally shifting his hold from the gorgeous curve of her butt, he ran his hands up her sides as he kissed and petted her through the aftershocks of</p><p>pleasure. Her eyes were still a little unfocused when she said, \u201cPut me down.\u201d It was an order.</p><p>The leopard snarled, but he did as asked. She pressed her hands flat against the door and looked up at him. \u201cYou\u2019re . . .\u201d Color streaked across her cheekbones.</p><p>He gave her a smile that he knew held a distinctly savage edge. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I want lots and lots of time when I slide into you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre all cats as arrogant as you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and leaned in close. \u201cI\u2019m the only cat you need to be thinking about.\u201d</p><p>Ria couldn\u2019t not think about Emmett. That night, as she sat across from her parents at the dinner table, she kept finding herself drifting off in the middle of conversations. Emmett\u2019s herself drifting off in the middle of conversations. Emmett\u2019s scent seemed to have become locked in her brain. She was</p><p>fantasizing about burying her face in his neck, his strong body hard and taut against hers when Alex\u2019s voice penetrated.</p><p>\u201cRia!\u201d</p><p>Jumping, Ria met her mother\u2019s eyes, hoping the guilt didn\u2019t show. \u201cSorry, what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom\u2019s popping by for coffee tonight. Why don\u2019t you change into a dress?\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s fingers turned to iron around her chopsticks. Enough, she thought. And strangely, it had nothing to do with Emmett. Perhaps he\u2019d pushed her to this point faster, but she\u2019d always been walking toward it. \u201cMom,\u201d she said, putting down the abused chopsticks, \u201cI have no interest whatsoever in Tom.\u201d</p><p>Utter silence.</p><p>Simon was the one to break it. \u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you, Ria? You and Tom grew up together\u2014he knows you. He\u2019ll make a good husband.\u201d The tone of his voice said the matter was settled.</p><p>Ria looked into her father\u2019s face. \u201cI love you, Dad, but not even for you will I marry a man who thinks I should be patted on the head once in a while and put in the corner like a good little girl the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>White lines bracketed Simon\u2019s mouth. \u201cThat boy\u2019s only ever treated you with respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe treats me like a dimwit,\u201d Ria said, skin blazing with temper. \u201cLast week, he told me I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about finances when we were married, that he knows math confuses females.\u201d</p><p>Alex made a choked little sound that succeeded in ripping Ria\u2019s attention from her father\u2019s disapproving face. Alex\u2019s expression was a mix of outrage and disbelief. \u201cHe did not say that. You\u2019re making it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopo?\u201d Ria turned to her right.</p><p>Miaoling ate a fried shrimp and nodded. \u201cHe said it. Then he smiled as if expecting praise.\u201d</p><p>Alex\u2019s hands clenched on the tablecloth. \u201cAnd who does he think does the books for the shop, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlex.\u201d Simon closed his hand over his wife\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019re getting off topic.\u201d</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Alex nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Sweetheart, Tom is a very good match for you. You never had a problem with him before you met that disreputable leopard.\u201d</p><p>Ria supposed Emmett was disreputable\u2014that stubble, those hands that had squeezed and petted, those eyes that told her he wanted to do all kinds of wicked things to her. But . . . \u201cHe\u2019s an honorable man.\u201d That core of honor was so much a part of him, she wondered if he was even aware of it. It was why it had been so easy for her to lose control in the gym today\u2014she\u2019d trusted Emmett to take care of her. And that, she thought, was a dangerous thing . . .</p><p>the kind that could lead to a broken heart if she wasn\u2019t careful. \u201cHe\u2019s protecting our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jet said, jumping into the conversation. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s making time with you while he does this duty, but he won\u2019t marry you, Ria. Those cats</p><p>stick together.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s stomach twisted, because she knew her brother was right. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Emmett. It\u2019s about me. I will, under no circumstances, marry Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Alex asked, eyes flashing. \u201cHe\u2019s intelligent, handsome, has a good job, and brings you flowers.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, Ria threw down her napkin and rose to her feet. \u201cIf he\u2019s that great, you marry him. I will not marry a man who hasn\u2019t even attempted to French-kiss me the entire year we\u2019ve been \u2018dating.\u2019 \u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her parents yelled her name, but Jet\u2019s incredulous voice drowned them out. \u201cSeriously?

She flew into a rapid stream of Mandarin.</p><p>Miaoling looked up at Ria and winked. \u201cSit. Eat.\u201d</p> <p>And oddly enough, Ria did. The family fought through the entire meal, but now her parents were mad at Jet because he figured Tom had to be gay.</p><p>Alex glared at her son. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s just being respectful of your sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo effing way.\u201d A skeptical snort. \u201cMen aren\u2019t that noble when it comes to women they want.\u201d Jet turned to his wife, his voice dropping. \u201cWhen I saw Amber, all I wanted to do was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou finish that sentence,\u201d Alex threatened, \u201cand you\u2019ll be breathing fire I\u2019ll put so much chili in your food.\u201d</p><p>Amber grinned and blew Jet a kiss. \u201cYou know, it sounds to me like Tom\u2019s planning to marry Ria and get himself a nice, respectable wife, while having a bit on the side.\u201d</p> <p>Simon\u2019s mouth fell open at this scandalous contribution from his flawlessly elegant daughter-in-law.</p><p>Miaoling ate another shrimp. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Like father, like son.\u201d</p><p>Silence. Deeper. More shocked.</p><p>FIVE</p><p>Simon cleared his throat. \u201cMother,\u201d he said, his tone that of a man who knows he\u2019s done for,</p><p>\u201cis that true?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m lying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d do anything for your favorite granddaughter.\u201d</p><p>Leaning back, Miaoling actually cackled. \u201cThis time, I don\u2019t have to. Wait.\u201d She got up and headed toward her room.</p><p>Ria shrugged when all eyes turned to her. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEat some tofu,\u201d Alex said when they just sat there. \u201cIt\u2019ll go bad if we don\u2019t finish it tonight.\u201d</p><p>Everyone ate. But the instant Miaoling walked back into the room, all implements were abandoned, food forgotten. Wearing the same smile she always displayed when she came out of Mr. Wong\u2019s, Miaoling sat down and opened an envelope.</p><p>Ria\u2019s eyes went wide when she saw the photograph in her</p><p>grandmother\u2019s hand\u2014Tom\u2019s father with his tongue down the throat of the woman everyone knew as his secretary. \u201cOh, my, God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t show me,\u201d Alex said, slapping her hands over her eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it. Essie\u2019s one of my best friends!\u201d</p><p>Miaoling waved off the objection. \u201cShe knows. Doesn\u2019t care\u2014it keeps Tom Sr. from interrupting her hobbies. She\u2019s making lanterns this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopo,\u201d Ria said, choking, \u201chow did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think Mr. Wong and I talk about?\u201d She turned her gaze to Ria\u2019s parents. \u201cWant to know about the apartment Tom bought his mistress?\u201d</p><p>Alex looked like she was about to keel over. \u201cMistress?\u201d It was a thin sound.</p><p>A sense of fair play induced Ria to attempt to defend Tom. After all, she was now involved with Emmett. \u201cGrandmother, no one has mistresses anymore.</p><p>Tom was probably just waiting for the right time to tell me he\u2019d fallen for someone else.\u201d Yes, he should\u2019ve been man enough to stop the charade of their non-engagement soon as he met his girlfriend, but Ria wasn\u2019t going to beat him up about that. Chances were, he\u2019d needed time to work up the strength to stand firm against familial pressure.</p><p>\u201cI talked to her.\u201d</p><p>Jet whooped at Miaoling\u2019s words, while Amber shushed him and said, \u201cHow, Nana?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a weak old lady, always need so much help.\u201d Miaoling\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cNice girl, too nice for Tom. She\u2019s so sad for him because he has to marry some plain, fat girl\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat snake!\u201d Alex\u2019s hand clenched on a sharp knife as Ria\u2019s sympathy for Tom died a quick and permanent death.</p><p>\u201c\u2014but nothing\u2019s going to change between them after the wedding. Tom\u2019s set it all up so he can visit her on his way home every night. He\u2019s even</p><p>promised to take her to Paris after he explains how things are to his wife.\u201d</p><p>Simon looked at Ria, a tic in his jaw. \u201cIf you even think about marrying Tom, I\u2019ll hogtie you and send you to live with my parents in Idaho.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Dad.\u201d Grinning, Ria walked around to hug her parents. But she waited until she was alone with her grandmother to ask, \u201cWas that in case I didn\u2019t get up the guts to pull myself out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it was just backup.\u201d Miaoling\u2019s wrinkled hand was a touch of love against her cheek. \u201cI always knew you\u2019d find your voice. Don\u2019t ever let anyone</p><p>take it away from you.\u201d</p><p>Pleased and frustrated in equal measures by his earlier encounter with Ria, Emmett forced himself to focus as he ran his early-evening class through some hand-to-hand combat moves. There were only four in this group\u2014he preferred to spend more one-on-one time with the older, higher-level students.</p><p>\u201cJazz,\u201d he said, when the sole girl in the group smiled slowly at one of the boys before blowing him a flirtatious kiss\u2014the poor kid lost his rhythm completely.</p><p>Emmett\u2019s cat found her little tricks amusing, but he put on a stern face, knowing if he didn\u2019t, she\u2019d keep on doing exactly as she wanted. Female</p><p>leopards were a handful\u2014throw teenage hormones into the mix, and no wonder half the pack had sent him sympathy cards when Lucas put him in charge of this lot. The other half had offered to take him drinking.</p><p>\u201cYes, sir?\u201d An innocent look.</p><p>\u201cUnless you plan to beat your opponents with nothing but a smile and a hip wiggle,\u201d he said,</p><p>\u201cI suggest you work on your hand to eye coordination. It\u2019s off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is not.\u201d Her back went ramrod straight. \u201cI can move smoother than anyone else in this class.\u201d</p><p>He met her militant gaze. \u201cTen laps. Now.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing at his unusually harsh tone, the ebony-skinned girl took off to do the required laps. Emmett turned back to the three boys who remained.</p><p>\u201cGentlemen, you have something to say?\u201d</p><p>One of them, a slender kid named Aaron, stepped forward. \u201cShe\u2019s right\u2014she is better than all of us at the hand to eye stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot today\u2014she\u2019s too busy playing head games.\u201d Sending them back to their training, he waited for Jazz to return.</p><p>\u201cGrab a drink and a seat,\u201d he said when she did, red-faced from having done the laps at full changeling speed as required. After making sure the boys</p><p>had enough to carry on with, he walked over to hunker down in front of her. \u201cWhy do you think I made you do that?\u201d</p><p>A shrug. \u201cI was mouthing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d And because he knew something of young female pride, he reached out to tug on one of her braids. \u201cYou are top of the class.\u201d</p><p>A small smile peeked out.</p><p>\u201cBut, kitten,\u201d he said, meeting her gaze, \u201cthat won\u2019t get you far if you can\u2019t hold your temper.</p><p>You can still be Jazz, still be a smart-ass, too, if you want\u201d</p><p>\u2014that got him another small smile\u2014\u201cbut you need to learn to work within a hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>Because that was how changeling packs stayed strong, though they were often far fewer in number than either of the two other races. And if his mother was correct in her predictions, that internal strength would become even more important in the years to come. These kids were all highly independent predatory changelings\u2014his job was to start teaching them to work as a unit.</p><p>\u201cI think I understand,\u201d Jazz said after a thoughtful pause. \u201cIt\u2019s how the sentinels and soldiers work to protect the alpha\u2014they know they can always rely on each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Rising, he tugged her to her feet, \u201cGo on, finish your training routine, and then we\u2019ll do some one-on-one combat.\u201d</p><p>A sharp grin. \u201cI\u2019m going to kick the boys\u2019 butts tonight.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling as he watched her slide easily into the graceful rhythm of combat, he wondered what Ria would think of the measures DarkRiver was taking to protect its future. Would she understand, or would she be repelled by the threat of violence, by the aggressiveness that was an inherent part of a predatory changeling\u2019s nature? Not that he had any intention of discussing those things with her\u2014not as long as he could avoid it. She\u2019d clearly been</p><p>brought up in a sheltered environment\u2014why ask her to worry about things she didn\u2019t have to? Protection was his job. His plans for Ria Wembley were all about pleasure . . . of the most decadent, delicious kind.</p><p>His entire body thrummed in anticipation.</p><p>Ria stayed home for two days after the explosive events in the gym, seeing Emmett only to say hi.</p><p>He scowled at her when she looked out the window on the second day. She had a good feeling she knew what he was thinking\u2014that she was running scared after coming apart in his arms\u2014but tempting as it was to head out and put him straight, she stayed in.</p><p>Of course, that temptation wasn\u2019t the sole one where Emmett was concerned\u2014her body wasn\u2019t letting her get much sleep. Now that it had had a taste of real pleasure, it wanted more. The sleepless nights left her frustrated in more ways than one, and she intended to punish the damn cat for it.</p><p>But first, she had to do something.</p><p>On the third day after he\u2019d crushed her up against the basement door and kissed her senseless, she walked out dressed in a deep peach skirt suit teamed with a white silk shell. Emmett looked her up and down, then did it again . . . slow.</p><p>Her cheeks felt like they matched her suit by the time he finished.</p><p>\u201cI like it.\u201d A slow, feline purr.</p><p>She thrust a list at him. \u201cInterview locations.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow as he scanned the list, but all he said was, \u201cHold on. I\u2019ll get cover for your home then we can go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill no luck with tracking Vincent down?\u201d</p><p>Sliding the phone into his pocket after rearranging his people, he shook his head. \u201cCreep\u2019s laying low. He thinks we\u2019ll give up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That, she knew, was simply not a possibility. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been sitting still.\u201d He\u2019d only swung by her house in the mornings and at night. The other times, they\u2019d had a rotation of both male and female DarkRiver soldiers.</p><p>\u201cWe have a bead on his base of operations.\u201d A smile that was openly feral. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, but had the distinct feeling he wasn\u2019t telling her everything. And why should he, part of her pointed out. She was just someone he was protecting. Maybe he lusted after her, too, but Jet was right, the cats stuck together. She didn\u2019t know any DarkRiver people who\u2019d entered into long-term relationships with humans\u2014sexual, business, or otherwise. \u201cEmmett,\u201d she began, intending to ask that question, then realizing he might see it as</p> <p>expectation.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI think the first appointment is about a ten-minute walk away.\u201d</p><p>For a second, it looked like Emmett was going to pursue her aborted statement, but to her relief, he followed her lead and they headed off\u2014with Ria sandwiched between the safety of the shop walls and Emmett\u2019s big frame. His constant alertness made her feel safe on the innermost level.</p><p>\u201cWhat kinds of jobs are you applying for?\u201d he asked a block from the first location on her list.</p> <p>\u201cAdministrative,\u201d she said, then made a face. \u201cI\u2019d really love to run my own office\u2014you know, be in charge of all the organizing for the boss, but that\u2019s going to be far in the future. First, I need experience\u2014so I\u2019ll end up someone\u2019s lackey.\u201d</p><p>Emmett laughed at her tone. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be a lackey for long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and took several deep breaths. \u201cRight, here it is. Wish me luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wish you luck inside.\u201d He pulled open the outer door.</p><p>\u201cEmmett, I can\u2019t go into an interview with a bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>His eyes turned flint-hard. \u201cVincent knew when you\u2019d be coming home from your course.</p> <p>Chances are high that he\u2019s worked out you\u2019d now be applying for jobs.\u201d</p><p>She grit her teeth. \u201cThis is an established firm. I hardly think I\u2019m going to be in danger from the sixty-year-old manager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going behind a closed door with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Ria argued until she was close to the screaming point but he wouldn\u2019t budge. Predictably, her interviews didn\u2019t go well. The first manager was so</p><p>affronted at the idea of being considered a threat that he booted her out without an interview.</p><p>The next two were female and couldn\u2019t stop staring at</p><p>Emmett long enough to listen to Ria. When one finally did throw her a crumb of attention, it was to give her a condescending smile and say that maybe</p><p>she wasn\u2019t cut out for office work.</p> <p>A babysitter didn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence.</p><p>Ria was close to tears by the fourth interview, but not from anxiety. From sheer rage. \u201cThank you for destroying my chances of employment,\u201d she said as they got off the skytrain near Chinatown, having circled the city for her appointments.</p><p>\u201cRia,\u201d he began.</p><p>She slapped up a hand, palm out. \u201cI am cut out for office work. I do my mother\u2019s books. Not only that, I do the entire family\u2019s books. I make sure my father goes to his appointments and Amber sees the obstetrician on time, that Grandmother takes her medications and Jet doesn\u2019t forget to write New Year cards to our aunts in Albuquerque. I am damn well cut out for office work!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said you weren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The soothing tone in his voice made Ria want to bite him. \u201cNo, you simply stood there like I couldn\u2019t be counted on to take care of myself if someone</p><p>tried to hurt me. That day, at the gym, it was all bullshit!\u201d</p><p>His scowl was thunderous. \u201cTake that back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that, you idiot. I\u2019m talking about the self-defense stuff. It was just to pacify me. You don\u2019t even trust me to scream.\u201d That had been the first lesson he\u2019d taught her\u2014scream as loud as you can and run. \u201cYou know what, I think that makes the other stuff bullshit, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on a fucking minute.\u201d__</p><p>SIX</p><p>I gnoring him, she walked through the automatic doors of the medium-sized office building that was the location of her next appointment and strode up to the counter. \u201cHi,\u201d she said to the well-groomed woman on the other side, her skin a lush, flawless mahogany. \u201cI have an appointment with Lucas Hunter.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s eyes flicked behind Ria\u2019s shoulder, and something like surprise passed through them, but her voice, when she turned to Ria, was wholly professional. \u201cName?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRia Wembley.\u201d</p><p>A warm smile. \u201cYou\u2019re fifteen minutes early, Ms. Wembley. If you\u2019ll wait here, I\u2019ll let you know when Lucas has finished with the current applicant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She was walking toward the seating area when she belatedly realized she didn\u2019t know the name of this company. The ad had simply said that a small but growing construction firm was seeking administrative staff. Since that ad had been vetted by the college where she\u2019d taken her course, she hadn\u2019t worried too much about the lack. But her ignorance probably wouldn\u2019t look too good . .</p><p>. if this Hunter person even bothered to see her after</p><p>learning about Emmett.</p><p>Turning on her heel, she skirted around Emmett to speak to the receptionist again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.</p><p>I noticed that your doors don\u2019t have the company name on</p><p>them.\u201d</p><p>The woman\u2019s gaze flicked to Emmett again. Ria fumed. But the beautiful brunette didn\u2019t seem to be checking him out. \u201cActually,\u201d she said after a small pause, \u201cthe name\u2019s still in discussions . . . er, the partners haven\u2019t decided on the order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d That was odd, but not odd enough to make her run. Beggars, as they said, couldn\u2019t be choosers. Nodding, she walked to the comfortable</p><p>arrangement of armchairs to the left of the reception counter, choosing a seat bathed in sunshine.</p><p>Emmett sprawled beside her. \u201cWhat we shared was not bullshit. And I didn\u2019t know you even knew how to swear.\u201d</p><p>The joke just irritated her. \u201cIf you can lie about one thing, why not another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, hold on. I never lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? What do you call teaching me self-defense, then treating me like a brainless ninny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>Ria jerked up at the sound of the receptionist\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cLucas is free now,\u201d she was told. \u201cThe interviews are taking place one floor up.\u201d</p><p>As she got up and headed across the lobby to the elevators, someone called out a hello.</p><p>Since she didn\u2019t know the male heading out the front door, she assumed it had been aimed at Emmett. \u201cFriend?\u201d She stabbed the touchpad beside the elevator.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t meet her eyes. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>The elevator doors opened to reveal an empty cage and she could\u2019ve sworn she heard Emmett sigh in relief. \u201cFear of crowded elevators?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>They were on the next floor what felt like an instant later. The meeting room was obvious by its open door. The man who came to that door was beyond</p><p>handsome\u2014bright green eyes, dark hair that brushed his shoulders and savage clawlike markings on the right side of his face. He was young . . . yet not.</p><p>Experience flickered in that striking green gaze, and Ria knew he\u2019d sized her up in a single fleeting instant.</p><p>\u201cRia\u201d\u2014he held out a hand\u2014\u201cI\u2019m Lucas. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>She shook and went to explain Emmett . . . except that her self-appointed bodyguard had already grabbed a seat in the plush armchair outside the</p><p>meeting room. Her mouth hung open for a second before she snapped it shut. What in the . .</p><p>. ? This Lucas, with his aura of contained power, was</p><p>undoubtedly far more dangerous than anyone else she\u2019d met today and Emmett was okay with her being alone with him?</p><p>Deciding not to look a gift horse in the mouth, she walked in, aware of Lucas closing the door behind her as she took a seat on one side of a small</p><p>table. There was something about his walk when he came to take his own seat . . . he reminded her of someone.</p><p>\u201cWater?\u201d At her nod, he poured her a glass and pushed it across. \u201cI\u2019ve read your resume.</p><p>You\u2019ve just completed studies in advanced office</p><p>administration?\u201d</p><p>She took a sip before answering. \u201cYes, at the top of my class. I\u2019ve also had some on-the-job experience through the course.\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded. \u201cI have no doubt your technical skills are excellent. We checked with the college and with the people you put down as references.\u201d</p><p>The efficiency of it surprised and pleased her. \u201cYour ad said you were seeking a number of staff,\u201d she said, finding herself relaxing in spite of her vivid awareness of his power. The woman who took on Lucas Hunter, she thought, would have her work cut out for her. \u201cCould you give me more information about the positions\u2014I could perhaps tell you which I might be best suited for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, you\u2019re on the short list for a particular position already. That\u2019s what I want to discuss\u2014it\u2019s in no way a normal administrative job.\u201d</p><p>Ria was intrigued. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d A smile that turned him from gorgeous to beautiful in a very masculine way. She appreciated the sight, but without wanting to jump his bones. Not like with Emmett. And that thought had no business interrupting her interview. Corralling her runaway hormones, she turned her attention firmly back to Lucas.</p><p>\u201cHow are you with chaos?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI love it.\u201d Her response was instinctive. \u201cIt gives me more to organize.\u201d</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cWhat about constant interruptions, having to rejig meetings on a moment\u2019s notice, and a boss who might be impossible to track down </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>at times?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it needs to be done, it\u2019ll get done,\u201d she said, meeting those brilliant green eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be honest\u2014even though I probably shouldn\u2019t be. I\u2019m likely to get a little short-tempered now and then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA temper might come in handy in this position.\u201d His lips tilted up at the corners. \u201cThis is a . . .</p> <p>family business. And that family will be in and out. Can you handle being the focus of their curiosity?\u201d</p><p>It was a strange question, but her answer was easy. \u201cLet\u2019s see\u2014every Sunday without fail, my aunt Eadie calls to interrogate me about my life and offer</p><p>\u2018essential fashion advice.\u2019 My paternal grandparents live in Idaho, but last week, they sent me a dossier on all the nice boys in town\u2014just in case. Oh, and my normally very forward-thinking parents recently tried to arrange my marriage. I know how to handle family.\u201d</p><p>His eyes danced. \u201cAnd the arranged marriage?\u201d</p><p>Since she\u2019d brought it up, she couldn\u2019t exactly avoid the personal question. \u201cNot happening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He rose to his feet, an amused curve to his mouth. \u201cI think that\u2019s all I need from you, Ria.\u201d</p><p>Standing, she picked up her purse. \u201cIt\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it? The person I\u2019d be working for if I get the job?\u201d</p><p>A slight nod.</p><p>\u201cUsually HR interviews applicants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m picky.\u201d He pulled open the door. \u201cI need to trust the person I hire.\u201d</p><p>Smiling even as her stomach dropped, she stepped out. Emmett was up and waiting for her.</p> <p>They entered the elevator in silence and walked out into</p><p>the street.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d Emmett asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed the back of his neck. \u201cStill mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should give you credit for letting me go in there alone?\u201d She raised an eyebrow, wondering what he\u2019d do.</p><p>\u201cEr.\u201d His cheeks flushed. \u201cNever mind.\u201d</p><p>She felt her lips twitch. \u201cI know he was a cat, Emmett. The way you leopards walk, it\u2019s a dead giveaway.\u201d They prowled, all soft and silent and lethal.</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI was hoping to score brownie points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s DarkRiver Construction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of it. The building will also function as the pack\u2019s city headquarters\u2014we outgrew the old premises.\u201d</p><p>All of which, Ria knew, meant she\u2019d never get the job. Changeling packs looked after their own, sticking together like glue. Sure they\u2019d helped clean up the city, making it safer for everyone, but as Emmett had explained, that had more to do with holding territory than anything else.</p><p>Tired, dispirited, and hungry, she walked into a neighborhood restaurant run by a family she\u2019d seen at community functions, and grabbed a seat.</p><p>Emmett took the chair opposite hers.</p><p>\u201cYou order,\u201d he said, scanning the room.</p><p>She was telling the waitress\u2014who also happened to be the owner\u2019s daughter\u2014that she wanted cashew chicken, when Emmett moved across the table to smash her and the waitress both to the ground. A split second later, she heard a loud pop followed by a scream. Emmett was already up and</p><p>speaking on his cell. \u201cHe\u2019s heading out, past the candy shop\u2014\u201d He ran toward the door.</p><p>Getting up, Ria helped the shaken waitress to her feet. Emmett was back before she\u2019d finished. \u201cYou hurt?\u201d His hands swept over her body.</p><p>Aware of several interested glances, she slapped them off. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She turned to check on the waitress and got the same answer in response. \u201cWhat</p><p>happened?\u201d she asked Emmett.</p><p>He pointed behind her. A large hole marred the previously pristine wall. \u201cBullet.\u201d His jaw was a brutal line, his eyes . . . his eyes.</p><p>Stepping instinctively closer, she put her hand on his chest. \u201cEmmett.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down, those incredible green-gold eyes, leopard eyes, looking out at her from a human face. His hand cupped her cheek. \u201cYou have a</p><p>scratch here.\u201d A thumb stroking gently over a hurt she didn\u2019t even feel, his gaze predator-cold.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how she knew what to do. She just did. Instead of fighting off his hold as she had earlier, she leaned into him, slipping her arms around his waist. His own came around her at almost the same instant, and he squeezed her close, until she could barely breathe. But she held on, held tight.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how long they stood wrapped around each other, but when he did finally release her, the fear in the restaurant had turned to</p><p>speculation. Likely, her grandmother and mother would be hearing all about it in the time it took to type a text message. She didn\u2019t care. Because the leopard was gone from Emmett\u2019s eyes, his rage under control.</p><p>He tapped her cheek. \u201cGrab your purse. This place needs to be looked at by our techs, and I want you safe at home.\u201d</p><p>Realizing he wanted to start tracking the shooter as soon as possible, Ria didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>Emmett\u2019s eyes were hyperalert as they began to head out of the restaurant, his big body vibrating with protectiveness.</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked over her shoulder. It was the waitress Emmett had taken down\u2014the woman ran over, a bag of take-out containers in hand. Her smile was a little wary as it flicked to Emmett, but her gratitude clear. \u201cThank you.\u201d She shook her head when Emmett, the majority of his attention clearly on ensuring no more nasty surprises, went to grab his wallet. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift. My father was in the army. He says that bullet would\u2019ve hit me first.\u201d She pressed the bag into Ria\u2019s hands. \u201cPlease take this.\u201d</p><p>Ria accepted it, understanding the family\u2019s need to give something back to the man who\u2019d saved their child\u2019s life. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled and looked up at Emmett. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome at our table at any time.\u201d</p><p>Emmett gave a short nod. Ria wondered if he understood the value of the invitation. She could\u2019ve let it go, but that wasn\u2019t who she was\u2014she asked him about it as they walked home at a rapid clip.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, his voice tense as he scanned the area. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on building relationships with the folks around here, but it\u2019s been a slow process. You\u2019re very insular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about the big, fat charcoaled pot calling the kettle black.\u201d</p><p>An unworried shrug, no smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t say we didn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople like DarkRiver cats,\u201d she said, wondering why that damn arrogance was sexy on him. \u201cYou\u2019ve cleaned things up so the shopkeepers feel safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting to get friendlier smiles,\u201d he told her, \u201cbut that\u2019s all going to be fucked to hell if Vincent and his gang of thugs start shooting holes in</p><p>defenseless people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a feeling they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re up against.\u201d</p><p>A hard glance. \u201cYou got that right, mink.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond but they\u2019d arrived at her family home and Amber was waiting in the doorway, cell phone in hand. \u201cShe\u2019s home!\u201d her sister-in-law said into the slim white device as soon as she spotted Ria. \u201cNo, she\u2019s safe.</p><p>Emmett\u2019s with her.\u201d</p><p>All but lifting Ria inside, Emmett ordered Amber to shut the door. \u201cAnd stay inside.\u201d He was gone before Ria could say anything else.</p><p>Blowing out a breath, she took the phone Amber was holding out. \u201cMom, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She repeated that for the next ten minutes, until Alex finally calmed down. By that time, her grandmother had prepared tea, brought out two giant hunks of Mr.</p><p>Wong\u2019s famous Divine Madeira Cake, and begun to make her</p><p>special sweet black-sesame soup, one of Ria\u2019s favorites.</p><p>\u201cSit!\u201d she said when Amber began to stand up as if to help.</p><p>Amber sat with a thankful groan. \u201cThe baby\u2019s kicking so hard. Want to feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ria scooted over. Amber was a great sister-in-law, but she was also intensely private.</p><p>This kind of an invitation didn\u2019t come often. Placing her hand on Amber\u2019s abdomen, she stayed very still. Miaoling\u2019s future great-grand(gender unknown) didn\u2019t keep Ria waiting. She felt two very distinct thuds.</p><p>\u201cWow, I think I felt the shape of a foot.\u201d</p><p>Amber laughed. \u201cProbably. Baby Wembley has a future as a football player. Fitting really, given the family name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell Jet,\u201d Ria teased, biting into her cake. The familiar taste was as welcome as a hug, soft and comforting. \u201cHe\u2019s hoping for a golf buddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Ria?\u201d Breaking off a piece of her own slice, Amber brought it to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou thinking of popping out any golf buddies sometime</p><p>soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmber!\u201d Ria fell back, laughing. \u201cWhere do you think I\u2019m going to get the other half of the equation now that the Great Match is done for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Amber\u2019s eyes turned sly. \u201cBut I know a cat who looks at you like he wants to eat you up, then come back for seconds.\u201d</p><p>Ria was still gasping at the scandalous comment from her\u2014usually\u2014shy sister-in-law, when Miaoling began laughing. Slapping her thigh, she laughed</p><p>so hard that Ria could do nothing but join in. \u201cYou heard\u201d\u2014she sobbed between bursts that left her stomach aching\u2014\u201cwhat Jet said. They don\u2019t get</p><p>serious with humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says?\u201d Amber\u2019s eyes were shiny with humor. \u201cJust because we don\u2019t know about any.\u201d</p><p>That cut off Ria\u2019s laughter. She sat back. Thought about it. Shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019d have heard. I\u2019d have heard at the college.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily,\u201d Amber argued. \u201cThey don\u2019t exactly advertise things. I\u2019d say I\u2019d never met a more closemouthed lot, but . . .\u201d She waved a hand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ria blew out a breath. \u201cI can\u2019t ask him. You know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Miaoling asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause then he\u2019d think I was hinting at something!\u201d</p> <p>Her grandmother gave her a gimlet-eyed glance. \u201cIf you don\u2019t hint, how\u2019s he going to know?\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s mind flooded with the memories of her pressed up against that gym door, his hand stroking over her, his tongue in her mouth. \u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Amber said. \u201cChangelings have a better sense of smell than humans. He can probably scent your you-know-what.\u201d</p><p>Ria stared. \u201cAmber, what\u2019s come over you?\u201d</p><p>Her sister-in-law picked up another piece of cake. \u201cI\u2019m going to blame it on the pregnancy.\u201d A slow grin.</p> <p>SEVEN</p><p>Emmett\u2019s blood was at fever point. Returning to the restaurant, he caught the scent of the shooter and began tracking. Dorian and Clay had both picked up the trail while he escorted Ria home, but this was his hunt.</p><p>His fingers remembered the soft feel of Ria\u2019s skin, the delicate roughness of the scratch that shouldn\u2019t have been on her face. The leopard paced</p><p>inside his skull, wanting out, wanting to do damage, but Emmett held on to his humanity. For now.</p><p>Minutes later, he found both Dorian and Clay standing frustrated at a busy intersection.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Emmett said, sensing what they had. The shooter\u2019s scent simply disappeared.</p> <p>\u201cProbably someone waiting to pick him up,\u201d Dorian muttered, looking around. \u201cNo CCTV</p><p>cameras in this area. We need to fix that.\u201d</p><p>Emmett narrowed his eyes, making a slow circuit of all four points of the intersection. It was clogged with people. \u201cCan\u2019t have been a pickup. It\u2019d be too hard to make a quick getaway,\u201d he muttered almost to himself . . . and looked up.</p><p>The old-fashioned fire escape ladder hung a few feet off the ground, just far enough up to confuse the scent trail with this many people around. Landing on the ladder with a single powerful jump, he began to follow the fading trail with the fluid grace of the leopard he was. No human could ever hope to match a predatory changeling moving at full speed.</p><p>Making it to the top of the building in seconds, he pursued the scent to the other side.</p><p>Another ladder, this one looking down into a small parklike area thronged with elders playing what looked like a combination of mahjong and chess. Ignoring the ladder, he jumped straight to the ground, making several people scream. His cat ensured he landed on his feet, his body perfectly balanced.</p><p>Again, the scent was muddied by the number of people in the park. But worse, a few meters later it was overwhelmed totally by the strong disinfectant used to sanitize the nearby automated public toilets. Swearing under his breath, he did a circle of the park and came up with nothing. Frustration clawed at him. He was certain this was where the shooter had been picked up\u2014on one of these narrow streets.</p><p>Thrusting a hand through his hair, he was striding back the way he\u2019d come when an old man waved him over. \u201cHere\u2014he left his motorcycle parked on</p> <p>the footpath. Very rude.\u201d A piece of paper was put into his hand.</p><p>Opening it, he found a license plate number. Hot damn. \u201cThanks.\u201d His cell phone was in his hand an instant later. The elderly man waved away his</p><p>thanks and went back to his game even as Emmett fed the tip through to the DarkRiver techs. Changelings had made it their business to be up-to-date on all technology known to man\u2014because if the coldly powerful Psy had a weakness, it was that they relied too much on their machines.</p><p>But that technical knowledge also came in handy when DarkRiver needed to hack into Enforcement databases. Emmett had an address to go with the license plate five minutes later. Assembling a team took only a further three minutes\u2014Lucas, Vaughn, and Clay, with Dorian holding a surveillance</p><p>position. The young soldier was turning into one hell of a sharpshooter.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re we doing this?\u201d Lucas asked as they got out of their vehicle a short distance from the shooter\u2019s home, his eyes cold.</p><p>\u201cI want the bastard alive,\u201d Emmett said through gritted teeth. \u201cWe need to get Vincent\u2019s location.\u201d He glanced at Lucas. \u201cWe\u2019re skating way past the edge of the law here.\u201d Changelings had jurisdiction over crimes that involved their kind, but this shooter was most likely human. \u201cIt\u2019s daylight\u2014we\u2019ll be seen.\u201d</p><p>His alpha shrugged. \u201cLet me handle that.\u201d</p><p>Trusting his word, Emmett gave the signal and they fanned out, coming in at the suspect\u2019s dirty trailer from all sides. The bike sat near the back\u2014and it was sticky with the scent Emmett had detected at the restaurant.</p><p>Even that close, no one shot out at them, and a couple of seconds later, Emmett\u2019s leopard picked up a new scent. Blood. Fresh and thick.</p><p>\u201cGoddammit,\u201d he muttered under his breath, knowing what they\u2019d find. He was right.</p><p>The shooter lay slumped over a rickety table, the back of his head blown off execution style.</p><p>\u201cVincent knew we\u2019d picked up his scent,\u201d Lucas said,</p><p>taking in the scene from the doorway beside Emmett. \u201cI bet that blood is still warm.\u201d</p><p>They both stepped back out, Emmett\u2019s frustration making him want to kick something. \u201cThink there might be intel in there that could lead us to Vincent?\u201d</p><p>Lucas nodded at the neighbors in the surrounding trailers, a few of whom were openly staring. \u201cWe can\u2019t risk going in and giving the cops a reason to hassle us. As it is, these folks saw us open the door, stand in the doorway. No harm, no foul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let it bother you,\u201d Clay said, breaking his customary silence. \u201cThis guy, he was expendable. They\u2019d have told him squat.\u201d</p><p>Emmett tried to believe that as he circled the trailer.</p><p>A hint of movement in his peripheral vision, prey breaking into a run.</p><p>He didn\u2019t even think about it, shifting into hard pursuit between one second and the next. The skinny guy in front of him didn\u2019t look back as he snaked</p><p>through the trailer park. Not until he passed a group of children kicking around a dusty soccer ball. Emmett\u2019s gut chilled as the man\u2019s hand came up. \u201cGet down!\u201d he yelled, thrusting himself into an incredible burst of speed. Slamming into the shooter\u2019s arm, he pushed it up just as the man fired. The shot was silent, the bullet lost in the sky.</p><p>The shooter was already moving, using his body with the fluid grace of an experienced street fighter. His fist hit Emmett\u2019s cheek with enough force to jerk it back, but Emmett didn\u2019t let go of the man\u2019s wrist, holding the gun pointed up, even as he used his free elbow to hit the assassin\u2019s jaw. The bastard didn\u2019t go down.</p><p>Fuck it. Emmett squeezed the man\u2019s wrist, crushing his fragile human bones.</p><p>With a scream, the shooter dropped to his knees, the gun falling out of his hand. \u201cKeep an eye on it,\u201d Emmett ordered Vaughn.</p><p>The jaguar nodded and made sure any kids who hadn\u2019t already scattered got the hell out.</p><p>Emmett kept his hand around the shooter\u2019s wrist as the</p><p>whimpering male knelt in the dust. This one, Emmett thought, would know something about Vincent. Dropping into a crouch, he met the man\u2019s shiny-wet eyes. \u201cTell me what I want to know,\u201d he said very quietly, \u201cor I\u2019ll crush your wrist so badly, they\u2019ll never be able to put it back together.\u201d</p><p>The man spat at him. \u201cI\u2019ll get a cloned replacement.\u201d</p><p>Emmett heard the faint sound of Enforcement sirens and knew he had a couple of minutes at most. Leaning close, he deliberately let his eyes go cat, his claws shooting out. Then he smiled. \u201cYou know, they\u2019re not very good at cloning eyes.\u201d</p><p>He touched a claw to the very edge of the man\u2019s right eye.</p><p>\u201cFunny how a claw can accidentally blind a man during fighting.\u201d</p><p>Fear burned off the shooter, acrid and thick. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. There\u2019re witnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>He watched as the man turned . . . to see only closed doors and shuttered windows.</p><p>\u201cYou threatened their kids,\u201d Emmett whispered. \u201cWho do you think\u2019s going to come forward to save you?\u201d He pressed in the claw until the edge actually touched the delicate surface.</p><p>The fear turned into sheer terror. \u201cI\u2019ll answer your questions!\u201d</p><p>Emmett asked them hard and fast. By the time Enforcement arrived, the Crew male was so grateful to see them, he confessed to the shooting just to get away from Emmett. The cops looked like they wanted to take Emmett in, too, but all of a sudden, there were twenty witnesses who\u2019d seen everything</p><p>\u2014and who swore Emmett was a hero.</p><p>Faced with that many enthusiastic supporters, the cops gave up. One older female met Emmett\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to crush his wrist.\u201d It wasn\u2019t censure, more a question.</p><p>Emmett raised an eyebrow.</p><p>She smiled and walked off. Right into Dorian.</p><p>The blond soldier grinned. \u201cHow about you let me buy you dinner?\u201d</p><p>The cop laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re adorable. But I gave up cradle robbing a few years back.\u201d</p><p>Dorian was unabashed. Walking over to Emmett after the woman left, he folded his arms.</p><p>\u201cSooooo . . . what happens if I flirt with Ria?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI use your ribs to make a wind chime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>Emmett told the others what the assassin had revealed. \u201cVincent stays out of sight by living in a mobile home\u2014it\u2019s a hover-truck, black, with constantly changing license plates. But it\u2019s shiny, all tricked out. The bastard likes living in style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll make it easier to spot him,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cWe\u2019ll start circulating the description.</p><p>Someone will talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe also said Vincent has a stockpile of weapons, so we need to be ready for what he might do when cornered.\u201d The bastard wouldn\u2019t care who he hit.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got connections to one of the big crime families up north\u2014this is a test run. We don\u2019t kick him out, we\u2019re going to have more problems.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the human gangs we need to worry about\u2014we don\u2019t handle this challenge right, other changeling groups are going to start looking at our territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s make sure we take care of business.\u201d</p><p>Emmett spent the rest of the day ensuring his more shadowy informants knew to look out for the truck. By the time night fell, there was only one thing he wanted to do . . . and only one person he wanted to do it with.</p> <p>Unfortunately, though his split lip had healed with changeling speed, he still had a fairly impressive black eye. No way in hell would Ria\u2019s family let him in through the front door, especially at this time of night. If it had been his daughter, Emmett thought with a twist in his heart, he\u2019d have done the same. But that didn\u2019t mean he was going to stay away from Ria.</p><p>Finding his way to the back of the two-story house that was the Wembley home, he nodded at Nate, on watch that shift, and looked up at the window that he knew faced out from Ria\u2019s bedroom. Nate gave him an interested look. \u201cWall\u2019s got no handholds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I can hook myself up to that window,\u201d Emmett said, working out the mechanics, \u201cI can get up.\u201d</p><p>The other man judged the gap. \u201cDoable.\u201d</p><p>Decision made, Emmett backed up until he had enough distance, kicked himself into gear and jumped. The leopard made sure he caught the ledge he</p> <p>aimed for, and from there, it was a fairly simple climb. Holding himself up with one hand on the lower edge of Ria\u2019s darkened window, while his feet found precarious purchase on the slight ledge of the kitchen window below, he tapped on the glass.</p><p>Silence. Then a shush of sound, as if she was wearing something that trailed on the floor.</p><p>His mind filled with a thousand erotic images, but the window didn\u2019t go up. Instead, he heard Nate\u2019s phone ring. Ria was being very careful. Smiling as he heard the sentinel answer, he waited.</p><p>The window went up a few seconds later. \u201cAre you insane?\u201d Ria hissed, sticking out her head. \u201cHow are you even staying up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot easily,\u201d he said with a grin, the stress of the day wiped away by the sight of her all sleep mussed and kissable. \u201cLet me in?\u201d</p><p>Pulling back, she waved him in. \u201cDear God, Emmett,\u201d she said the instant he was inside.</p> <p>\u201cYou could\u2019ve fallen and broken your fool neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a leopard, mink. Climbing\u2019s my thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think leopards evolved to climb two-storied\u2014\u201d A gasp and she nudged his face toward the light coming in through the window. \u201cWhat</p><p>happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t dodge fast enough.\u201d He pushed down the window, knowing Nate wouldn\u2019t be able to hear anything now if they kept their voices low. \u201cMy own</p><p>fault.\u201d</p><p>Ria slapped a hand on his chest. \u201cI want a straight answer. Talk.\u201d</p><p>He fingered the strap of her ankle-length satin nightgown. The material looked soft and utterly silky. He wanted to gather it up in his hands and bare something even softer and silkier.</p> <p>\u201cEmmett!\u201d A low whisper, but her eyes were snapping fire.</p><p>Sliding his hands down her arms, he tugged her closer. \u201cWho wants to talk?\u201d He dropped his head, nuzzled the scent of her into his lungs.</p><p>Feminine heat and a delicate, exotic perfume.</p><p>Licking out to taste it was instinct. He wanted to know everything about his mate. The leopard smiled at the easy, absolute realization. Of course she was his mate. Why the hell else would he have climbed up that damn wall? Only for Ria. \u201cI like your perfume.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered. \u201cYou\u2019re being bad again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you buy it for me?\u201d He stroked his hands down her back, pressing her softness against the pounding heat of his cock.</p><p>\u201cI-I had it from a gift set.\u201d She tangled her hands in his hair. \u201cIt said it\u2019s formulated for changelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Nibbling his way up from her neck to her lips, he took her mouth in a slow, lazy kiss.</p><p>\u201cOur sense of smell is so strong, normal perfume is too</p><p>intense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even smell this one,\u201d she murmured against his lips. \u201cGuess you\u2019ll have to buy my perfume for me.\u201d</p><p>His cat purred, wondering if she realized what she\u2019d just given away. \u201cI\u2019m going to buy you bubble bath, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett.\u201d A moan.</p><p>He kissed it away. \u201cDoes your door have a lock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She pressed her lips to the pulse in his neck. \u201cBut it\u2019s not set.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, he swept her up into his arms and carried her to the door. \u201cDo it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay please.\u201d</p><p>He looked down into that teasing face and gave in to the urge to bite, sinking his teeth\u2014very carefully\u2014into the sensitive spot between shoulder and</p><p>neck. She trembled, and he felt the lock turn. \u201cHow quiet?\u201d he asked, licking over the mark as he carried her to the bed.</p><p>\u201cMy mother has ears like a bat.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, he dropped her lightly on the mattress, coming down on top of her as she finished the sentence. She was all soft and curvy under him, the</p><p>satin of her nightgown delicious torture. He ran his hand down the side. It snagged. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>His hands were rough, calloused, nothing like her creamy</p><p>flesh.</p><p>\u201cI love your hands, Emmett.\u201d It was an intimate whisper in the night-dark of her room.</p><p>He looked down into those intelligent eyes, and knew he was lost. Raising himself off her and to the side, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to mess up your pretty nightgown. Pull it up for me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, but her hands moved to the satin, pulling it up with slow, sensual tugs. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d He cupped her knee as it was revealed, waiting for more, for everything.</p><p>\u201cYou going to mess up my interviews next time, too?\u201d</p><p>The sweet slope of her thigh. \u201cProbably.\u201d He stroked his hand up, knew he\u2019d have to taste.</p><p>A soft moan, her leg rising slightly, that knee bending as she rubbed her foot on the sheet.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do this to me?\u201d</p><p>Shifting his hand fully between her legs, he cupped her.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>Her gasp was almost silent this time, her body rising in a sinuous curve. Tempted beyond measure, he leaned in to steal another kiss. \u201cThe same way you do it to me.\u201d She was so damp and hot under his palm that it was all he could do not to tear off her panties and slide his fingers into liquid-soft flesh.</p><p>Her hands tugged at his T-shirt. \u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>He considered it. \u201cI\u2019ll have to move my hand.\u201d And he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Ria\u2019s lips parted. \u201cYour eyes have gone leopard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can smell you, all slick and luscious and ready.\u201d He pressed the heel of his hand against the enticement of her, teasing, playing, caressing.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed. \u201cEmmett\u201d\u2014a husky order\u2014\u201cif you don\u2019t get that T-shirt off, I\u2019m not going to be responsible for my actions.\u201d</p><p>Moving his hand with reluctance, he pulled off the T-shirt, then got rid of the rest of his clothing\u2014he wanted no more interruptions. Ria\u2019s eyes went wide as he came down beside her again, his hand closing over her thigh. \u201cI want to rip off your panties.\u201d</p><p>Those gorgeous eyes went impossibly wider. \u201cIf you promise to buy me a replacement pair.\u201d</p><p>He froze, so aroused he could barely see straight. Burying his head against her neck, he breathed deep. It only twisted the coils more strongly around him. And those coils were soft, feminine, erotic beyond all measure. Fingers tensing, he tore off the scrap of fabric that had so tormented him.</p><p>Ria arched up and he took her mouth again, addicted to the sugar and spice taste of her.</p><p>Under his fingers, she was pure feminine seduction, hot and slick with need. But he wasn\u2019t ready to end this. Continuing to play his fingers between her legs, he licked and kissed his way down her throat, and over the satin to the hollow of her breasts. Her chest rose and fell in jagged breaths, her hand sliding through his hair.</p><p>\u201cEmmett.\u201d Her voice was husky, her passion unhidden.</p><p>Not yet, he told himself, and flicked his fingers over her clit, making her body jerk. When she tugged on his hair, he refused to go up. Instead, he closed his mouth over her nipple, sucking hard through the delicate satin of her gown. Her fingers clenched and unclenched convulsively, her entire body twisting as if it wanted to escape . . . and get closer at the same time.</p><p>Sensing that she was riding the fine edge of pleasure, Emmett slipped two fingers into her tight sheath, stroking her to trembling release. She bit his shoulder to muffle her cry, inciting the leopard to primal possessiveness. Petting her down from the orgasm, he moved to cover her body with his, one hand on the pillow beside her head, the other tangled in her hair as he tugged her back for an almost savage kiss.</p><p>She opened to him immediately, her arms wrapping around him. He nipped at her mouth and tore the straps of her gown, pushing down the material so he could close his hand over the sweet roundness of her breast. When he released her mouth, she pulled him back down. Growling low in his throat, he gave her what she wanted, molding her breast under his hand. She was so lush that he wanted to bite. Next time, he promised himself.</p><p>This time, his patience was at its limit.</p><p>Nudging apart her thighs, he nipped at her lower lip. \u201cPut those pretty legs around my waist, mink.\u201d</p><p>An exquisite slide of soft feminine flesh as she gave him what he wanted. Then she gave him more, pressing her lips to his throat, nibbling on him with delicate possession as he fought not to thrust inside her in a single hard push. Shuddering, he ran one hand down her back to tilt her at just the right angle.</p><p>And then he was sliding in, the liquid heat of her almost scorching. Gritting his teeth, he clenched his hand on the pillow and pushed, slow and easy.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he choked out, \u201cI get to go fast.\u201d</p><p>Gripping his biceps, Ria drew in a deep breath. \u201cSo long as you don\u2019t get any bigger . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Emmett.\u201d The last was a moan as he buried himself to the hilt.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move for several seconds, knowing he was a big man. But then Ria began to shift beneath him in slow rolling movements that drove him out of his mind. The leopard took control and he only just had the presence of mind to take her mouth in a kiss before he surrendered to the driving hunger to take, to mark.</p><p>Mine, he thought, mine.</p> <p>A moment later, even that thought was lost.</p><p>Ria stared at the ceiling over the muscled slope of Emmett\u2019s shoulder. He was heavy, but she didn\u2019t mind being squashed. Not right now. Not when her body was so loose and sated, she felt like a big lazy cat herself. Which, she thought, was exactly what Emmett was acting like. He sprawled over her . . .</p><p>inside her.</p><p>Her cheeks heated. How could she still be shy after what they\u2019d done? But well, she hadn\u2019t expected him to start revving up for a second go so fast.</p><p>\u201cFast recovery time?\u201d she asked, not quite sure where she found the sass.</p> <p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d It was a rumble against her throat.</p><p>She ran her fingers through his hair, smiling.</p><p>\u201cRia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you a virgin?\u201d</p><p>The question made her cheeks burn. \u201cTechnically.\u201d</p> <p>He sounded a little choked as he said, \u201cTechnically?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m twenty-two, Emmett. Just because I chose to wait for the right man doesn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t curious.\u201d She thought she might have shocked him when he remained silent for several long minutes.</p><p>She should\u2019ve known better.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you keep the stuff you used to satisfy your curiosity?\u201d</p><p>Her throat dried up. \u201cNever you mind.\u201d</p><p>A squeeze of her hip. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>Her heart tumbled over. This man, she thought, could enslave her. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d She didn\u2019t know if she could survive the eroticism.</p><p>Emmett grazed her throat with his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll buy you some. And make you open them in front of me.\u201d</p><p>Her mind overloaded. She felt her body ready itself for another ride, and dear Lord she wanted it. \u201cLess talk, more action, pussycat.\u201d</p><p>That got her a pinch on the butt, a low male growl, and all the action she could\u2019ve hoped for.</p><p>Ria couldn\u2019t meet her mother\u2019s eyes the next morning. Not because she was ashamed\u2014how could she possibly be ashamed of the glory of what she\u2019d</p><p>done with Emmett? The sex was one thing, but he\u2019d been so affectionate afterward, not leaving until almost dawn. She\u2019d felt petted and adored.</p><p>That was the reason she couldn\u2019t meet Alex\u2019s eyes. She was sure her mother would spot the bubbling joy in her, the certain knowledge that she was in love with a man who was almost perfect. And that almost, she thought with a frown, might yet be a big problem. She had more interviews lined up this week, and while Emmett had hinted that they were close to catching Vincent, that still left her with a bodyguard.</p><p>The phone rang as Alex was muttering about it being nine already. Since the shop opened at ten, she had plenty of time to get there, but Alex didn\u2019t like being late. \u201cI\u2019ll grab it,\u201d Amber said, having just walked into the room. \u201cHello? Yes, she\u2019s here. One moment.\u201d She held out the phone to Ria, mouthing DarkRiver Construction.</p><p>Ready to hear the bad news, Ria took the receiver, not bothering to step out of the kitchen/dining room\u2014Alex, Amber, and Miaoling would simply follow her. \u201cRia speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lucas Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Her eyes narrowed. \u201cMay I ask a question?\u201d</p><p>A chuckle. \u201cNo. Ask Emmett.\u201d</p><p>That was the problem, Ria thought. Emmett wouldn\u2019t answer her questions. His protectiveness was starting to get on her nerves\u2014even the nerves that loved the bejesus out of him. \u201cThen what can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about sorting out my filing system?\u201d</p><p>Excitement shot through her . . . before coming to a crashing halt. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cRia, this has nothing to do with anything else. I\u2019m an ice-cold bastard when it comes to business\u2014I need an assistant who can deliver the goods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the fact that I\u2019d be protected at DarkRiver HQ is coincidence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. If you suck at your job, I\u2019ll boot you out after the probationary period.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that delighted her. \u201cI,\u201d she said, starting to grin, \u201cam very good at what I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen when can you start?\u201d</p><p>Ria blinked. \u201cToday if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you when you arrive.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Ria looked into three pairs of avidly interested eyes. The symmetry of it struck her deep in the heart. Miaoling, with her wise, laughing gaze.</p><p>Alex, so energetic and impatient. Amber, with both Miaoling\u2019s sense of calm and a slight wickedness it took even friends and family a long time to see.</p><p>Smile cracking her face, Ria pumped her fist in a victory salute before jumping over to do a little dance around the three most important women in her life. Alex opened up a bottle of champagne she\u2019d secreted away\u2014though Amber had to be satisfied with grape juice\u2014and did a toast. \u201cHere\u2019s to my daughter. Much too smart for that imbecile, Tom.\u201d</p><p>Emmett walked into Lucas\u2019s office area and winked at the assistant sitting primly at her desk.</p><p>\u201cBoss in?\u201d \u201cYou look like a hoodlum,\u201d he was told, before Ria got up and came over. \u201cDid you even brush your hair after you showered?\u201d She was threading her fingers through that hair as she spoke.</p><p>Emmett savored the feel of her so close. Hearing Lucas\u2019s door open, he bent down, picked Ria up, and planted a bone-tingling kiss on her lips.</p><p>She was panting for breath by the time he finished, her cheeks adorably red. \u201cEmmett! I\u2019m at work.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, he met Lucas\u2019s eyes over the top of her head. His alpha held up his hands, his amusement open. \u201cWe ready to go?\u201d</p><p>Emmett nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s parked about half an hour out of the city.\u201d</p><p>Ria looked between the two men. \u201cVincent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Emmett said as Lucas made a signal that he\u2019d be out in a minute and walked back into his office. \u201cBastard\u2019s ass is toast.\u201d</p><p>Ria put a hand on his chest. \u201cAre you going in with lots of backup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, mink. I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett!\u201d Her voice was a whip.</p><p>Surprised, he looked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me not to worry! Don\u2019t pat me on the head as if I\u2019m a brainless bimbo and tell me everything\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d She poked him with a finger.</p><p>\u201cIf we\u2019re going to be in a relationship\u2014\u201d Snapping her mouth shut, she folded her arms and returned to her desk.</p><p>Stupefied, he prowled after her. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be in a relationship, then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d She began to order papers on her desk. \u201cJust don\u2019t get yourself killed. That would make me seriously angry.\u201d</p><p>He knew that wasn\u2019t it. Grabbing her arm, he pulled her toward him. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving till you tell me what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>Ria looked toward Lucas\u2019s open doorway. \u201cThis is not the time and place.\u201d</p><p>He waited.</p><p>She blew out a breath. \u201cAre we in a relationship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think last night was?\u201d This was one of those times when he didn\u2019t get women.</p><p>Scratch that. When he didn\u2019t get his woman.</p><p>\u201cWell, men don\u2019t necessarily equate sex with a relationship.\u201d It was a whisper, her eyes flicking to Lucas\u2019s door again.</p><p>Emmett decided not to remind her that Luc could probably hear everything anyway. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t sex, Ria. That was fucking-amazing-sex.\u201d He grinned at her blush. \u201cAnd I equate everything I do with you to a relationship. Try going out with another man and see where it gets you.\u201d</p><p>She tried for a glare but a smile peeked out. \u201cGo. Be careful.\u201d A tight hug. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss the other stuff when you\u2019re back safe and sound. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>He walked out with the scent of her bound into his very skin, her promise in his ears.</p><p>Ria found herself escorted home by an older man called Cian that day. \u201cAny word?\u201d she asked him as they reached the front door.</p><p>A shake of his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll move until a few hours after dark.\u201d</p><p>Something about Cian struck Ria as oddly familiar, but she was sure he\u2019d never been on protection detail before. \u201cWill you let me know if you learn anything?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were warm when he looked at her. \u201cOf course, Ria.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she thanked him and walked inside. Her father had beaten everyone home and was at the stove, concocting his (in)famous secret spaghetti sauce. \u201cHey, Dad.\u201d She bussed him on the cheek. \u201cWhere\u2019s Amber?\u201d she asked, guessing her grandmother was catching a nap as she sometimes did.</p><p>\u201cShe thought she might be having contractions\u2014Jet came home and took her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>Ria stopped in the process of taking off her coat. \u201cIs she in labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoctor thinks it\u2019s false, but he\u2019s keeping her there for a couple of hours to make sure.\u201d He touched his back pocket. \u201cJet\u2019s gonna buzz me if it looks like my grandbaby\u2019s going to come early.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, she hung up her coat and went to stand by his side, sliding one arm around his waist. \u201cSmells good.\u201d</p><p>He put his free arm around her shoulders. \u201cSo, you involved with that cat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She\u2019d never lied to her father. Skirted around the truth maybe, but never lied. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about him.\u201d</p><p>A sigh. \u201cInvite him to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can grill him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what fathers do.\u201d A squeeze of her shoulders. \u201cI only want what\u2019s best for you. Have you considered how this man is going to support you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ria didn\u2019t point out that she could support herself. That wasn\u2019t the issue at hand. \u201cWell, when he\u2019s not acting as a DarkRiver soldier, he has another job.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d discovered that sometime last night\u2014even now, the memory of Emmett\u2019s lazy voice murmuring the answers to all the little questions she had about him was enough to make her body flush.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p> <p>NINE</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She drew it out, knowing it would drive her father Ycrazy.</p><p>\u201cRia.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she met his scowling eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s an engineer.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s eyebrows climbed to his hairline. \u201cWho does he work for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDarkRiver Construction. He specializes in making sure buildings are built to withstand seismic events.\u201d That was how he\u2019d put it, sounding far more academic than she\u2019d expected. It had been obvious in that single sentence that he not only knew what he was doing, but that he loved his work. \u201cHe</p><p>trained with Angus Wittier.\u201d Wittier was considered the premier expert on seismic-proof building in the country.</p><p>Simon nodded, his face contemplative. \u201cPass me the oregano and go get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill the spaghetti be ready soon?\u201d She wasn\u2019t hungry, her stomach in knots as she waited to hear the outcome of the DarkRiver-Crew showdown, but</p><p>she wanted to keep the emotional temperature mellow for her father. Simon only cooked spaghetti when he was stressed\u2014Amber\u2019s situation was clearly worrying him more than he\u2019d admitted.</p><p>\u201cTen minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll set the table after I change.\u201d Walking up to her bedroom, she closed the door before calling Jet. \u201cHow\u2019s Amber?\u201d she asked when her brother</p><p>answered.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s okay right now, resting.\u201d His voice was soft. \u201cTell Mom and Dad not to worry\u2014the doctor says everything\u2019s super with the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHah,\u201d she said, with a smile. \u201cYou know how they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll keep them calm, Ri-ri.\u201d Said with absolute confidence. \u201cI\u2019ll call you as soon as anything changes.\u201d</p><p>Hanging up, Ria changed, and then did what Jet had expected her to do\u2014she made sure everyone remained calm\u2014though her own emotions had her</p><p>feeling incredibly fragile beneath the surface. What if something happened to Emmett? No, she told herself, somehow managing to maintain her</p><p>composed facade even when Amber suddenly went into labor and the entire family rushed to the hospital, escorted by a trio of DarkRiver soldiers.</p> <p>They were walking past the emergency room when several ambulances came screaming in.</p><p>Ria recognized the shock of white-blond hair on the</p><p>stretcher they pulled out of the back of one vehicle. \u201cDorian,\u201d she whispered, looking for Emmett\u2019s big form. He wasn\u2019t there. But Dorian was bleeding, the red stark against the pale gold of his skin. \u201cPopo\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo.\u201d Miaoling squeezed her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of your mom.\u201d</p><p>Cian by her side, Ria ran to the fallen DarkRiver soldier, slipping her hand into his as the medical team worked around her. \u201cHold on, Dorian.\u201d He was unconscious, but she felt as if he knew she was there. She turned to Cian. \u201cTamsyn?\u201d</p><p>A nurse pushed Ria out of the way as they wheeled Dorian into an operating theatre.</p><p>Turning, she found Cian on the phone. \u201cShe\u2019s almost here,\u201d he told her, putting the phone in his pocket. Tiny lines of concern fanned out from the corners of his pale blue eyes.</p><p>Tamsyn ran in mere minutes later, a slender blonde female by her side. While the healer ran through to prep for the operating theatre, the woman halted beside Cian. The soldier immediately put his arm around her shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at Tammy\u2019s when the call came in,\u201d the woman said, pushing back her hair.</p><p>The instant Ria saw her eyes, all the pieces fell into place. The way Cian moved, the way he spoke, no wonder it had seemed familiar. \u201cYou\u2019re Emmett\u2019s parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you must be Ria. I\u2019m Keelie.\u201d Emmett\u2019s mother\u2019s smile was wide, those whiskey-colored eyes she\u2019d bequeathed her son as bright as diamonds.</p><p>Ria didn\u2019t even think about shaking hands. She walked forward and into open arms. The hug was tight. \u201cHave you heard from Emmett?\u201d Keelie asked.</p><p>Surprised that Keelie expected Emmett to call her first, Ria shook her head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d Her phone rang at that very instant. Pulling it out, she put it to her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way to the hospital, mink. Don\u2019t faint.\u201d</p><p>She felt her stomach drop. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Emmett, if you\u2019ve been shot\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a flesh wound. You can kiss it better.\u201d His tone was warm, a caress across her skin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come by after I stop in at the hospital\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d she interrupted him. \u201cAmber\u2019s in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProblems?\u201d Sharp concern.</p><p>Her heart clenched. \u201cIt\u2019s a couple of weeks too early, but the doctor said he didn\u2019t foresee any difficulties.\u201d She took a shuddering breath, trying to convince herself of that. \u201cI\u2019m in the ER. I saw Dorian being brought in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Blondie okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTamsyn\u2019s in there with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took a bullet through the ribs\u2014don\u2019t think it hit anything major. Hold on. Be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Closing the phone, she turned to share what he\u2019d said with Keelie and Cian, but the couple shook their heads. \u201cWe heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett\u2019ll get you an earpiece,\u201d Keelie said. \u201cIt\u2019s what the other human members of the pack use when they want to have private conversations.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s curiosity momentarily overwhelmed her worry. \u201cYou have human members?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Keelie smiled. \u201cI guess people must assume they\u2019re cats.\u201d</p><p>Ria opened her mouth to reply but something made her turn to the doorway. She was running toward Emmett before she realized she\u2019d moved. He caught her with one arm, the other in a sling.</p><p>\u201cFlesh wound?\u201d She pushed aside his shirt to reveal the bandage. \u201cThat\u2019s an awfully large bandage for a flesh wound.\u201d</p><p>One big hand stroked over her hair. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine as soon as Tammy has some time free.</p><p>Gimme a kiss, mink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmmett! Your parents are standing right there.\u201d</p><p>But he was already kissing her, and what could she do but kiss him back? She held on tight, so glad he was safe. \u201cWhen did you turn into such an</p><p>exhibitionist?\u201d she whispered after he drew back, her cheeks nuclear-hot.</p><p>A small, wicked smile. \u201cJust letting the others know you belong to me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widening in horror, she looked around his shoulder . . . to see the grinning faces of ten more DarkRiver soldiers. Including her boss. And a tall redheaded female who was giving her the thumbs-up. \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d She buried her face in Emmett\u2019s chest and felt the laughter rolling through his body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d But in truth, all she wanted to do was stay pressed to him forever.</p><p>Dorian was pronounced stable half an hour later, and Tamsyn had enough energy left over to do a little extra healing. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d Ria asked as the healer put her hand on Emmett\u2019s shoulder and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cSome healers say it comes from within, but I think I act as a reservoir for pack energy.\u201d</p><p>Tamsyn\u2019s forehead furrowed in concentration. \u201cMy body can only hold a finite amount, so if Dorian had been hurt too badly, I would\u2019ve been wiped out. But he\u2019s a strong one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s selling herself short,\u201d Emmett said. \u201cTammy directs and channels her energy so it does the most good\u2014probably knows more about the human</p><p>body than most doctors. Though she\u2019s one of those, too.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later, the sling was gone, Emmett\u2019s wound a soft pink. Ria ran her fingers over it, taking utmost care. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaw, I\u2019m tough. But if you want to kiss it better, I won\u2019t object.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Tamsyn backed out of the cubicle. \u201cRemember kids, this is a hospital.\u201d She closed the folding door behind herself.</p><p>Ria punched an unrepentant Emmett gently on his uninjured shoulder. \u201cHow did you get shot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, mink, you don\u2019t want me to get into that.\u201d</p><p>Putting her hands on her hips, she faced him head-on. \u201cEmmett, you know how we were going to have a conversation later?\u201d</p><p>He looked a little wary. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d she began just as her phone started to beep in a frantic pattern only the family ever used. \u201cAmber!\u201d She put the cell to her ear. \u201cMom?\u201d</p><p>A fragile response. \u201cAmber\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Ria began moving, conscious of Emmett at her back. The maternity ward was in a completely different wing of the hospital so it took precious minutes to get there. She arrived to find Miaoling sitting down, her hand intertwined so tightly with Alex\u2019s her fingers had turned bone white. Simon sat on Alex\u2019s other side. No one said a word.</p><p>Ria\u2019s heart stopped. \u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d</p><p>It was her father who answered. \u201cThere was bleeding. Complications. They don\u2019t know if . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one will talk to us,\u201d Alex said, sounding on the verge of tears. \u201cThey just rush in and out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Ria took a deep breath and grabbed the first nurse she saw.</p><p>Crouching down beside Miaoling, Emmett took her small, wrinkled hand in his as he watched Ria quietly and effectively intimidate a nurse into giving her the information her family needed. She returned several minutes later, a small fierce warrior.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a fetal heartbeat. Amber\u2019s conscious and</p><p>talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bleeding?\u201d Alex asked, her voice breaking on the words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re working on getting it under control.\u201d Ria looked up as another group burst into the waiting room.</p><p>Amber\u2019s parents, Emmett realized as Ria greeted them in a flowing burst of Mandarin, clearly trying to stave off their panic. The couple sat down on</p><p>Simon\u2019s other side, asking Ria more questions. She shot Emmett a grateful glance as he continued to talk to Miaoling and Alex in a low voice, telling them about life in the pack, anything to take their minds off what was happening in the room only a few feet away.</p> <p>They asked him all kinds of questions, but he knew they\u2019d be unlikely to remember any of it come morning. Still he talked, giving them the distraction they needed, as Ria did the same with Amber\u2019s parents. Simon spoke to both his wife and mother-in-law, and Amber\u2019s parents, in turn, obviously trying to stay strong for his family.</p><p>But Ria was the glue, the quiet strength that held everyone together.</p><p>His leopard growled in pride.</p><p>Forty minutes later, there were tears of happiness, not sorrow. Amber was pronounced stable\u2014though she\u2019d have to stay in the hospital a bit longer than usual\u2014the baby was a squalling ball of red-faced anger, and Jet was grinning like a fool.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you going to call her?\u201d Ria asked after everyone had piled into the room and reassured themselves that both mother and baby were fine.</p> <p>\u201cJoy,\u201d Jet said, touching one gentle finger to the baby\u2019s cheek. \u201cThat\u2019s what she is\u2014our Joy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Amber wants to use Nana\u2019s name as a middle name.\u201d He drifted to his wife\u2019s side as if drawn there, curling his hand around hers. Though her</p><p>face was lined with tiredness, Amber smiled. \u201cHey you.\u201d</p><p>Ria began to nudge everyone out of the room.</p><p>Half an hour later, Emmett used Simon\u2019s car to drop off Amber\u2019s parents, along with Alex and Miaoling, since none of them were in any condition to drive, before returning to pick up Ria and her father. Simon got into the passenger seat, as Ria slid into the back. Emmett could feel the older man\u2019s focus on him as they drove and it was no surprise to hear Simon say, \u201cRi, go inside. We\u2019ll be in in a moment.\u201d</p> <p>Ria looked from one man to the other. Emmett shook his head in a slight negative when she went to open her mouth. Pursing her lips, she got out and entered the house. Emmett glanced at Simon. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s special,\u201d Simon said, looking him straight in the eye. \u201cWe lost a baby girl to a late-pregnancy miscarriage a year after Jet was born. We weren\u2019t the same after . . . but then Ria came. She healed us. She\u2019s our heart.\u201d</p><p>Emmett nodded, fully comprehending the sheer depth of everyone\u2019s terror at the hospital tonight. \u201cI understand.\u201d And he did. Because she was his</p><p>heartbeat, too.</p><p>A pause. Then Simon opened the door and got out. \u201cI\u2019ll send Ria to you. Save you sneaking up the wall.\u201d</p><p>Emmett winced. \u201cUm . . .\u201d</p><p>Simon\u2019s lips curved. \u201cAsk me sometime about how I used to get into Alex\u2019s room when we were high school students.\u201d</p><p>Emmett was still grinning when Ria slid into the passenger seat. Before she could say anything, he started up the engine again. \u201cThink your dad would mind if we took the car for a spin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, but where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little ride.\u201d Putting the vehicle into hover-drive, he took them out of the city, and through the red arches of the bridge that had been there so long, the world couldn\u2019t imagine San Francisco without it.</p><p>Ria sat back, releasing a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m so glad everyone\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the idiot who got himself shot up when I specifically told him not to.\u201d</p><p>The leopard batted playfully at her sharp response, delighted by her. \u201cJust checking.\u201d</p><p>Passing the main lookout on the other side of the bridge, he drove up a \u201csecret\u201d route that all the high schoolers knew about.</p><p>\u201cHey, where does this go?\u201d She twisted around. \u201cI\u2019ve never been up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMink, you must\u2019ve been one hell of a good kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI admit my nerdiness with pride.\u201d She made a choked up sound of surprise when she saw four other cars parked at the top, all of them a good distance from each other. \u201cYou brought us to a make-out spot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else was I supposed to get my hands on you?\u201d Parking the car at the end of the dirt lot, he slid away the manual controls, then reached over and</p><p>undid Ria\u2019s safety belt. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>Laughter danced in her eyes as she shifted over to straddle him, knees on the seat on either side of his thighs. \u201cWe are not making out in my parents\u2019</p><p>car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we are. That\u2019s the rule. You think those kids own those cars?\u201d He nodded out the window. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s smile softened, grew serious. \u201cI was so scared for you, Emmett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He pressed his lips to hers. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you I\u2019ll never be hurt, but I can promise that I\u2019ll do everything in my power to come back to you every day.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. \u201cIf you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll come after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d After seeing her at the hospital, he finally understood what she\u2019d been trying to tell him all this time\u2014Ria might be small and vulnerably human, but she was also strong enough to take anything the world threw at her, a warrior in her own way. It was time he started treating her like one. \u201cYou want to hear how it went down?\u201d</p><p>A jerky nod.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we have the truck surrounded, and we\u2019ve blocked off the streets he could use to drive out, so he\u2019s a rat in a cage. We wait till nightfall.\u201d He unbuttoned the first three buttons on her shirt.</p><p>\u201cEmmett!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s to make the bad memories go away.\u201d</p><p>Giving a burst of stifled laughter, she thrust her fingers through his hair as he pressed a kiss to the delicate skin between her breasts. \u201cGod, you\u2019re</p><p>pretty, mink. I\u2019m gonna kiss you all over next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Another kiss before he straightened. \u201cSo, everything\u2019s going to plan. Problem is, Vincent\u2019s smart. He\u2019s got the immediate area around his</p><p>truck set up with sensors. No way to get to the truck without alerting him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you were sure he was in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe saw him come out earlier in the day\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know what he looked like?\u201d</p><p>Smart question. Nothing less than he expected from his mate. \u201cNo need. It was obvious he was the alpha dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>He ran his finger down her bared skin, undoing a few more buttons along the way. His leopard rose to the forefront, possessive and oh-so-hungry.</p><p>TEN</p><p>Breathing past the desire to simply take, he continued. \u201cIt was clear we wouldn\u2019t be able to get into the truck even if we somehow got past the alarms</p><p>\u2014thing was armored like a tank. No windows, no visible vents. So we threw something at the back doors.\u201d</p><p>Ria blinked. \u201cHigh-tech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll we needed was one of the goons to open the doors. Soon as he did, we shot in so many canisters of tear gas, they couldn\u2019t throw them all back.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d finished unbuttoning her shirt, but she was too involved in the story to notice. The cat grinned. \u201cBastards had to come pouring out eventually. But the morons came out shooting, even though they couldn\u2019t see a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou got shot by accident?\u201d she asked, as if it was his fault.</p><p>\u201cI got shot by morons.\u201d He bent to press kisses along the creamy upper curves of her breasts. \u201cAside from two lucky shots, they were useless. We had them down on their knees in seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do to them?\u201d</p><p>Looking up, he met her gaze. \u201cI\u2019m a leopard, Ria. I protect what\u2019s mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Absolute acceptance in her eyes, her face.</p><p>\u201cI was the one to take Vincent down\u2014and maybe he got a little banged up in the process, but we turned the whole lot of them over to Enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d He smiled, letting the leopard out to play. \u201cTurns out the Crew killed two cops in cold blood only a few hours before our takedown.</p><p>Enforcement was real happy to take them in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo birds, one stone,\u201d she murmured. \u201cVincent never again sees the light of day, and you make friends in Enforcement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said, knowing she needed to know everything, \u201cby taking down the Crew so completely, we gave notice to the Psy Council that we\u2019re here to stay.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s eyes darkened. \u201cThey\u2019ll make trouble for you if they think you\u2019re a threat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing you cats are so tough.\u201d A soft whisper that told him she\u2019d stand by him, no matter what.</p><p>Proud of her courage, he said, \u201cWe did let one goon go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he could take a message to the famiglia up north. Anyone else comes down, we\u2019ll be sending them back in little tiny pieces. And then we\u2019ll come up and do the same to those who gave the orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think family comes first.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou did something else. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>He began to slip her shirt off her shoulders. \u201cWe have some expert hackers. Maybe the big bosses found their data compromised and pictures of</p><p>leopards as screen savers.\u201d</p><p>Ria\u2019s body began to shake as the shirt dropped to the floor. Her laughter was infectious\u2014the leopard purred into her mouth as he took it in a slow, deep kiss. She kissed him back with an intensity that was pure Ria, then slid her mouth over his jaw and up to nibble on his ear. He was stroking his hand down to cup her breast when she screamed and jerked back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew she was saying something, but he couldn\u2019t hear it, his entire body in agony.</p><p>Mouth snapping shut as her eyes fell on his face, Ria touched her fingers to a point below Emmett\u2019s right ear. \u201cOh, God.\u201d She realized his ears were bleeding. Her heart almost stopped. \u201cEmmett?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were hazy\u2014he was clearly in pain. And still, she saw him turn to look for whatever it was that had made her scream. But the little spider on the headrest was long gone, scared by her stupid reaction. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said. \u201cOkay.\u201d A few contortions and she managed to get her shirt back on. Fastening a single button between her breasts, she slid back Emmett\u2019s door and half scrambled, half fell out of the vehicle.</p> <p>Once out, she pushed at his shoulders, trying to get him into the passenger seat. He finally seemed to get the message and slid over, his movements</p><p>nowhere near as graceful as usual. Instead, he slumped heavily into the seat and mimed writing.</p><p>Grabbing the purse she\u2019d left on the dash, she pulled out the tiny notepad and pen she always carried. Emmett took it and wrote down an address, with the name Tammy at the top.</p><p>\u201cTamsyn.\u201d Nodding, Ria started up the car. The healer was a little ways out of the city, but if Emmett wanted to go to her rather than to Emergency, Ria</p><p>wasn\u2019t going to argue.</p> <p>It was the worst drive she\u2019d ever made. Emmett touched his knuckles to the back of her cheek ten minutes into the journey, but his tenderness only made her feel worse. Fighting off tears, she drove as fast as she dared and made it to Tamsyn\u2019s just after one in the morning. Emmett slid back his own door and was out by the time she got to him. He swayed, as if he\u2019d lost his center of balance.</p><p>Pulling his arm around her shoulders, she began to walk him to the door. It was wrenched open before they reached the first step. Nathan, who Ria had met during his watch on her parents\u2019 house, walked out, followed by Tamsyn. The healer was wearing a kimono-style robe in vivid blue, but it was her eyes that stole the scene, night-glow in the darkness.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, coming to a stop in front of Emmett.</p><p>Tears streamed down Ria\u2019s face. \u201cI screamed right next to his ear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d Lifting her hands, the healer cupped them gently over Emmett\u2019s ears. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long to heal. He\u2019ll be extra-sensitive for a week, but after that, his hearing will go back to normal.\u201d</p><p>Ria felt Emmett squeeze her shoulders, his eyes already looking clearer. But she didn\u2019t breathe easy until Tamsyn drew back her hands and said,</p> <p>\u201cThere.\u201d</p><p>Emmett turned to Ria. \u201cWhat was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA spider,\u201d she admitted, shamefaced. \u201cTeeny, tiny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared of spiders, mink?\u201d He drew her into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d Her eyes met Tamsyn\u2019s. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Touching her fingers gently to Ria\u2019s cheek, she took the damp towel Nathan held out to her. \u201cFor the blood.\u201d</p><p>As Ria accepted the soft cloth with a murmur of thanks, Nathan jerked his head toward the house. \u201cI\u2019ll leave the door open if you want to come in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Emmett shook his head. \u201cI have to get Ria home.\u201d</p> <p>The couple headed in with a wave. Reaching up, Ria dabbed away the blood with careful hands. Emmett bent his head and let her do what she needed to do. Only when his face was clear did he take the towel and put it on the hood of the car.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna look at me anytime soon?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Emmett.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it wasn\u2019t that bad.\u201d He tipped up her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze. \u201cExcruciating, but otherwise not that bad.\u201d</p><p>Guilt threatened to crush her. Then she caught the glint in his eye. \u201cEmmett, if I didn\u2019t love you so much, I\u2019d kill you right now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes went night-glow between one second and the next. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>That was when she realized she\u2019d given away everything. Her heart in her throat, she swallowed. \u201cI said I love you.\u201d</p><p>Emmett cupped her cheek in his hand, those amazing, wild eyes becoming impossibly wilder. \u201cSay that again.\u201d</p><p>She did.</p><p>Emmett\u2019s smile was slow, possessive, brilliant. \u201cI love you, too, mink.\u201d</p><p>Her lips trembled. Throwing her arms around him, she let him pick her up and kiss the air right out of her. Sometime later, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re my mate.</p><p>Think you can handle that?\u201d</p><p>It was hard to speak with her heart bursting open. \u201cThink you can handle me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo long as you\u2019re gentle with me.\u201d</p><p>And she knew he was going to tease her about this for the rest of their lives. Her smile almost cracked her face, she was so delighted by the idea.</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>Of course Dorian flirted shamelessly with Ria at her and Emmett\u2019s mating ceremony. But Emmett didn\u2019t carry through his threat to eviscerate the younger man. Because Ria was his now, and Dorian, like every other man in DarkRiver, would rather die than cross that line.</p><p>His leopard smiled indulgently as the blond soldier danced Emmett\u2019s mate into a whirl, then caught her laughing form. Her eyes met Emmett\u2019s over</p><p>Dorian\u2019s shoulder and she blew him a kiss. Smiling, he decided he\u2019d shared his mate quite enough. \u201cGo find another partner, Blondie.\u201d</p><p>Dorian released Ria with a mournful smile. \u201cBut I like your mink.\u201d Dodging Emmett\u2019s swipe, he walked off with a cocky grin.</p><p>\u201cIs your pack always like this?\u201d Ria asked, looking up at him, her arms wrapped around his waist.</p><p>\u201cCrazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, too. But so . . . like family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Pack is family.\u201d</p><p>A frown gathered between her brows. \u201cWhat about my parents, grandmother, my brothers, Amber, and Joy\u2014will they be shut out now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re family, too,\u201d he told her. \u201cSometimes, they might wish they weren\u2019t.\u201d Grinning, he directed her gaze to where poor Amber and Joy were being</p><p>\u201clooked after.\u201d The changelings weren\u2019t touching either mother or baby, but it was obvious they wanted to. Then Ria noticed the beautiful handcrafted baby blanket being held out to Amber. Her sister-in-law looked stunned . . . before a slow smile crept over her face.</p><p>\u201cWe like kids,\u201d Emmett whispered in her ear.</p><p>Pressing herself to him, she stood on tiptoe to whisper back. \u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her close.</p><p>\u201cHow come you took so long to find me?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cStupidity.\u201d A nip of her ear. \u201cBut now that I have you, I\u2019m never letting go.\u201d</p><p>Ria smiled and kissed the edge of his jaw. \u201cWho says I\u2019d let you?\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Emmett spun her off her feet and around in a dizzying circle. Ria met her grandmother\u2019s eyes halfway through the first rotation. Miaoling was holding court with the young ones, but her smile was just for Ria. And Ria knew her grandmother understood.</p><p>Emmett was it for her. Forever. No matter what.</p><p>It was, she thought, looking down into eyes gone cat in joyful play, perfect.</p><p>The San Francisco Gazette</p><p>January 1, 2073 </p> </body></html>"]
