A petite powerhouse. The ultimate diversion. Those damn short, damn tight cheerleading skirts that showcased her athletic body. If he angled his head to the side, he caught a glimpse of her muscular thigh instead of the back of her head. Not that the view was bad. Her hair was as black and shiny as a crow\u2019s wing in the sun. Add in her china-white skin, full ruby lips and Georgia could be a modern-day Snow White.</p> <p>You\u2019re a real poet, McKay. More like a fuckin\u2019 pervert. Think about something else.</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>Startled by the husky rasp of his name, he glanced up from his notebook, right into pale, icy-blue eyes that made him stammer like a fool. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you do the homework assignment?\u201d</p><p>Be cool. Do not imagine Hot Lips Hotchkiss whispering that in your ear. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth curved into a smile. He wondered if the gloss glistening on her lips was flavored. Would it taste like bubble gum? Peaches? Ripe black cherries?</p> <p>\u201cThank God. Can I copy it?\u201d</p><p>Tell managed to rip his focus from her plump lips. Before he could speak, she cranked the charm on high.</p><p>\u201cPlease? You let me do it before. And I didn\u2019t have time because I was...\u201d</p><p>Sucking face with your asshole boyfriend?</p><p>Not that he\u2019d ever say that, but man, he hated Declan \u201cDeck\u201d Veldekamp; not just because the super jock\u2014aka big man on campus\u2014was dating the hottest girl in their class. The guy was a prick and a bully. And those were his best traits.</p><p>\u201cYou was what?\u201d Tell whispered back.</p><p>\u201cBottle-feeding the replacement calves my dad got yesterday.\u201d</p><p>He snorted.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? I\u2019m serious. I had chores to finish last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did I. And I was up until three a.m. helping my brothers pull a couple of calves since my dad\u2014\u201d was passed out in the barn, \u201c\u2014needed some shut-eye and I still got my homework done.\u201d</p><p>Her tempting lips formed a pretty pout. \u201cI don\u2019t see the big deal in you letting me copy it real quick.\u201d</p><p>You wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Like you didn\u2019t see a problem asking me to help with prom decorations, and I ended up doing everything.</p><p>Like you didn\u2019t see a problem asking me to help with Fellowship of Christian Athletes concessions, and I ended up doing everything.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Tell? I\u2019m desperate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Hotchkiss,\u201d Mrs. Walls said sharply. \u201cStop flirting with Mr. McKay and get ready to turn in your assignment.\u201d</p><p>Swish. Her silky hair tickled Tell\u2019s knuckles as she whipped her head. The scent of cherries traveled from his nose straight to his crotch.</p><p>Fuckin\u2019 awesome.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the problem, Mrs. Walls,\u201d Georgia intoned sweetly. \u201cI seem to have...lost my assignment and I was just asking if he saw the paper fall out of my binder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that true, Tell?\u201d</p><p>Now Miss Sweet and Sexy was asking him to lie for her? Bull crap.</p><p>\u201cNo, ma\u2019am, that is not true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, what were you two whispering about that was so all-fired important that you disrupted my class?\u201d Mrs. Walls demanded.</p><p>Tell knew the hard-nosed teacher wouldn\u2019t let it go. \u201cGeorgia and I were talkin\u2019 about the upcoming class project, bein\u2019s we\u2019re partners. She forgot the folder with our notes and discovered she\u2019d slipped her assignment in it too.\u201d</p><p>When Georgia gaped at him, Tell allowed a smug grin, but stopped short of giving her a conspiratorial wink.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let it slide this time, only because I\u2019m impressed you two have already started on the project,\u201d Mrs. Walls said.</p><p>Score! Now with Hot Lips as his partner for a major graded assignment, she couldn\u2019t back out. It finally gave him the chance to show her the real Tell McKay. Not the tongue-tied loser who sat behind her in history class and sniffed her hair.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the subject matter?\u201d Mrs. Walls asked him.</p><p>Crap. \u201cAh. Advances and setbacks in Wyoming livestock practices over the course of Wyoming statehood.\u201d Hey, that sounded pretty good, especially on the fly.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. The rest of you might as well choose partners today\u2014after you turn in your assignments. The bell rings in two minutes, so get cracking.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s mind drifted into a soft-focus image of Georgia and him, alone, studying in the back of the library with their heads bent close. When they looked up simultaneously, Georgia would whisper his name and lick her lips, letting him know she wanted him. Then would he gently touch her face and slide his hand into that thick waterfall of shiny black hair? Or would he keep eye contact with her as he gradually moved in for a long, slow kiss?</p><p>No. He\u2019d grab her, kiss her with all the bottled-up passion he hadn\u2019t had the chance to show any woman, let alone her. Passion that was just waiting to burst free. While they were kissing like crazy, her soft hands would be all over him.</p><p>No. His hands would be all over her. Slipping under her shirt to touch her boobs. Inching beneath the spandex panties she wore under her cheerleading skirt.</p><p>She\u2019d be moaning, rubbing her hand against his fly. Then he\u2019d pick her up\u2014just like in the movies. He\u2019d sweep all the books and papers off the desk\u2014just like in the movies. Then he\u2019d gently lay her across the surface, bringing his body on top of hers. For some of that sliding, pounding, pumping action\u2014</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>His guilty gaze winged to Georgia. \u201cAh, what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening to me?\u201d</p><p>He stammered, \u201cN-no. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bell rang.\u201d</p><p>Shit. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you still sitting there?\u201d</p><p>Because I have another freakin\u2019 boner. \u201cBecause I\u2019m tired. I must\u2019ve fallen asleep.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cWith your eyes open?\u201d</p><p>Way to be an idiot. He shrugged and fought another lame blush. Please, don\u2019t let his face reveal that he\u2019d been in a porn scene, dry-humping her to orgasm as she screamed his name. Be cool. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to say thanks for covering for me, but I can\u2019t be your partner.\u201d</p><p>Every fantasy\u2014and his dick\u2014deflated. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Georgia gnawed on her lip. \u201cDeck will get mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? It\u2019s for school. Say the teacher put us together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Smitty was here. He\u2019ll tattle that we weren\u2019t assigned and us partnering up was your idea. Then Deck will want to, well...deck you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see him try.\u201d Ooh, such a tough guy, McKay. Deck would wipe the floor with your scrawny ass.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do that to you, Tell.\u201d</p><p>Was her concern for him from fear? Or from something else? She had been talking to him a lot during class the last couple of months. Did she kind of...like him?</p><p>Wait. If he let Deck beat the ever-lovin\u2019 crap out of him, would Georgia feel so guilty she\u2019d offer to kiss his injuries and make them better? For the first time ever, he really hoped a guy punched him in the crotch.</p><p>Nice fucking fantasy, perv, but it ain\u2019t ever gonna happen.</p><p>\u201cYou understand, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>His focus snapped back to her. \u201cWhat\u2019s your grade in this class?\u201d</p><p>She dropped her gaze. \u201cI have a C. Minus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an A. This project could raise your grade to a B if you partner with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, okay then. But we can\u2019t meet to work on the project during school hours where anyone could see us.\u201d</p><p>If he\u2019d had an ego, it would\u2019ve taken a massive hit. \u201cWhere we gonna work on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about the public library? In, ah, Moorcroft.\u201d Her fingers nervously twisted the purity ring on a chain around her neck. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when he knew he\u2019d be doing the history project alone.</p><p>That\u2019s when he understood that sucker defined a guy like him, easily manipulated by a pretty girl.</p><p>That\u2019s when he swore it\u2019d never happen again.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Ten years later...</p><p>\u201cTell McKay, you\u2019re a sight for sore eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeeBee, darlin\u2019, I swear you get younger-lookin\u2019 every time I see you. Pretty soon I\u2019m gonna be carding you to make sure you\u2019re old enough to be serving in a bar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven an old broad like me ain\u2019t immune to that bullshit flattery.\u201d She opened the cooler. \u201cYou drinkin\u2019 Bud Light?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Tell caught the bottle when the bartender slid it across the bar top. \u201cThanks, Beebs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. So where\u2019s the blonde from last week?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s a new week.\u201d</p><p>BeeBee flapped the bar towel at him. \u201cYou\u2019re such a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take the compliment. But you gotta admit I ain\u2019t as wild as some of my cousins in their heyday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re worse, sugar, because you hide it better. Lord, them dimples of yours are deep enough to get lost in. And the ladies eat up that fun-lovin\u2019 gentleman cowboy bit you do so well.\u201d She shook her finger at him. \u201cDon\u2019t deny it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t. But I\u2019ll point out I am a fun-lovin\u2019 gentleman cowboy, so it ain\u2019t like I\u2019m pretending to be something that I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>BeeBee\u2019s gaze flicked to whoever stood behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tell slowly turned around on his barstool to see a redhead glaring at him. Aw, hell. Not again. He remembered he\u2019d done a little mattress dancing with this cutie last year, but he couldn\u2019t recall her name. \u201cHey, pretty lady.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cDoes that work for you? The \u2018hey, pretty lady\u2019 when you can\u2019t remember a woman\u2019s name after you slept with her?\u201d</p><p>BeeBee snorted.</p><p>Tell grinned. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>The woman opened her mouth, no doubt about to read him the riot act, but he jumped in to head her off.</p><p>\u201cNow, don\u2019t go getting all indignant, darlin\u2019. We both had a great time\u2014that part I do remember. I told you up front that\u2019s all it\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>She sidled up to the bar, telling BeeBee, \u201cA honey Jack and seven with lemon, please.\u201d Then she cocked her head. \u201cI\u2019m Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, pretty Jamie, I may\u2019ve been fuzzy on your name, but I do recall one thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>Tell traced the line of her neck from beneath her jawbone to the hollow of her throat. \u201cHow much you liked havin\u2019 my mouth here.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s breath caught. \u201cYou are the devil. A handsome devil with dirty, sweet-talking ways and wicked, wicked hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. But knowing that ahead of time still didn\u2019t keep you from sayin\u2019 yes to me, did it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t want to say no.\u201d Her gaze gravitated to his crotch and zoomed back to his eyes. \u201cThen or now.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>She inserted her curvy body between his thighs and leaned into him. \u201cBuy me a drink, cowboy, and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>His night was looking up. \u201cBeeBee doll, put Jamie\u2019s drink on my tab.\u201d</p><p>BeeBee snorted again.</p><p>\u201cSo, you here with anyone?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>Jamie took a healthy sip of her drink. \u201cMy friend Stephanie and some chick she knew in high school.\u201d</p><p>High school. A time in his life he\u2019d rather forget.</p><p>He set down his bottle and said, \u201cDance with me.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a band, just piped-in country music, but several couples were on the dance floor.</p> <p>Three fast songs later, Tell led Jamie back to their seats at bar. \u201cI forgot that you\u2019re such a great dancer,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t a lot of other things to do around here on the weekends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I haven\u2019t seen you in Ziggy\u2019s for a while.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t mention he was in here every Tuesday night for dart league. \u201cWe just got done calving. Now I\u2019m gearing up for rodeo season. Which means I\u2019ll be gone most Friday and Saturday nights.\u201d</p><p>She placed her hand on his chest. \u201cIs that your way of warning me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Just stating the facts up front.\u201d He shifted against the bar and put his mouth on her ear. \u201cSo knowing that... What are the odds that you\u2019ll come home with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn whether you still live with your brother.\u201d</p><p>His lips nibbled down her jawline to the column of her throat. \u201cMy brother was only staying with me temporarily. So it\u2019d just be you and me. I\u2019ll be the only one to hear you moan when I do this.\u201d Tell parted his lips and sucked on the sweep of skin where her neck met her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cGod. You\u2019re good at that.\u201d She bared her entire throat.</p><p>\u201cAt what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeducing me with your mouth and the words flowing from it.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her neck. \u201cSo is that a yes, pretty\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie?\u201d</p><p>Tell froze. He recognized that smoky voice. Soft, sweet, unbelievably sexy. Been a while since he\u2019d heard it. He lifted his head, but kept his face shadowed beneath the brim of his hat.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m a little busy?\u201d Jamie said crossly.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t bother you, but Stephanie told me to tell you that your sister has called your cell about ten times. She thinks you oughta call her back in case it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stepped away from him, warning, \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here, waitin\u2019 on you.\u201d As soon as Jamie flounced off, Tell raised his head, looking at the woman who\u2019d starred in his teenage fantasies for three long years. \u201cHello, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Surprise crossed her face. She stumbled backward and would\u2019ve fallen on her ass if he hadn\u2019t lunged for her.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell? Tell McKay? You\u2019re the hot cowboy Jamie was talking about?\u201d</p><p>Tell wasn\u2019t sure if he should scowl because of Georgia\u2019s shock or if he should grin because she\u2019d called him hot. A smile won out. \u201cYep, that\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. You...look amazing.\u201d Georgia\u2019s gaze traveled over his shoulders, his arms, his chest and then landed back on his face. Her fingers tightened on his biceps as if she was testing the merchandise. \u201cLike, really amazing.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t look away from her. Christ. Hot Lips Hotchkiss was still a knockout. Her ebony hair was shorter\u2014shoulder length, rather than flowing halfway down her back in a tangle of black silk. Same lush mouth. Same startling blue eyes. She\u2019d put on weight, which had softened the sharp angles of her face, and added some curves to her compact body.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring at me,\u201d she said in that low-pitched voice he\u2019d dreamed about.</p><p>\u201cYou were staring at me first, darlin\u2019. And I\u2019m pretty sure you can let go of me now, unless you wanna challenge me to an arm-wrasslin\u2019 match?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. No. Sorry.\u201d A hint of pink spread from her neck up to her cheekbones and she dropped her hands.</p><p>Interesting. Tell couldn\u2019t remember if he\u2019d ever seen her blush in high school. \u201cSo what are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaving a drink with Stephanie. You remember her?\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cWas she in our graduating class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Stephanie Blackstone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Now I remember. One of them smart girls. But I didn\u2019t know you two were friends.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes turned cool. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be friends with a smart girl because I was a dumb cheerleader?\u201d</p><p>Shit. He\u2019d stepped in it with her first thing. He felt the knots tighten in his tongue as that stammering, apologizing, blushing boy from the past made a brief appearance.</p><p>No sirree. He was not going there. He hadn\u2019t been that kid for a long damn time. He reached for his beer and sipped. Then he granted her a slow grin. \u201cGeorgia girl, you were smart enough to get a boy like me to do your schoolwork, even when you were more than capable of doin\u2019 it yourself. So that snippy response don\u2019t hold true and you know it.\u201d</p><p>She laughed self-consciously. \u201cI guess I deserved that.\u201d</p><p>At least she could laugh at herself. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Stephanie in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteph moved back to Moorcroft last year but she travels all over the state for her job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in years either. What brings you back to Sundance?\u201d</p><p>His cell buzzed before she could answer. Normally he would ignore it, but he\u2019d been expecting\u2014dreading\u2014this call. He lifted a finger and said, \u201cHold on a sec. I gotta take this.\u201d He clicked Answer. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon has been shrieking since you left him here. He don\u2019t wanna watch a movie. He ain\u2019t hungry. And the little sh\u2014 poop kicked my dog. When I put him in time out, he smacked me in the face with his fire truck. Sorry, bro, but I can\u2019t do this alone.\u201d</p><p>Perfect fucking timing as usual. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll be there in fifteen.\u201d Tell finished his beer. He fished out a twenty and dropped it on the bar, signaling to BeeBee. \u201cWe square?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure enough. You\u2019re leaving so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta deal with a kid problem.\u201d</p><p>BeeBee frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Landon this weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and he\u2019s actin\u2019 up bad enough to warrant a call, so I gotta get. Thanks.\u201d Tell looked at Georgia with serious regret. \u201cSorry we didn\u2019t get a chance to catch up. Take care.\u201d He slipped on his PRCA jacket and hustled out the door.</p><p>Georgia watched the hot cowboy with the black hat disappear into the night. Tell McKay had been cute in high school in that sweet and dorky way. But now? The man was drop-dead gorgeous.</p><p>And built. Holy cow. She\u2019d gotten a good grip on his muscled biceps when he\u2019d kept her from making a complete fool of herself.</p><p>Now she felt totally perverted since she\u2019d been sneaking peeks at Jamie and him on the dance floor, mesmerized by his fast, sexy, smooth moves. She\u2019d kept watching them when they returned to the bar. Saw him draw Jamie in. He hadn\u2019t given a damn who knew he was seducing her. Jamie had been his only focus in a bar full of people.</p><p>Lucky, lucky Jamie.</p><p>What would it be like on the receiving end of such potent sexual attention? She\u2019d know if she hadn\u2019t tuned Jamie out as the girl had regaled Stephanie with explicit details of her last hookup with the man she\u2019d referred to as \u201ccowboy hottie\u201d.</p><p>What an understatement.</p><p>She\u2019d spiraled back ten years when Tell\u2019s eyes met hers. Even back then, she\u2019d felt he saw so much more than other kids their age, which sent her into full retreat. Maybe she\u2019d even acted a little cold to him sometimes because she hadn\u2019t wanted anyone\u2014especially a sweet-talkin\u2019, sharp-eyed McKay\u2014to see that deeply inside her, fearing he\u2019d find her...shallow.</p><p>Georgia dodged dancers on her way back to the booth.</p><p>Stephanie stirred the ice cubes in her glass and watched her approach. \u201cJamie had to bail. Issues with her sister.\u201d</p><p>At least she wouldn\u2019t have to break the news to Jamie that Tell had left.</p><p>\u201cI saw you talking to Jamie\u2019s mystery guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t know the hot cowboy Jamie was going on about...was Tell McKay?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Stephanie\u2019s eyes became enormous behind her purple glasses. \u201cSeriously? Jamie never said his name.\u201d She groaned. \u201cThen again, she did say she wasn\u2019t the type to kiss and tell.\u201d</p><p>Georgia choked on her vodka tonic.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be surprised. That\u2019s how karma works.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKarma? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Running into Tell McKay. He always had a crush on you. But you were too busy being Deck\u2019s girlfriend to notice.\u201d</p><p>Wrong. She had noticed. But it wasn\u2019t like she could\u2019ve acted on it. Deck had been insanely jealous, and enough bad blood had lingered between Deck and Tell in rodeo club that she hadn\u2019t wanted to add to it.</p><p>\u201cTell was surprised we were friends.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie shrugged. \u201cOur friendship was off the radar. No biggie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. When we saw each other at school, you didn\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t know me. I never understood what you did to earn such animosity from the girls in our class anyway, besides their bitchy attitudes being from stupid, petty jealousy because you were beautiful and dating the class stud. You weren\u2019t a mean girl, not like Sally Hermanson and her group. You just stuck with your own crowd\u2014RJ, Deck and his groupies. Who can fault you for that? Besides, look at us now. We\u2019re still friends. Can either of us say that about anyone else in our graduating class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but that\u2019s because you took pity on me after I divorced Deck and let me room with you in Laramie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt worked out for both of us. What else did Tell say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d After the cocktail waitress took their order, Georgia steered the conversation away from her embarrassing run-in with Tell. \u201cYou know who else I ran into from our class? Maggie Malone. She looks exactly the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? You have been keeping a low profile since you moved back to Wyoming.\u201d</p> <p>Moved back. Banished to purgatory was more like it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy the last week setting everything up to Barbara\u2019s specs.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie adjusted her glasses, which meant she was getting ready to grill Georgia. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why your boss picked Sundance to open a branch office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a branch office. Since she took over promotions for L bar K Rodeo, we have to maintain a physical presence throughout the summer rodeo season. Mostly to reassure the committees that hired L bar K that we plan on honoring those contracts. Plus, Barbara believed my former ties to this area would work in our favor now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t be living here permanently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But that tidbit has to stay strictly between us. You know how locals get about an out-of-state company relocating here temporarily for tax benefits and then pulling up stakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it still seems bizarre and...coincidental. How did a promotions and advertising firm in Dallas end up owning a small rodeo promotion company in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>That same question had crossed Georgia\u2019s mind, especially after Barbara\u2019s strange edict: take the job in Wyoming or lose her job in Dallas.</p> <p>\u201cL bar K has fallen on hard times and they approached Barbara about a buyout.\u201d</p><p>Both Stephanie\u2019s eyebrows rose. \u201cAgain with the coincidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBarbara does this buyout thing all the time. And she\u2019s getting plenty out of this deal, trust me. Some of the rodeos around here are overlooked gems just needing the right PR company to put a shine on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you getting out of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA promotion, if everything goes smoothly. In the meantime, I get to spend my summer at the rodeo grounds, instead of taking calls at my desk in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes your dad know you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>Georgia reached for her fresh drink. \u201cHe\u2019s probably heard rumors. Have I called him? No. Do I intend to? The jury\u2019s out on that one.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. But I feel the need to point out that people change. You have. Why couldn\u2019t you at least give your father the benefit of the doubt, just once?\u201d</p><p>That comment made Georgia think of Tell. Not of how he\u2019d changed, but what had remained the same.</p><p>His piercing blue eyes were the same.</p><p>That dimpled smile was the same.</p><p>His sweet, helpful disposition was the same.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten better at evasion,\u201d Stephanie inserted. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to talk about your dad? Fine. We\u2019ll finish the conversation about Tell McKay. Did he recognize you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was too busy trying to get into Jamie\u2019s pants to pay attention to anything but her zipper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he recognized me. Right away.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie said, \u201cAnd?\u201d with exasperation.</p><p>\u201cAnd what? He was polite, even when I sort of freaked out on him.\u201d Georgia groaned and put her forehead on the table.</p><p>\u201cThat bad? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Georgia raised her head and mimicked herself. \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re Tell McKay! Wow, let me feel your big muscles! Wow, you look amazing! God, Stephanie. What was wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sideswiped with lust?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe and every other woman in the bar. But they didn\u2019t gasp and swoon. Can you believe I almost fell on my ass, so the poor man had to catch me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to catch you,\u201d Stephanie pointed out. \u201cBut the fact he did is great insight into his character.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wanted to roll her eyes, but her psychologist friend would read something into it. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk to him long enough to find out anything about his character. Besides. What does it matter? He\u2019s with Jamie.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie shook her head. \u201cJamie\u2019s commitment issues preclude her from anything but casual relationships. After what she\u2019s told me, I\u2019m assuming cowboy hottie, aka Tell McKay, is the same way.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wanted to point out she\u2019d overheard Tell\u2019s phone conversation and he had a kid, but that didn\u2019t mean he had a wife or even a significant other. Just a baby mama, who was at home, dealing with his child while he caroused at the local bar.</p><p>Maybe Tell had turned into a player. Wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch, given his good looks and the wild reputations the McKay men had built up over the years.</p><p>\u201cYou know, he could solve a major problem for you.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up. \u201cWhat major problem? That I need to get laid?\u201d</p><p>Stephanie laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever get used to hearing you talk like that, G. Anyway, maybe this will be a two-fer in the problem-solving department for you: you\u2019ll get laid and score a date to our ten-year class reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. No. I\u2019ll take the sex but I\u2019m not going to the reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>Georgia started to retort but Stephanie cut her off.</p><p>\u201cYou are going. You cannot not show up at our class reunion, Georgia. Especially when people find out you live here. Especially not after you and Deck were voted class couple and prom king and queen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose titles worked out so well since we\u2019ve been divorced for seven years,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you have to go. Don\u2019t let Deck have the upper hand. Plus, you know he\u2019ll be there with Tara-Lee.\u201d</p><p>She scowled. \u201cAll the more reason to skip the damn dog and pony show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really don\u2019t care if Deck badmouths you?\u201d Stephanie asked. \u201cBecause you know he will if you\u2019re not around to defend yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dealt with the Deck drama a lifetime ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have to show up at the reunion on the arm of a gorgeous cowboy. It\u2019d give you cred. It\u2019d give Tell cred because you\u2019re still the hottest woman from our class. Add in the fact Deck and Tell were rivals in rodeo club? Sweet, sweet revenge.\u201d</p><p>That would be a way to prove she\u2019d moved on. That she no longer had that purity ring around her neck like a noose.</p><p>No. She could not possibly be considering the idea of attending that farce of a reunion. \u201cWho are you taking to the reunion?\u201d she asked Stephanie.</p><p>\u201cNo one. I\u2019m going stag.\u201d Stephanie held her hand up again. \u201cAnd before you blow a gasket, let me remind you that you were in the thick of things during high school. I was very happily in the background, observing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still observing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo make it interesting for me. Show up and show off. The introverted high school girl you were wouldn\u2019t dare ask Tell to go to the reunion with her. That\u2019s exactly why you should ask him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he says no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re more afraid that he\u2019ll say yes.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Landon calmed down immediately when Tell walked through the door. The four-year-old crawled onto Tell\u2019s lap with his dinosaur blanket and promptly fell asleep.</p><p>\u201cHe prefers you, even to Brandt.\u201d</p><p>Tell glanced at his younger brother. \u201cOnly because Brandt hasn\u2019t spent much time with him, Jessie bein\u2019 pregnant and all.\u201d</p><p>Dalton shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s more than that. I think Landon is drawn to you because you two look so much alike\u2014like Luke.\u201d</p><p>Total bullshit, in Tell\u2019s opinion. His nephew had been born several months after their brother Luke\u2019s death. No one had known about the kid\u2019s existence until the boy was almost a year and a half old. Having a piece of Luke had been a catalyst for change in their family\u2014some good, some bad. But it\u2019d become important that Landon grow up around his family.</p><p>Tell was aware that he most closely resembled Luke\u2014at least in physical appearance. In temperament he was light-years away from his hotheaded oldest brother. Every time he dealt with a frustrated Landon, Tell was reminded that he\u2019d been the one to calm Luke down when his temper had gotten the best of him.</p><p>\u201cI could use a beer, since my night of drinkin\u2019 was cut short.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dalton brought back two bottles of Bud Light. He gulped down a mouthful before he said, \u201cYou\u2019re probably gonna need more than one when I tell you that Dad called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see Landon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. He just wants to see if Mom\u2019s boyfriend will be along when she picks up Landon tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019d you tell him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019d be at the park in Sundance tomorrow afternoon.\u201d Dalton shrugged and took another drink. \u201cHe probably won\u2019t show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hope.\u201d Tell let his head fall back on the couch cushion and closed his eyes. He did not want to think about the fucked-up family shit now when he\u2019d have to deal with it again tomorrow.</p> <p>\u201cSo who did I pull you away from at the bar that\u2019s put that crabby look on your face?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>The thought of Georgia snapped him out of a potentially sour mood. He raised his head. \u201cGeorgia Hotchkiss. Remember her?\u201d</p><p>Dalton whistled. \u201cOf course I remember Hot Lips Hotchkiss. You had it bad for her.\u201d</p><p>He felt his cheeks heat. \u201cI did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to lie, bro. You let her run roughshod over you. But damn, I might\u2019ve let her roll over me, too. She was all that and a bag of chips. A little stuck-up, though. She still that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. You called right when I started talkin\u2019 to her. I haven\u2019t seen her since a week after graduation.\u201d</p> <p>Dalton gave him a considering look. \u201cWeren\u2019t you friends with her twin brother, RJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew him, pulled a couple pranks with him, but we weren\u2019t friends since he ran with Deck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t around the summer he was killed. Sad deal.\u201d</p><p>Landon stirred.</p><p>Tell stood, carrying him to the spare bedroom and slipping the kid into bed. He pulled the blanket up and smoothed back the boy\u2019s hair. Then he returned to the living room, plopped back on the couch and stretched out with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cI take it you\u2019re staying tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I had plans?\u201d</p> <p>Tell quirked a brow. \u201cAt ten o\u2019clock when we gotta be up at five?\u201d</p><p>Dalton sighed. \u201cI wish I had plans. Been awful damn hard getting back into the swing of havin\u2019 a social life after calving. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever catch up on sleep. Man. Was this year brutal or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe added an extra hundred head and Brandt is uptight and so, yeah, it was rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad it\u2019s not just me bein\u2019 a whiny pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d make me one too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I feel better.\u201d Dalton drummed his fingers on the chair arm. \u201cI heard something that might interest you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all over for Jim and Charlene Fox\u2014\u2019cept for the fightin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cWhy would that interest me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou dated Charlene, right?\u201d</p><p>Dated. More like he banged her a couple times and then she married someone else. \u201cYeah. Like six years ago. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe remembers your time together fondly. Hell, I think she remembers every man fondly, which is probably why her marriage is on the skids.\u201d Dalton smirked. \u201cBut she told me\u2014in confidence\u2014that when it gets down to the wire with Jim, she wants to sell off everything and move to Austin to live with her sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did Char spill her guts to you, D?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stopped by here yesterday when me\u2019n Landon were outside. Something about a cute kid makes a woman go all soft and talkative. Anyway, if we play our cards right, we could get first crack at it.\u201d</p><p>That caught his interest. \u201cFirst crack at everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d Dalton\u2019s face turned into pure business. \u201cThe land is already divided into two parcels. That larger section wouldn\u2019t be a bad investment. Especially if you were serious about starting a feedlot in a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am serious. But given land prices, there\u2019s no way we can afford it. Even if she gives us a friends and former lovers discount, even with what we\u2019ve got saved up.\u201c</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way we can afford to pass up this opportunity, even if it takes us a few years to get the feedlot up and running. This time we wouldn\u2019t have to rely on someone else to run interference for us. We could handle the details ourselves and no one would know until after the fact.\u201d</p><p>They both had a bad taste after a land deal had fallen through a year and a half ago. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019d hate to get my hopes up again. We\u2019ve been talkin\u2019 in abstracts. What if I\u2019m wrong and a feedlot isn\u2019t viable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. You\u2019re the smartest person I know, T, and if anyone can make it profitable, you can show us how. You\u2019ve done more than talk in abstracts. You\u2019ve already studied up on the regulations.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s faith in him was humbling.</p><p>\u201cAnd wouldn\u2019t it be sweet to stick it to Little Miss Know-It-All-Ecologically-Sustained-Agriculture after what she done to us?\u201d</p><p>He spit out his beer at hearing Dalton refer to sweet Rory Wetzler in such a way. \u201cHey, you\u2019re the one who got drunk with Rory and spilled the beans about us wantin\u2019 to buy her mom\u2019s land so we could turn it into a gigantic feedlot.\u201d</p><p>Dalton sighed. \u201cYeah, that wasn\u2019t smart of me, especially since we managed to keep that part of our plan even from our cousin Ben.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should\u2019ve expected Rory would blab to her mom right away, which is how Rielle ended up selling to Gavin so fast. Both Rielle and Rory have that hippie attitude and don\u2019t want any changes to the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, they\u2019re getting their wish since Gavin hasn\u2019t done shit with it.\u201d</p><p>They chewed on that in silence.</p><p>\u201cYou be all right doin\u2019 chores Sunday morning alone?\u201d Dalton asked. \u201cThere\u2019s a poker tournament in Deadwood. The pot is twenty grand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for it. Get drunk, get laid and win the pot. I\u2019ll need payback next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuffalo. Friday and Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d Dalton stood. \u201cNight, John-Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, Mary Ellen.\u201d Tell snagged the afghan off the back of the couch and let sleep overtake him.</p><p>The next afternoon after Tell got Landon cleaned up and fed, they headed to town. It was one of those perfect Wyoming days\u2014the sun shining above an enormous, cloudless blue sky. Just enough bite of cold in the air to remind him winter had ended but summer wasn\u2019t here yet.</p><p>Landon exuded energy and ran from the swing set to the jungle gym to the sandpit and every place in between before he decided to shinny up the monkey bars.</p><p>Tell chased the boy, ran when Landon chased him, and let himself be caught and tickled. Finally Landon settled into the sandpit to dig\u2014an activity that\u2019d keep him occupied for more than five minutes.</p><p>Tell rested in the grass, letting the sun warm his face. It\u2019d been a cold, snowy and gloomy winter. Seemed the sun hadn\u2019t shone at all, so he basked in the warm glow like a fat barn cat when he had a chance.</p><p>Not long after he hit that perfect relaxation point, a shadow fell across him. He inhaled a slow breath, expecting to open his eyes and see his father looming over him.</p><p>But Georgia Hotchkiss\u2019s beautiful face swam into view.</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cWell, it\u2019s my lucky week if I\u2019ve seen you twice in as many days, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is you. I wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat threw you off?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze moved along his body from his Merrell hiking boots up to his face. \u201cMight\u2019ve been that ball cap you\u2019re wearing instead of a cowboy hat.\u201d</p><p>Just then Landon skidded to a stop, spraying Tell\u2019s legs with sand. \u201cWatch me!\u201d The boy jumped over Tell and sped around the perimeter of the sandpit, making racecar noises.</p><p>\u201cPity the kid doesn\u2019t have any energy to burn off,\u201d Tell said dryly.</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d Georgia asked.</p><p>\u201cFour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLandon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat name. Your son looks a lot like you.\u201d</p><p>Tell pushed to his feet. \u201cWhoa. That\u2019s not my kid. That\u2019s my brother Luke\u2019s kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry. I just assumed...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cSo are you babysitting for Luke or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr something.\u201d</p><p>Georgia gave him a strange look. \u201cSounds cryptic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou probably haven\u2019t heard the story since you\u2019ve been gone. Luke died a few years ago. Before he died, he\u2019d stepped out on his wife and knocked up this chick he met in a bar. She didn\u2019t come forward until Landon was sixteen months old. So, as weird as it is, we\u2019ve got an informal custody agreement with Landon\u2019s mom, Samantha.\u201d</p><p>Horror widened Georgia\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh my God, Tell. I had no idea that Luke had died... I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He kicked a clump of sand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about RJ. Losing a brother sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it does. I would\u2019ve loved to have a surprise nephew or niece show up in my life.\u201d She scowled. \u201cBut that\u2019s an impossibility since my dead brother\u2019s girlfriend is now married to my ex-husband.\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed. \u201cThat situation is familiar. My brother Brandt married Luke\u2019s widow, Jessie.\u201d</p><p>Georgia smiled and Tell\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Goddamn. She still had that goofy smile. He was happy to see she hadn\u2019t perfected a fake, polite grin over the years. \u201cWhat are you doin\u2019 at the park?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m out for a walk, enjoying this beautiful day.\u201d She tipped her head toward Landon. \u201cDo you have him all weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Dalton have had him the last two days. My mom lives in Casper now and helps Samantha with Landon\u2019s daycare and stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo your mom and dad...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot divorced.\u201d Tell tore his gaze away from her and looked for Landon. Sneaky kid was nowhere to be found. He said, \u201cGimme a sec,\u201d and jogged to the monkey bars.</p><p>Landon wasn\u2019t crawling around the jungle gym or sitting on the swings. Tell spun a slow circle and squinted at the flash of red by the picnic tables.</p> <p>There the little bugger was. Tell froze when he saw his father sitting next to Landon on a picnic bench. He\u2019d had to bribe Landon with ice cream to get the boy\u2019s attention.</p><p>Tell meandered over, feeling his skin tighten and toughen up. \u201cDad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t keepin\u2019 a very good eye on my grandson, Tell. Anyone coulda snatched him up while you was yammering to that girl. You always did have the attention span of a dog with fleas. Praise the Lord I was here.\u201d</p><p>Landon jumped off the seat and wrapped his arm around Tell\u2019s leg. \u201cWhoa there, buddy. Sit down. I\u2019m right here. Didja tell Grandpa thanks for the ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Landon ducked his dark-haired head.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shame the kid don\u2019t know who I am.\u201d</p><p>And whose fault is that?</p><p>\u201cYour mother is probably poisoning him against me,\u201d Casper said with a sneer.</p><p>Tell wouldn\u2019t let that comment slide. \u201cI reckon with you\u2019re doin\u2019 that just fine yourself. If you want him to know you, you\u2019ve gotta spend time with him. Which you haven\u2019t done, even when we\u2019ve given you opportunities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoin\u2019 the Lord\u2019s work keeps me busy.\u201d</p><p>And of course that was more important. Anything was more important than mending the rift with his family.</p> <p>\u201cI see your mother\u2019s got you jumping through hoops now too.\u201d He pointed at Landon. \u201cHow often does she ask you to watch the boy?\u201d</p><p>Way too often, but Tell wasn\u2019t about to give his father that ammo. \u201cMe\u2019n Landon are pals, right, bud?\u201d</p><p>Landon nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s my youngest son? Ain\u2019t you two joined at the hip?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton helped with chores and then he took off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t surprised Brandt didn\u2019t show up.\u201d Casper shook his finger. \u201cRemind him he\u2019d better call me when that baby arrives. I\u2019ve already talked to my pastor about baptizing the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to take that up with Brandt and Jessie, Dad. Leave me out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least that\u2019s one thing your mother and I did right. Havin\u2019 all you boys baptized. Even if we didn\u2019t follow through and raise you up proper in the church.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming a sober, born-again Christian hadn\u2019t made Casper McKay any nicer. It\u2019d just given him faith that he\u2019d be forgiven by God for whatever mean thing that spewed out of his mouth.</p><p>Tell studied his father, knowing he hated it. Casper had been sober for a year and a half. He\u2019d lost all the puffy, pasty skin and bloated body shape that had been the result of years of alcohol abuse. He\u2019d let his hair grow instead of keeping it short, strands of silver prevalent against the black. His eyes, identical to the ones staring back at Tell in the mirror every day, were clear, yet still filled with the disapproval Tell had felt his entire life.</p><p>Landon shouted, \u201cGram!\u201d He raced across the park, throwing himself into Joan McKay\u2019s arms.</p><p>Tell couldn\u2019t help but smile. Landon loved his grandma, and his mother loved having a living reminder of the son she\u2019d lost.</p><p>As she walked over, holding Landon\u2019s hand, Tell had to remind himself this relaxed, laughing woman was his mother. Not only did she look happier after leaving her husband, she owned an air of confidence\u2014too much, maybe, to make up for the years she\u2019d had none.</p><p>Tell whispered, \u201cLookin\u2019 good, Mama,\u201d and kissed her cheek. Then he offered his hand to her companion. \u201cBart. Nice to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Tell.\u201d</p><p>She looked at her ex-husband. \u201cCasper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoan.\u201d Casper gave Bart a full inspection, but didn\u2019t offer his hand.</p><p>\u201cSo everything went okay? No problems?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWe had a great time like we always do, huh, Landon?\u201d Tell said, ruffling the kid\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cYep. I got to ride on the four-wheeler three times! And Uncle Dalton buyed me a new toy, a backhoe, and we dug a big hole and he let me fill it with water!\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll bet your uncle had to hose you down outside afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had a water fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoys will be boys.\u201d</p><p>Casper snorted. \u201cDalton is long past bein\u2019 a boy. He needs to grow up and start actin\u2019 like a man.\u201d</p><p>Joan stiffened. \u201cAnd just where was Dalton supposed to learn how to be a man? Because you\u2019re definitely not the example he oughta be following, Casper.\u201d</p><p>Shit. This was not good. He hated how they verbally assaulted one another and that his brothers were never around to witness it or help him break it up.</p><p>Bart said, \u201cTell, how about if you give me your keys and me\u2019n Landon will get his stuff.\u201d</p><p>Tell tossed them over. Bart and Landon took off.</p><p>He didn\u2019t blame them. Maybe he should\u2019ve gone along.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting mouthy in your old age, Joan,\u201d Casper said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still an asshole in yours, Casper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that young fella sharin\u2019 your bed like your dirty mouth?\u201d His eyes gleamed. \u201cI remember when you used to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit, Dad, that\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><p>Casper whirled on him. \u201cDon\u2019t you be takin\u2019 the Lord\u2019s name in vain. God wouldn\u2019t smite me down for popping you one in the mouth for your blasphemy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, give it a rest,\u201d Joan snapped. \u201cWe get that you\u2019ve switched your allegiance from Jameson to Jesus. And don\u2019t forget\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat goes for you too, Mom. Stop it. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I need to get going anyway since we\u2019re meeting Brandt and Jessie for supper.\u201d Of course she had to get in another shot. She hugged him. \u201cThanks for everything, son. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even look his direction before she walked off.</p><p>\u201cThat woman needs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m warning you to shut it,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>Casper muttered something about him still being a mama\u2019s boy.</p><p>\u201cLook. I\u2019ll see you. I got things to do.\u201d That\u2019s when Tell realized his family drama caused him to forget about Georgia entirely. He looked over at the last place she\u2019d been, but she was gone.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d his father said to his retreating back.</p><p>Like walking into the closest bar.</p><p>He needed a goddamn drink.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Tell ordered a beer and a burger. He\u2019d finished half and most his fries when his buddy Thurman Watson showed up. Not only had he and Thurman been friends since fifth grade, these days they were the last bachelors in their group of friends.</p><p>\u201cSince you called me... You buying my supper, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>The waitress brought Thurman a Coors and took his order to the kitchen. \u201cWill you call me a pussy if I admit I ain\u2019t in the partyin\u2019 mood tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Tell swirled a fry through a puddle of ranch dressing and popped it in his mouth. \u201cHow long you in town?\u201d Thurman spent three weeks out of every month on the road as a long-haul trucker.</p><p>\u201cUntil tomorrow. I oughta have next week off, but I picked up an extra load going to Seattle. Then I hit Salt Lake and Denver before I get back.\u201d</p><p>For the next hour they bullshitted about family crap and work, drank and played pool. A few of their buddies showed up. They eyed the ladies trolling in the bar; most seemed barely legal. Tell was talking to Thurman\u2019s older brother, Warner, when Thurman stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never guess who just walked in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou buyin\u2019 me a beer if I guess right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. \u2019Cause you ain\u2019t never gonna get this one.\u201d</p><p>Tell smirked. \u201cIs it...Georgia Hotchkiss?\u201d</p><p>Thurman\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cHow the hell did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve run into her twice, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd somehow you just forgot to mention that to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t interested in partyin\u2019 or gossiping like an old woman tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. This ain\u2019t gossip. This is news, my friend.\u201d</p><p>Tell rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious, McKay.\u201d Thurman looked around before he lowered his voice. \u201cYou had it bad for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did half the damn school. Which is why Deck gave her a purity ring until he could swap it out for a wedding band.\u201d</p><p>Before his friend could rib him any more, their buddy Ned showed up with his wife, Roxanne. Then Warner\u2019s wife, Leah, joined them. The group had grown to six, so they claimed a circular booth in the back corner.</p><p>After ordering a couple pitchers, talk turned to the weather, sports and kids. Warner still team roped on occasion and he and Tell talked about upcoming rodeos.</p><p>During a lull, Roxanne said to Tell, \u201cI take it Jessie hasn\u2019t popped yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got three weeks left. If Brandt could hurry that baby up, he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019ll wanna shove it right back in there after it\u2019s been cryin\u2019 for two days straight and it won\u2019t stop,\u201d Warner said.</p><p>Leah bumped him with her shoulder. \u201cSays the big, tough daddy. Now all Desiree has to do is pout and Daddy gives her whatever she wants.\u201d</p><p>A skinny bleached blonde butted in and perched on the edge of the booth, right next to Tell. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t my favorite cowboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMira. How\u2019s it goin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter now that you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d God, he hoped she didn\u2019t ask him for money. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She leaned close enough to put her mouth on his ear. \u201cBecause I am so horny. Come outside and do me in your pickup. Do me anywhere.\u201d Then she blew her boozy breath in his ear and licked it. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>The drunk woman used so much tongue Tell was surprised saliva wasn\u2019t dripping off his earlobe. Now he wished she had just hit him up for cash. He scooted closer to Thurman. \u201cSorry to disappoint you, darlin\u2019, but I\u2019m just getting over a nasty bout of the flu.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt don\u2019t bother me. Come on.\u201d</p> <p>Tell had a hard time remembering why he\u2019d ever found her attractive. He uncurled her fingers from his bicep. \u201cI\u2019m on heavy-duty meds and they have an...unfortunate side effect.\u201d He sipped his beer, waiting for the meaning to sink in.</p><p>Her painted lips formed an \u201cO\u201d of surprise. \u201cYou can\u2019t get it up.\u201d She popped to her feet. \u201cHuh. Too bad. See you around.\u201d And she took off.</p><p>Ten seconds later the entire table burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cMan. Does that happen to you a lot?\u201d Ned asked.</p><p>Tell nodded yes and said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>More laughter.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t worried about her spreading rumors you can\u2019t get it up?\u201d Thurman asked.</p><p>\u201cNope. There are plenty of women around who will dispute that statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a dog, McKay,\u201d Warner said. \u201cHow many chicks do you have on a string right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat day is it?\u201d</p><p>Laughter ended abruptly and everyone looked at the end of the table.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Tell. I just wanted to come over and say hello.\u201d</p><p>Tell felt that same whomp in the gut he had at age seventeen whenever their eyes met. \u201cGeorgia. Good to see you again.\u201d He stopped being mesmerized by her beauty long enough to say, \u201cI\u2019m sure you know most these folks we went to school with. Thurman. Ned. Roxanne\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ned\u2019s wife now,\u201d Roxanne said sharply. \u201cAnd I doubt you would\u2019ve remembered my name if Tell hadn\u2019t reminded you.\u201d</p><p>Wow. That was bitchy.</p><p>Leah folded her arms over her cleavage. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll bet you don\u2019t know who I am either.\u201d</p><p>All eyes were on Georgia. But rather than lifting her chin and leveling them with a haughty stare, she took a step back. \u201cOur class wasn\u2019t that big, Leah. Of course I remember you.\u201d She gave Tell a wan smile. \u201cSorry to interrupt. Have a good night.\u201d She walked off.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Roxanne, way to be a bitch to her,\u201d Ned said.</p><p>\u201cServes her right for all the times she was so stuck-up to me,\u201d Roxanne shot back. \u201cDid she expect we\u2019d give her a group hug?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe has put on a few pounds,\u201d Leah said with a cruel smile. \u201cNo way would she fit into that itty-bitty cheerleading skirt now.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. He\u2019d never seen this side of his friends\u2019 wives and he really didn\u2019t like it.</p><p>\u201cSally Hermanson, who\u2019s running everything for the reunion? Said when she called Georgia last year to ask if she\u2019d be interested in helping organize it? Georgia said no and she doubted she\u2019d be attending the reunion anyway.\u201d Roxanne shrugged. \u201cI sure as hell wouldn\u2019t show up if I was her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. Divorced from the guy you married right out of high school. I heard she lives with her mom in some hippie commune in Boulder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard her dad doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s why Deck kicked her out,\u201d Leah added.</p><p>\u201cOr else she was too good to be married to a guy who became a pig farmer.\u201d</p><p>Both women snorted.</p><p>Tell slammed his beer glass on the table. \u201cJesus. Really? You guys haven\u2019t seen Georgia or talked to her in ten years and you automatically assume she\u2019s exactly the same person she was back then? Why? None of us are the same. Thank God we\u2019ve changed, but you can be damn sure I ain\u2019t gonna stoop to your level and point them changes out, because they ain\u2019t all good.\u201d He stood, tossed a twenty on the table and went to find her.</p><p>Georgia had taken a booth in the center of the room. Some guy appeared to be harassing her. Tell tapped him on the shoulder and recognized him as Dalton\u2019s former classmate. \u201cMonte. Been a long time. You waiting for the band to start?\u201d He maneuvered him aside so he could slide into the booth opposite Georgia.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m just looking for someone to take to my buddy Brad\u2019s party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know Mira? Skinny blonde? She mentioned wanting to get wild tonight. Track her down. She\u2019d be game.\u201d</p><p>Monte said, \u201cThanks for the tip, McKay,\u201d and loped off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t mind that I interrupted?\u201d Tell asked, suppressing a grin. \u201cOr were you interested in accompanying Monte to a kegger?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her low-pitched, sexy laugh hadn\u2019t changed either. \u201cSo will you let me buy you a drink?\u201d</p><p>Her face shuttered. \u201cIf it won\u2019t ruin your reputation being seen in public with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember when you wouldn\u2019t be seen with me. So, it\u2019s a chance I\u2019m willing to take.\u201d</p><p>A waitress took their drink order.</p><p>\u201cSo, I overheard part of the conversation with your friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d Hopefully not Mira\u2019s last comment.</p><p>\u201cThe part about you having a bunch of women on the hook.\u201d Georgia cocked her head. \u201cEmbraced your McKay wild-man heritage after we graduated, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith both hands. I had plenty of wild oats to sow and I\u2019ve enjoyed the hell out of plowing up every single row.\u201d He adjusted his hat. \u201cSorry Leah and Roxanne went off on you.\u201d</p><p>Those pale-blue eyes searched his. \u201cNot your fault. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve faced that kind of hostility since I returned to Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReturned? You\u2019re not just visiting?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Well didn\u2019t that just present some interesting possibilities? \u201cFill me in on the last ten years in the life of Georgia Hotchkiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I bare all, McKay, you\u2019d better be willing to do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t have a problem baring anything, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>She blushed.</p><p>Huh. How about that.</p><p>Once they\u2019d been served their drinks, Georgia said, \u201cWhen was the last time we saw each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter graduation. That night at the lake.\u201d She\u2019d shown up in skintight Daisy Duke short-shorts and an icy-blue tank top that matched her eyes. He\u2019d stood by the bonfire, mesmerized by the golden glow reflecting on her beautiful face, taking her from the realm of a pretty woman to that of a goddess. She\u2019d only stayed long enough to forever burn that image of her in his mind.</p><p>\u201cMy life. Let\u2019s see... Deck and I got married the month after graduation. RJ died the next summer. Then my mom left my dad. I was divorced from Deck by my twenty-first birthday. I finished college in Laramie and got a job in Dallas. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Okay. Maybe he\u2019d expected more. But...she had boiled it down to the basics.</p><p>She took a drink. \u201cYou know, I was so self-involved back then I have no idea if you went to college.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You were definitely smart enough. You graduated at the top of our class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere were only a hundred and thirty kids in our class,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cYou never considered it?\u201d</p><p>Even though ten years had passed, Tell couldn\u2019t confess there\u2019d been no money for college. \u201cI\u2019m a generational Wyoming rancher. My life choices were decided for me when I was born.\u201d He sipped his beer. \u201cBut I did take off the summer I turned nineteen. Spent three months on the southwest rodeo circuit. Considered going pro.\u201d Part of him hadn\u2019t wanted to come back. But he\u2019d felt guilty about leaving all the ranch work to his brothers, and he\u2019d missed Wyoming more than he thought possible.</p><p>\u201cThat was the summer RJ died.\u201d She started picking at the cocktail napkin. An air of sadness softened her brusque demeanor.</p><p>It ripped at him, but Tell knew how that felt. Putting on a brave face or a funny face because that\u2019s what was expected. He covered her hand. \u201cI\u2019m so damn sorry.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t pull away from his touch. \u201cDid you know my father went off the deep end two months after RJ\u2019s funeral?\u201d Her gaze met his again. \u201cSorry. This is all old news to you. I\u2019m sure the town gossips had a field day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never heard anything about it,\u201d he lied.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know which is worse. Being the object of gossip. Or no one caring enough to gossip about you.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea what to say to that.</p><p>The band started tuning up.</p><p>Her melancholy mood disappeared and she offered him a dazzling smile that set off his warning bells. \u201cEnough about me. So you\u2019re ranching?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou raising Black Angus? Or Herefords?\u201d</p><p>Tell studied her. It\u2019d been a while but he still recognized the switch\u2014cranking the charm on high meant she wanted something from him. Time to let her know he wasn\u2019t the gullible teen boy he\u2019d been. \u201cDo you really care?\u201d</p><p>That caught her by surprise. \u201cYes. Why would I ask if I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause small talk ain\u2019t ever been your style.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t deny it.</p><p>He took it a step further. \u201cBesides, I get the feeling you came here tonight lookin\u2019 for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCocky much? I didn\u2019t ask you to join me, Tell. So feel free to leave.\u201d</p><p>And that retort was so old-school Georgia-like he had to grin. \u201cThere\u2019s the glare I remember. I prefer it to that fake flirting thing you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFake flirting? You don\u2019t think much of me, do you, McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a decade and I ain\u2019t gonna pretend I know you. Likewise, you don\u2019t know me. So you oughta understand that I\u2019m a straight-shooter. If you wanna continue this conversation, you\u2019d best be up front about what you want from me, without dousing me with your feminine wiles.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Georgia laughed. \u201cNow I remember why I always liked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I was easily manipulated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re still tossing off those one-liners every chance you get in an attempt to charm and distract.\u201d</p> <p>Ouch. He deserved that. It surprised him that she remembered that about him. He smiled. \u201cNow we\u2019re getting someplace. So spill it, hot lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are right. I did come to the bar tonight looking for you to ask if you\u2019re going to the class reunion in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d planned on going to the Saturday night stuff, but not the Friday family picnic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have a date?\u201d</p><p>Why did his heart rate spike? \u201cNot yet. Why?\u201d</p> <p>She blurted, \u201cWill you be my date?\u201d</p><p>After the shock wore off, Tell leaned forward. \u201cFor real, Georgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor real. I hadn\u2019t planned on going to the reunion. What a fun way to spend an evening, dealing with the stares, rude comments and whispers about why Deck and I are divorced. Or hearing about what a tragedy it was that RJ got killed driving drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>Her pale-blue eyes remained on his. \u201cSeeing you last night.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t fall for it. Demand a solid reason. \u201cBecause...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you know how to have fun. And if I went with you, I might have a chance at having fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour change of heart about revisiting those glory days isn\u2019t because Deck hates my guts and it\u2019d be a hard poke at him to show up with me on your arm?\u201d</p><p>She allowed a tiny, embarrassed smile. \u201cOkay. Maybe that\u2019s part of it. And you have to admit it\u2019d be a great bit of drama if we showed up together.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat it might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t go to the family picnic that Friday either. I\u2019ll be out of town for a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked what you\u2019re doin\u2019 for a living that allowed you to move back to Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work for an event management company out of Dallas. We have a PR arm and an advertising arm, and we mostly handle promotion for events like rodeos, concerts and benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the company?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBarb Wyre PR. Ever heard of it?\u201d</p><p>He had heard of it. Recently. \u201cThe committee that hired me as a judge for the rodeo in Buffalo next weekend mentioned L bar K had been bought out by another company.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWait a second. You\u2019re a PRCA judge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor over two years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. I figured you\u2019d always have a foot in the rodeo world. Seems to be an addiction.\u201d</p><p>Tell knew that Deck was a judge too, but they\u2019d never worked a rodeo together, and he\u2019d always been thankful for that. \u201cHow many other rodeos is your company providing promotion for this summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty, right now. We seem to add more every week. Why?\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s mind was churning. This could be his chance not only to get more judging gigs, but to get Georgia Hotchkiss where he\u2019d always wanted her: on his arm in public and in his bed. \u201cDo you have judges scheduled for all those events?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d have to look, but I\u2019m betting not. Not all rodeos are PRCA-sanctioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve worked quite a few that aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many PRCA events are you scheduled to judge this summer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly four. Which ain\u2019t bad, considering I haven\u2019t been doin\u2019 it that long and I\u2019ve mostly been judging small rodeos in the area during the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you pissed off one of the higher-ups in the regional PRCA judge management?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so far as I know. The only thing I can think of is the committees that hire companies like yours are goin\u2019 with judges who have more years on the dirt. How am I supposed to get experience if I don\u2019t get the chance to judge?\u201d</p><p>Georgia thoughtfully drummed her fingers on the table. \u201cThat is a catch-22, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could help me change that. We could help each other out. If you like how I conduct myself, then you could drop my name to the committees that hire judges for non-PRCA rodeos. Extolling my...qualifications.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what would I get in return?\u201d</p><p>Tell bestowed his most charming grin. \u201cI\u2019d be your date for the reunion. Might be fun, bein\u2019 the stick you use to poke Deck and anyone else who wants to take a whack at you.\u201d</p><p>A strange expression flitted across her face, but she hadn\u2019t automatically said no.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t our classmates think it\u2019s a setup? Or worse, that you\u2019re my date strictly out of pity? I don\u2019t want to be pitied, Tell.\u201d</p><p>That could be a problem for both of them. He snapped his fingers as a solution occurred to him. \u201cThen we\u2019ll just have to convince everyone in town that we\u2019re crazy about each other in the next two weeks before the reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy pretending to be together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetness, there wouldn\u2019t be no pretending. We\u2019d be together for real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine \u2018for real\u2019.\u201d</p><p>His gaze encompassed her face, then dipped to her chest, and he didn\u2019t bother to bank his lust when their eyes met again. \u201cYou want me as your date for the reunion? I\u2019ll also be sharin\u2019 your bed.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s jaw dropped and she shrank back in the booth.</p><p>\u201cIs that such a repulsive thought to you?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cGod no. Not at all. You\u2019re just so\u2014\u201d Her mouth snapped shut on whatever she\u2019d been about to say. \u201cWho is gonna believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone, if we play this right.\u201d He leaned in, trying to hard-sell it. \u201cSee, we\u2019ve already got the ball rolling. We were seen in the park together today. We\u2019re sitting in the Golden Boot right now. I told off my friends\u2019 wives for their bitchy behavior toward you, and Leah and Roxanne are two of the biggest gossips in town. It\u2019ll get around. Trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou defended me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat mean-girl shit don\u2019t fly with me.\u201d</p><p>When Georgia continued to stare at him without speaking, he started to get annoyed. \u201cWhy\u2019re you so shocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t expecting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expected I\u2019d be happy just holdin\u2019 your hand and smelling your hair?\u201d Had he really said that? Be a man. Be firm. You\u2019re no longer that eager-to-please pup. \u201cWrong. Nothin\u2019 comes for free. We\u2019ll be lovers. Not friends. There\u2019s your deal. Take it or leave it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo room for negotiation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s chin came up and her eyes were pure skepticism. \u201cOh really? Not even when a no on my part could mean you don\u2019t get assigned to more rodeos?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He finished his beer and slid out of the booth. \u201cLet me know what you decide, but I wouldn\u2019t take too long to make up my mind, sweetness, because you are not the only woman who\u2019s asked me to be her reunion date.\u201d</p><p>Damn hard to do, but Tell walked away.</p><p>When did you turn into a mouse, Georgia Hotchkiss?</p><p>She\u2019d scurried out of the bar and was pacing in the parking lot, a little shocked by Tell\u2019s aggressive side. He\u2019d always been so laid back. Then again... How well had she known him ten years ago?</p><p>Not well at all.</p><p>But she\u2019d really like to get to know him now. On the most basic, carnal level.</p><p>What was the worst that could happen if she said yes to Tell\u2019s demands? Sex would be bad with him? Doubtful.</p><p>Still, Georgia couldn\u2019t shake the feeling this might be a game. He\u2019d agree to attend the reunion with her, have sex with her beforehand, but back out at the last minute, just to get even with her.</p><p>She hated to think along those lines, but she had to put that possibility into the equation. Along with the fear that Tell was living out some high school fantasy. As soon as he bedded her, he\u2019d revert to locker room behavior and brag that he\u2019d nailed the homecoming queen.</p><p>Where did that leave her? Sorting fact from fear.</p><p>Fact 1: Tell McKay was undeniably hot.</p><p>Fact 2: He wanted her on his terms.</p><p>Fact 3: She could be the bold, sexually adventurous woman she\u2019d always wanted to be.</p><p>Fact 4: She was leaving at summer\u2019s end.</p><p>So why was she debating the pros and cons in the dark parking lot of a honky-tonk? Because he\u2019d unnerved her? Or because he\u2019d made her panties wet with one simple demand?</p><p>She had nothing to lose...and everything to gain.</p><p>That cinched it. She\u2019d become Tell McKay\u2019s lover for however long it lasted.</p><p>Mind made up, Georgia walked to the bar entrance. Who should wander out but Leah and Roxanne. They didn\u2019t act nearly so confident without a bar full of people bolstering their courage.</p><p>\u201cYou know the funny thing about returning here?\u201d Georgia sauntered forward. \u201cThe length of time away is disproportionate to the level of animosity I faced when I lived in Sundance. I get that neither of you liked me during our years together in high school. But did either of you really know me?</p><p>\u201cGranted, I didn\u2019t know you either, so I\u2019ll give you both a pass on that one. But what I do know? I didn\u2019t try and steal your boyfriends. I didn\u2019t snub you because you wore a purity ring. I didn\u2019t put gum in your hair. I didn\u2019t X out your face in every homecoming and prom picture. But you know what? Every one of those things was done...to me. So remember that when you embellish the past and paint me out to be some nasty bitch. I wasn\u2019t that way back then and I\u2019m not that way now. It sucks if someone made your high school years hell, but that someone was not me. And my high school years weren\u2019t a bucket of fucking roses either. Think about that.\u201d She walked between them into the bar.</p><p>One monkey off my back.</p><p>The noise had increased exponentially. The lighting seemed dimmer. The air smokier. Technically smoking wasn\u2019t allowed in the bar, but folks in Wyoming didn\u2019t appreciate the government handing down decrees, so they ignored them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Georgia scanned the line at bar. The dance floor. The pool tables. Then she saw him. Her belly swooped. Her mouth dried. Her sex clenched.</p><p>Even in a room full of hat-and-jeans-wearing cowboys, Tell McKay stood out. A prize bull, a top stud, a virile male.</p><p>He studied her nonchalantly, as if trying to gauge her intent. Waiting for her to make the first move.</p> <p>So she did.</p><p>Squaring her shoulders, she offered him a sexy smile and started toward him.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The neon glow from the bar lights created a blue halo above her shiny black hair.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t look like an angel. She looked like a temptress.</p> <p>Tell\u2019s eyes ate up every inch of Georgia\u2019s sexy body as she meandered toward him. He drained his beer and set the bottle aside, meeting her halfway. \u201cYou came back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something...compelling about you, Tell. There always has been. I couldn\u2019t stay away.\u201d</p><p>He bit back a growl. \u201cYou know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay it. Out loud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in my bed or I\u2019ll be in yours. Either way, we\u2019ll be lovers.\u201d</p><p>He ran his palm down her arm, from her shoulder to her fingertips. Her skin beaded and a tiny shiver rolled through her.</p><p>Now that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about.</p><p>Without asking, Tell clasped her hand and led her to the dance floor. Holding her felt as good as he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>She was such a petite thing. The sky-high heels she wore put the top of her head level with his chin. She definitely had curves in the right places now, all luscious woman, not athletic girl.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said much, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Bein\u2019 so short. Remembering when the cheerleaders threw you in the air at football games.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d be hard-pressed to basket-toss me now.\u201d</p><p>Tell tipped up her chin. \u201cYou looked good then, but you look even better now.\u201d</p><p>She said, \u201cOh really?\u201d as if she didn\u2019t believe him.</p><p>\u201cYep. Now I won\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll break you when I fuck you hard.\u201d</p><p>Those stunning eyes widened. With shock? Some. But mostly interest.</p><p>Tell just smiled and spun her around the dance floor.</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak through the next song; they held fast and learned the rhythm of their bodies until they were in perfect synch. Georgia followed his lead like she was born to it. Would she be that yielding in bed?</p><p>You don\u2019t want that. You want her all over you like a cat in heat. Hissing. Scratching. Rubbing. Purring.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>He refocused on her. \u201cYeah. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made a strange noise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a growl.\u201d He bent his head closer to hers. \u201cI suspect you\u2019ll bring out the beast in me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to scare me off, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, but maybe this will.\u201d Tell twined a handful of her hair around his fingers, pulling those soft tresses to tilt her head back. He kept their gazes fastened as his mouth descended. Once their lips touched, he kissed her with the zeal of a seventeen-year-old boy, but with the finesse of a twenty-eight-year-old man.</p><p>She surrendered to him, kissing him with passion as alluring as the taste of her. The press of her lips, so pillowy soft, yet so firmly locked to his hungry mouth, sent a spike of desire straight to his dick.</p><p>Tell could\u2019ve kissed her all damn night, but he\u2019d taken things a step further than was smart. He released his possessive grip on her hair and broke the seal of their mouths, feeling her rapid exhalations on his kiss-swollen lips.</p><p>She opened her eyes. A mix of wonder and hunger flared in the icy-blue depths.</p><p>They began dancing again. \u201cThat oughta get some tongues a\u2019waggin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t crack a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make their jaws drop. Come home with me tonight.\u201d</p><p>Immediately his dick was on board with her suggestion. But a quick fuck wasn\u2019t in the cards for them. He\u2019d been waiting a long time for this, so she sure as hell wasn\u2019t getting instant gratification. A little sexual teasing would be good for her. For him too.</p><p>She brushed her mouth against the corner of his lips. \u201cYou know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t believe. But we\u2019re gonna do this the right way. We\u2019ll spend time together before we slip between the sheets.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows knitted. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Aren\u2019t we trying to convince them we\u2019re lovers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we want people to believe we\u2019re really a couple, then we need to be out and about doin\u2019 couple things, not just banging each other behind closed doors.\u201d Tell put his lips by her ear. \u201cOnce I get you nekkid\u2014and trust me, sweetness, that will happen sooner rather than later\u2014we\u2019ll be there for a while. A good long while.\u201d</p><p>Georgia shivered.</p><p>When the band switched to a fast tune, he led her off the dance floor and purposely sat across from her in the booth.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll go home. I\u2019ll stick around here for another hour or so. Then we\u2019ll meet tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cLet\u2019s get one thing straight. If we\u2019re a couple, then I expect you to only be with me.\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cYou think the second you\u2019re out the door I\u2019ll take some other woman home with me? Wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? Because you admitted earlier that you have a reputation as a player. I\u2019ve seen the glances other women are throwing your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got no control over who looks at me, Georgia. You either trust me or you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She was clearly torn, wanting more assurances, but Tell offered her none. Finally a faint smile touched her lips. \u201cObviously I have some trust issues that aren\u2019t your concern. So what are we doing tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>Tell brought her hand to his mouth and kissed her knuckles. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have some fun. Because I get the feelin\u2019 you don\u2019t have near enough fun in your life, hot lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet you to loosen up? Yes, I do. \u2019Cause that\u2019s one of the things I do best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the other thing?\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow at her and smirked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd proud of it. Mark my words, I\u2019m gonna make you have fun tomorrow even if it pisses you off.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed. \u201cWhat fun thing do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 you out for ice cream. But first we\u2019ll meet in the park at the basketball court. Wear something casual and sporty, because sweetness, I\u2019m gonna make you work for that very first lick.\u201d</p><p>Casual and sporty, he\u2019d said.</p><p>Georgia checked her reflection in the bathroom mirror for the fourteenth time before she muttered, \u201cScrew it,\u201d and sailed out the door. On the walk, she gave herself a pep talk.</p><p>Don\u2019t overanalyze everything. Have fun. Be sexy. Be flirty. In other words, act nothing like yourself.</p><p>No pressure.</p><p>By the time she reached the park, she\u2019d calmed herself down.</p><p>Then she got a gander at Tell McKay and her heart rate zoomed into the danger zone again.</p><p>Uh, yeah. No mistaking him for a teenage boy now.</p><p>Tell wore black basketball shorts that hung above his knees and a sleeveless gray top that molded to his upper body. Over the years he\u2019d bulked up, making his chest appear broader than she\u2019d remembered. And yeah, baby, check out those well-defined arms. His skin was startlingly white from the ball of his shoulder to his muscled biceps, and from that point down, the length of his arm was a caramel brown. Even a farmer\u2019s tan looked good on him.</p><p>He noticed her and jogged over, holding a basketball. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came.\u201d His gaze moved over her body from her orange Lycra tank top to her gray cotton capris to her black athletic shoes. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too.\u201d Without a cowboy hat covering his dark hair, she saw the ends held a slight curl. Such a tempting man, with his banging body, piercing blue eyes and those deep dimples. She wanted to lick him up one side and down the other. And that was a totally foreign feeling to her. She defined reserved in all matters of her life, especially in relationships with the opposite sex.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were going out for ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter.\u201d He dribbled the ball around her. Stopped and took a shot at the basket. Naturally, he sank it. He chased after the ball and bounced it as he returned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good. Why didn\u2019t you play in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt conflicted with rodeo season. I like shooting hoops for fun. Not everything has to be about competition.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his in direct challenge. \u201cSo we\u2019re not havin\u2019 us a little contest?\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed. \u201cYou mimic me pretty well, sweetness. Yes, we\u2019re havin\u2019 us a little contest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t go one-on-one with you, Tell. You\u2019re too big.\u201d</p><p>He eyes smoldered. \u201cI\u2019ve no doubt you could take me. Take all of me just fine.\u201d</p><p>Wasn\u2019t he just pouring on sexual innuendo today? And didn\u2019t she get a secret thrill out of it? When was the last time any man had cajoled her into having fun while making her think of hot skin, cool sheets, and a night without end? Never, probably.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re playing for ice cream?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head slowly, gifting her with a sexy, sly grin. \u201cIf you win, you get to pick the place on your body I kiss. If I win, I get to pick the place on your body to kiss.\u201d</p><p>Her mind automatically compiled a list of spots, adding stars and hearts to her favorites.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze zoomed back to him to see a sinful grin on his handsome face. \u201cThat sounds like a heckuva good deal for me. What do you get out of it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He loomed over, all hard-bodied man. \u201cI finally get to put my mouth on you wherever I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo confident you\u2019re gonna win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already won.\u201d Tell pressed his lips to hers and let the kiss linger. No tongue, just the warm tease of his mouth. \u201cI trust you know how to play horse?\u201d he murmured between soft smooches.</p> <p>\u201cYes. But I get to shoot first because you\u2019re going down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I\u2019m goin\u2019 down on you.\u201d Grinning wickedly, he handed her the ball. \u201cShow me whatcha got, hot lips.\u201d</p><p>Georgia had always hated that nickname, but coming from Tell in that husky male rasp...made it sound sexy. Standing on the right side of the basket, she shot and the ball bounced off the glass to the other side.</p><p>\u201cTough break. My turn.\u201d Tell performed some fancy dribbling maneuver around her. Stopping beneath the basket, he took the shot.</p><p>Nothing but net.</p> <p>\u201cAnd the crowd goes wild.\u201d Tell spun a circle, pumped his fist into the air, then passed her the ball.</p><p>Okay. She could do this. No sweat. She lobbed the ball at the basket and it dropped in. She must\u2019ve had a surprised look because Tell laughed when he high-fived her.</p><p>He snatched the ball and lined up at the free throw mark. He bounced the ball four times and then let it fly.</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Dammit. She\u2019d never make that shot. Georgia felt Tell move in behind her at the free throw line; his breath tickled her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t forget. It was four bounces before the shot. If you don\u2019t do it exactly right, you\u2019ll earn a penalty.\u201d</p><p>She faced him. \u201cThat\u2019s not in the rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s one thing you oughta know about me, sweetness. I make up my own rules.\u201d</p><p>Tempting to break the rules just to see what he\u2019d do. But Tell probably expected that. She dribbled four times and sent the ball into the air, only to watch it bounce off the rim.</p><p>\u201cAnd she earns an \u2018H\u2019. Better luck next time.\u201d</p><p>For the next two shots, Tell remained in the same place at the free throw line. He aced both baskets, which added an \u201cO\u201d and an \u201cR\u201d to her score when she missed both hers.</p><p>Tell slam-dunked the next one.</p><p>\u201cNow that, Tell McKay, is just plain mean. I\u2019m short. I need a ladder to make that shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr some help.\u201d He handed her the ball. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d barely squeaked from her mouth before Tell wrapped his arms around her thighs and hoisted her up. \u201cOmigod, I weigh too much for you to be lifting me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit. Now dunk that ball in the basket.\u201d</p><p>Using both hands, she slammed it in the hoop. She released a loud whoop and kept her eyes on Tell\u2019s as he allowed her to slide down his body slowly enough that every hard inch of his upper torso pressed into her thighs, belly and chest.</p><p>When they were eye to eye, Tell muttered, \u201cYou\u2019re just so goddamn tempting I can\u2019t help myself,\u201d and snared her mouth in a kiss.</p><p>Tell McKay kissed the daylights out of her. Even after he finally let her feet touch the ground, Georgia still had that floating sensation.</p><p>\u201cI could get used to seein\u2019 that dazed look every time I kiss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could get used to you kissing me like that,\u201d she shot back. \u201cBut I know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheating. Trying to keep me off-balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He flashed an unapologetic grin. \u201cAnd I\u2019m even gonna let you take the next shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you believe I won\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><p>He walked backward with his hands out. \u201cSo prove me wrong.\u201d</p><p>As Georgia scooped up the ball, she had a brilliant idea. She dribbled the ball until she reached the free throw line. Then she turned around.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, what are you doin\u2019? You\u2019re facing the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d With her back to the basket and her feet spread wide apart, she swung the ball between her knees and threw it over her head. She spun quickly, watching the ball hit the backboard, sloppily rimming the bucket before it dropped in. \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d She skipped toward Tell, taunting, \u201cIn your face, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I can\u2019t do it granny style, hot lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you can. Just as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make a crack about preferring to do it doggie style.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess you\u2019ll find out, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Georgia cooed, \u201cI\u2019m game for that right now.\u201d</p><p>Tell let the ball drop. He stalked her, but it wasn\u2019t like she tried to get away. He bent down and slapped his hands on her ass. \u201cJump up and wrap your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo. It. Now.\u201d</p><p>That bit of bossiness coming from him was hot. Soon as she moved, he lifted her, keeping a firm grip on her ass. Georgia emitted a little yelp, clutching his shoulders as he walked her backward until her upper body rested against the steel post.</p><p>His intense blue eyes were riveted on hers before he dipped his head. She expected fire the instant their lips touched, but Tell kissed her without hurry. Keeping the kiss soft, sweet and slow. As if he had all the time in the world to explore her mouth, to tease her tongue with little sucks and bites. To drive her to the edge of lust and hold her there for as long as he damn well pleased.</p><p>She tangled her fingers in his hair, drifting into a fuzzy state of pleasure. She couldn\u2019t blame the heat building between them on the sun. Just this man.</p><p>They only broke the kiss because someone whistled.</p><p>Tell\u2019s forehead met hers. \u201cDamn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are we gonna do about this, sweetness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a couple of ideas. Explicit ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I said, \u2018Georgia, let\u2019s hotfoot it to my place right now and get nekkid\u2019...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d race you to your truck. And I\u2019d probably win.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGuess that settles my question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>Tell studied her. \u201cIf you\u2019re shy when that bedroom door closes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I\u2019m not bossy, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. Because I am bossy.\u201d</p><p>She expected him to laugh and say just kidding, but apparently he was serious. Very serious. She swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cDid you know I had a hard-on every damn day in history class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh-hah!\u201d Georgia poked him in the chest. \u201cI knew studying the War Between the States got you all hot and bothered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny girl. You got me all hot and bothered. Every time your hair brushed across my knuckles, I imagined those soft strands teasing my dick. I\u2019d stare at the back of your head and daydream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout my hair?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNo. Mostly about sex stuff that I had no experience with, but your cherry-scented hair played a big part in every one of those horny teen dreams. And I wasn\u2019t the only guy in our school who got hard just from lookin\u2019 at you. I hoped my boner would be gone by the time the bell rang. So you wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>A sudden feeling of guilt caused her to blurt, \u201cWhat does that say about me, Tell? That I didn\u2019t notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says you were a seventeen-year-old girl immersed in her own dramas. It also says for bein\u2019 the hottest girl in school, you were unaware of your appeal. I didn\u2019t bring it up to make you feel bad, Georgia. I only said it because I\u2019m hard right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured that out on my own.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSee? You\u2019re much more observant now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how long do you plan to keep me pressed up against this pole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil my flagpole impression goes away. Just give me a minute to...catch my bearings, because we still need to finish our game,\u201d Tell murmured in her ear.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I forfeit. You win. Now can we get ice cream?\u201d</p><p>Tell kissed her and gently set her back on her feet. He picked up the basketball and held out his hand. \u201cWhere you thinking? Dairy Queen? Or the drive-in? Wherever we go, you cannot order a cone. No way can I hide an erection in these shorts if I watch that tongue of yours licking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad. I\u2019m definitely picking that.\u201d She yelped when he swatted her butt.</p><p>After piling in Tell\u2019s pickup, he patted the center of the bench seat and grinned at her.</p><p>Georgia rolled her eyes, but she scooted over.</p><p>The DQ parking lot was full on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Tell kept his hands on her shoulders and his body tucked in close behind hers as they waited in line. He read every item on the menu to her, and made every item sound dirty.</p><p>When she turned to warn him to knock it off or else she was ordering a chocolate-covered frozen banana, he kissed her. Not a quick peck either.</p><p>\u201cEww, Tell. I think I saw your tongue,\u201d a young male voice complained.</p><p>They broke the lip-lock and looked at the boy. Dark hair, blue eyes, wearing camo shorts and an orange Toby Keith T-shirt.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ky. Guess you haven\u2019t kissed a girl yet if you\u2019re still grossed out by it.\u201d</p><p>The kid blushed. \u201cI coulda kissed a girl if I wanted to, but who\u2019d want to?\u201d Ky\u2019s gaze landed on Georgia. \u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia Hotchkiss. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKy McKay. Tell is kinda my uncle.\u201d He threw back his thin shoulders, rising to his full height. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda short. I\u2019m almost taller than you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re about to get extra chores for bein\u2019 rude, Kyler.\u201d</p><p>The man who\u2019d spoken stood behind Ky with another dark-haired boy of about two resting on his hip. She\u2019d never met him, and he was probably a dozen years older than Tell, but he was obviously a McKay.</p><p>\u201cAw, Dad, I was just kiddin\u2019,\u201d Ky complained.</p><p>The man thrust out his hand and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Cord McKay. Tell\u2019s cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Cord. Who\u2019s the little guy?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cord glanced down as the boy hid his face. \u201cBeau. It\u2019s past his naptime and he\u2019s steppin\u2019 on his mama\u2019s last nerve today.\u201d</p><p>Another dark-haired boy, around age four, barreled up and head-butted Ky in the stomach. \u201cYou stole my toy!\u201d</p><p>Ky looked innocent. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talkin\u2019 about, Foster. You probably lost it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive it back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby. It\u2019s just a stupid toy.\u201d</p><p>Foster growled and charged Ky again, but was handily stopped by his father. \u201cKnock it off. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>A pregnant blonde stopped next to Cord, and Beau tried to jump out of his father\u2019s arms into hers. When Cord kept that from happening, Beau wailed.</p><p>Cord passed off the crying Beau to Ky and handed him a set of keys. \u201cTake your brothers to the truck. But don\u2019t even think about starting it,\u201d he warned.</p><p>The boys raced out.</p><p>Cord put his hand on the woman\u2019s lower back and kissed her temple.</p><p>But the pretty blonde wasn\u2019t looking at her husband. She was looking at Georgia.</p><p>Tell said, \u201cThis is Cord\u2019s wife, AJ. AJ, this is Georgia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who she is,\u201d AJ replied coolly. \u201cWe went to school together.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t remember this woman at all and she started to get that panicked feeling like she should know her.</p><p>\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know me since I didn\u2019t have time to go to football games, dances and such. I was too busy working on the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that experience came in mighty handy when you married a rancher, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Cord kissed her temple again. \u201cCome on, baby doll, let\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>Georgia said, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Cord nodded, but AJ didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>Another snub.</p><p>\u201cAJ\u2019s usually really sweet, but you wouldn\u2019t know it today. Sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like she has her hands full.\u201d She smiled, trying to act like it didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI\u2019ve decided on an Oreo Blizzard.\u201d</p><p>They finished their ice cream in Tell\u2019s pickup. Then Tell eased the seat back and patted his thighs. \u201cYou\u2019re lookin\u2019 a little cold. I\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p><p>She put her knees by his hips, facing him as she sat on his lap. \u201cChecking out my nipples, were you?\u201d</p> <p>That bold observation seemed to shock him. \u201cWhat? No. I saw you shiver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Maybe I shivered because I saw you eyeballing my chest, Tell McKay.\u201d</p><p>He placed his cold lips on the hollow of her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s been distracting me all damn day because I know you ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 a bra.\u201d</p><p>Georgia rested her elbows on his shoulders. \u201cWould I have had a chance at winning the basketball game today if you\u2019d known I\u2019m not wearing panties?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But the game would\u2019ve been over before it began.\u201d Tell kissed her hotly, sliding his hands beneath her backside, urging her to her knees so he could run his hands from the curve of her hips, over her butt, down the backs of her thighs and back up.</p><p>Her fingers mapped the breadth of his shoulders and the cut muscles of his arms. Such defined biceps. Ripped triceps. Even his forearms were meaty. She let her fingers lightly trail back up to tangle in his hair.</p><p>The kiss turned playful. When his tongue tickled the roof of her mouth, she laughed and leaned back to look at him.</p><p>Tell had a slight smile on his face, but his eyes were dark with sexual heat.</p><p>So she took a chance that he\u2019d act on it with a little encouragement. \u201cWill you come inside when you take me home? Show me where you want to place the winning kiss?\u201d</p><p>He traced her lips with his thumb. Then his finger drew a line down her throat to the middle of her chest. \u201cYou are so sexy, Georgia. I want you like crazy. But I\u2019ve got things to finish before dark.\u201d He brushed his knuckles over the rise of her cleavage. \u201cOnce I get you in bed, we\u2019re gonna stay there awhile. That\u2019s not a possibility tonight.\u201d</p><p>Georgia spread his palms over her breasts. \u201cI don\u2019t mind a quick tumble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He moved his hands to her rib cage, his thumbs stroking her hardened nipples. \u201cBut that don\u2019t keep me from imaging how it\u2019s gonna be between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in your wildest imagination, what is the first thing you\u2019d do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip you to skin. Learn every inch of it with my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Would you get me off while you\u2019re touching me, or do you keep me hanging on the edge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely keep you hanging.\u201d His mouth skated across her collarbone. \u201cUntil you\u2019re begging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re tired of hearing me beg, do you use your fingers to make me come? Or do you use that wicked mouth between my thighs? Or maybe you\u2019ll go straight for ramming your cock into me.\u201d She\u2019d started rocking her pelvis and she wondered if he realized he was pushing his hips up to match the motion.</p><p>\u201cYou like dirty talk?\u201d</p><p>She sank her teeth into his bottom lip, tugging slightly before releasing it with a wet pop. The flame of want in his eyes burned hotter. \u201cI love it. The dirtier the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it. Say something dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me harder, Tell. Put your cock in my mouth, Tell. Bend me over the tailgate of your pickup, Tell.\u201d</p><p>His breaths were choppy. His jaw set. One hand squeezed her breast. The other hand gripped her hair. He rubbed his mouth over her ear, teasing her mercilessly until she was shuddering in his arms.</p><p>\u201cDid that change your mind?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. It was freakin\u2019 hot. But here\u2019s a warning. You can say all the raunchy things you want. Get me so damn worked up I\u2019m ready to shoot in my shorts. But guess what? The more you tease, the longer I\u2019m gonna make us wait.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help the bewildered, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, sweetness, I can.\u201d Then he kissed her. Not with the hunger, but with delicacy. Letting their harsh breaths mingle, thoroughly teasing her lips, making her want a firmer kiss. Making her want his unrestrained passion, not his caution.</p><p>Tell held her face in his hands and ended the kiss. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home.\u201d</p><p>Dazed, and a little petulant, Georgia tried to return to the passenger\u2019s side, but he wouldn\u2019t allow her retreat. He pulled her back to the middle of the bench seat and rested his hand on the inside of her thigh.</p><p>He left his pickup idling by the curb as he walked her up the sidewalk. \u201cDidja have fun today, Georgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Did you notice all the folks watchin\u2019 us? Ought to make for some interesting chatter around town tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d had such a great time she\u2019d forgotten that creating buzz about them being a couple was part of the deal.</p><p>He stopped in front of the door. \u201cYou busy tomorrow night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore of this \u2018see and be seen as a couple\u2019 stuff?\u201d</p><p>Bristling, he stepped back. \u201cYou can say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying no tonight, Tell.\u201d Maybe he wouldn\u2019t notice that came out kind of whiny.</p><p>\u201cI know that too. What\u2019s with the snippy answers and the pouty face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pouting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you are.\u201d He pushed her against the door. \u201cGimme a smile, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can give me a smile or I\u2019ll take it.\u201d He poked her ribs, trying to find her ticklish spots.</p><p>\u201cNo fair. Stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. All\u2019s you gotta do is lemme see that pretty smile.\u201d More pokes.</p><p>She giggled. God. When was the last time that\u2019d happened?</p><p>\u201cA laugh will work too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her cheek and tickled her until she shrieked, \u201cTell!\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m done.\u201d He stepped back. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The instant Tell popped out of bed he thought it\u2019d be a damn fine day.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to get outside and do chores. Or more to the point, finish chores so he could come home, get cleaned up for his date with Georgia tonight.</p><p>Hard to believe he had another date with Georgia Hotchkiss.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted to hang out with her longer yesterday, but he knew they\u2019d wind up in bed and he wanted to wait.</p><p>Why? Haven\u2019t ten years been long enough? Or are you stalling because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll disappoint her in the sack?</p><p>No. The younger version of himself might\u2019ve been worried Georgia would find him lacking in bedroom skills. That definitely wasn\u2019t the case now. He wouldn\u2019t rush this; he had one chance to get it right.</p><p>Juggling his coffee, he drove to Dalton\u2019s place.</p><p>Dalton ambled out after Tell honked three times. His brother wore sunglasses\u2014never a good sign. He was either hungover or he\u2019d been fighting or both.</p><p>\u201cRough weekend, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight say that.\u201d</p><p>Tell pointed at his shades. \u201cTake \u2019em off and lemme see how bad.\u201d</p><p>Dalton slid his sunglasses down his nose, revealing a blackened right eye. \u201cSatisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wanna let me in on what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d He pushed the shades in place and adjusted his hat. \u201cI\u2019ll just say the other guy looked worse than me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat part of I don\u2019t wanna talk about this is confusing you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouchy much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, so maybe we oughta hurry this up today so you don\u2019t gotta be around my crabby ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try. We\u2019re fixin\u2019 fence when we meet up with Brandt.\u201d</p><p>Dalton groaned. \u201cFuck. Can\u2019t it wait another damn day? I\u2019m whupped, T.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t my fault you played too hard. We gotta get that section fixed because Brandt wants to run the bulls in there after we\u2019re done turnin\u2019 them out with the cows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right around the time Jessie is set to calve.\u201d</p><p>Tell snickered. \u201cI doubt she\u2019d find the humor in comparing her to a heifer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit. She ain\u2019t finding humor in anything. Brandt told me she cried for an hour after she dropped a dish and she couldn\u2019t bend down to pick up the broken pieces.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat don\u2019t sound like Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat don\u2019t sound like Brandt, neither. He never tells me shit like that.\u201d</p><p>Tell downshifted as they crested a small rise. \u201cHe\u2019s just worried about this pregnancy. And who can blame him?\u201d Shortly after their dad got out of rehab, Jessie had miscarried. In a moment of anger, Brandt blamed the loss on the stress their father caused. Being a total asshole, Dad said the baby dying was God\u2019s will.</p><p>Yeah, that\u2019d been a fun day.</p><p>So Jess and Brandt hadn\u2019t announced her pregnancy until she\u2019d reached the end of the fourth month. Everything was progressing normally. But the truth was, they were all a little anxious.</p> <p>The pastures still had enough grass they hadn\u2019t needed to supplement feed. Funny how the only time cattle paid attention to them was when they were hungry.</p><p>While Dalton catnapped in the truck, Tell walked the fence line until he reached the first section they\u2019d rip out and replace.</p><p>He and Dalton were unloading equipment when Brandt drove up. He was all business. \u201cMornin\u2019. Let\u2019s only do the first half today. Jess has a doctor\u2019s appointment this afternoon, so she\u2019s home. And there\u2019s no cell service on this part of the ranch, so I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorry,\u201d Tell and Dalton finished simultaneously. Then they grinned at each other and high-fived. Eerie, how often they were on the same wavelength. Although he and Brandt were closer in age, Tell and Dalton had spent more time together as kids and as adults, because Luke and Brandt had been so tight.</p><p>\u201cLooks like I\u2019m workin\u2019 with Tweedledee and Tweedledum today.\u201d</p><p>Dalton poked at Brandt\u2019s belly. \u201cLooks like we\u2019re workin\u2019 with the Pillsbury Doughboy today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJesus, Dalton,\u201d Tell said with a groan.</p><p>The comment rolled right off Brandt. \u201cYeah, I know I\u2019ve packed on an extra twenty pounds. But Jess is so damn self-conscious of how much she eats that if I\u2019m not shoveling food in my mouth right along with her, she won\u2019t eat. That ain\u2019t good for her or the baby. So I\u2019ll deal with my flabby gut after that kid is out of my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you need someone to be your fitness drill sergeant, I\u2019m game,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cYou just wanna stand over him and yell,\u201d Tell retorted.</p><p>\u201cYep. And ain\u2019t you jealous that you didn\u2019t think of it first?\u201d</p><p>They dragged fence posts, a posthole digger, shovels, barbed wire and various hand tools to the first rotted post.</p><p>They\u2019d done this enough times there wasn\u2019t need for discussion, which Tell knew would\u2019ve bugged the crap out of most people. Silence ruled out on the western plains and between the McKays.</p><p>And if they\u2019d had the radio blasting or been jawing about nothing, he probably wouldn\u2019t have heard the rattler.</p> <p>He\u2019d noticed a weird-shaped chunk of rock behind Dalton\u2019s boot. Then that rock rose up.</p><p>\u201cAh, Dalton. There\u2019s a rattler about a foot from your left boot,\u201d Tell said calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s ready to strike at something, so I suggest you don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cShit,\u201d but stayed put.</p><p>\u201cBrandt, can you get on the back side of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? Poke it with a stick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what Dad would tell you just to see if it\u2019d strike you first. Hit it with a rock and see if it\u2019ll move away.\u201d</p><p>Brandt approached the snake with a spade and tossed a rock five feet behind it. But instead of it slithering the opposite direction, the snake moved forward, right between Dalton\u2019s feet.</p><p>Once the snake had slithered through, Brandt said, \u201cCatch,\u201d and tossed Dalton the spade.</p><p>Dalton brought the shovel down hard, slicing the snake in two.</p><p>\u201cNice. You keeping the pieces to make yourself a snakeskin hat band?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever. I don\u2019t even want the damn rattles.\u201d Dalton shivered from head to toe. \u201cI hate them things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the season. Guess that\u2019s a sign to break out the tall boots from here on out,\u201d Brandt said.</p><p>Dalton and Tell groaned. Most rattler bites happened below the knee, so thick leather boots that hit directly below the knee were necessary in the summer months. They all hated wearing them.</p><p>Even though it was just a little after one, they reloaded the equipment, deciding to call it a day.</p><p>Jessie\u2019s SUV bumped up the path to the fence.</p><p>Brandt was down the hill before Jessie opened her door.</p><p>Dalton and Tell weren\u2019t far behind.</p><p>The first thing Tell heard? Sweet Jessie snapping, \u201cFor Christsake, Brandt, will you move your ass and let me out of the damn car?\u201d</p><p>Okay. Maybe she wasn\u2019t so sweet today.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Brandt demanded.</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019 is wrong. I saw you forgot your water bottle and I knew it\u2019d be hot out here, so I brought it to you.\u201d She hoofed it up the small incline and gestured to Tell and Dalton, panting, \u201cBrought you guys some too.\u201d</p><p>Seemed Jess\u2019s belly had grown another six inches in the last week. She looked like she\u2019d swallowed a beach ball.</p><p>Not that Tell would share that observation with her.</p><p>\u201cThanks, sweetheart,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cThat\u2019s mighty thoughtful, but aren\u2019t you supposed to be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLocked in the damn house going out of my freakin\u2019 mind? I\u2019m supposed to sit around with my feet up so I can watch my ankles swell up like toads?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me to calm down or use that patronizing tone with me, mister. You\u2019ll be in the doghouse right along with Lexi. The little shit pissed me off today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dog pissed you off?\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s gaze pierced Dalton. \u201cYes. And if you spout off anything smart, Dalton McKay, you\u2019re liable to piss me off too.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s hands went up in the air. \u201cForget I said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d When she turned to her husband\u2014too fast\u2014and started to lose her balance, Brandt was right there, keeping her steady. He was smart enough not to warn her to be careful. Or to open his mouth at all.</p><p>\u201cThe other reason I came out here was because some guy called the house phone and needs to talk to you right away about irrigation sprinkler heads. Something about a back order? He\u2019s only going to be in the office another hour and then he goes on vacation for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddammit. Those have already been on back order for six weeks. I ain\u2019t waiting another month and a half for them. Let\u2019s go. I\u2019ll drive your car and Dalton can bring my truck to the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go on,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cNow that I\u2019m out of jail and see how nice it is, I\u2019m taking a few minutes to breathe in some fresh air.\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked torn, wanting to command her to get in the car, but also wanting to keep his head attached to his body. \u201cFine. But don\u2019t wander off. Dalton just killed a rattler.\u201d He set his hands on her belly, kissed her\u2014twice\u2014and whispered something that made her smile. Then he whacked her butt before he jogged to his truck.</p><p>Once Brandt was gone, Jessie put her hands on her hips and squared off with both of them. \u201cI lied about needing fresh air.\u201d</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you guys without your brother hovering.\u201d</p><p>Tell and Dalton exchanged a look. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou tell me. Brandt is beyond tense. Like heart attack and stroke-level stressed out, and I\u2019m scared. He won\u2019t talk to me. So I wondered if maybe something was going on with Casper or your mom or Landon or the ranch, or if you two boneheads are sneaking around, trying to buy some land again, and my husband is hiding all of this secret family shit from me so I don\u2019t get upset!\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s voice had become louder until she shouted the last part.</p><p>Dalton popped the tailgate on the pickup. \u201cYou can yell and scream at us all you want, Jess, but you\u2019re gonna do it while you\u2019re sittin\u2019 down. So park it.\u201d</p><p>Surprisingly, Jessie didn\u2019t quibble. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s just...you have no idea how on edge Brandt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we do. We were just talkin\u2019 about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you come up with a solution to get him to calm the fuck down?\u201d</p><p>Tell stepped in front of her, bracing himself for her wrath. \u201cKnow what I think? You need to calm the fuck down too.\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s stubborn chin came up. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I am calm. I\u2019m as calm as the fucking sea of tranquility! No one is more goddamn calm than me!\u201d</p><p>A crow cawed in the silence.</p><p>Then Dalton started laughing. \u201cGirl, that baby is gonna come out swearing a blue streak if you keep talkin\u2019 like that.\u201d</p><p>Tell started laughing too.</p><p>After a minute, she cracked a smile. \u201cPay no attention to the hormone-crazed pregnant lady cussing like a McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Jess, you and Brandt are feeding off each other\u2019s anxiety. Brandt sees that you\u2019re uptight, then he gets uptight and paranoid that something is wrong with you or the baby, something that you\u2019re not telling him because you don\u2019t want him to worry. Which makes you even more uptight and you don\u2019t want to talk to him about it because you believe your worries will just add to his. See how this goes?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and started to cry.</p><p>\u201cOh Jesus. Don\u2019t cry. Brandt will kill us both if he thinks we made you cry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese last two months I\u2019ve cried enough that it doesn\u2019t even faze him anymore.\u201d She sniffed and set her hand on her belly. \u201cHey, little kicker, that was uncalled for.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I feel it?\u201d Tell asked.</p><p>Jessie placed his hand off to the left side. \u201cHe\u2019s too big to show off his soccer-player imitation, but he gives me plenty of knee and elbow action.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t believe how hard and tight the skin stretched over her belly was. Then he felt something move beneath his palm. \u201cI know you\u2019re tired of bein\u2019 pregnant, but this is just so damn cool. Yours and Brandt\u2019s baby is in there.\u201d</p> <p>She set her hand over the top of his. Tears filled her eyes. \u201cThank you. When I\u2019m feeling bloated and I can\u2019t stretch my maternity shirts over this massive bump and I can\u2019t put on my boots and just want it to be over, I forget this is a miraculous thing. And I\u2019ve wanted it for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect things will settle down once the little bugger makes his appearance,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. Thanks, guys. Now I know Brandt\u2019s tension wasn\u2019t just my pregnancy paranoia. I just wish there was something I could do for him short term that would relax him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know one thing that will relax him completely. Guaranteed. A b\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tell shoved his younger brother. \u201cReally, Dalton? That\u2019s how you help, by suggesting Jess gives him a blow job\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa. No! I was gonna say a big tumbler of whiskey! Sheesh.\u201d Dalton shoved him back. \u201cPerverted much, bro?\u201d</p><p>Jessie giggled. \u201cI have a hard enough time getting out of a chair, say nothin\u2019 of getting down on my knees.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with that...we\u2019re sending you home to your husband.\u201d</p><p>They followed her back to the house\u2014still weird to think of it as Brandt and Jessie\u2019s place. After Casper sobered up, he\u2019d announced he wasn\u2019t returning to live in Sundance and handed over his house to Brandt and Jessie. They\u2019d hired Chet and Remy West for a complete remodel. Happy as he\u2019d been for his brother and sister-in-law to have the family homestead, the place he\u2019d grown up in wasn\u2019t his home any longer.</p><p>On the way to drop Dalton off, Tell asked, \u201cIs it poker week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot postponed since everyone is scattered. Cam and Domini took their kids to Disney World. Colby is testing new stock at Cash Big Crow\u2019s, which means Cord and Colt are swamped. Kane and Kade are checking out a bull sale in Montana. Quinn and Libby and their kids are in Arizona at Gavin\u2019s, which means Ben\u2019s up to his ass. Keely and Jack are on some tropical vacation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long before the poker games end altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d Dalton tipped his hat back. \u201cYou think Ben told anyone in the family about our card skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. I will say that it does suck, pretending that we\u2019re lousy players.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember someone talking about us havin\u2019 bad poker faces.\u201d Dalton laughed. \u201cI wanted to prove them wrong, until I realized I was proving them wrong and they didn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said if you won or lost in Deadwood.\u201d</p><p>Dalton cocked his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t, did I?\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t intend to, either. \u201cAsshole. Looks like you\u2019re gonna get that nap after all since we\u2019re done early.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God. What are you gonna do with yourself?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake sure the baler is working. Ben said something last week about double-checking every piece of equipment before we get to haying. So I might swing by his place after lunch to see what he needs help with, since I doubt Brandt will remember to do it.\u201d</p><p>Dalton peered over the tops of his sunglasses. \u201cWord of caution\u2014never just drop by Ben and Ainsley\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cWhy? Because they\u2019re newlyweds?\u201d</p><p>He emitted a strangled laugh. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>Weird.</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Georgia looked forward to her date with Tell, hoping that tonight he\u2019d put his bold declaration that they\u2019d be lovers into action.</p><p>She\u2019d tried to work after he dropped her off yesterday, but her thoughts kept drifting to back to him. Starting with when she\u2019d seen him in the park on Saturday. She\u2019d watched him for a while before approaching, hesitant to interrupt the fun time he\u2019d been having with Landon.</p><p>But Tell\u2019s happy demeanor changed when his father entered the picture. Tension rolled off him so thickly Georgia felt it on the other side of the park. She\u2019d left soon after; she wouldn\u2019t want Tell to witness a dustup between her and her family.</p><p>As the afternoon had worn on and she hadn\u2019t accomplished a damn thing, she\u2019d dug out her high school yearbooks.</p><p>Georgia had no interest in seeing pictures of her size-two self, not because of the twenty extra pounds she carried, but because when she saw at pictures of that young girl, her gut twisted thinking about all the losses facing her. The disappointments to come. Shaking off the morbid thoughts, she scanned the index for mentions of McKay.</p><p>There were tons of entries for Chase McKay and Keely McKay. A couple for his brother Brandt. Three listings for Tell. He\u2019d kept a low profile their sophomore year. Then again, Georgia remembered both Chase and Keely had ruled the school that year\u2014easy to be overlooked even if your last name was McKay.</p><p>She thumbed back through the pages. The first shot was of Tell in the lunchroom, mugging for the camera with his buddies Thurman and Ned\u2014the trio called themselves TNT. The second pic was of rodeo club\u2014not surprising he wasn\u2019t standing by Deck, but he wasn\u2019t next to his cousin Chase, either, who was front and center. The last entry was Tell\u2019s sophomore class picture. The kid in the pic was scrawny. His dark hair was brutally short and no hint of smile lingered on his lips or brightened his eyes. She honestly didn\u2019t remember this somber version of Tell at all.</p><p>Georgia flipped open the next yearbook. Five mentions of Tell during their junior year. A picture of him at the first football game of the season. One of him in the buckin\u2019 chute as he got ready to ride. Another picture of him in rodeo club. A shot of him filling balloons for the junior/senior prom. And his junior class picture. At least he\u2019d smiled in that one.</p><p>Guilt rolled over her, seeing the picture of Tell standing beside the helium tank. After being assigned the tedious task by Denille, the head cheerleader, she\u2019d asked Tell to help. He\u2019d made her laugh all the time in English class, so she figured he\u2019d make even a crappy chore fun. But when Deck had found out who she\u2019d asked to help her, he\u2019d told her dad. And her father refused to let her spend time alone, unsupervised, with a godless, wild McKay boy. She\u2019d been too mortified to explain why she had to back out, and poor Tell had gotten stuck doing all the work.</p><p>Come to think of it, that had happened more than once over their high school years.</p><p>If Tell was the vengeful type, agreeing to take her to the reunion and then standing her up would be a perfect way to get back at her.</p><p>The beautiful evening was impossible to resist, and Georgia sat on the front steps, basking in the sun\u2019s last rays as she waited for Tell to pick her up. She\u2019d probably overdressed in capris, a sleeveless yellow shirt patterned with tiny daisies, and wedge sandals, given the fact they\u2019d played basketball on their first date.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat as she watched Tell saunter up the sidewalk. He wore that sexy grin and his usual cowboy finery that made him look smokin\u2019 hot, so she was glad she\u2019d taken extra time with her appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou make such a damn pretty picture, sittin\u2019 out here with the sun shining on your hair, making it look like black gold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to you, Tell McKay, talking so sweet.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she was upright, he tugged her into his arms. Then his mouth was on hers, reminding her that he knew how to kiss. Georgia\u2019s head was pleasantly muzzy by the time he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI like hearing that happy little hum when I kiss you. Gets me all kinds of curious about what other noises you make when you\u2019re turned on.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed softly. \u201cDon\u2019t get my hopes up that you\u2019ll find out tonight.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. Where we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Bill\u2019s Burger Shack in Hulett. Best burgers around. Been there yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But first ice cream? And now burgers? You\u2019d better have a plan to help me work off these extra calories, Tell McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is...?\u201d Should she mention sex burned a lot of calories?</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like surprises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered. Come on. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The drive was beautiful. The years away from this area had allowed her to forget just how spectacular the scenery was. Had she ever really appreciated it?</p><p>They scored the last table in the burger joint. Between bites of an oversized burger, Tell asked about scheduling for upcoming rodeos. She responded as best as she could, but each event had different parameters and she hadn\u2019t memorized the details.</p><p>That didn\u2019t make him happy. She knew he was anxious to get scheduled to judge, but he\u2019d brought it up on the drive back to her house after the trip to DQ too. Was that all he cared about?</p><p>Did he think she only cared about the reunion?</p><p>Maybe. To prove she had interest in his life, Georgia asked about his day. He mumbled about Dalton being hungover, his sister-in-law Jessie having a short fuse and broken fences that don\u2019t fix themselves.</p><p>Then he clammed up and this slid into awkward date territory.</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t talk to her but he sure didn\u2019t have a problem talking to anyone else\u2014or everyone else that stopped by their table. When Tell introduced her, a few people remembered her; mostly they remembered her brother RJ.</p><p>While Tell chatted with yet another person she didn\u2019t know, she was reminded of her biggest mistake after moving to Sundance the beginning of her sophomore year: letting her high school boyfriend become her everything.</p><p>Deck\u2019s interests, activities and friends took priority over hers. Cheerleading was the one activity she could claim as her own. Being back here was a harsh reminder that she\u2019d spent her high school years as arm candy. Virginal arm candy. Silent, virginal arm candy. A girl so sweet and demure sugar wouldn\u2019t melt in her mouth. A girl whose opinions were considered as fluffy as a bag of cotton candy. She snorted. There was a past persona to be proud of. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>So as proud as she was that she\u2019d grown a spine and left Deck, she knew few people would see the new and improved Georgia Hotchkiss\u2014because no one had really known the old Georgia.</p><p>Tell leaned forward to capture her attention. \u201cSorry about that. Tim, from my dart team, tends to go on and on.\u201d</p><p>Georgia bit back her smart response, I hadn\u2019t noticed.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys who believes we oughta have a strategy for winning the league. When most of us are just there to bullshit and drink beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019d be the only draw for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of... Would you come to Ziggy\u2019s tomorrow night and watch the match?\u201d</p><p>Nothing she disliked more than being a spectator at a guys\u2019 sporting event\u2014she\u2019d done that more times than she could count. But if she wanted to spend time with Tell, hopefully naked time, she\u2019d have to take one for the team first. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeague starts at seven. It\u2019s usually done by nine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could show up for a little while.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cGood. As far as tonight... Are you a fan of John Wayne movies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only seen a couple, so I don\u2019t know if that qualifies me as a fan. Why?\u201d Please say we\u2019re going back to your place to watch movies. In your bed.</p><p>\u201cThe Sundance Arts Council plays movies in the park every Monday night in the summer. They have a big projection screen by the band shell. You interested in checking it out?\u201d</p><p>Tell wore such an earnest look she couldn\u2019t say no. \u201cSure, as long as it doesn\u2019t run past my bedtime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhenever you decide it\u2019s time to take me to bed,\u201d she purred. Then she stood, adding an extra wiggle as she dumped her empty cup in the trash.</p><p>Tell was a lot friendlier on the drive back to Sundance.</p><p>At the park, he spread out a blanket on the grass, away from the families with small children. She looked around, feeling so far out of her element she might as well be on Mars.</p><p>Then Tell\u2019s hand gently touched her face. \u201cGeorgia? Something wrong?\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t fit in here. I never have. \u201cJust lethargic after eating.\u201d</p><p>He scooted back, stretching his legs into a V. \u201cYou can use me as a pillow.\u201d</p><p>Georgia crawled toward him. That bad-boy grin with smirking dimples was impossible to resist. She nestled her backside into his crotch, wiggling to get comfortable. Rolling her spine against his chest, she releasing a tiny sigh. Tell was so warm and firm. She turned her head to kiss the bottom of his jaw, getting a noseful of his pine-scented aftershave. \u201cYou are kinda hard for a pillow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd getting harder in some places.\u201d He set his chin on top of her head. \u201cYou feel good on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d feel good in me.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou never give up, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. So be prepared to be worn down by my feminine wiles, cowboy. Because not only do I talk dirty, I can act out all the dirty suggestions. Wanna see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d</p><p>The movie started and she blocked out all sounds, concentrating on the steady beat of Tell\u2019s heart and the rhythmic rise and fall of his chest. Onscreen, John Wayne was shooting at an outlaw. She tried to focus on the action, but her eyelids kept slipping shut. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to rest her eyes. Just for a couple of minutes.</p><p>A rough hand skated up her arm and she jumped.</p><p>\u201cRelax. You conked out for the first half.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntermission gives the local kids\u2019 groups a chance to sell popcorn, candy, soda. The rodeo club is scheduled to work the concession next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an advisor to the club. Some of these kids need direction. Plus, it\u2019s fun.\u201d</p><p>That surprised her. \u201cWhat else do you do for fun in your free time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hang out at the trap club. My cousins Colt and Kane roped me into refereeing at Little Buddies/Big Buddies flag football and basketball games. I shoot pool with Thurman, Warner and Ned.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI\u2019d rather do just about anything than stay home by myself. That ain\u2019t fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s completely the opposite of the way I am. I\u2019d hole up in my condo in Dallas all the time, if I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love your place that much?\u201d</p><p>No. I just don\u2019t have anywhere else to go.</p><p>Tell kissed her forehead. \u201cWell, I aim to change your antisocial ways now that you\u2019re back here in the Wild West.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd force me to have fun.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYep. By any means necessary.\u201d</p><p>They wandered to the concession stand hand in hand. Tell struck up a conversation with the couple ahead of them in line.</p><p>The woman kept sneaking looks at her, until Georgia finally asked, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Do we know each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019d remember me. I graduated the year after you. We had gym together and Mr. Larkin partnered us for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTennis,\u201d Georgia finished. \u201cWe got second place. I remember that. You\u2019re Allison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I was friends with RJ.\u201d She smiled sadly. \u201cThen again, everyone was friends with RJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother did have a knack for knowing everyone when he walked into a room.\u201d Kind of like Tell.</p><p>\u201cRJ was a great guy.\u201d</p><p>That pang of sadness surfaced. \u201cYeah. He was.\u201d</p><p>Tell squeezed her hand.</p><p>But the encounter was a pointed and poignant reminder to her that this small-town stuff didn\u2019t appeal to her. Where everyone knew her sad family history. Where everyone paid attention to her purchases in the local grocery store, gossiping that she\u2019d bought magnum condoms and a raunchy romance novel. She\u2019d rather be anonymous in a big city than infamous in a small town.</p><p>She looked around the park. Everything seemed too perfect. Almost as if it\u2019d been staged. Happy moms and dads resting on heirloom quilts while their kiddos ran wild. Friends laughing together. Reliving the types of memories she\u2019d rather forget.</p><p>You don\u2019t belong here.</p><p>Georgia had such a sense of disquiet she abruptly let go of Tell\u2019s hand.</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yeah, I\u2019m just going to use the facilities.\u201d</p><p>And she fled.</p><p>Maybe this hadn\u2019t been the best idea.</p><p>Georgia had been skittish all night. When she wasn\u2019t ignoring everything and everyone around her.</p><p>It bothered him that she hadn\u2019t joined in the conversations at the burger joint. Not that she\u2019d been rude. She\u2019d just seemed uninterested and entirely focused on her food.</p><p>Maybe she\u2019s shy.</p><p>That jarred him.</p><p>Georgia Hotchkiss...shy?</p><p>No way. She\u2019d always spoken her mind.</p><p>Hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>No. If he remembered correctly, the only time she\u2019d voiced her opinions was when Deck hadn\u2019t been around. Like in history class. The rest of the time she\u2019d kept quiet. So she wasn\u2019t aloof or stuck-up, as most people\u2014including him\u2014had assumed.</p><p>As much time as Tell had spent watching her in high school, how had he not noticed that she was actually shy?</p><p>Because you were a teenage boy too busy imagining fucking her.</p><p>Seemed he, too, had seen only what he\u2019d wanted to see.</p><p>When Georgia returned from the bathroom, her face was even more pale.</p><p>He was by her side in an instant. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go. If you want to stay and watch the end of the movie, it\u2019s not that far to my place. I\u2019ll walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell you will.\u201d He loomed over her. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll grab the blanket and be right back.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak on the short ride to her house. After he\u2019d parked in her driveway, he said, \u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s really wrong?\u201d</p><p>She continued staring out the window for another minute before she faced him. \u201cNow that I\u2019m back in Sundance I see a lot of mistakes I made.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I didn\u2019t make much effort in high school to make new friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that? Because you\u2019re a little shy?\u201d</p><p>Georgia looked at him sharply. \u201cHow\u2019d you know?</p><p>\u201cLucky guess.\u201d He kissed the back of her hand. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not painfully shy or anything. I was just raised in a God-fearing home where men were masters of their domain. My mom was a foreigner and introverted, so I ended up like her, where RJ took after my dad and was outgoing. Took me a long time to figure out most people thought I was stuck-up because I wasn\u2019t like RJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the last name McKay, I\u2019ve dealt with a lot of those preconceived ideas too. It sucks.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cBut mostly I didn\u2019t try to find a best friend because I already had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cRJ. Whenever we moved to a new town, I didn\u2019t worry about fitting in because I had him. Then he took to Sundance like he was born here and he kind of left me in the dust, which is probably why I clung to Deck so much. Everybody knew RJ. Everybody liked him.\u201d She looked away. \u201cI miss him. I know it\u2019s been almost nine years and it should be easier, but it still hurts. And being here makes me face it every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Tell leaned across the seat, gently encouraging her to look at him. \u201cI know how that feels. I still expect my brother Luke to barrel up when we\u2019re out fixin\u2019 fence. Course, he\u2019d tell me I was doin\u2019 something wrong. That part I don\u2019t miss.\u201d He smiled. \u201cBut I miss him. Not the Luke who was a shitty husband to Jessie or the Luke who was Dad\u2019s favorite kid as well as his favorite whipping post. I miss Luke, my brother. The guy he was when it was just the four of us. Not trying to impress the ladies, or trying to piss Dad off, or trying to make Mom laugh when she was so damn miserable. But the guy who taught me stuff. The guy who listened when I talked. He\u2019s been gone almost five years and I still miss him every day. I know I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ve got two other brothers. But neither of them replaces Luke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes filled with tears. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor understanding. For not thinking I\u2019m some kind of freaky girl for crying over my dead brother.\u201d</p> <p>Tell hauled her into his lap. \u201cI\u2019d never think that.\u201d</p><p>Georgia curled into him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has turned out to be a shitty date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetness, it\u2019s always a good date when I\u2019ve got you in my arms.\u201d He kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cSorry to rip you away from the end of the movie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how it ends. John Wayne wins.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t be much of a John Wayne movie if he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cCan I ask you something? I\u2019m not clear on why you chose to return to Sundance. You had to know there\u2019d be memories of RJ all over the place.\u201d</p><p>Georgia absentmindedly stroked the tops of his fingers. \u201cMaybe I came back here to face my demons. Be warned: I\u2019ve got quite a lot of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t we all.\u201d Tell eased her back so he could take his time kissing her. Enjoying the feel of her soft body against his. Enjoying a lazy exploration of her mouth.</p><p>She slipped her lips down his chin, breaking the kiss. \u201cWe\u2019d be more comfortable in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf that there\u2019s no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor now.\u201d</p><p>Georgia disentangled herself from his embrace and sat up. \u201cThanks for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow night sometime.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Tell had sensed the change in the air when Georgia walked into the back room at Ziggy\u2019s. His eyeballs had popped out like a cartoon character\u2019s when he got a load of her outfit\u2014a cleavage-baring black lace lingerie thingy topped with a sheer black blouse. Painted-on jeans that highlighted every juicy curve. Her inky-black hair was a hot mess, as if she\u2019d just rolled out of bed. Her lips were glossy. And those eyes. God. Damn. Those eyes.</p><p>Georgia Hotchkiss was a fucking goddess.</p> <p>Georgia Hotchkiss was here for him.</p><p>And Tell immediately staked his claim. Wrapping one arm around her lower back, curling his other hand on the side of her head, bringing her mouth to his for a possessive kiss. A public kiss that no one would mistake as friendly.</p><p>His dick performed a happy, hopeful salute whenever Georgia was around, so he hoped his friends wouldn\u2019t razz him about the tent in his jeans.</p><p>Throughout the game, his gaze kept zipping to her. She distracted him to the point he\u2019d almost sent his last dart into the wall instead of the dartboard.</p><p>\u201cFocus,\u201d Tim hissed.</p><p>Right. It was freakin\u2019 darts. But he also had the need to impress Georgia\u2014and he hadn\u2019t done squat this round.</p><p>When his turn rolled around again, he threw perfectly and broke the tie to win the third game.</p><p>His buddies clapped him on the back and offered to buy him a couple of beers, but he only had eyes for her.</p><p>\u201cHey, hot lips,\u201d he said, pulling her to her feet.</p><p>\u201cHey yourself. Pretty impressive shooting at the end.\u201d</p><p>Tell put his mouth on her ear. \u201cBetween you and me? These guys take darts way too seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t want to let them down.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled and the scent of her hair filled his lungs. Lord, she smelled good. Like vanilla cupcakes. \u201cNo sense in doin\u2019 something half-assed.\u201d</p><p>Her sexy rasp of a laugh rolled over him.</p><p>\u201cCome on. Hang out for a bit.\u201d</p><p>His friends had left one chair at the crowded table. Which meant Georgia had to sit on his lap.</p><p>Tell made introductions. During a lull in the conversation, to which she\u2019d contributed little, she whispered, \u201cWhy am I the only woman here?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt happens sometimes. Most the wives and girlfriends work. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t know anyone here and I shouldn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>Someone knew her.</p><p>They turned and saw Eugene \u201cSmitty\u201d Smith. A fellow classmate who\u2019d hung out with Deck and RJ\u2019s crowd.</p><p>\u201cIt is you!\u201d Smitty crowed.</p><p>\u201cHey, Smitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you waiting for, girl? Gimme a hug.\u201d</p><p>She hopped off Tell\u2019s lap and let Smitty scoop her up and spin her around.</p><p>Tell drained his beer.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever. You\u2019re still looking like a million bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Smitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019re you doin\u2019 here? Not in this bar,\u201d he clarified, \u201cbut in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m working in Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit? Huh. Don\u2019t get over there much. Have you seen Deck?\u201d</p><p>She dodged the question. \u201cHow\u2019s Janice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFat and mean-mouthed. In other words, the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you always say it takes one to know one?\u201d</p><p>Smitty\u2019s pseudo-friendly demeanor changed. \u201cYou seen Deck?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s fake smile faltered. \u201cNo. Why would I have?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know that him and Tara-Lee are havin\u2019 a kid? They\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think it would\u2019ve happened sooner beings they\u2019d been practicing since I was married to Deck.\u201d</p><p>Tell draped his arm over Georgia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSmitty.\u201d</p><p>Smitty\u2019s gaze winged back and forth between them. \u201cYou gotta be kidding me. You two are together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He didn\u2019t elaborate. Neither did Georgia.</p><p>And Smitty fidgeted in the silence.</p><p>\u201cI gotta get. See ya around.\u201d He scowled at Tell and lumbered off.</p><p>\u201cGee, if that\u2019s a preview of how the reunion is gonna go, I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll skip it.\u201d</p><p>Tell pressed his lips to her temple. \u201cNow why would you wanna do that? This is just startin\u2019 to get interesting. You want another drink?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I should go.\u201d</p><p>He tipped her head back. \u201cWhy? You bored?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m intruding on guy time.\u201d Georgia gave him that sexy, crooked smile. \u201cBesides, I want to spend time with you. Alone with you. Don\u2019t you want that?\u201d</p><p>Well, hell, what was he supposed to say to that?</p><p>Say yes, you dumb fucker.</p><p>Georgia placed her hands on his chest. \u201cYour lack of enthusiasm for that idea is giving me the impression this attraction is one-sided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull. You just wanna set the pace of how things are gonna go between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because things aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suggest we take things on our third date, Georgia? Skip the getting to know each other part and head straight for the nearest bed?\u201d</p><p>She backed up. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re right. I\u2019m being pushy. I\u2019ll go. Thanks for the drink.\u201d She spun away from him.</p><p>Tell wouldn\u2019t have believed Georgia could run in such ankle-breaking heels, but she was hightailing it out the door.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>Tim clapped him on the back. \u201cSo, McKay, when the fuck did you hit your head?\u201d</p><p>Tell glared at him. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He pointed toward the exit. \u201cDude, you\u2019ve got a screw loose if you\u2019d rather be with us than her.\u201d</p><p>The guy had a point.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the kick in the ass, buddy, I owe you.\u201d Tell took off, catching her halfway across the gravel parking lot. He picked her up, covering her shriek of surprise with his mouth.</p><p>She fought him for about two seconds, then her arms wound around his neck and she kissed him back.</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop moving until he reached the back end of his pickup, setting her down long enough to drop the tailgate. He hoisted her onto his lap, facing him, crossing her ankles behind his butt.</p><p>The light in the parking lot allowed him to see her face, but the angle he\u2019d parked his truck meant no one could see them.</p><p>\u201cYou flounced off in a snit before I got to say my piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve heard that particular piece before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re taking it slow. You\u2019re gonna spend two solid days in my bed once we finally get there...blah blah blah.\u201d</p><p>That seemed a little sarcastic. \u201cBut you don\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\u201d Georgia let her fingers trace his jawline, the hollows of his cheeks, the corners of his eyes and the arch of his eyebrows. Then she murmured, \u201cLook at you. So different now. You\u2019re all man. Hardly any trace remains of that cute high school boy I knew.\u201d Her mouth curled into a mysterious smile.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting smirk, hot lips.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering if that high school boy still inside you is afraid I\u2019ll reject you if you try and touch me.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened beneath her stroking fingers. \u201cNot true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo true.\u201d Georgia flicked her tongue across the seam of his lips. But rather than diving in for a kiss, she retreated. \u201cCome on, McKay. Don\u2019t you want to get to second base with me tonight?\u201d</p><p>Automatically his gaze dropped to her chest. Damn. She\u2019d always had such a great rack. Now that he was inches away from those perfect breasts...the go slow portion of his adult brain was suddenly silenced by the show me your boobies! section of his teenage brain.</p><p>No surprise which side won.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit that contraption you\u2019re wearing\u2014while sexy as all get-out\u2014is a little intimidating for a simple country boy like me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a bustier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. The boost-e-ay needs gone.\u201d Tell\u2019s hot gaze hooked hers. \u201cUntie the bow.\u201d</p><p>She curled the satin ribbon around her finger and gently tugged until the bow disappeared, leaving two short ribbons dangling along each side.</p><p>\u201cShow me more.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next two hooks didn\u2019t reveal much.</p><p>Georgia must\u2019ve been impatient because she popped the last few hooks in rapid succession until the bustier hung open completely, and goddamn he could see smooth white flesh from her neck to her navel. And those pretty, perky nipples.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d He slid his hands up her back and around her rib cage to peel away the sides of the stiff material. His thumbs stroked the underswell of her breasts and the soft, plump sides. Each new stroke sent gooseflesh across her arms. Seeing her reaction caused his cock to jerk against his zipper.</p><p>\u201cTell. Please. Touch me.\u201d</p> <p>Since she asked so nice... \u201cRemind me again about second base. \u2019Cause I never got to it in high school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I was a late bloomer, remember? So second base means I just get to touch? Or do I get to use my mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. It can be whatever you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. I want all right.\u201d Tell lowered his head and Georgia arched back slightly. He pursed his lips around the already hard nipple and sucked.</p> <p>She groaned and bit her lower lip.</p><p>He delicately swirled his tongue around the crest of her nipple until she squirmed. Then he bit down with enough pressure to get her attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d She shuddered when he did it again.</p><p>Tell pulled her upright and pressed her against the hard planes of his chest. He brushed his lips over her ear, keeping his hand cupped around her breast trapped between them. \u201cYou like a little pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d He pinched her nipple and she quivered.</p> <p>\u201cTell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you like that? Yes or no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, okay? Yes. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>Another pinch brought forth another moan from her.</p><p>\u201cYou will be honest with me, Georgia. Even if you haven\u2019t been honest with other men who\u2019ve enjoyed your body. Maybe especially if that\u2019s been the case.\u201d He blew gently in her ear. \u201cMake no mistake. I will enjoy the hell out of this body, and I can give you everything you\u2019ve been afraid to ask for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re killing me. Please. More.\u201d</p><p>He growled and pushed her back. Squeezing her tits together so he could nip and suckle her nipples. Making her moan and thrash. The scent of her arousal teased his nose every time she rocked her hips forward. And damn if she wasn\u2019t riding the sweet spot on his cock. And double damn if he didn\u2019t just want to spin her around, yank her pants down and fuck her. Leaving suck marks over every inch of that beautiful skin. From beneath her strong, stubborn chin to the tips of these tasty nipples.</p><p>Georgia moaned louder; her fingernails dug into his biceps as she pushed her nipple against his teeth.</p> <p>Fuck. She was hotter than fire. Tell sucked harder, switching between her left and right nipples. Licking. Biting. Devouring her until she released a long wail.</p><p>A pair of male voices echoed to them. \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t hear nothin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re drunk. Them grunting and moaning sounds mean someone is getting fucked good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if we can find \u2019em,\u201d the drunken guy slurred. \u201cI wanna watch live porn. See some big bouncing titties.\u201d</p><p>They both froze. Tell\u2019s eyes met Georgia\u2019s. He mouthed, \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t happy as she began to re-fasten the hooks with shaking hands. He didn\u2019t offer to help; he just kept his hands on her lower back, holding her steady. The only thing that\u2019d stopped him from fucking her right there on the tailgate of his truck was...well, they were on the tailgate, in the parking lot of a damn bar. He wanted so much more than bouncing in the bed of his truck the first time he made her come undone.</p><p>Good timing, though, with the interruption from the peeping drunks. Tell had been seconds away from throwing common sense and caution into the wind, taking Georgia amidst the hay, dirt and tools in his truckbed. How fucking romantic would that have been?</p><p>She tapped his shoulder to get his attention. \u201cYou can let go of me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Tell stood and set her back on her feet.</p><p>She made a big show of straightening her clothes and a big point of not looking at him.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, I\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Her gaze snapped to his. It wasn\u2019t embarrassment in her eyes, but anger. Or frustration?</p><p>He took a step forward only to have her take a step back.</p><p>\u201cStay where you are, Tell McKay. I seem to lose all rational thought when you put your hands on me.\u201d</p><p>Tell couldn\u2019t help but grin. \u201cBut, sweetness, that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be when I\u2019m touchin\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in public. Again. Not when you have no intention of following through after getting me so worked up. Again. I\u2019m such an idiot. Again.\u201d Georgia took another step back. \u201cLook, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to come back to my place so we can finish what you started?\u201d</p><p>When he didn\u2019t immediately answer, she released a harsh laugh. \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d She whirled around and set off at a good clip across the parking lot.</p><p>He followed her.</p><p>She stopped beside a black Honda with Texas plates. \u201cI\u2019ll see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNot tomorrow. I can\u2019t...I have something else going on.\u201d</p><p>Why did he get the feeling she was lying? \u201cFine. Thursday night. I\u2019ll pick you up. We\u2019ll go out for a nice supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell, I don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>He closed the distance between them. \u201cI will be at your place at seven on Thursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are gonna give me a goodnight kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just take one?\u201d she taunted.</p><p>\u201cGreat idea.\u201d He clamped one hand on her ass and grabbed a fistful of her hair, angling her exactly where he wanted as he plundered her mouth.</p><p>They\u2019d shared some hot kisses over the last three days, but nothing like this. This kiss was a primal preview of every raunchy, dirty, kinky thing he planned to do to her. At least three times.</p><p>Maybe he felt a little smug that Georgia whined a protest when he broke the kiss. Maybe he felt a little cocky, seeing the dazed look of need that had heated her pale irises to a deeper blue.</p><p>\u201cDrive safe.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Trying to do twelve things at once, she let the phone ring six times before she brusquely answered, \u201cThis is Georgia Hotchkiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. I had to hear from Smitty that you got a job in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d wondered how long before the news reached her father. \u201cIt\u2019s been what? Four months since we\u2019ve talked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling you now. How long are you in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>Why wouldn\u2019t he assume her job was permanent? \u201cThe event promotion company I work for has taken over the summer rodeo events for our latest acquisition. I\u2019m here to ensure it all runs smoothly.\u201d She\u2019d keep the conversation short. \u201cWas there something you needed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t even call my own daughter? You\u2019re too good to talk to your dad now?\u201d</p><p>Georgia paced. \u201cI\u2019m not going to fight with you. I doubt you would\u2019ve called me if Smitty hadn\u2019t mentioned he\u2019d seen me at Ziggy\u2019s on Tuesday night, right?\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cFine, I\u2019ll admit Smitty called me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize you and Smitty were so close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ain\u2019t. He\u2019s still good friends with Deck. He wondered if Deck would be upset when he heard you were back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would Deck be upset about anything that had to do with me? We\u2019ve been divorced for seven years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left him, Georgie. A man don\u2019t take that well, no matter how long it\u2019s been. No reason to rub it in.\u201d</p><p>She hated that he\u2019d called her Georgie. Like a boy. Like the boy he wished she were. \u201cThe reason I left him was because I caught him in bed with Tara-Lee.\u201d</p><p>Her father harrumphed. \u201cAll men make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was the proverbial straw for me, and his mistake cost him, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 as cut and dried as it looks. Anyway, I\u2019m asking if you\u2019re going to your high school class reunion next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Deck call me himself and ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Tara-Lee would get upset. Not good for a woman in her condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerminally stupid is a condition now?\u201d Wow. Had that bitchy comment just come out of her?</p><p>\u201cSuch a mean mouth. Just like your mama.\u201d</p><p>Georgia rolled her eyes. Her mom had a mouth so sweet honeybees swarmed around it. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going to the reunion. With Tell McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy him, Georgie? That\u2019s gonna cause a big ruckus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck and me being in the same room will cause a lot of speculation anyway. I don\u2019t owe my ex-husband anything, least of all any type of consideration for everything that man has...\u201d Taken from me.</p><p>\u201cYou remember your actions reflect on you, not on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to hear that Deck is still golden in your eyes and he\u2019s become the son you lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow wait just a damn minute, Georgia Lou, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Dad, you\u2019ll have to excuse me, I have a business call coming in on the other line.\u201d She hung up on him.</p><p>Beyond angry, she paced, hands clenched at her sides.</p><p>Even when her father finally deigned to call her, it hadn\u2019t been to see how things were going in her life. No, it was to poke at her.</p><p>Why are you surprised?</p><p>Needing to get out of her head, she cranked up her iPod and stormed outside.</p><p>She\u2019d rented this small, two-story house because it had a great backyard. It wasn\u2019t until she\u2019d signed the lease that the landlord informed her she\u2019d have to keep up with all the yard work. It\u2019d surprised her, how much she enjoyed mowing the lawn, especially on days like today, when exercise was the secondary goal. Something about the mundane physical task alleviated frustration. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Yard mowed and trimmed, Georgia weeded and fertilized her little garden. She watered the pots of flowers she\u2019d planted and scattered about. She swept the patio and scrubbed down the porch swing. She eyed the scraggly lilac bushes. Best not to trim them in her present mood\u2014she\u2019d likely hack them to stubs.</p><p>In her frame of mind, she considered canceling her date.</p><p>But maybe being a little pissy with Tell would force him to see that she wasn\u2019t the purity-ring-wearing innocent he remembered.</p> <p>Tell wanted her. He turned her inside out. She\u2019d about come unglued\u2014hell, she\u2019d just about come period from those sexy love bites he\u2019d given her in Ziggy\u2019s parking lot. Obviously the man the bedroom sexpertise if he could almost get her off with just his teeth on her skin.</p><p>So why was he so hesitant to take that next step with her?</p><p>A power thing?</p><p>A fear thing?</p><p>A little dick thing?</p> <p>She\u2019d find out tonight.</p><p>Tell held a bouquet of flowers behind his back as he knocked on Georgia\u2019s door. He heard the locks disengage and the door swung open.</p><p>\u201cAnd of course you\u2019re right on time,\u201d she said.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t make his mouth work. She was breathtaking. Not because of her clothes, although her hippie-type blouse, flouncy miniskirt and high heels made her look even more like sex on legs, but because a kind of ethereal glow emanated from her.</p><p>You are a sucky poet, McKay. Do not share that lame-ass you glow, baby observation with her.</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p> <p>His gaze met hers. \u201cDamn, woman, you look fantastic.\u201d He remembered the flowers and handed them over. \u201cFor you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Come in while I put these in water.\u201d She started down a hallway and disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Tell rested against the doorjamb into the living room and checked it out. Not at all what he\u2019d imagined. The space was bland: white walls, beige-colored furniture. No pictures or books or personal items of any kind. Her couch wasn\u2019t overloaded with those annoying throw pillows most women were so crazy about. No newspapers, magazines or TV remote on the coffee table. The space looked as if it\u2019d never been used. As if it was just for show.</p><p>Weird. True, she\u2019d just moved in a few weeks ago, but he didn\u2019t see any boxes stacked around, waiting to be unpacked. After he\u2019d moved in to Brandt and Jessie\u2019s old place, he\u2019d made the place his own, right away.</p><p>His subconscious snickered. Putting in a seventy-two-inch TV didn\u2019t exactly make him Martha freakin\u2019 Stewart.</p><p>Georgia sashayed toward him, her heels clacking on the wooden floor. She set the flowers on the coffee table. Then she grabbed her purse and smiled. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUp to you. If you want steak, the Twin Pines is the best option. If you want to get out of Sundance, there are a couple more casual places in Moorcroft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou choose. Just not Dewey\u2019s. I had lunch there today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTwin Pines it is.\u201d</p><p>He opened the passenger door, figuring she\u2019d need a boost into his pickup. When he put his hands on her hips, she twined her arms around his neck and pressed her lips to his. Not in a chaste kiss, but a let\u2019s strip and get wild type of kiss. Her tongue was aggressive, her body so tight against his that he felt the rapid beat of her heart.</p><p>Tell\u2019s mind shut down to everything but the scent of her hair and the minty taste of her mouth as their tongues dueled. He slid his hands down to cup her ass, and he groaned as he squeezed those soft globes.</p><p>That\u2019s when Georgia broke the kiss and looked at him, her eyes shining with lust. \u201cI\u2019m an eat-dessert-first type of girl. Let\u2019s go back inside.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cNice try. We are eating food first. Then we\u2019ll see about dessert.\u201d</p><p>Georgia was quiet on the drive to the supper club.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t overly chatting during their salads either.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s because your date has been interrupted half a dozen times by former female conquests.</p><p>Tell hadn\u2019t encouraged the interlopers, but he hadn\u2019t discouraged them either. He\u2019d wondered if Georgia would mention it.</p><p>\u201cSo if the number of women who\u2019ve dropped by to say hello are any indication, you\u2019ve dated a lot of women.\u201d</p><p>Guess she wasn\u2019t the type to let it slide. Tell sipped his beer. \u201cThe word dated works better than some other words that come to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, you\u2019ve slept with a lot of women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>His answer seemed to annoy her. But she didn\u2019t ask him to define a lot.</p><p>\u201cWhy? You worried I have herpes or VD or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stabbed her lettuce, then shoved the fork in her mouth, chewing angrily.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, you want to tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>She wiped her mouth. \u201cI needed fertilizer yesterday, so I went to the hardware store. It appears your plan of convincing everyone in town that we\u2019re a couple is working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s bad...how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently the store clerk has been on the receiving end of your sexpertise and she high-fived me.\u201d</p><p>When Tell shifted in his seat but didn\u2019t answer, Georgia added, \u201cI didn\u2019t catch her name, but then again, maybe you don\u2019t remember it either? Rumor is that\u2019s a major problem with you.\u201d</p><p>That was a low blow. Or was it, since it was true?</p><p>Then she gestured to the space surrounding them. \u201cDid you pick Twin Pines because you knew there\u2019d be a bevy of women hovering around? So I could see how much sexy-man, town-stud Tell McKay is in demand these days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. You\u2019ve got it wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I? Want to know what else I heard today at Dewey\u2019s? From my waitress? Because evidently she\u2019s another one of your conquests. And I got an earful from her.\u201d</p><p>Oh fuck.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s fingers tightened around the stem of her wineglass. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to deny whatever she said and defend yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst what? I\u2019m a guy. I like sex. What am I supposed to do when an attractive woman is throwing herself at me? Say no?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Jesus. He\u2019d walked right the fuck into that trap.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t snap back a smartass comment. She didn\u2019t utter a sound. But the oddest, saddest expression crossed her beautiful face and he wanted to start this whole date over.</p><p>He reached for her hand, only to have her snatch it back. \u201cIt\u2019s different with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not an attractive woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Why would you even say that? You know I think you\u2019re gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged and leaned back when the waitress brought their entr\u00e9es.</p><p>As soon as they were alone again, Tell scooted forward. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do I.\u201d She pointed to his plate with her steak knife. \u201cEat your steak before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>He ate. And kept stealing glances at her.</p><p>But Georgia ignored him. She didn\u2019t shove the petit filet in her mouth in one bite, but damn close.</p><p>When she retreated to the ladies\u2019 room, he slumped in the booth. He had no idea what he was supposed to do to make this right.</p><p>If he took her straight to bed tonight, she\u2019d never believe it wasn\u2019t a knee-jerk reaction.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t take her to bed, she\u2019d assume he wasn\u2019t sexually attracted to her.</p><p>That brought up the question: why had he set these dating parameters? Because he wanted to show her that he was in control? Because he got off on making her wait? Or because he didn\u2019t want a fast and easy hookup with her? He wanted something more.</p><p>Yeah. Like she\u2019d believe that.</p><p>Georgia returned and pointedly waited at the end of the table. Tell paid the check. He placed his hand in the small of her back as they crossed the parking lot to his truck. \u201cAbout the ladies who kept coming by\u2014\u201d</p><p>Georgia held up her hand. \u201cNo need to explain further. In fact, I really rather you wouldn\u2019t even try.\u201d</p><p>This night had gone straight to hell.</p><p>Rather than take her home, Tell decided to follow through with his original plan.</p><p>If she recognized where he was taking her, she kept it to herself. He drove to one of his favorite spots with an amazing view of the valley.</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t say a word until he shut off his pickup.</p><p>\u201cReally, Tell? You brought me to Flat Top?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s the local make-out spot!\u201d</p><p>Again, not the reaction he\u2019d hoped for.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with you?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?</p><p>\u201cAre you living out some high school fantasy? Taking Hot Lips Hotchkiss to Flat Top?\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cSo what if I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re an ass.\u201d Georgia opened the door and bailed out.</p><p>Dammit. That\u2019d been the wrong thing to say. Tell followed her. With clouds covering the stars, it was darker than normal, and he was afraid she\u2019d forgotten about the steep drop-off. \u201cGeorgia? Be careful. There\u2019s a\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLedge. I know. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been up here,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll recall this time of year, the ground is soft and it gives way easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. But you\u2019re certainly treating me like one.\u201d She whirled around and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cAre you having a good laugh? Stringing me along these last few days? Did you even intend on taking me to the reunion? Or was that part of the joke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat joke? I\u2019m confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us. I have no idea what your game is, but I\u2019m tired of it. Just take me home.\u201d</p><p>This woman ran hot and cold like no woman he\u2019d ever met. \u201cHuh-uh. You\u2019re gonna tell me where these accusations came from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. This is our what? Fourth date? Let\u2019s recap our dates. For the first date, we played basketball and you took me out for ice cream. The next date, you fed me burgers and fries before dragging me to an outdoor movie in the park. The third date, I watched you throw darts at Ziggy\u2019s. Oh, we played a little grab-ass that night, but we had to stop, because we were in public. Now tonight it\u2019s flowers, dinner and a trip to lover\u2019s lane\u2014where no doubt we\u2019ll hold hands and gaze adoringly into each other\u2019s eyes. What\u2019s next, Tell? Pizza and video games while we grope each other on the couch?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t havin\u2019 fun, you should\u2019ve said something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying something now!\u201d</p><p>More pissed off than hurt, he loomed over her. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that all the time we\u2019ve spent together in the last couple of days...has sucked?\u201d</p><p>She threw her hands up in the air. \u201cI knew you\u2019d take that the wrong way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else am I supposed to take it?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cAs constructive criticism! As a suggestion that this is not working. When you have dates with other women, what do you do?\u201d</p><p>He tried to remember his last date. An actual date. Where he picked the woman up, took her to supper or to a movie. He couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>It\u2019d been a long time. A damn long time.</p><p>That\u2019s when Tell realized all his encounters with women in recent years had been hookups. Regardless if he met the chick in a bar, or at a rodeo, or at the poker table. He\u2019d flirt. She\u2019d flirt back. Then they\u2019d be naked, fucking the night away. In the morning, they\u2019d go their separate ways.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want that with Georgia. He wanted something...real. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t even remember my last damn date, so maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little rusty. Why don\u2019t you tell me about your dates?\u201d</p><p>That strong chin of hers came up. \u201cMost guys at least try to get me in the sack on the first date.\u201d</p><p>Tell felt the strangest surge of jealousy. \u201cAnd because I haven\u2019t tried to nail you the first week we\u2019ve been together, there\u2019s something wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. You\u2019re sexy, you\u2019ve got an incredible body and I\u2019ve no doubt you know exactly how to use it. You act like you want me. But there\u2019s no follow-through, just the constant tease. So can you understand why I\u2019d be suspicious that this is a game? Since you couldn\u2019t have me ten years ago when you wanted me, but I want you now, you\u2019re going to lead me on and then change your mind?\u201d</p><p>His mouth opened to deny it, but part of him feared she was right. If any other woman had been so hot to get naked and wild with him, he would\u2019ve jumped her the first night. But he\u2019d held back with her. Not just one night, but every time they\u2019d been together.</p><p>Shit. Maybe he was turning this into a game. Despite his mortification, he looked at her. \u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can tell you what I don\u2019t want from you. I don\u2019t want to neck with you in your pickup at the local make-out spot and get all hot and bothered. I don\u2019t want to watch you racing around half-naked on a basketball court and get all hot and bothered. I don\u2019t want to sit on your lap after your dart game and get all hot and bothered. I want more because we\u2019re not high school kids anymore, Tell. There\u2019s no reason for us to be worried we\u2019re taking it too far, too fast. My biggest worry is you see me as that purity-ring-wearing virgin and you won\u2019t take it far enough.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Unable to come up with a clever response, he just said, \u201cI think it\u2019s best if I take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? We\u2019re not talking about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got my tongue so tied up in knots that I\u2019ll just say the wrong damn thing.\u201d He sighed. \u201cLook, it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m an idiot when it comes to this stuff, all right? Can we just go?\u201d</p><p>After he helped her into his rig, she said, \u201cSuch a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s who I am, Georgia. And for some reason, you bring out those gentlemanly qualities far more frequently than any woman I\u2019ve met.\u201d</p> <p>She touched his face and he felt as if he\u2019d been zapped by a cattle prod. \u201cKnow what\u2019s funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour gentlemanly side brings out my inner whore.\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed softly, appreciating her attempt to lighten the mood. \u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So no wonder we\u2019re at cross-purposes.\u201d</p><p>The ride back to her place was mighty quiet, not that he\u2019d expected Georgia to blather on. So her next question surprised him.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember when you took me home that one time senior year?\u201d</p><p>Like he could ever forget. Seeing her crying outside the gym, looking so lost and alone. He\u2019d acted on instinct, trying to soothe her, trying to get her to talk to him. It\u2019d shocked him that she had talked about bad choices and no choices. Then she\u2019d asked him for a ride home and climbed in his dirty, piece-of-shit pickup. She\u2019d left the window open and literally let her hair down, allowing all that black silk to flutter in the breeze. Georgia had been so preoccupied that she hadn\u2019t noticed him staring at her. She hadn\u2019t noticed that he\u2019d almost wrecked his damn truck because he\u2019d been staring at her.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what I wanted more than anything that afternoon? To ask you to keep driving. To drive until we were a long way from Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would\u2019ve said yes. I would\u2019ve taken you anywhere you wanted to go.\u201d He\u2019d ended up on the receiving end of Deck\u2019s fists for that anyway. Getting to spend more time with Georgia would\u2019ve made those bruises a little less painful to bear.</p><p>Tell pulled up in front of her house. She hadn\u2019t left the light on, so he walked her to the front door.</p><p>She faced him. \u201cTell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t expect you to lie and say you had a great time tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to. I want to know where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you asking me if I still plan on taking you to the reunion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m asking you if you plan to take me to bed anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefine soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike right now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Georgia watched the muscle in his jaw flex and his eyes darken.</p><p>His voice was dangerously low when he finally spoke. \u201cTell me what you want in that explicit detail you\u2019re so fond of.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t chicken out now.</p><p>She inhaled a deep, slow breath. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, Tell; I\u2019ve liked spending time with you. But I\u2019d really like to know what sound you make when my hand is on your cock. What sound you make when your cock is in my mouth. I want to feel your body on top of mine as you\u2019re fucking me. I want to feel your body behind mine when you\u2019re fucking me. I want to look down and see your face between my thighs. I want to see who Tell is when he stops showing me his fun, flirty, gentlemanly side and starts showing me the intensity I saw that first night you kissed me at the Golden Boot.\u201d</p><p>He stalked her until her back hit the door. \u201cThink you can handle me when my fun, flirty, gentlemanly side is completely overtaken by a whole different side you haven\u2019t seen?\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin a notch. \u201cWhy don\u2019t try you me?\u201d</p><p>Then Tell\u2019s hand snaked out and curled around the back of her neck, pulling her so close their noses almost touched. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want, Georgia? Hard, fast, hot sex without the niceties?\u201d</p><p>If his blazing eyes were any indication, she\u2019d awakened the sexual beast inside him.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Her gaze gravitated to his sculpted lips. She wasn\u2019t scared of his no niceties warning, and she said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He smashed his mouth to hers without warning, consuming her in a kiss so blistering hot it nearly melted her brain and started her hair on fire. His hands tightened in her hair, holding her head in place.</p><p>The kiss went on and on. A ravenous display of heat, raw power and sexual greed.</p><p>Georgia had never wanted like this. She\u2019d never been wanted like this.</p><p>His mouth remained fused to hers as his fingers began to undo the buttons on her blouse. Once her shirt hung open, he stroked her damp flesh with rough-skinned fingertips, from the waistband of her skirt, up her belly, between her breasts.</p><p>He ripped his mouth free from hers. \u201cNo more public displays. Let\u2019s finish this inside.\u201d</p><p>Man. Tell had scrambled her brain so completely she\u2019d forgotten they were in front of her house. She tried to pull her blouse closed, but his hands stayed the movement.</p><p>\u201cOnce the buttons are undone, they\u2019re undone. No goin\u2019 back. We do this my way.\u201d</p><p>Nodding, she fumbled with the keys to unlock the door.</p><p>Tell kissed her as he pushed her through the door and locked it. He kissed her as he pressed her back to the wall. He kissed her as he unhooked her bra and played with her nipples.</p><p>Her hands raced over him, eager to touch him everywhere at once. Bulging biceps, broad shoulders, thick column of his neck\u2014God, too many delicious body parts to choose from. Her fingers tangled in his hair, pulling slightly when his teeth grazed her nipple.</p><p>He made a growling noise and said, \u201cDon\u2019t. Move.\u201d</p><p>That terse command made her tremble with anticipation.</p><p>His mouth reconnected with hers as he slipped his hand beneath her skirt, stroking her over her panties.</p><p>She gasped when he pushed his finger inside her. He thrust in and out before adding another thick finger, which easily slid into her channel because she was so wet. When he rubbed his thumb back and forth across her clit, she whimpered.</p><p>His mouth was on her ear. \u201cCome on my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want my cock in you? Fucking you like this?\u201d He thrust his fingers in deep.</p><p>It felt so damn good she moaned, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come on my hand.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t have to tell him she needed him to stroke her clit faster. She didn\u2019t have to tell him to rub the tips of his fingers over the ridge of flesh on the inside wall of her pussy. Tell did that automatically. Perfectly.</p><p>\u201cI wanna hear you the first time I get you off.\u201d</p><p>She was so close. And Tell\u2019s harsh panting in her ear really did it for her. Normally she had some warning before an orgasm unfurled, but not this time. This time everything happened in a rush. Her clit pulsed. Her pussy muscles spasmed around his fingers. She dug her nails into Tell\u2019s forearm, just in case he decided to pull away too soon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He chuckled against her throat and the vibration traveled down her torso to where his magic fingers were still working her.</p><p>\u201cOh God.\u201d</p><p>After the last throb faded, his firm, warm lips ate at her mouth. He murmured, \u201cI want you. Now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. My room is upstairs\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too far. I want you now.\u201d He blew in her ear. \u201cOn the stairs.\u201d</p><p>On the stairs? Georgia shivered.</p><p>Tell eased his hand out from beneath her skirt. Watching her eyes, he yanked the blouse off her shoulders. Then her bra hit the floor. \u201cTake off your panties, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Dragging them down her legs, she kicked them away.</p> <p>His eyes drank in her half-bared body as he unbuckled his belt and unzipped his jeans.</p><p>This intensity was intoxicating. No dimpled smile, just heat firing his eyes. The angles of his face seemed more pronounced. Edginess rolled off him as he pulled his T-shirt over his head.</p><p>He wrapped a hank of her hair around his fingers, using it to tug her closer until they were chest to chest.</p><p>She spread her palms on his pectorals, wanting so much to put her mouth and tongue where her fingers touched.</p><p>Then his mouth snared hers in a brutal kiss. Another hot, wet, deluge that left her teetering in her heels and on the edge of orgasm again.</p><p>During the all-consuming kiss, Tell maneuvered her to face the staircase.</p> <p>He said, \u201cOn your knees on the second stair.\u201d</p><p>Her heart threatened to beat out of her chest as she did at he directed, resting her elbows on the fourth stair tread.</p><p>Hearing the crinkle of plastic, she looked over her shoulder at him as he rolled on a condom.</p><p>\u201cGrab on to the spindles.\u201d His work-honed hands skimmed the outside of her legs and he pushed her skirt out of his way. \u201cSpread your knees and flatten your back.\u201d</p><p>The carpet scraped her elbows and her knees as she widened her stance.</p><p>The tip of his cock circled her pussy. His strong fingers dug into her hips as he pushed inside her fully. Filling her so completely she felt the head of his cock bumping her cervix.</p><p>Yes. God. Yes, that was good.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything beyond a long groan.</p> <p>Twice more, Tell eased in slowly and withdrew slowly.</p><p>Then no more niceties. He slammed into her and pulled out all the way, quickly slamming into her again. And again. And again. The sounds of bodies slapping and harsh grunts permeated the air.</p><p>Georgia arched harder. At this angle each stroke hit her G-spot with pinpoint accuracy. Each hard thrust nearly stole her breath. It certainly stole her wits; she couldn\u2019t think beyond more.</p><p>Tell fucked her without stopping. Without saying a word.</p><p>She\u2019d never been...taken like this. Her body had never responded like this. Her skin tingled from her nape to her heels. Her blood burned hotter as it churned through her. She held on and held her breath as another orgasm rocked her.</p><p>His thrusts became frenzied and he released a long groan. His hips slowed from the relentless, pounding rhythm to small, rolling prods with his pelvis. His entire body shook as he fought for more breath.</p><p>Then she felt his hands moving up her back, releasing gooseflesh from every point of contact. Firm, warm lips kissed her shoulder. His hands swept aside her hair so he could string kisses up to her ear. \u201cSo beautiful.\u201d His palms followed her arms to her wrists. He curled his big hands around her fingers gripping the stair spindles. \u201cLoosen up, sweetness, or you\u2019re gonna get a cramp.\u201d</p><p>Still such a concerned gentleman. She\u2019d move. In a minute. When every part of her brain and body and soul wasn\u2019t so relaxed and floaty.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re a little out of it, huh?\u201d He pulled out. She heard clothes rustling. His hand circled her ankle and he removed her shoes, sending them tumbling to the floor. Then he picked her up and carried her up the stairs.</p><p>Georgia let her head loll into his neck. He was so warm. So solid. And he smelled good. Like cologne, sweat, sex and man. She sucked in another lungful of him and let it out as a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhich room is yours?\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cThe one with the big bed.\u201d</p><p>She thought she heard him growl again.</p><p>\u201cYou shoulda said the big pink bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a girl. I like pink.\u201d</p><p>He set her on the bed. Keeping her eyes closed, she stretched her arms above her head. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemme help you get ready.\u201d Tell\u2019s hands roamed over her torso until his fingers reached the waistband of her skirt and he tugged it off. He settled her head on the pillow before tucking her beneath the sheets.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you gonna stay with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tonight.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheek so sweetly, she angled into his touch. This floating feeling was marvelous.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning my brain into mush. That was really fun. Can we do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d He kissed her forehead. \u201cSweet dreams.\u201d</p><p>Classy, McKay. Fucking Georgia on the stairs. That was your big \u2018wait for it baby, it\u2019ll be phenomenal\u2019 sex play?</p><p>What the hell had he been thinking? Not even taking the time to get either of them completely naked? He\u2019d just bent her over...</p><p>And found himself in heaven.</p><p>Georgia Hotchkiss was as hot-blooded and hot-bodied as he\u2019d imagined. Those little moans she made. The way she\u2019d given herself over to him without hesitation. If she hadn\u2019t forced him to look at why he\u2019d been holding back with her, he wouldn\u2019t know the wet clasp of her pussy around his cock.</p><p>He\u2019d come so hard he\u2019d had to cage her body beneath his or he might\u2019ve passed out.</p><p>Georgia had come twice. He\u2019d made her come twice. And how fucking sexy had it been when she\u2019d dug her nails into his forearm, not wanting that hand going anyplace? Or how about when she arched against him? Pushing herself deeper into his rapid thrusts. Wanting more, wanting everything he gave her.</p><p>These sex flashbacks aren\u2019t helping you get focused.</p><p>Right. He was supposed to be getting ready for the rodeo.</p><p>Tell slipped on his judge\u2019s vest and pass, heading to the livestock penning areas to inspect the rough stock. Rarely had he deemed an animal ineligible for competition, but the health and welfare of the animals were top priority for everyone involved. Tell had never run across a stock contractor who would put anything\u2014money, or a shot at getting picked for NFR\u2014ahead of the well-being of their livestock.</p><p>The outdoor arena in Buffalo was a mix of old and new. The stands were little more than wooden benches with a tin-roof covering. Spectator seats ringed the arena, reserved for sponsors and fans who were willing to pay a higher ticket price to get sprayed in the face with dirt.</p><p>At this particular rodeo, all the rough stock and timed events originated from the same end of the arena. At some venues, the rough stock chutes were on one end and the timed events were on the opposite end. Tell had worked the Buffalo Rodeo before, so he knew it ran very smoothly. At least it had under the other rodeo promotion company. It\u2019d be interesting to see if anything changed under the company Georgia worked for.</p><p>After the fireworks and pageantry of the opening ceremony, including appearances by Miss Rodeo Wyoming, Miss Rodeo Montana, Miss Rodeo South Dakota, Miss Rodeo North Dakota, and Miss Rodeo Colorado, a salute to veterans, and the singing of the national anthem, the crowd was revved up and ready to rodeo.</p><p>Tell hit the dirt with his clipboard and took his place as the second judge.</p><p>The only time he paid attention to the crowd was if the judges were booed for what the audience believed was a bad score. It happened at least once during every event. He never took it personally.</p><p>The roster was pretty big for a small rodeo. Saddle bronc riders fared better than bareback riders, as far as making that eight-second mark. As the second judge, Tell wasn\u2019t required to be on horseback for the timed events.</p><p>Since it was a two-day event, purses and buckles weren\u2019t awarded, so the festivities wrapped up early. The other judge invited Tell to hang out at the local bar. He didn\u2019t jump at the chance like he usually did\u2014because he was looking for a chance to jump Georgia.</p><p>He waited until the crowd thinned before he made his way to the business office. And he was still stopped half-a-dozen times by people he knew. He remembered how nervous he\u2019d been the first time he\u2019d judged an event. How he\u2019d worried it would be like high school. Where the upper classman sneered at him as fresh meat or all questions would be about his bull-riding cousin Chase McKay, who\u2019d seemed to get more famous every year. But now even that wild man had been tamed.</p><p>Speaking of wild...there she was. The hot little number he wanted to get wild with all freakin\u2019 night.</p><p>Her clothing was a mix of professional and accessible. No severe business suit; no-over-the top sequined rodeo-queen outfit either. Her denim dress was form-fitting enough to be sexy, but modestly cut. She looked good enough to eat.</p><p>After the group broke up, Georgia started gathering papers. She hadn\u2019t noticed him yet, or that they were the only ones in the room.</p><p>When she finally looked up, he hauled her against his chest and kissed her.</p><p>And kept kissing her, sinking into that sweet mouth. Sucking in her fevered response like oxygen. Aching to touch her, but keeping his hands spread across her lower back, knowing once he set his hands to roaming, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stop.</p><p>Georgia slipped her mouth free, leaning back to look at him. \u201cWell. If it isn\u2019t Tell McKay. No hi, how are ya? No sorry I didn\u2019t call? You just waltz in here and kiss the crap outta me first thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Is that a problem for you?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cNot. At. All.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tell cradled her face in his hands. \u201cI should mention that you are totally rockin\u2019 that dress. But I preferred what you were wearin\u2019 the last time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was naked... Oh, ha ha. Real funny.\u201d</p><p>He feathered kisses across her lips. \u201cAs hot as it was between us last night, I intend to slow things down a bit tonight. So will you come to my motel room right now and let me show you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr we could go to my hotel.

Someone else will lock up.\u201d</p> <p>An odd expression crossed her face when he reached for her hand. \u201cIs there a problem with your job if people see us together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m just...surprised that you aren\u2019t keeping this under wraps. I mean, us being out together in Sundance is one thing. But here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would here be any different?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze dropped to his chest. \u201cBecause you have a reputation as a player, Tell. Rumor has it that as many buckle bunnies wait for you after an event as for the riders.\u201d</p><p>Tell grabbed her chin, looking into her eyes. \u201cWe are together, here, there and everywhere else. I won\u2019t deny my reputation, but I will point out that I don\u2019t fuck around. You are the only woman I\u2019m with.\u201d</p> <p>When Georgia still didn\u2019t look convinced, he picked her up and plopped her on the conference table. He made room for himself between her thighs and loomed over her, forcing her to rest her hands on the table behind her. \u201cYou want me to prove that right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darlin\u2019, I surely believe it is.\u201d He placed a soft kiss on the hollow of her throat. \u201cMove your head to the side.\u201d</p><p>Georgia arched her neck.</p><p>He nuzzled that warm sweep of flesh, letting his breath tease before he used his mouth to kiss and suck. He dragged his lips over the smooth muscles of her throat. Inhaling her fragrance and absorbing the vibrations of her body reacting to his touch. When she began to squeeze her thighs together, he whispered, \u201cThink I\u2019d be embarrassed and back away from you if someone walked on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t fucked you so fast and hard the first time, I\u2019d fuck you hard and fast right now on this table.\u201d</p><p>Then her hands were on his chest, pushing him back. \u201cLet\u2019s get out of here before the temptation is too much for me to resist.\u201d</p><p>Hot damn. \u201cCan you leave your car here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. But I really hate being without a vehicle.\u201d</p><p>Tell brought Georgia to her feet. \u201cI\u2019ll keep you too goddamn busy to even think about leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>And didn\u2019t that put a hungry look in her eyes?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive. You tell me where we\u2019re goin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>As much as he wanted to run for his pickup, he didn\u2019t. As much as he wanted to swing Georgia into his arms and carry her, kissing that tempting mouth of hers the entire way, he didn\u2019t. He patted himself on the back for his control.</p> <p>But as soon as they reached their destination? Tell knew his control would be nonexistent.</p><p>Georgia said, \u201cI\u2019m staying at the Holiday Inn.\u201d</p><p>Then he remembered he\u2019d left his duffel bag in his motel room. \u201cWe have to stop by my motel first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the condoms are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smirked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure we won\u2019t be seeing that big bed at the Holiday Inn tonight.\u201d She picked up his hand and rubbed the back of his knuckles over her cleavage. \u201cBut at this point, any bed will do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrive faster.\u201d</p><p>He hit the gas.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Probably it wasn\u2019t the first time pickup tires screeched to a stop at the Sage and Spurs Motel.</p><p>Tell had the old-fashioned key fob in his hand when he skirted the back end of his pickup.</p><p>When he went to help Georgia out, the woman launched herself at him and locked her arms around his neck. He clamped his hands on her ass and half-carried her to the door.</p><p>He released her long enough to get the key positioned. But with the way her hands were clawing at his chest, he fumbled the key twice before he fit it in the lock.</p><p>As soon as they were in the room, before he\u2019d turned on a single light, Georgia was all over him. Her mouth attacking his throat as she started popping buttons on his shirt. Her pelvis rubbing against his. Making those sexy-ass moans.</p><p>He put his hands over hers, stopping her frantic motions. \u201cGeorgia. Hold that thought for a sec.\u201d He took off his hat, reached over and hit the light switch.</p><p>This was a pretty shitty room. Maybe keeping the lights off hadn\u2019t been such a bad idea. But then he looked at the beautiful woman standing in front of him. Her breathing uneven. Her lips so full and ripe. The blush of arousal on her cheeks, those magnetic eyes of hers so completely focused on him.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. God. You are something else.\u201d He traced her prominent jawline with the backs of his fingers. \u201cTake off your clothes.\u201d</p><p>That stubborn chin came up. \u201cI\u2019m not stripping solo again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. Then I\u2019ll strip you.\u201d He yanked her denim dress over her head. He unsnapped her bra. He hooked his fingers into the sides of her bikini panties and tugged them down to her ankles.</p><p>Georgia tried to take a step back, but hobbled by her underwear, she fell ass-first on the bed.</p><p>Tell dropped to his knees in front of her. He kept his caresses easy, wanting to take hours to touch and taste every inch of her bared skin. The explosive passion wasn\u2019t going anywhere so he\u2019d just put it on simmer while he savored her.</p><p>But Georgia seemed a little unsure about being naked.</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t allow it. He lightly pushed on the insides of her thighs and demanded, \u201cLet me see you. All of you.\u201d He heard a swift intake of breath and then she scooted her bottom to the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cWatch my eyes. See how goddamned turned on I am by your body.\u201d He grinned. \u201cAnd baby, if that doesn\u2019t convince you? Look at the crotch of my jeans.\u201d</p><p>That brought her sweet, lopsided smile.</p><p>He pressed a kiss below her belly button. Then lower. Then lower again. Leaving a longer kiss on the small strip of black curls pointing the way to his ultimate destination.</p><p>When his tongue followed that silken trail, she moaned.</p><p>He glanced up at her, his mouth hovering over her sex. Then he shoved his tongue deeply into her slick core.</p><p>So sweet. So wet. God, he wanted to suck and lick and make her come undone at least five times before he moved from this paradise. His intent to leisurely explore every delicate pink fold, to keep her hanging until she begged him to make her come...vanished.</p><p>Tell used his thumbs to pull her pussy lips apart, settled his mouth over the skin hiding her clit and began to suck.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s body quivered. A strangled moan escaped and she arched, shoving her pelvis forward.</p><p>He loved this part of sex. Losing himself in this first taste of her. Hearing her moan louder when he lightly flicked his tongue over that swollen little pearl.</p><p>Her fingers tangled in his hair as he kept up his relentless assault. She kept murmuring, \u201cYes, yes, yes...\u201d Then her body went stiff and she cried out.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s sex pulsed beneath his lips and against his tongue. Tell stayed right there, his sucking mouth keeping rhythm until the spasms ended. He scattered kisses to the creases of her thighs, stopping to dip his tongue into that sweet, sweet honey again.</p><p>She rolled back onto the mattress, her body limp.</p><p>That was the only limp thing around here.</p><p>As he unbuckled his belt, she rallied and pushed upright. She didn\u2019t say anything, she just watched from beneath heavy-lidded eyes as he removed his boots, shucked his jeans, boxers and socks.</p><p>When his hand tugged on the remaining buttons on his shirt, Georgia shook her head. \u201cI get to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>She still had her shoes on, so when she stepped off the bed, the top of her head brushed the underside of his jawline. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to put my hands all over you since Sunday when we played basketball. Last night we were too...\u201d</p><p>Tell touched her cheek. \u201cShould I apologize?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no. It was fantastic. One minute we\u2019re arguing and the next you\u2019re stripping me and fucking me.\u201d She popped the next button. \u201cYou had that look of animal lust and I...\u201d</p><p>He stayed her hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI liked that you didn\u2019t treat me like a fragile doll. You wanted me, you took me. That type of intensity is powerful, Tell. Especially when it\u2019s new to me.\u201d Her cheeks reddened. \u201cI haven\u2019t been with a lot of guys. And it\u2019s been pretty basic sex.\u201d She met his gaze. \u201cBut from the first time you kissed me at the Golden Boot, I knew it\u2019d be different with you.\u201d</p><p>Tell groaned. \u201cAnd then what did I do? Became that same type of guy you didn\u2019t want. With the innocent dates and the waiting to get nekkid and wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to read up on the Kama Sutra to impress me, but I don\u2019t want you to hold back.\u201d She focused on unsnapping his buttons and ridding him of his shirt.</p><p>Now that he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about holding back with her...didn\u2019t that just bust open the vault to all his kinkiest fantasies?</p><p>Georgia ran her hands over his chest. Tracing the ridges of his pectorals. Following the edge of his rib cage down to his lower abdomen. Then she locked her gaze to his as she wrapped her hand around his cock, delicately sweeping her thumb over the spot beneath the head.</p><p>As much as Tell wanted to see those hot lips circling his cock, it could wait. \u201cWe sorta slowed down. Maybe I shoulda gone with my first instinct and fucked you against the door as soon as we walked in.\u201d He bent to align his mouth with her right nipple. Licking the hardened point with the very tip of his tongue. \u201cOn the bed. Now.\u201d</p><p>Georgia placed a soft kiss on his sternum and scooted onto the bed.</p><p>Tell ripped open a condom, rolled it on and crawled across the mattress. She\u2019d parted her thighs, keeping her arms above her head, making her body one long line of curves he couldn\u2019t wait to explore. Lowering himself over her, hips to hips, he fit his cock to her core, gliding into that tight heat. Then he ran his palms up her arms until he reached her wrists. Threading his fingers through hers, be began to move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her gaze never left his. For the several long, sensuous strokes, they stayed in that silent connection of bodies touching from feet to hands, being skin to skin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, Georgia.\u201d He kissed her. Hungrily, frantically, even as he kept the same steady rhythm. His cock pausing outside her entrance on every fourth stroke before he snapped his hips, slamming into her to the root. Withdrawing slowly. Dragging out this pleasure as long as possible. Their mouths breaking only long enough to suck in more oxygen.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s fingers squeezed and released as her body strained to match the rhythm of his. He wanted to feel that same clenching and unclenching sensation of her pussy around his cock.</p> <p>Tell kissed a path to the sweet spot below her neck. Then he rammed into her fast and hard on every stroke until she arched against him violently.</p><p>Her sexy wail burned his ear as her pussy clamped down on his cock. Her grip on his hands was almost painful as she rode out her orgasm.</p><p>The strong pulses and pounding rhythm were so perfect, his own release caught him unaware. He came hard and fast. A head rush. A brain freeze. Free-falling into the abyss. Then nothing but the decreasing thud thud thud of his heartbeat in his ears.</p><p>Georgia nibbling on his jaw brought him back to reality. He eased back and looked into the face of a satisfied woman.</p><p>Despite the cramp in his ass, and in his arms, he wanted to stay right here with her, just like this\u2014sweat-soaked, sticky and sated. Possibly forever.</p> <p>His cock was totally on board and his aches and pains disappeared.</p><p>He rolled his hips and she gasped. He whispered, \u201cAgain,\u201d and lost himself in her, half-afraid he\u2019d never find his way back, half-grateful that he\u2019d found her at all.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t Tell McKay just as cuddly as a kitten?</p><p>After he\u2019d rocked her body\u2014twice\u2014she\u2019d expected a sweet kiss and then he\u2019d pull back.</p><p>But after he\u2019d ditched the condom, he\u2019d returned to bed, tucking her body against his, trailing his rough-tipped fingers up and down her spine as her head rested on his chest.</p><p>It\u2019d be heavenly, if it weren\u2019t freaking her out.</p> <p>Georgia couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d been held so tenderly in the aftermath of spectacular sex.</p><p>Maybe never.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t that sad?</p><p>Deck had fucked her and reached for the remote.</p><p>Other lovers had fucked her and reached for their pants.</p><p>So she didn\u2019t have much experience with this...lying around in the afterglow type stuff.</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that make an awesome confession?</p><p>Funny thing, Tell. I\u2019m not used to the snuggly routine because previous lovers couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell away from me. Maybe they were disappointed in my bedroom skills, or maybe my O face is fugly, but sweetness after sex? Nope. Not familiar with that. So forgive me if I\u2014</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You tensed up.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a loser and a bad lover and too mortified to tell you, although you\u2019ve probably already figured it out. \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>Tell put his fingers under her chin, lifting her face up. \u201cDon\u2019t go silent on me now, hot lips. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on in that beautiful head of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were amazing.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, placing a gentle kiss on her lips. \u201cHuh-uh. We were amazing. Together. There are two people in this bed, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Believe me, I know. I\u2019ve never...\u201d She rubbed her fingertips on the razor stubble that had sprouted on his jawline. \u201cYou\u2019re just overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>A tiny wrinkle appeared between his eyebrows. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean overbearing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I... For supposedly being in charge of my own sexual needs and sexuality, I don\u2019t have much experience with men like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like me,\u201d he repeated. \u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>Georgia blinked at him, unsure the level of honesty she should strive for. Especially when he was naked and she was looking into a face that could make angels sing.</p><p>Yeah, saying girly stuff like that will make him take you seriously\u2014not.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like you who have the moves. The experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound a little pissed off about that,\u201d he said tersely.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m not making any sense. Just forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Take a deep breath and time to gather your thoughts, because I ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to screw this up. \u201cI acted like a cat in heat around you last week because I thought it might get you to finally see that I\u2019m not the goody-goody I used to be. Now I\u2019m worried you\u2019re disappointed I wasn\u2019t a tiger in the sack. And I didn\u2019t live up to all the fantasies you\u2019ve supposedly had about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Stop. You are sex on legs.\u201d Tell let the backs of his knuckles outline her face. \u201cI want the you that you are now. Not the girl who sat in front of me in history class.\u201d</p><p>Relieved, she tossed off a flip, \u201cEh. She wasn\u2019t that cool anyway. A bit of a prude, I\u2019ve heard.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>She traced a scar on his rib cage. \u201cThis has been awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to bring this up now, but when do you plan to take me back to my car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were stayin\u2019 here tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you were seducing me I would\u2019ve said anything to get naked with you.\u201d Georgia kissed the frown lines bracketing his mouth. \u201cI loved every second of it. But I do have to work in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can run you back to the rodeo grounds first thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. That\u2019s not the best option.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His lips flattened. \u201cYou sure you ain\u2019t embarrassed to be seen with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you hear me out without getting defensive and paranoid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Georgia smiled at his gruff tone. \u201cI don\u2019t care who knows we\u2019re together. I do care about the walk of shame tomorrow morning in front of people on the rodeo committee if I show up in the same clothes and sporting sex hair.\u201d</p><p>Understanding flashed in his eyes. \u201cDamn. I hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u201d Then his lips quirked. \u201cSex hair, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the way you always mess with my hair? I\u2019m sure I look like I just rolled out of bed after a wild romp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good look on you.\u201d He curled a hank of hair around his finger.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. But I expect you\u2019ll stay with me tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Of course he would. \u201cMotel sex is pretty hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pretty hot,\u201d he shot back with a sexy growl. \u201cIn fact, let\u2019s burn up the sheets once more before I haul your sexy ass back to your car.\u201d Tell flipped her on her back and rolled on top of her.</p><p>Her belly rumbled like an empty railcar.</p><p>He squinted at her. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you were hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only hunger I cared about feeding was what I saw in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s the sweet-talker? I\u2019m still starved for you, sweetness.\u201d He kissed her three times, each kiss lingered a little longer than the last. \u201cBut you ain\u2019t gonna be able to keep up with my appetites if I don\u2019t feed you.\u201d</p><p>Georgia finished dressing and watched Tell tucking in his shirt and refastening his belt buckle. Something about getting dressed after experiencing such explosive heat together made her self-conscious of her rumpled state. She smoothed her hair and tugged her dress into place.</p><p>Then Tell was in her face, giving her the gentlest kiss while his fingers firmly held her chin. \u201cEvery time you get that embarrassed look, I\u2019m gonna kiss it right off your pretty face. No matter where, no matter when, understand?\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t being his playful, fun self. She wondered how many women knew this side of him. Rather than speculate, she just asked. \u201cAre you always this intense after sex?\u201d</p><p>The heat in his eyes didn\u2019t dissipate. Tell slowly shook his head. \u201cApparently only with you.\u201d</p><p>Oh man.</p><p>They drove to a truck stop on the outskirts of town. Tell ordered the steak and egg platter while Georgia chose blueberry pancakes.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re lucky this place is open twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>He picked up her hand and rubbed his lips over her knuckles. \u201cI\u2019d like to keep you tied to my bed for twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>She blushed but held his molten gaze.</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t send you running away screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it supposed to? Because the thought of you showing me all your sexual tricks and making me come so many times I lose track sounds like an awesome way to spend a day.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYou constantly surprise me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Miss Unpredictable,\u201d she said with an edge of sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t feel that way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly with you.\u201d</p><p>Another kiss to her knuckles. \u201cThen you should be around me all the time.\u201d He frowned and pulled his phone out of his pocket. \u201cHang on, I gotta take this. Dalton? Why\u2019re you callin\u2019 me this late? Uh-huh. No. That\u2019s fine, but it sucks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I\u2019ll leave after the event tomorrow night. But just remember you can\u2019t do this next weekend. I\u2019ll be gone Saturday morning. Nah. I can do \u2019em Sunday but it\u2019ll be late. Fine. Drive safe.\u201d He laughed. \u201cFuck if I\u2019ll tell you, perv.\u201d Tell hung up and looked at Georgia. \u201cSorry. Dalton is goin\u2019 to Colorado in the morning and won\u2019t be back until Monday. Which means I have to head back tomorrow night after the rodeo so I can do chores Sunday morning.\u201d</p><p>Georgia sighed. \u201cI have to be here Sunday morning to wrap everything up. So much for us spending tomorrow night together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome by my place on Sunday when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>She paused a beat too long before saying, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s eyes were on her. \u201cSomething wrong?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot wrong. I just wanna know that we\u2019re both okay with keeping this casual. Us hanging out until the reunion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that important to you, keeping things casual?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d Tell fiddled with the straw in his water glass. \u201cI just got to thinkin\u2019. Aren\u2019t some of these rodeos small potatoes for a PR firm outta Dallas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the stipulations when we absorbed the company was that we fulfilled the contracts of all the events, no matter the size.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have problems with other existing contracts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few. Mostly because the committee didn\u2019t want to work with an out-of-state firm. After the fifth cancelled contract, my boss decided to send someone to Wyoming as proof we were invested in the local community. Local meaning, within four hundred miles,\u201d she said dryly.</p><p>\u201cDid you volunteer?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was volunteered.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her sharply. \u201cYou don\u2019t sound too happy about that.\u201d</p><p>Hedge. \u201cNo way do I want to think about work when I\u2019ve got a gorgeous hunk of man sitting across from me,\u201d she cooed. \u201cCan\u2019t we talk about something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s talk about you. What\u2019s the most exciting place you\u2019ve been in the last ten years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to Cozumel for a week.\u201d</p><p>A depraved look settled on his face. \u201cNow I\u2019m imaging you in a bikini, sipping fruity girl-drinks on the beach. I\u2019d like to\u2019ve been there to rub suntan oil all over your hot skin.\u201d Then suspicion entered his eyes. \u201cWho\u2019d you go with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy mom. It was my college graduation present. I haven\u2019t been anywhere since.\u201d She took a sip of water. \u201cHow about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent the summer down south. A buddy I met on the circuit dragged me to a swamp in Louisiana and a beach in Pensacola. Went someplace in Mississippi where the drawls were thick as molasses and I couldn\u2019t understand nothin\u2019. Guess that\u2019s how I ended up eating opossum and turtle.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed. \u201cSo were them tasty vittles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what it was at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you ever tempted to stay down there?\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cI\u2019d got tired of the humidity, the bugs, the slower pace. I also figured out I didn\u2019t have what it takes to become a championship saddle bronc rider.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoney, mostly. It\u2019s expensive to keep competing if you ain\u2019t winning. Hell, it\u2019s expensive even if you are winning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how these rodeo cowboys do it. They\u2019re gone at least a couple times a week over the summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no different than you flying off here and there to do your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the remain in the office to put out fires type of employee. No jet-setting for me.\u201d</p><p>Tell studied her. \u201cWhen you\u2019re not working, what do you do for fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to stay home on the weekends. I live forty-five minutes from where I work and the traffic is awful during the week. Sometimes in the summer I head to this small lake that has great walking paths. I pack a lunch and hang out all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why? Do I sound pathetic?\u201d</p><p>He snatched her hand and kissed the inside of her wrist. \u201cNo. It does sound a little lonely, sweetness. So I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have to go back to that.\u201d</p><p>Georgia felt guilty for letting him believe she was sticking around. \u201cYour off-the-ranch hours are packed with stuff. What else do you do besides play in a dart league, mentor the rodeo team, judge rodeo events and charm and bed all the women in the county?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one woman I\u2019m interested in charming and bedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I know her?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cIntimately. And if we weren\u2019t waitin\u2019 for some grub, I\u2019d haul you out to my truck right now and we\u2019d get reacquainted.\u201d He lifted a brow. \u201cHow come you\u2019re sittin\u2019 so far away from me?\u201d</p><p>Georgia stood and scooted next to him in the booth, secretly thrilled he always wanted her physically close to him, not just in bed.</p><p>\u201cMuch better. So when you come over tomorrow, I\u2019ve got a couple of fun things we can do. Since you don\u2019t like surprises, I\u2019ll give you a hint. It begins with Z.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA visit to the zoo.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cThat would suck balls. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re taking me on a Zamboni ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Wyoming. In June. Nope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re gonna catch some z\u2019s after you tie me to your bed for twenty-four hours,\u201d she purred.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an idea, but nope. One last try.\u201d</p><p>She tapped her chin. \u201cDoes it have anything to do with a zipper?\u201d</p><p>Tell grinned. \u201cPartially. I\u2019m takin\u2019 you for a ride on the zip line I built.\u201d</p><p>\u201cZip line. As in flying-through-the-air-with-no-safety-nets zip line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne in the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019s safe. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers pleated the paper placemat that boasted facts about Wyoming. \u201cSorry, but that\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d</p><p>Tell turned her face toward his. \u201cIt\u2019s not scary or steep. I built it for Landon. Try it one time. Please.\u201d</p><p>How could she resist those damn dimples? \u201cFine. But if I take an ass-buster\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will kiss your ass until it feels better.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Tell\u2019s phone rang at midnight Sunday night.</p><p>Never good.</p><p>Caller ID read: Brandt. \u201cBrandt? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tell, Jessie is in labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! She\u2019s two weeks early!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jess all right? She\u2019s not havin\u2019 complications?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just...in so damn much pain she can\u2019t even talk.\u201d</p><p>Tell set his feet on the floor. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my truck on the way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>A loud female wail echoed through the phone. \u201cCan\u2019t you make this fucking thing go any faster, Brandt? You\u2019re driving thirty miles under the speed limit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust bein\u2019 safe, baby. Got precious cargo on board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt?\u201d Tell prompted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna hafta do chores by yourself, at least in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I can handle it. You need to be focused on Jessie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Jessie, baby, breathe.\u201d</p><p>Another groan, followed by, \u201cIt fucking hurts to breathe!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, bro, I gotta go.\u201d</p><p>He said, \u201cKeep in touch,\u201d to the dial tone.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s warm, naked body pressed against his back and her chin rested on his shoulder. \u201cI take it Jessie\u2019s in labor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. And Brandt doesn\u2019t appear to be handling it any better than he did her pregnancy. They\u2019re on the way to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be funny if they ended up sedating your brother instead of the pregnant woman?\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cCome back to bed. It\u2019s hours before we have to start chores.\u201d</p><p>He turned and looked at her. \u201cWe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we. You said Dalton is gone this weekend and I know it\u2019s too much work for one cowboy\u2014even a McKay cowboy\u2014so I\u2019ll help you.\u201d She kissed the cup of his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m not all city girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you also know that I\u2019m having a pain on my right butt cheek? From where I fell off the zip line.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t fall off. Your arms gave out and you bailed off because you went on the damn thing like twenty times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was so fun!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? I told ya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be smug. Now get back under these covers and kiss my butt.\u201d</p><p>Tell kept checking his phone all morning, but he hadn\u2019t heard from Brandt and he was getting worried.</p><p>Georgia was a big help with chores. She\u2019d brought all the paperwork for the upcoming rodeos and she started the ball rolling on getting him assigned as a judge. He was happy he\u2019d be working fourteen more rodeos this summer, although none were PRCA-sanctioned, and not all of them were events she was working.</p><p>They\u2019d finished a late lunch when his phone vibrated. He fished it out of his pocket. \u201cBrandt. You have good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Jess had the baby about an hour ago. His name is Tucker. The boy weighed eight pounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mama Jess? How\u2019s she doin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird to hear her called Mama Jess. But she\u2019s already taken to the little guy like he\u2019s been here forever...\u201d Brandt cleared his throat. \u201cShe was in labor for five hours before she even told me, so it was eighteen hours in labor instead of just thirteen hours at the hospital. She\u2019s sleepin\u2019. The nurses came in and took Tucker for some tests or something about five minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Jess is sleepin\u2019, aren\u2019t you supposed to be with Tucker wherever he goes?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cShit. You\u2019re probably right. I don\u2019t know how to do any of this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no different than anything else. You\u2019ll learn as you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you come to the hospital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh...now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s a good idea, given Jess is sleeping? Who all have you called to spread the good news?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Jesus. Brandt was really a mess.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the first person I called, bro. Jess called her mom.\u201d He exhaled a frustrated burst of air. \u201cI better call Mom, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Dalton. And Skylar. If you call Keely, she\u2019ll make sure everyone in the McKay family knows.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d</p><p>Was it funny or sad that neither mentioned calling their dad?</p><p>\u201cNow go track down your kid, Brandt. That way when Mama Jess wakes up, you can fill her in on what happened to the little tyke. \u2019Cause she\u2019s gonna want to know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks. I just... I need you here, okay?\u201d</p><p>Had he ever heard such a note of panic in his older brother\u2019s voice? \u201cI\u2019ve got some things to finish up here first, so it\u2019ll be a couple, three hours before I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>Georgia rubbed Tell\u2019s arm after he stood there for several long seconds without speaking. \u201cSounds like congratulations are in order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m happy Jessie didn\u2019t have complications. But man. Brandt is still uptight as hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re going in. Maybe you\u2019ll calm him down.\u201d</p> <p>Tell leaned down to kiss her. On impulse he asked, \u201cWill you come with me?\u201d</p><p>Regret flashed in her eyes. \u201cNo. The first time seeing your nephew will be special. Jessie will have a ton of visitors and I don\u2019t need to add to her stress, especially since she doesn\u2019t know me.\u201d</p><p>But I want her to know you.</p><p>Whoa. That\u2019d come out of left field. Normally he kept the woman sharing his bed far away from the McKay family madness, so as not to give her ideas that he was serious about wanting her to become a part of his family.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I have work to do today. Somebody\u2014\u201d she pecked his mouth, \u201c\u2014has distracted me. Not that I\u2019m complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. \u2019Cause I don\u2019t plan to stop distracting you anytime soon.\u201d</p> <p>She gave him that goofy smile. \u201cCall me later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be in town. Wanna do something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s your way of asking if I want you to fuck me senseless again? The answer is yes.\u201d One last kiss and she sailed out the door.</p><p>The odd thing was, Tell hadn\u2019t been talking about sex.</p><p>He killed an hour doing stuff around the house he\u2019d been putting off. Stalling wasn\u2019t normally his style, but he suspected Jessie might be as overwhelmed as Brandt.</p><p>After he checked on Jessie and Brandt\u2019s dog, he stopped at the grocery store to grab some flowers. The selection was shitty, so he drove to Spearfish.</p><p>Somehow he managed to leave Walmart with flowers, a stuffed horse, a DVD of Parenthood, a box of chocolates and a bottle of booze.</p><p>He felt like a dork schlepping all the stuff into the hospital. When he asked at the visitor information center for Jessie\u2019s room number, the woman made him wait.</p> <p>His heart sped up. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>The older gal shook her head. \u201cDoc Monroe put a limit on visitors for the first twenty-four hours. The McKays could overtake the whole wing if y\u2019all showed up at the same time.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cleared to go in, Tell. Room one nineteen.\u201d</p><p>He cut down the left hallway\u2014due to various injuries over the years he\u2019d been in this hospital several times\u2014and stopped in front of the door. After shifting everything into one hand, he knocked.</p><p>Brandt opened the door a crack. Then he threw it open wide. \u201cTell. Man. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. What took you so damn long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to get a few things to mark the occasion.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s eyes were dark with guilt when he saw the bouquet. Dammit. His brother hadn\u2019t gone out and brought Jessie flowers yet? Dumb-ass.</p><p>Jess was sitting up, a blanket-wrapped bundle tucked against her body. She looked tired, but happy. She beamed at him. \u201cHey, Uncle Tell. Whatcha got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlowers from your adoring husband. He asked me to pick them up for him because he couldn\u2019t bear to leave you guys.\u201d Tell passed her the bouquet of yellow, white and pink daisies.</p><p>Her lip trembled. She looked over at Brandt. \u201cThank you. Daisies are my favorite.\u201d</p><p>Brandt said, \u201cI\u2019ll get \u2019em in some water.\u201d</p><p>Then Tell pulled out the tie-dyed plush pony. \u201cLooks like a hippie horse, but I\u2019ve heard babies like bright things. And so you didn\u2019t think I forgot you...\u201d He waggled the two-pound box of chocolates and the DVD at her.</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He took the bottle out of the paper bag. \u201cMy gift to the proud daddy. Koltiska liquor made right here in Wyoming. Figured my big brother and I needed to celebrate Wyoming\u2019s newest resident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta give Brandt a shot now,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cAnyway. Come see our son.\u201d Jessie peeled back the blanket covering the baby\u2019s face.</p><p>His eyes were squeezed shut. In fact, his whole face was squished and red\u2014not that Tell would point that out. The baby had a full head of dark hair.</p><p>Jess murmured and stroked Tucker\u2019s cheek. His eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. He\u2019s lookin\u2019 at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s actually awake more than I thought he\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeya, buddy. Welcome to the family.\u201d Tell kissed Jessie\u2019s forehead. \u201cYa done good, Mama. He\u2019s perfect. And so little.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cHe didn\u2019t feel little when I was tryin\u2019 to push him out.\u201d</p><p>Tell chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hold him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a bit. He looks content. I ain\u2019t gonna mess with him.\u201d</p><p>Jessie frowned.</p><p>\u201cHas Dalton been by yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on his way. Now that Tell\u2019s here to keep you company, I\u2019m gonna fill out that paperwork.\u201d Brandt softly closed the door behind him.</p><p>Tell\u2019s gaze connected with Jessie\u2019s. \u201cIs everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Brandt... He...\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThis is gonna sound stupid, but I don\u2019t think he likes Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt was great during the delivery. He stayed right beside me and he didn\u2019t blink when I sort of...took a swing at him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It didn\u2019t faze him. He just kept me focused on getting through the next contraction. After I delivered Tucker and it was just the three of us alone in the room, Brandt was so quiet. When I finally made him hold his son, he just looked at Tucker like I\u2019d handed him a rabid raccoon.\u201d Jessie started to cry.</p><p>Tell was going to slap his stupid fucking brother right upside the head when he got him alone.</p><p>\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t really want this baby? What if Brandt just said he did to make me happy and now he regrets it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Tell wrapped his hands around Jessie\u2019s face, wiping away her tears. \u201cI promise you, I will find out what is wrong with him. But get it outta your head, right now, Jess, that he doesn\u2019t love this kid.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then Tucker squirmed and grunted and made the funniest face that both Tell and Jessie laughed.</p><p>Three knocks and the door swung open.</p><p>Keely McKay Donohue sauntered in, holding a shiny blue bag covered in rocking horses. \u201cThank God that baby is finally here.\u201d She hugged Tell and then hip-checked him, completely horning in on his spot.</p><p>He knew Keely would stick around awhile and he considered tracking down his shit-for-brains older brother. But he opted to stay in case Keely needed encouragement to leave because Jess was too nice to point her toward the door.</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna hold him?\u201d Jessie asked Keely.</p><p>\u201cYep. Lemme pull a chair over first.\u201d She scooped Tucker up like a pro. \u201cHe\u2019s hefty. Colt and India\u2019s McKenna weighed in at seven pounds. That one pound makes a big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>Keely kissed Tucker\u2019s forehead. \u201cGod. I love the way babies smell. And they\u2019re so warm and cuddly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter that remark, you know I\u2019m gonna ask when you and Jack are going to start a family,\u201d Jessie said.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Keely fussed with the blanket. \u201cCan I ask you something? On a scale of one to ten, how bad did it hurt to have these eight pounds squeezed out of your va-jay-jay?\u201d</p><p>Jessie paused. \u201cA nine.\u201d</p><p>Tell did not want to hear this conversation but now he was trapped.</p><p>\u201cCrap. That\u2019s what I thought. See, AJ spews this \u2018it\u2019s a beautiful thing\u2019 when she talks about giving birth, even when I saw her screaming at Cord when she was in labor with Beau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYikes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that was her second baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it hurts like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt. I mean, I wanted to punch and scratch and scream at Brandt because I had to go through all of this and he didn\u2019t. Yet the baby would still be half his. How is that fair? At the very least he should have to suffer somehow, right? I mean, months of being sick, being hormonal, being fat, being so desperately horny and then wanting to chop off Brandt\u2019s hand or his dick if either so much as touched me again.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s legs automatically snapped together.</p><p>\u201cAnd now after the blessed event, not only is there no sex for six weeks, I\u2019ve been warned that my nipples might crack and bleed while I\u2019m breastfeeding. Not to mention milk leaks everywhere. And I have this extra pooch of skin on my gut that I\u2019ll probably never get rid of. I\u2019m pretty sure my hips or my ass won\u2019t ever be the same pre-baby size.\u201d</p><p>Maybe they wouldn\u2019t notice if he dropped to the floor and crawled out. Knowing women talked about shit like this and hearing it? Two. Different. Things.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d Keely pointed out. \u201cPregnancy sounds like a raw deal for women, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jessie\u2019s face softened. \u201cBut look at him, Keely. He\u2019s so perfect. He\u2019s part me and part Brandt. I just stare at his sweet little face and wonder if he\u2019ll have my personality or his father\u2019s, or maybe his own. I wonder who he will look like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHate to break it to you, but this boy already looks like a McKay. He\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Keely sniffled.</p><p>Holy fuck. His cowgirl-tough cousin was...crying? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessie\u2019s voice dropped to a soothing timbre Tell hadn\u2019t heard from her. \u201cWhat\u2019s this really about, Keels? Being scared of labor isn\u2019t really what\u2019s holding you back from having a baby. Is Jack pressuring you?\u201d</p><p>Keely wiped beneath her eyes. \u201cA little. I love Jack like crazy. I love our life together. I never thought I\u2019d be this happy. What if having a baby screws that up? What if everything in our life becomes about being parents? What if I lose myself in motherhood? We both know we won\u2019t stop at one kid. Plus, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m cut out to be a full-time, stay-at-home mom. And I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s what Jack wants, because that\u2019s what we both had growing up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Jack about any of this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. He\u2019s my best friend\u2014hell, he\u2019s my everything\u2014but I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll understand. I can\u2019t talk to AJ because she\u2019s glowing with pregnancy. My mom had five kids by the time she was my age. My single friends remind me I\u2019m only thirty and there\u2019s no rush to motherhood. My sisters-in-law and my cousins\u2019 wives nag me to get on the ball so mine and Jack\u2019s kids will be raised around cousins like I was. I just feel that no one understands my fears, even when they sound stupid when I say them out loud.\u201d</p><p>Tell sat up a little straighter. Could that be the issue with Brandt? Some unnamed fear and he felt he had no one to talk to about it?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cause problems if you don\u2019t talk to Jack about what\u2019s holding you back as far as planning a nursery and picking baby names. Trust me on this. Brandt is holding something back from me and it\u2019s frustrating. So I imagine Jack might feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>Keely snickered. \u201cGQ practically shoved me out the door to meet the newest McKay. I think he\u2019s hoping new-baby pheromones give my biological clock a good swift kick.\u201d She glanced down at the bundle in her arms and her nose wrinkled. \u201cHe just filled his diaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHand him over. Will you get the diapers and stuff over by the window?\u201d</p> <p>Brandt walked in, his gaze firmly on Jessie\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiaper change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Tell watched his brother standing there, just watching Keely help out, not offering to do anything.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>He grabbed the bottle and clapped Brandt on the back. \u201cCome on. I could use some fresh air.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKeely\u2019s gonna stick around for a bit, so I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Jessie said.</p><p>Tell sent Jessie a reassuring glance before following Brandt out the door. He headed to his pickup and dropped the tailgate. He took a seat and watched Brandt pace. \u201cLet\u2019s make a toast to your son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You figure we\u2019re gonna get arrested? If Cam\u2019s on duty, we won\u2019t even get a warning for open container.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Gimme the damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. I get the honors.\u201d Tell twisted the cap off. \u201cWelcome to the world, Tucker McKay.\u201d Then he handed Brandt the bottle.</p><p>Brandt took a long swallow and passed it back to Tell.</p><p>After Tell drank, he said, \u201cYour turn to make a toast.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTo Jessie. The best woman in the whole damn world.\u201d</p><p>By about the fifth toast, they\u2019d knocked back a third of the bottle. Finally, Brandt stopped pacing and hopped up on the tailgate.</p><p>\u201cSharing a bottle takes me back. Remember that time Luke dragged all of us to the lake to go fishin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Tell nodded. \u201cWe never even dropped a line on the water, bein\u2019s he stole a bottle of Dad\u2019s cheap whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time Dalton ever got drunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time I ever got drunk,\u201d Tell reminded him.</p><p>\u201cMan. Dad whupped Luke but good. Gave him the punishment for all of us because as the oldest, Luke shoulda known better.\u201d</p><p>The liquid in the bottle sloshed as Tell helped himself to another swig.</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still expect him to show up where we\u2019re workin\u2019. Skidding to a stop in his truck, the tires spraying us with dust, and then him saying, \u2018If ya ain\u2019t dirty, you ain\u2019t workin\u2019 hard enough\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Tell chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t really talk to Jess about it,\u201d Brandt said softly. \u201cNot like I used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t imagine you can. But you can talk to me, Brandt. Both me and Dalton. Neither of us wants to forget Luke like he never was.\u201d</p><p>Brandt didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>\u201cAre you talkin\u2019 to Jess about anything? And before you deny it, it\u2019s obvious something ain\u2019t right. You wanna tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s been goin\u2019 on a while. Since Jess miscarried. She just fell apart, convinced she\u2019d never take a baby to term. We were shocked to find out she was pregnant so soon after. When she got past the six-month mark, that\u2019s when she began to breathe a little easier. But me? I couldn\u2019t breathe at all.\u201d</p><p>Tell tipped the bottle and drank.</p><p>\u201cI worried about every damn thing. Her health. Money. The baby\u2019s health. Each month her belly got bigger, so did my fears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there one fear that\u2019s bigger than all the rest?\u201d</p><p>Brandt looked away.</p><p>\u201cCome on. It\u2019s me. This is eatin\u2019 you alive, bro. And that ain\u2019t good.\u201d</p><p>He scrubbed his hands over his face. \u201cWhat if I turn out to be the same kind of father as Dad?\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s stomach dropped.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it won\u2019t happen. To hear Dad\u2019s brothers talk, he wasn\u2019t always a total dick either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid the uncles say when Dad changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. After he and mom started havin\u2019 kids.\u201d</p><p>Jesus. No wonder Brandt was freaked out. Especially when their dad had always claimed Brandt was more like him than any of his sons.</p><p>But his brother wasn\u2019t an idiot. Couldn\u2019t he see that by closing himself off from his wife and his brothers that he was falling prey to that mindset and becoming like their father? That maybe he\u2019d already slipped into that cycle?</p><p>This was totally fucked up. Tell mentally flipped his dad the bird. But he wouldn\u2019t stand by and watch that bullshit destroy any more lives, especially not the great life Brandt finally had with the woman he loved more than anything.</p><p>Brandt closed his eyes. \u201cSo now that I have a kid of my own, I need you to do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep me from turning into Dad. I understand it ain\u2019t your responsibility, but you know the signs, Tell. I can\u2019t rely on Jessie in this. You will see when I\u2019ve stepped too far over that line and you will need to jerk me back to the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you brought it up, you have stepped over the line in the last few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Tell waggled the bottle at Brandt but he shook his head. \u201cYou need to talk to Jessie. Yeah, some stuff can be between us. But the big stuff? She needs to know. She ain\u2019t gonna judge you. And without stepping in it too deep, Jess is afraid you regret havin\u2019 Tucker.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s mouth fell open in shock. \u201cWhy would she think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. But you\u2019d better figure it out fast. Tonight, before you\u2019re overwhelmed with visitors tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. Fine.\u201d Brandt sighed. \u201cUh, thanks for saving my ass with the flowers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta stop walking around in a fog, so damn...scared I\u2019m gonna break Tucker if I hold him. He\u2019s so freakin\u2019 little.\u201d He scrubbed his hands over his face. \u201cGod. How can Jess think I don\u2019t want him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo clue, but I expect you\u2019ll fix that issue right away or I will kick your ass until you\u2019re a broken heap on the floor. Then I\u2019ll turn Dalton loose on you. You ain\u2019t Dad. None of us are. None of us ever hafta be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t know how to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut yourself some slack. The kid is a few hours old! And you know more than you think you do. You\u2019ve watched our cousins become fathers. They all seem to be doin\u2019 pretty well. I\u2019m bettin\u2019 every single one of them felt the way you do at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven Cord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. He\u2019s perfect. He\u2019s never fucked up anything in his life.\u201d</p><p>Brandt laughed. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s pickup zipped into the parking lot, music blaring. He trotted over like an eager pup and jerked Brandt into a big hug. \u201cCongrats, bro! How\u2019s it feel to be a daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScary as shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubt. Luckily you\u2019ve got me and Tell to keep you on the straight and narrow in not turning into Dad. \u2019Cause I gotta be honest, B. The way you\u2019ve acted a couple times in the last few months really reminded me of him.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Dalton to cut to the chase.</p><p>Dalton spied the bottle. \u201cReally? You guys started celebrating Tucker\u2019s arrival before I got here? For shame. I\u2019m just gonna hafta catch up.\u201d He raised the bottle and drank.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m done,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cI wonder if Jess will let me hold our son with booze on my breath.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t had nearly as much as me.\u201d The shots seemed to hit Tell all at once.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold off on any more then,\u201d Dalton said to Tell. \u201cSo I can get you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. But I probably won\u2019t be goin\u2019 straight home. I\u2019ll probably just walk over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver where?\u201d Brandt asked.</p><p>\u201cTo Hot Lips\u2019 place.\u201d Dalton took another drink.</p><p>Brandt looked confused. \u201cWho\u2019s Hot Lips?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Brandt. Get with the program. Georgia Hotchkiss. The chick Tell has been hangin\u2019 out with all week. Everyone in the whole damn McKay family knows about her.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Great. But it bothered Tell that his older brother hadn\u2019t been paying attention to things going on in his life. Then again, Brandt hadn\u2019t been paying attention to anything.</p><p>You cut him too much slack.</p><p>Dalton smirked at him. \u201cDidja finally get into her pants?\u201d</p><p>After several belts, Tell didn\u2019t have the tact to deal with his younger brother, so he ignored him and slid off the tailgate. He looked at Brandt. \u201cI know you\u2019ll get a handle on this. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Georgia was mighty shocked to see Tell on her doorstep.</p><p>\u201cTell? What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at the hospital to meet my nephew. Brandt and I knocked back a few celebratory shots, and I realized I oughten be drivin\u2019, so I walked over to see if you\u2019d be interested in goin\u2019 out for supper with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s thoughtful, but I just finished cooking.\u201d</p> <p>He took a step back. \u201cI probably shoulda called first. No big deal. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed a fistful of his T-shirt, holding him in place. \u201cNot so fast. I have plenty of food if you\u2019d like stay and eat with me.\u201d</p><p>Tell curled his hand around her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re so damn sweet. Thank you. I\u2019d like that. A lot.\u201d</p><p>Just the simple stroke of his thumb made her belly flip. \u201cI hope you like curry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever had it.\u201d</p><p>Georgia stood on tiptoe to press her mouth to his. \u201cSo come in and try it.\u201d</p> <p>He let her lead him into the kitchen after protesting that he needed to remove his boots. She gently shoved him into a chair and grabbed another plate from the cupboard. \u201cTea would be better for you than beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I ain\u2019t drunk, but I\u2019m definitely feeling the shots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is the newest McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect, strapping, eight-pound baby boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your sister-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doin\u2019 great.\u201d He frowned and traced the edges of the place mat.</p><p>Between Tell showing up unannounced and the uncertainty surrounding him, Georgia knew something was up. If he wanted to talk about it, he would, but she wouldn\u2019t pry. She dished up two plates of basmati rice and poured coconut chicken curry over the top.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, darlin\u2019, this smells awesome.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little spicy.\u201d She filled two glasses of iced tea and sat across from him. \u201cDig in. Don\u2019t be shy.\u201d</p><p>Tell stirred his food before taking a bite.</p><p>Georgia waited to see if he made a face. She remembered from living with her dad and Deck that cowboys weren\u2019t adventurous eaters.</p><p>He swallowed and immediately scooped up another forkful. \u201cHey. This is tasty.\u201d After a few more bites, he reached for his tea and sputtered. \u201cIs there sugar in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cIced tea ain\u2019t supposed to be sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet tea is the norm where I\u2019m from in Texas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you ain\u2019t claiming Wyoming as your home at all?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWe moved a lot before we ended up in Sundance. I might\u2019ve considered it home if I\u2019d stayed married to Deck.\u201d</p><p>He dumped his tea in the sink and refilled the glass with water. \u201cYou\u2019ve never talked about your life before you moved here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that exciting. Me and RJ were born at Fort Bragg. My dad was stationed at two different army bases before he got out of the service. After that we moved to Nebraska. When Granddad died, my dad and his brother sold the farm, split the money and went their separate ways. My dad had always wanted to live in Wyoming, so he bought a small ranch and cattle operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom didn\u2019t mind movin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she did, she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d Georgia swirled her fork through the mixture, thinking back on those years. When everything thing had been somewhat normal in their family.</p><p>Startled by the rough fingertips caressing her hand, she looked up into Tell\u2019s beautiful blue eyes. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\u201d</p><p>His concern touched her, because she hadn\u2019t expected it. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. It was just a reminder that Sundance will never be my home.\u201d She managed a smile. \u201cSo what do you think of the curry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want the recipe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really much of a cook.\u201d</p><p>It amazed her how many bachelors were clueless in the kitchen. \u201cSo what do you eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stick to the basics. Meat. Potatoes. Chili. Eggs. Sandwiches. Frozen dinners. Or I eat out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet lots of ladies offer to fix you a home-cooked meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI usually take them up on it too.\u201d He gave her a sly smile. \u201cBut none of those vittles have ever been as good as this.\u201d</p><p>Georgia rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d offer to whip something up for you, but now that I\u2019ve admitted I\u2019m a lousy cook...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on the offer, McKay, if for no other reason than to watch you squirm.\u201d</p><p>His gaze settled on her chest. \u201cI know a thing or two about making you squirm, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>He laughed when she blushed.</p><p>After they finished eating, Tell insisted on doing the dishes. She wandered out the back door onto the patio.</p><p>The backyard was enclosed on three sides by a six-foot wooden fence with no trees obstructing the view of the sky. She\u2019d even planted a vegetable garden, something she hadn\u2019t done since living at the ranch. The lush green grass was soft beneath her bare feet. She spent most nights out here. Gazing at the stars. Listening to the night noises that were absent in a big city.</p><p>The screen door banged. Then Tell\u2019s arms were around her. \u201cI wondered where you\u2019d gone off to.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cI checked your bedroom first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you disappointed not to find me there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>Georgia spun around and faced him. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful out here.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were so serious. \u201cIs that what you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for? Peace?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered honestly.</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d Tell spread out the blanket from the porch swing on the grass. He\u2019d taken off his boots and his socks. And did he ever look sexy: dark stubble on his lean cheeks, wearing a tight T-shirt and low-slung jeans, his feet bare. He dropped onto the blanket with a deep sigh.</p><p>And Georgia continued staring at him.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re just so easy on the eyes, Tell McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just sweet-talkin\u2019 me, hoping it\u2019ll get you laid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>Smirking, Tell crooked his finger at her. \u201cGotta come closer, my sweet, to find out.\u201d</p><p>She straddled his groin, pinning his arms above his head. \u201cWhatcha gonna do now, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind you that what goes around comes around.\u201d</p><p>Angling across his body, she smashed her breasts into his chest, taking one teeny nibble of his bottom lip. \u201cThat sounds intriguing. What does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means...restraining me now gives me the right to do the same to you in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like this? Just my hands?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>Wow. Tell\u2019s dark look of challenge unfurled a long lick of want inside her. Imagining her arms tied behind her back. Or in front of her. Or above her head. Or tied to a four-poster bed.</p><p>\u201cSweetness, gazing at me all wide-eyed like that is bound to get you...bound in all sorts of interesting ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise?\u201d she whispered against his lips.</p><p>Tell made a low growling sound and took her mouth in a savage kiss. Swamping her body with a wave of heat. His tongue swirled around hers aggressively as he cranked her lust higher.</p><p>Georgia returned his passion, rolling her hips against his pelvis and across the hard ridge in his jeans.</p><p>He dragged an openmouthed kiss down the center of her throat, commanding, \u201cShirt off. I want your nipples in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>She released his hands long enough to yank off her shirt and pop the clasp on her bra. She expected him to gather her breasts in his hands, feeling that delicious shock of wet heat as his mouth enclosed the tip.</p><p>But Tell\u2019s arms remained above his head. His gaze hooked hers. \u201cBring them to me.\u201d</p><p>She scooted up, bracing one hand on the ground as she leaned closer to his open mouth, intending to tease his lips with the hardened tip, then pulling away when his wicked tongue popped out to lick.</p><p>He had other ideas. He arched his neck and sucked the tight point, closing his eyes as he attempted to work more of her into his mouth.</p><p>Gooseflesh broke out, starting at her nape, inching down her spine a vertebra at a time with every rhythmic pull.</p><p>He bit down harder than she was expecting and she jerked back, which allowed him to shift oral focus to her other breast. \u201cStay. Still.\u201d</p><p>She tried, but her body was twitchy.</p><p>He\u2019d latch his suctioning mouth to the hard point and then back off, teasing with little whips of his tongue. Blowing a stream of air on the wetness. Rubbing his face over the center of her breasts, scraping the bristly five o\u2019clock shadow across the puckered tips until they ached. She ached. Everywhere. She wanted more.</p><p>She shifted, putting both hands on the ground, and began to grind on him.</p><p>Tell released her nipple. \u201cYou can grind on me all you want, but you don\u2019t get to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause I said so.\u201d</p><p>Georgia glanced at him. The ferocity in his eyes was a little scary, until she remembered this was Tell. Laid-back Tell. Tell with the sexy, dimpled grin. Tell with the dancing eyes. Tell with the silver-tongued sweetness. Fun-loving Tell who teased her.</p><p>But there was not a hint of that man staring back at her right now.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you have that deer in the headlights look?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I remember you looked at me like this the first night you kissed me when we were dancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how did I look at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you owned me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes that scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.

Grabbing her hand, he murmured, \u201cI liked how you were on me before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn top?\u201d she asked, wondering if he could see her blushing.</p><p>\u201cYep. And hurry up, \u2019cause I\u2019m dying to see how beautiful you are when you\u2019re ridin\u2019 me.\u201d</p><p>She straddled him, pressing her palms against his pectorals, squeezing that warm, hard flesh.</p><p>Tell reached up and traced the inner rim of her lip with his thumb. \u201cPut me inside you.\u201d</p><p>Circling her hand around his shaft, she adjusted her hips. The instant the tip connected with her opening, Tell\u2019s hands landed on her hips.</p><p>\u201cSlowly,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Georgia lowered herself a little at a time, aware of how wet she was. Aware of Tell\u2019s hungry gaze on her. She looked up when his cock was inside her to the root.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands on my thighs.\u201d</p> <p>Arching back gave him full access to her clit.</p><p>\u201cRide me like this. Bring me all the way out of that tight pussy and then take me deep again.\u201d</p><p>Every time she lifted her hips, letting his shaft slide out, he\u2019d swirl his thumb over her clit. Her body quivered from the effort as she kept the maddeningly slow pace. Her thighs were sweating. Aching.</p><p>When he pumped his up to meet her downstroke, she switched gears. She fell forward, dropping her hands above his shoulders. Sliding so they were skin on skin, which felt amazing. God. He was so pretty to look at as she was on top of him, fucking him.</p><p>His hands cupped her ass. \u201cImpatient?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes. This is so good.\u201d She rolled her torso, her breasts rubbing against his chest hair as she increased the tempo.</p><p>Two sharp smacks on her bare ass surprised her.</p><p>She froze. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor takin\u2019 over.\u201d He smacked her butt cheeks again. \u201cSome other time when you get it in your mind to be in charge, I\u2019m gonna put you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>Her pussy clenched at the image of lying across his lap as his big, rough hands connecting with her butt.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh, sweetness, you\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, gliding back down his body like a cat, pushing him in deep. Then almost kissing him as she pushed herself forward. \u201cBut I\u2019d really like to see that holy shit look in your eyes when I make you come.\u201d</p><p>He pressed a kiss to her lips. \u201cTake us there.\u201d</p><p>Her instincts took over. She picked up the pace, sliding skin on skin until their torsos were damp and sticking together. Mouth dry, head roaring, every inch of her skin prickled with awareness as she pushed toward that point of no return.</p><p>Tell whispered, \u201cBreathe, baby. Lemme help you.\u201d His grip on her ass tightened as he helped her move to shorter, faster strokes.</p><p>That little changeup flipped a switch, sending her straight over the edge. \u201cYes. Oh God.\u201d She threw her head back in sweet anticipation of that first hard pulse.</p><p>The automatic sprinklers went off as she started to come. She gasped from the shock of the cold water spraying on her hot skin. The tick tick tick of the sprinklers was synchronized to the contractions in her pussy, to the throbbing in her clit, and to Tell\u2019s sucking kisses on the pulse point in her throat.</p><p>By the time the climax slowed, she was soaked.</p><p>Then Tell flipped her on her back, trying to protect her from the sprinkler stream. Resting on his forearms above her head, fucking her with power, but tenderness dominated his eyes. \u201cWatch what you do to me.\u201d He groaned and his back bowed as he peered at her from beneath lowered lashes. His mouth tight with tension, then slack with pleasure as he emptied himself into her.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t time to cling to each other, whispering sweet words as bodies and breathing returned to normal.</p><p>Tell twitched. \u201cGoddammit. That sprinkler head is spraying me right in the ass.\u201d</p><p>Georgia snickered. \u201cYou won\u2019t need an enema.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you said that. Just for that...\u201d He withdrew from her body and rolled to his feet, ducking out of the way so the sprinklers hit her from every direction.</p><p>She shrieked and scrambled upright, grabbing the corners of the blanket before she ran to the patio, where Tell was shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI shoulda left your clothes out there,\u201d she grumbled, dropping the wet bundle on the cement.</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d He pulled her wet, naked body against his. \u201cBut won\u2019t you feel a little bad for me, drivin\u2019 home in wet clothes? While you\u2019re all nice and warm, wrapped in a fluffy robe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not a bit.\u201d</p><p>He whacked her ass and covered her mouth, stopping her squeak of protest.</p><p>The kiss was pure seduction. So hot her lips seemed to burn. So sweet her teeth ached. So thorough she felt as if he\u2019d taken her body again.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t get enough of you, Georgia.\u201d He gifted her forehead, temples, cheekbones, jaw, the corners of her mouth with soft kisses. He murmured, \u201cBeing with you... There\u2019s never been anything like it for me.\u201d</p><p>For her either. And he seemed to be as perplexed by it as she was.</p><p>\u201cI hate that I hafta go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to wait until your clothes are dry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ve worn worse than this.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers traced the cut muscles in his chest. \u201cAt least let me give you a ride to your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe walk will do me good. But I appreciate the offer.\u201d He snatched his wet clothes and only grimaced a little when he slid them on.</p><p>When she returned from donning a robe, Tell lounged by the front door. \u201cThanks for supper tonight. And for\u2014\u201d his hungry gaze swept her from head to toe, \u201c\u2014dessert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I see you tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want.\u201d</p><p>His knuckles followed the curve of her jaw. \u201cOh, I want.\u201d Then he slipped out into the night.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Georgia spent way more time on her hair and makeup for the reunion than she\u2019d planned. Pointless fussing as she was torn on which image she wanted to project to her classmates. That Georgia Hotchkiss hadn\u2019t changed in appearance at all? Or that Georgia Hotchkiss had changed completely?</p><p>She scrutinized her reflection. Her hair, a solid foot shorter than in her teenage years, was sleek and professional.</p><p>Wait. Why did she want to look like she\u2019d just stepped out of a board meeting? Why wouldn\u2019t she prefer to look sexy?</p><p>Dammit. None of this shit mattered.</p><p>Georgia fluffed up her sleek style into a tousled look. As if she\u2019d just rolled out of bed after a bout of hot, hair-pulling sex. Tell would appreciate it.</p><p>She was wearing a sleeveless, form-fitting dress in a pale blue. With a modest bodice, the fabric was shirred from the empire waist to the froth of tulle at the hemline, two inches above her knees. With her funky platform heels in a blue cheetah print and a rhinestone clutch, she\u2019d probably added fashion violation to her list of worries, which was already too long.</p><p>Seeing Deck for the first time since the dissolution of their marriage.</p><p>Seeing Tara-Lee, pregnant.</p><p>Seeing the girls in her class who hated her.</p><p>Seeing RJ\u2019s friends.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Georgia gave herself one last look and headed downstairs.</p><p>Tell hadn\u2019t waited for her to open the door; he\u2019d just waltzed right in.</p><p>And wasn\u2019t it ironic he was standing at the bottom of the stairs waiting for her, just like she\u2019d seen in all those teen movies where the guy showed up to take the girl to the prom? To top it off, Tell had a look on his face she\u2019d never seen on any man.</p><p>\u201cMy God, Georgia. You are a fucking goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped her before she reached the bottom stair, setting his hands on her hips. He still topped her by a couple inches.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look so damn perfect I\u2019m afraid to touch you. Afraid I\u2019ll muss you up.\u201d</p><p>Her shoes dangled from her right index finger. She propped her forearms on his broad shoulders and let them hang between his shoulder blades as she rubbed her nose to his. \u201cI love it when you muss me up. In fact, if you wanna ditch this whole reunion idea right now, I\u2019ll take you upstairs and let you muss me up however you want. All night.\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed. \u201cMighty tempting offer, hot lips. Now you gonna let me give you a proper kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>His mouth came down on hers with more force than she\u2019d expected. He dove in for a tongue-teasing, openmouthed kiss that utterly overwhelmed her. His fingers tightened on her hips. And he blew every one of her circuits.</p><p>Then he eased back and made her weak-kneed with his dimpled grin. \u201cSee? I didn\u2019t muss you up at all.\u201d</p><p>Not on the outside. But on the inside? Different story.</p><p>\u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust have to put my shoes on.\u201d She used the newel post for support as she shoved her feet in the heels and checked out Tell\u2019s attire.</p><p>A black western-cut sport coat worn over a pristine white shirt, a bolo tie at his neck. Jeans, boots and his black hat. Yummy. \u201cYou are quite the head-turner, Mr. McKay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks.\u201d He seemed embarrassed by the compliment.</p><p>Georgia grabbed her clutch. As soon as they stepped outside and approached his truck, Tell apologized.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid we ain\u2019t showing up to the school tonight in a fancy sports car. The only person I know who has one is Keely\u2019s husband, Jack, and it seemed a little forward to ask to borrow it.\u201d</p> <p>She waited while he opened the door. Then he helped her into the cab. She wrapped her fingers around the braided leather strings of his bolo tie and pulled him closer. \u201cI\u2019m very fond of this truck. Especially after last night. Now I know it is possible to steam up the windows in July.\u201d</p><p>Tell held her hand on the short drive to the school. She checked her reflection again, adding a coat of lip gloss.</p><p>The parking lot was nearly full, and her stomach tightened.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>As they walked up to the gymnasium doors, Tell casually asked, \u201cYou nervous?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA little. How about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He tucked her hand around his bicep. \u201cI\u2019m with the hottest girl in our graduating class, who also happens to be the sexiest woman I know. I remember promising myself ten years ago that I\u2019d show up at this reunion bein\u2019 the envy of all the other guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid that fantasy include making all the girls in our class take notice of what a gorgeous hunk of man you turned out to be?\u201d</p><p>Tell grinned. \u201cBusted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it appears both wishes will come true, since I will be the envy of all the women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would be different from high school for you...how? Didn\u2019t everyone want to be you?\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t crack a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an ironic statement because I didn\u2019t want to be me in high school.\u201d She withheld a frustrated sigh. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s what tonight will be about? Just an exercise in our classmates going out of their way to prove how much they\u2019ve changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly.\u201d He smoothed a piece of her flyaway hair back in place. \u201cIsn\u2019t that why we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I am here, I\u2019m wondering why I came. Can we just go? Out for dinner or something? I\u2019ll buy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I promise we\u2019ll leave if it sucks, okay?\u201d He kissed her. \u201cI like the coconut-flavored lip gloss.\u201d</p><p>The registration table was directly in front of one set of doors. And who was manning the table? Denille Swedlund. A fellow cheerleader. An easy piece for any of the jocks, anytime they wanted\u2014a fact Denille used to brag about to Georgia, staring with disdain at her purity ring. Denille had offered Deck a hand job\u2014a fact Georgia had found out from Denille herself after Deck had taken Denille up on the skanky proposition.</p><p>Denille looked good\u2014but Denille wasn\u2019t scoping her out at all. Her gaze stayed glued on Georgia\u2019s date. \u201cMy God. Tell McKay, is that really you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes indeed. Nice to see you, Denille, you haven\u2019t changed a bit.\u201d</p><p>Denille preened and handed over his badge. \u201cThe number on the bottom is the table you\u2019ve been assigned.\u201d</p><p>Tell raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re kiddin\u2019, right? About the assigned seating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The committee thought it would be fun.\u201d</p><p>The other woman at the table, Nicki DeSoto, was also ogling Tell. \u201cHey, Tell, remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do, Nicki. We had geometry together. So I\u2019m guessing, since you were good at math, you\u2019re an engineer or something?\u201d</p><p>Nicki laughed. \u201cNo. I\u2019m married. Living in Lander.\u201d She scooted her chair out and patted her rounded belly. \u201cOur first baby is due in October.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Denille finally deigned to look at Georgia. She handed over the button and said coolly, \u201cGeorgia. You\u2019re looking...well.\u201d</p><p>Georgia smiled. \u201cYou too. Do you still live in Sundance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I live in Longmont, Colorado. I teach high school biology and I\u2019m the head cheerleading coach.\u201d</p><p>No surprise Denille taught biology since she\u2019d had so much previous experience with male anatomy. Ooh. Snap. And as long as she was being bitchy, the phrase you can always tell the head cheerleader by her dirty knees popped into her head, which allowed her to give her former nemesis a genuine smile. \u201cThat\u2019s great, Denille.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t sure whether you were even gonna show up,\u201d Denille said.</p><p>\u201cSomeone convinced me it was a good idea,\u201d Georgia said, slightly nudging Tell.</p><p>Tell plucked the button out of Georgia\u2019s hand and murmured, \u201cHold still, sweetness,\u201d pinning it above her left breast. Then he straightened it, letting his fingers brush over the swell of her cleavage with obvious familiarity. \u201cThere. Perfect.\u201d</p><p>And perfectly sweet, his I\u2019m with her display. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>He draped his arm over her shoulder, said, \u201cSee you lovelies inside,\u201d to Nicki and Denille, and led her into the mouth of the beast\u2014aka the gymnasium.</p><p>Georgia hadn\u2019t realized she was holding her breath until Tell leaned over and whispered, \u201cCome on, baby, breathe.\u201d</p><p>A bar had been set up in the far back corner. He ordered a vodka tonic for her and a Bud Light for himself. Tell tapped his bottle to her plastic glass. \u201cTo makin\u2019 our own rules tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d</p><p>Popular music from their senior year flowed from the speakers. They drank in silence, watching the action up by the makeshift stage\u2014not that they could see much through the crowd. Georgia\u2019s spine stiffened when she realized the crowd was gathered around Deck.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll spill all over your pretty dress if you keep crushing the glass.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down. The sides of the cup were dented in. God. Why was she hiding in the corner? It wasn\u2019t fair to make Tell her babysitter because she didn\u2019t want to see her ex-husband and his groupies.</p><p>Like it or not, she had to deal with Deck, and it might as well be on her terms, not his. She drained her drink and set the empty on the closest table. \u201cLet\u2019s get the bullshit out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now.\u201d</p><p>Tell grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl. Not a wallflower, just balls to the wall.\u201d He drained his beer. Then he put his lips on hers. \u201cLet\u2019s go stir things up.\u201d</p><p>Once they reached the group, people began to recognize her and hugs were exchanged. She was on the receiving end of some dirty looks too. Tell laughed and joked with several guys, but he was never more than an arm\u2019s length away from her.</p><p>No one came right out and asked them about their relationship. Because it was obvious they were a romantic couple? Or because it was old news? She estimated more than a third of their graduating class still lived in the Sundance area and gossip was a way of life around here. And she and Tell had been all over the place in the last two weeks.</p><p>Deck was at the center of it all. Smitty said something in his ear, and Deck turned and looked at her.</p><p>Georgia could admit Deck looked good. He hadn\u2019t packed on a beer belly or spare tire like many of their male classmates. He hadn\u2019t gone bald; he still had a head of wavy blond hair. His face showed more creases than the last time she\u2019d seen him seven years ago. But he was still a handsome man.</p><p>He seemed to be sizing her up. He kept his arms crossed over his chest and a scowl on his lips. She was grateful when Tell placed his hand on the small of her back, possessively sliding his fingers around the curve of her hip.</p><p>\u201cHello, Deck.\u201d Thankfully her voice stayed friendly and not cold.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. It\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was surprised to hear you\u2019re living in Sundance now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor about the last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny. You couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell out of Wyoming and yet...here you are. Back again.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cRobert said he talked to you last week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d been a while since we\u2019d spoken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Deck rolled his shoulders back. \u201cHe said you ain\u2019t gonna come see him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty sure he knows the road runs both ways.\u201d</p><p>All the talking around them had stopped as everyone listened in to their conversation.</p><p>Deck\u2019s eyes scanned Tell head to toe. He didn\u2019t offer his hand. \u201cMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVeldekamp.\u201d</p><p>Deck pointed with his head to the woman next to him. \u201cThis is my wife Tara-Lee.\u201d</p><p>Tell said, \u201cI remember Tara-Lee. You graduated a year behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t look like this the last time you saw me.\u201d She laughed and lovingly rubbed her hand over her contoured belly.</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t acknowledge the woman at all. Too much risk of saying the last time I saw you, you were bouncing on my husband\u2019s dick.</p><p>Sam, one of Deck\u2019s longtime buddies, started talking about some of the crazy stuff they\u2019d gotten away with senior year. Georgia listened politely, not remembering those memories with such fondness.</p><p>When Deck\u2019s friends started chiming in, talking about RJ, Tell discreetly pushed her to the edge of the group to make their escape. And he didn\u2019t stop moving until they were hidden by the bleachers.</p><p>He framed her face in his hands. \u201cYou all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I really am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let\u2019s fuck up Sally\u2019s seating chart. I see my buddies are here. Or is there a group you\u2019d rather sit with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust you. But we need to save a seat for Stephanie.\u201d</p><p>They shared a table with Thurman, Leah and Warner, Roxanne and Ned, and Stephanie, who\u2019d brought Len Allen, the president of the chess club. Now the guy looked like he could be president of the steroid club.</p><p>Leah and Roxanne were surprisingly friendly, and had both her and Stephanie laughing at the stories about the hair and nail salon they co-owned. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she turned to say thanks to Tell for bringing her another drink, he was a kiss away.</p><p>The kiss, while short, was shockingly possessive. As was the hand sliding up her thigh. The man just smirked at her, silently daring her to move his hand, because guaranteed, he\u2019d slide it up higher.</p><p>Every time Tell looked at her with heat in his eyes, she felt the answering fire ignite her blood. And Tell didn\u2019t care if everyone else noticed. The connection between them was getting stronger, despite Georgia reminding herself it was just sex.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re setting up the buffet,\u201d Tell said.</p><p>\u201cThink it\u2019s better than cafeteria food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not. Think Sally will act like the grumpy old lunch lady, Miz Farnsworth, and dismiss us table by table to get in the chow line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably. She was a control freak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo let\u2019s freak her out and cut to the front of the line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a bad influence on me, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He whispered, \u201cAdmit the good girl in you always wanted a bad boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd lucky me, now I\u2019ve got one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least for the rest of tonight, right?\u201d</p><p>That off-the-cuff comment left her a little unsettled. Like this was the last night they\u2019d be together.</p><p>Isn\u2019t that what you wanted? A date to the reunion and hot sex?</p> <p>Maybe at first. But everything had changed in the last week. Or at least since the night Tell had shown up on her doorstep after his nephew\u2019s birth, so sweet and vulnerable. Then so unbelievably hot and forceful during their sexy romp in the backyard. Although she\u2019d known Tell was okay to drive home, she still called him to make sure he\u2019d arrived safely, and they\u2019d ended up talking for another hour.</p><p>Then they\u2019d yakked on the phone for several hours the following night, during Tell\u2019s last-minute trek to Casper to stay with Landon overnight. As much as she admired his dedication to his family, she couldn\u2019t help but suspect his family took advantage of his good nature and willingness to always lend a hand.</p><p>Wednesday night they\u2019d met at the Golden Boot for a night of dancing and managed to stay through the band\u2019s first set. But they were so desperate for a physical connection, they hadn\u2019t even made it onto the bed in her room; Tell had taken her on the floor. Dragging out the passionate encounter until they were both soaked in sweat, shaking and sated.</p><p>She would\u2019ve been happy curled up on the couch with Tell watching a movie Thursday night, but he had other see and be seen plans. Fun plans. A scavenger hunt picnic, where they picked up a food item from each restaurant in town and ate it at the park. Followed by an obstacle course race on the playground\u2014which he\u2019d won. Then dropping by the bingo hall for a game of bingo\u2014which she\u2019d won. And ending the evening with them jockeying for position for who got to be on top in her bed. They\u2019d both won that one.</p><p>Georgia found him incredibly easy to be with. The thought of this ending, just as it\u2019d gotten started, gave her a tiny feeling of loss. But she wouldn\u2019t push him for more, especially since he hadn\u2019t brought up extending their agreement.</p><p>She\u2019d enjoy it\u2014and him\u2014while she could.</p><p>After a bit she excused herself and headed to the restroom. Unlike high school, there wasn\u2019t a line of girls gossiping at the mirror. She checked her makeup, smoothed her dress and walked down the hallway.</p><p>Straight into Deck.</p> <p>She attempted to sidestep him, but he blocked her. As she looked up at him, she experienced a punch of bitterness that she\u2019d wasted part of her life on this man. Being this close to him again, Georgia was hard-pressed to remember any happy memories. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>Deck loomed over her. \u201cBet you think you\u2019re clever, showing up here in front of the whole class, like you\u2019ve got a real thing going on with McKay. But I know better. It\u2019s all bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stopped giving a shit a long time ago about what you think, Deck, not to mention not caring what anyone else thinks. I am with Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 loser. Always has been, always will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what sticks in your craw, isn\u2019t it? Were you afraid I might act on that attraction to him back in high school and I\u2019d figure out you weren\u2019t half the man you pretended to be?\u201d</p><p>A mean smile distorted his mouth. \u201cYou were only trying to make me jealous back then and you remember exactly how I handled shit like that.\u201d</p><p>With his fists.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to make me jealous. Guess what, Georgie? It ain\u2019t workin\u2019. Tara-Lee is my life now. You\u2019re nothin\u2019 but a memory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you follow me out here?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat does it matter that I know how much you adore your wife? I\u2019m nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re jealous that life could\u2019ve been yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould\u2019ve been a little crowded, with Tara-Lee in our bed and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daddy would be so ashamed of your crude mouth, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stopped being my daddy when he became yours.\u201d Why had she blurted that out?</p><p>Deck gave her that mean smile again. \u201cSee? You are jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m heartsick that my father accepted you as a substitute for RJ.\u201d</p><p>He stepped back as if she\u2019d slapped him.</p><p>Good.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, darlin\u2019? Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Deck looked over her shoulder at Tell approaching her from behind. \u201cDon\u2019t get your jock in a twist, McKay. She\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make that determination since she ain\u2019t your concern anymore,\u201d Tell said evenly. \u201cYou probably better get back inside anyway, bein\u2019s your baby mama is lookin\u2019 for you.\u201d</p><p>Giving them both another scowl, Deck retreated.</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t have time to say anything before Tell took her hand, leading her deeper into the bowels of the school. \u201cThe reunion is the other direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Which is why we\u2019re goin\u2019 this way.\u201d They cut through the hallway to the main floor. As soon as they reached the locker bay, he crowded her against the cool metal, bracing his hands by her head. \u201cI imagined doin\u2019 something like this every damn day for almost three years. Since the very first time I saw you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImagined what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPressing you up against the locker and kissing the livin\u2019 hell out of you.\u201d Then Tell lowered his mouth and did just that. Turning her anger into passion. Passion he could coax forth with just the touch of his lips to hers.</p><p>The potent kiss hit her like a fifth of Scotch.</p><p>He broke the kiss and buried his face in her neck. His hot breath teased the damp skin and she shivered.</p><p>\u201cDid reality live up to the teen hype?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWay better.\u201d A grinning Tell stepped back and grabbed her hand. \u201cCome on. I have another fun idea.\u201d He towed her behind him through the hallway, stopping in front of room 226.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Wall\u2019s classroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>Butterflies took wing in her belly when Tell asked, \u201cHow adventurous are you feelin\u2019, Miss Hotchkiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember you said that.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>He propelled Georgia into the room and shut and locked the door.</p><p>\u201cI had at least one class with you every year, throughout high school. And every one of those years I had a fantasy of some sort about you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did these fantasies of yours include, Mr. McKay?\u201d</p><p>He ran the backs of his knuckles over her jawline, tempted as always by her soft skin. \u201cTypical teenage guy stuff. Groping. Kissing. More groping. You whispering in my ear what a stud I was, because I didn\u2019t have a freakin\u2019 clue about sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that your fantasies about me were innocent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack then? Yep. But now that I\u2019ve got the experience... Well, I\u2019ll remind you that I ain\u2019t exactly tame these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou willing to do a little play actin\u2019 with me? Takin\u2019 a trip back in time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRevisiting history class. Senior year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Georgia smiled and fingered the ends of his bolo tie. \u201cLose the sport coat and the hat. The you from ten years ago wouldn\u2019t have worn those to class.\u201d</p><p>Hot damn.</p><p>Tell took his seat, his heart pounding ridiculously hard. \u201cStart at the front of the classroom and walk to your desk like you always did.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wandered up to the front of the classroom. She took her time reading a laminated sign. Then she walked to the other side of the chalkboard and studied the fire escape route and building layout placards.</p><p>Tell was getting antsy. He almost called out to hurry up, but he realized this was part of the game. Every day he\u2019d been in his seat early, waiting for that first glimpse of her as she sashayed into the room. On game days, she\u2019d worn the super short, super tight cheerleading uniform. He\u2019d always loved game day.</p><p>Georgia took her seat, not looking at him at all. No different than when they\u2019d been in class together. She tossed her head and the aroma of her hair wafted back to him.</p><p>That sweet blast from the past hit his lungs and traveled straight to his groin.</p><p>Then Georgia stretched her arms above her head and released a soft groan. Twisting her upper body sent her hair flowing back and forth, as mesmerizing as a pendulum.</p><p>Years before, he\u2019d been too afraid to touch her. But he wasn\u2019t now. Keeping his hand as light as a helium balloon, he stroked that black silk. So tempting to twine his fingers through it and tug to get her attention. But he reminded himself that Hot Lips never paid him any mind unless she wanted something from him.</p><p>She turned in her chair to face him, gifting him with her megawatt grin. \u201cTell McKay. Just the man I needed. I\u2019m hoping you can help me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe assignment. I didn\u2019t get my homework done because I was up late cleaning stalls, since we\u2019ve got four horses set to foal at any time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I need to copy yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease? Just this once. I promise I won\u2019t ask again.\u201d</p><p>Dammit. Tell remembered how easily she charmed, tempted and cajoled him into doing whatever she wanted.</p><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to make this easy on her. He leaned forward and murmured, \u201cJust this once has been ten times over the course of the year.\u201d</p><p>Her haughty look was hot as hell. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were keeping track.\u201d</p><p>Tell shrugged. \u201cI just think it\u2019s time I got something in return for helpin\u2019 you out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think I want?\u201d he countered.</p><p>Georgia trailed her fingertips across his rough knuckles. \u201cI never noticed how large your hands are. I think you want to put these hands all over me.\u201d</p><p>He quickly wrapped his fingers around her wrist. \u201cWrong. I want a kiss. Not a peck on the mouth. A real kiss. With tongue and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She bit her lip. \u201cI can meet you after school.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cRight here, right now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t it wait?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know you. You\u2019ll have second thoughts just like you did with the project. So if you want to copy my homework, you\u2019ll let me taste my fill of them hot lips. Right now.\u201d</p><p>Desire flashed in her eyes. But she still played the game. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get busted for a PDA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe teacher ain\u2019t here.\u201d Tell brought her palm to his mouth and placed a kiss in the center. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t give a shit what anyone else says or thinks.\u201d</p><p>She finally sighed. \u201cFine. Pucker up. The bell is about to ring.\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cNot so fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome closer.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia complied with just enough trepidation to make it believable.</p><p>They met in the middle of his desk. The angle was a bit awkward, but this was how he\u2019d imagined it.</p><p>Her lips were so full and ripe he ached to take a bite. He skimmed his mouth over hers, catching the edges of her upper and lower lips with the soft, smooth inside of his. Letting the moist undersides cling together before following the contour with a painstakingly slow glide.</p><p>Her breath came in short bursts, mingling with his measured exhalations. When he swept the tip of his tongue across the seam of her lips, she moaned, opening for him fully.</p><p>Tell curled his hand around her neck, taking possession of her mouth. His tongue warred with hers; every swirling stroke kicked his need higher. Each suck, each lick, each slide of wet lips urged him to drag her out of the seat. Urged him to press and grind their bodies together.</p><p>When she eased back, he focused his attention on the section of her throat where her pulse jumped. He could feel her body vibrating, and he realized the kiss had shaken her as much as it had him.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia.\u201d His teeth scraped her throat. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. Yes. Don\u2019t stop doing that.\u201d</p><p>As many times as he had imagined this scenario as a seventeen-year-old boy, he hadn\u2019t choreographed the logistics. He didn\u2019t want to bend her over. He wanted to look in her eyes as he slid home. The student desks were too small and unstable for what he had in mind.</p><p>But the teacher\u2019s desk was perfect.</p><p>\u201cBaby, we gotta move.\u201d</p><p>She attempted to smooth her hair back into place as she slid out from the desk.</p><p>He laughed and hauled her close. \u201cYour hair is gonna look a whole lot messier by the time I get done with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. I don\u2019t know about this.\u201d She squirmed out of his hold and started backing away from him.</p><p>He stalked her. \u201cYou drive me outta my fuckin\u2019 mind, Georgia Hotchkiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should sneak out and do it in your truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta get it through that pretty head of yours that I\u2019m gonna have you. My way. Now.\u201d Tell had let her retreat until she\u2019d literally backed herself into a corner. He slapped his hands on the chalkboard beside her head.</p><p>Just as he leaned closer, she snaked her arms around his neck, and stole the kiss from him. Her body movements were porn-star-worthy as she made those fucking needy little moans.</p><p>He had years\u2019 worth of fantasies revolving around him and Georgia alone in a classroom, but dragging this out wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cAre you wet for me?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cSopping wet,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019da thought such a pretty mouth could be so dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me dirty.\u201d She nuzzled his neck. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted you for so long. So, so long.\u201d Her tongue zigzagged back up to his ear. \u201cFuck me, Tell McKay. Fuck me now. No one ever has to know.\u201d</p><p>A primitive growl was the only sound he could manage. He held on to her biceps as he pulled her away from the chalkboard and spun her toward the desk. He kicked the chair aside, releasing her only long enough to sweep all the papers off the surface, just like in that teenage fantasy.</p><p>She emitted an eep of surprise as he picked her up and set her on the surface. Her heated gaze met his when he unbuckled his belt.</p><p>\u201cPull that dress out of my way.\u201d</p><p>The fabric clung to her thighs as she inched the dress up to her hips. She twisted a finger in the elastic band of her silver thong. \u201cYou want me to take these off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He watched with his damn tongue hanging out as she whisked that scrap of satin down her trembling legs, then fingered herself with a soft moan of delight.</p><p>Then he was wedged between her thighs. Condom on, he lightly pushed her shoulders with a murmured, \u201cLie back.\u201d Soon as she was, he slid into her. Easily. Fully. He slanted over her, taking her mouth the same way he took her body. With unrestrained passion.</p><p>Georgia arched; her tits bounced into his chest with his every aggressive thrust.</p><p>Everything spun into a vortex of pleasure: the tight clasp of her pussy, the sound of his flesh slapping hers, the taste of her mouth and the need building between them with every stroke.</p><p>She broke the kiss first. \u201cI need...more.\u201d</p><p>Curling his hands around the steep angle of her high heels, he brought her knees above her hips and spread her wider. Fucking her harder, deeper. \u201cLike that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019m sliding around too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on to me.\u201d</p><p>She reached up, grabbing his biceps.</p><p>\u201cGod, I fuckin\u2019 love it when you dig your nails into me,\u201d he panted.</p><p>Gasping, she rocked her hips into his every thrust.</p><p>\u201cLook at you. So damn hot. So much better than any fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. Please. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>He repositioned his pelvis so he connected with her clit every time he plunged to the root.</p><p>\u201cSo close. So...\u201d A long moan flowed from her mouth as she unraveled. Completely. Her body arched and her face became lost in pleasure. He couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from Georgia, beautiful in abandoning herself to passion, to the moment, to him.</p><p>Tell wasn\u2019t far behind. He pumped into her three more times and he was done. His eyes rolled into the back of his head as her cunt clamped down and milked him dry.</p><p>Holy fuck. He opened his eyes and saw Georgia was still as out of it as he was. He ditched the condom and had his pants buckled before she stirred. When he ran his hand up the inside of her thigh, she flinched. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>Georgia wore a dreamy smile as she stretched her arms above her head. \u201cI feel like an ungrounded wire. In a good way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I gathered.\u201d Tell snuck another kiss. This one sweet and lazy. He rested his forehead on hers. \u201cThank you. That was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm-hmm. I\u2019m still feeling a little dizzy. A shot of you is so heady.\u201d Her fingertips outlined his face from his temples to his jawline. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must look well fucked. You think anyone will suspect what we\u2019ve been up to?\u201d</p><p>I hope so.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou are so transparent, McKay. You want me waltzing into the gym with my hair a mess, my dress wrinkled, my grin ten miles wide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusted.\u201d He slipped on his sport coat and watched as she fussed with her dress and her hair. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d Georgia started toward the door.</p><p>Staring at her backside, he muttered, \u201cShit. Wait a second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. You have chalk marks on your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d She tried to look over her shoulder at her butt.</p><p>\u201cHang on. I\u2019ll brush them off.\u201d As he swatted, he noticed the perfect bounce in those round cheeks.</p><p>He had a flash of spanking her ass until those cheeks were pink and hot. Usually he kept his fun-loving persona at the forefront when he took a woman to bed. But sometimes he\u2019d wanted more. Not a longer connection but a more intimate one. He\u2019d finally had the guts to show his intense side to Georgia and she liked his sexual demands. He wondered how far she\u2019d let him take it.</p><p>\u201cSo, are you about done smacking my ass, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>Tell pinned her back to his chest. \u201cAnd if I say no?\u201d He nuzzled her ear. \u201cIf I admitted my other fantasy was tyin\u2019 you up and spanking your butt until you came, would you be willing to give it a go?\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched. It took a few long seconds before she answered. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have to obsess about it beforehand. If we\u2019re in a moment...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I decided that\u2019s what I wanted from you in that moment? You\u2019d be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He growled, \u201cYou\u2019ve been a naughty girl, Miz Hotchkiss, getting fucked in the classroom. That behavior is against school policy and will result in a trip to the principal\u2019s office for proper punishment.\u201d</p><p>She peered over her shoulder. \u201cPrincipal McMasters kept a paddle in his office.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA bare hand is a much better instrument than a paddle for spankings anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn instrument of what?

Where you been?\u201d Stephanie asked.</p><p>\u201cWe toured the school. You know, reliving old memories.\u201d He grinned when Georgia smacked his knee under the table. \u201cWhy? What\u2019d we miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fucking limbo contest, if you can believe it,\u201d Roxanne grumbled. \u201cWho did the planning for this event? Chuck E. Cheese?\u201d</p><p>Georgia choked on her drink.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder no one wanted to help Sally. And can you believe she tried to assign us seats?\u201d</p><p>Stephanie leaned across the table. \u201cI had a run-in with Sally. I told her if she pulled a bitch move and tried to get you and Deck to dance together as the class couple, I would make myself projectile barf all over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for having my back, Stephanie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>The dancing ended and Sally took the stage to hand out the decade awards.</p><p>And just like high school, the awards were stupid, dragged on way too long and were handed to the popular crowd. With the exception of Georgia. Her face was a blank mask so Tell had no idea what she was thinking.</p> <p>\u201cThe award for most changed goes to...Tell McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. Really?\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cTell, you have to go up there,\u201d Georgia said.</p><p>He drained his beer before heading to the podium.</p><p>Sally gave him a hug and the small trophy. He started toward the stairs, but someone yelled, \u201cSpeech!\u201d</p><p>Fuck. He hated talking in front of people. \u201cI, ah, think everyone in this room deserves a trophy, because it\u2019d be a sad freakin\u2019 thing if we all stayed the same people we were in high school.\u201d He walked off to meager applause.</p><p>\u201cNow we look back on the classmates we lost.\u201d The first picture on the screen behind the stage was of Matt Wilson, who\u2019d died in combat in Iraq.</p><p>Sally went on about all that Matt had accomplished before his death. She called Matt\u2019s widow to the stage for a memorial plaque from the class.</p> <p>The second picture on the screen was of RJ Hotchkiss.</p><p>Georgia tensed, but there wasn\u2019t a perceptible change in her expression. When Tell noticed everyone in the room looked for her, he reached under the table and set his hand on her knee.</p><p>Sally talked briefly about RJ, mostly about his life because his death wasn\u2019t noble. Then she called Georgia to accept the memorial plaque.</p><p>She didn\u2019t budge.</p><p>Tell squeezed her leg. \u201cGeorgia. You have to go up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. Go on now. I\u2019ll be right here when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>Georgia walked toward the stage like she was facing an executioner. She let Sally give her a stiff hug and she read the plaque before she glanced up at the crowd.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be nine years on August third since I lost my twin brother, my best friend, the person who meant the most to me in the world. I know you all remember RJ as the guy with the perpetual smile. The guy who lived for a dare. The guy with a larger-than-life personality. I remember him as all those things too. But he was so much more. I miss him every day and I wish...\u201d Georgia looked at the plaque, her hair falling forward to obscure her face.</p><p>When her shoulders started to shake and Sally made no move to comfort her like she had Matt Wilson\u2019s widow, Tell was on his feet, his heart in his throat. He couldn\u2019t stomach seeing her standing up there alone, forced into public grief.</p><p>He scaled the steps, sidestepped Sally and stood in front of Georgia, blocking her from the room. \u201cGeorgia. Come on, sweetness, I gotcha.\u201d</p><p>Georgia peered up at him. \u201cPlease get me out of here.\u201d</p><p>He tucked her into the side of his body as they left the stage. Stephanie intercepted them with Georgia\u2019s purse and they made their way out the door.</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t stop until he reached his pickup. He dropped the tailgate and lifted her into his arms. Then he sat, holding her tightly as her body shook.</p><p>Her voice was whisper-thin when she finally spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d He kissed the top of her head. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>She\u2019d cried. In front of a room full of people.</p><p>Most of them had probably been happy to see her break down. They probably thought she deserved misery in her life after leading such a supposedly charmed existence.</p><p>The memory of RJ complaining he never won anything had hit her as she\u2019d accepted the award. There was no irony in that, only sadness.</p><p>And then Tell had been there. Rescuing her. Going above and beyond. Showing her yet another facet of his personality\u2014a protective side. She\u2019d only scratched the surface in getting to know the man he\u2019d become and she wanted so much more than the small glimpse she\u2019d had the past two weeks.</p><p>Before he started the truck, he said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d and brought her hand to his mouth for a gentle kiss.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you for...\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to think back on the awards they gave out senior year right before graduation. RJ was so bummed he hadn\u2019t won class troublemaker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t for lack of tryin\u2019,\u201d Tell muttered.</p><p>The hair on the back of her neck prickled. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Tell shifted in his seat.</p><p>What was up with his guilty look? \u201cSomething you wanna share with the class, Mr. McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, but I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t let it go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right about that, especially if it has something to do with my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does.\u201d He ran his hand through his hair. \u201cYou know me\u2019n RJ had shop together senior year? We were partnered during the sheet metal unit. RJ came up with the idea to make an animal trap. We worked on that sucker for a week and grumpy Mr. Krystanski gave us a D on it, citing a design flaw. So RJ decided we should prove Mr. K wrong by trapping an animal in our new, improved cage and showing him that it did work.\u201d</p><p>Georgia stared at him. \u201cYou and my brother were responsible for letting the skunks loose in the school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. The mama skunk and her four babies were in the cage the night we snuck it into the classroom. So when we saw the cage was empty the next morning...we had no idea what\u2019d happened. Mr. K never said a word and me\u2019n RJ chalked it up to a failed prank...until a few days later\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the entire school reeked like skunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, we had no way of knowin\u2019 the mama skunk had escaped and took her litter into the ductwork. By then, no way could we come clean, since they had to rip out the ceiling to free the skunk family and neither of us wanted to pay for the damage.\u201d</p><p>She smirked. \u201cSo Mr. K was right? Your trap had a design flaw since the skunks escaped?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOr someone let them loose. \u201c</p><p>\u201cAnd which one of you initially rounded up the skunks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a joint effort after I told RJ I\u2019d stumbled across a nest. The buggers are cute when they\u2019re little. But the mama was pissed we were touchin\u2019 them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she spray you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of us.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wrinkled her nose. \u201cI don\u2019t remember RJ coming home smelling like skunk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because we snuck into the showers at the truck stop and cleaned ourselves up. Hell, I think we even tossed our clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one ever knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Me\u2019n RJ swore we\u2019d take the secret to our graves.\u201d Tell went motionless after he said that. \u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t thinkin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>She leaned across the seat, bussing his cheek, feeling an odd kinship with him for the secret he\u2019d shared with her brother. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m pretty sure RJ won\u2019t mind that you told me.\u201d</p><p>He rested his forehead against hers. \u201cYou ready to go to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you have ice cream. Because I\u2019m in the mood to eat ice cream and wallow in front of the TV.\u201d</p><p>Tell grinned. \u201cI have such a bad sweet tooth that I have four different kinds of ice cream.\u201d</p><p>They didn\u2019t speak on the drive to Tell\u2019s trailer. When they started down the long driveway, Georgia realized she hadn\u2019t brought other clothes. \u201cYou\u2019ve got an extra T-shirt I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But it\u2019s gonna cost you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCost me what?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond until he\u2019d parked. He faced her with a lascivious grin. \u201cTwo things are gonna happen if you borrow one of my shirts. One, you don\u2019t get to wear a bra. Two, I can ask for my shirt back at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means I\u2019ll be naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you leave them sexy panties on.\u201d He smirked. \u201cUnless they\u2019re in my way and then they\u2019re gone too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this your way of distracting me?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He touched her face. \u201cOne of the ways I\u2019ve got planned for tonight.\u201d</p><p>She bit back a girly sigh.</p><p>It was stuffy inside. As Tell started opening windows, Georgia looked around. The space was as tidy as the last time she\u2019d been here.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll cool down fast, but we might wanna sit outside until it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to dish up the ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better ditch that sexy dress first so you don\u2019t spill on it. Hang tight. I\u2019ll be back with something for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>She wandered to the kitchen and opened the cupboards, looking for bowls. Why did she have a pang of sadness at seeing his meager selection of dishware? He had five mismatched dinner plates, four mismatched salad plates and three mismatched bowls. The plastic bowls were adorned with characters from animated movies: Cars, Finding Nemo and Toy Story. The selection of glassware followed those same lines: four Tupperware plastic glasses from the 1980s, a few small, plastic Happy Meal cups, three beer mugs, two wineglasses and four coffee cups. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What did it say about her that her cupboards looked like his? She\u2019d left everything behind when she left Deck, except for one suitcase full of clothes and one box of personal items. When she got her own place, purchasing matching dishes and household items hadn\u2019t mattered. Sort of pathetic that she\u2019d never cooked for anyone in her condo in Dallas besides her mother.</p><p>As busy as Tell\u2019s social life was, it didn\u2019t appear that extended to his home.</p><p>Strong arms hauled her back against a broad, hard chest. \u201cDidja find anything interesting while you were snooping in my cupboards?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. But I am wondering if I\u2019ll have to fight you for the Toy Story bowl. Woody is my favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a woody for you,\u201d he breathed in her ear.</p><p>Georgia faced him, noticing he\u2019d changed into a tight black tank top and athletic shorts. \u201cYour woody will have to wait. I\u2019m fixated on ice cream right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019d better get you outta this dress. Does it come off over your head? Or drop to the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the floor.\u201d</p> <p>Tell slipped his fingers beneath the fabric above her cleavage and followed the neckline to her shoulders. He peeled it down her arms and tugged the dress over her breasts and hips until it pooled at her feet.</p><p>Then he unhooked her bra. But this time the tease wasn\u2019t in how slowly he removed it, but what those clever fingers were doing to her nipples after her bra was gone.</p><p>She stayed still, although the way he was touching her made it damn difficult.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cHands up.\u201d</p><p>A super soft, super large T-shirt dropped over her head. The hem grazed her knee. \u201cI could wear this as a dress. Except for this part.\u201d The deep V-cut of the neckline would reveal both her breasts if she bent over.</p><p>\u201cI happen to like that aspect of the design.\u201d Tell pulled the fabric to the left, exposing the hardened nipple. He bent his head, pressing a soft kiss on the tip, before he straightened the shirt. \u201cYou\u2019re distracting me, woman. I\u2019m supposed to be givin\u2019 you ice cream choices.\u201d He retreated to the freezer. \u201cLooks like...rocky road, butterscotch ripple, cookie dough or chocolate and caramel swirl.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA scoop of chocolate and caramel swirl and a scoop of rocky road, please.\u201d</p><p>Tell dished up two identical bowls and handed her one with a spoon. \u201cYou wanna sit outside on the back deck? It\u2019s a beautiful night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d</p><p>They sat at a small wooden picnic table. It was too dark to see the view beyond the fence line, but she remembered the McKay Ranch had diverse vistas. \u201cHow long have you lived here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little over a year. This used to be Brandt and Jessie\u2019s place. Before that I lived in Luke\u2019s old place. Before that Dalton and I shared a crappy trailer. Now he\u2019s livin\u2019 in Luke\u2019s trailer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like your family plays musical houses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath, divorce and discontent sorta forces it. I think we\u2019re all kinda lazy because we like where the houses are located. Close, but not too close.\u201d</p><p>Georgia let the last bite of chocolate and caramel swirl melt on her tongue. \u201cDo any of you get along with your dad?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome days we all do. But they\u2019re few and far between. I never expected his sobriety would stick. I\u2019m glad it has, because he was killin\u2019 himself. But the really sobering part for all of us? It wasn\u2019t the alcohol that made him a mean, grumpy jackass. Take away the booze? He\u2019s still a mean, grumpy jackass.\u201d</p><p>She threaded her fingers through his.</p><p>Surprisingly, Tell kept talking. \u201cThere are times when I wish he\u2019d just go on a mission trip indefinitely. When he\u2019s not around, I feel guilty as hell for thinkin\u2019 that, then he shows up, still actin\u2019 like the same SOB he always was, minus the blackout-drunk moments. Ever since I was a little kid, the man terrified me. He did all of us. We were all afraid of doin\u2019 something wrong to earn one of them ass-chewings that strip you down to nothin\u2019. Might sound stupid, but after he got done rippin\u2019 into me, I wished he\u2019d taken after me with a switch. At least them marks would heal. The lash of his tongue always hurt far more than a belt.\u201d</p><p>This was the most he\u2019d ever spoken to her of the issues he had with his father. And her heart hurt for him. It got her to thinking... Was a mean father worse than one who preferred a stranger to his own child?</p><p>Tell shoved his bowl aside. \u201cDo Deck and Tara-Lee live with your dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Deck and I lived with my parents until RJ died. When Dad bought the hog farm, we had a small cabin to ourselves on the property. Deck didn\u2019t like it because it was pretty basic, so he stayed in the house. And I didn\u2019t like being in the house with my parents because they fought all the time, so I slept at the cabin. Because Tara-Lee and RJ were supposed to get married that fall, Tara-Lee had already moved in with my folks, so they let her come with us to the new place. I was still in grief, still trying to take college classes. I\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t the most attentive wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t give Deck the right to cheat on you,\u201d Tell said hotly. \u201cFor Christsake, you\u2019d lost your brother, you were forced to move, your parents split up. He shoulda been takin\u2019 care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Evidently my dad didn\u2019t see it that way since he took Deck\u2019s side. When I talked to him last week, he basically defended his actions and Deck\u2019s by telling me nothing is as cut and dried as it looks. He doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t just drive over to his place and we can hug it out.\u201d</p><p>Neither said anything for a few minutes.</p><p>Then Tell stood and held out his hand. \u201cI wanna show you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this more of your forced fun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep and there\u2019s gonna come a day when you don\u2019t dread that word, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Georgia allowed him to lead her down the steps and around the corner of the trailer. A two-person hammock was set up on the rise of a small hill. The ground was rocky and rough\u2014no soft, pampered grass here\u2014and she sucked in a breath when something jabbed the bottom of her foot.</p><p>Tell lifted her into his arms, carrying her the rest of the way.</p><p>As much as she liked being held against his warm, hard chest, she couldn\u2019t help but snicker. \u201cIs this where you call me a tenderfoot?\u201d</p><p>He grunted with exaggeration. \u201cI\u2019m stoically bearing the pain for you, little lady, \u2019cause that\u2019s what us cowboy types do.\u201d He set her down and stretched on the hammock before extending a hand to her.</p><p>It wobbled, but she found a balance point, which placed her right on top of Tell, luckily for her.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect temperature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI crash out here in the summer when it\u2019s too hot to sleep inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you get eaten alive by bugs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. I must not be sweet enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re plenty sweet.\u201d She kissed his pectoral and snuggled into his side.</p><p>Tell shifted to tangle their legs together.</p><p>All the turmoil from the last few hours faded, and a feeling of contentment filled her as he trailed his rough fingertips over her skin.</p><p>After a bit, Tell said, \u201cSo what\u2019s the craziest, riskiest thing you\u2019ve ever done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, there\u2019s gotta be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always done what was expected of me. Either by my parents or by my boss.\u201d Rather than dissect her boring choices, she posed the same question to him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the craziest, riskiest thing you\u2019ve ever done, wild man McKay?\u201d</p><p>He continued stroking the underside of her arm from her wrist to her armpit. \u201cI was tired of bein\u2019 the poor McKay relation. So I took all my money, except for fifty bucks, and entered a poker tournament. I was either gonna go big or go home broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt paid off. I won first place. So I banked half of what I\u2019d won, and used the other half to enter another tournament the next weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Tell chuckled. \u201cI had a winning streak that lasted an entire year. Made a really good chunk of change. Dalton was my partner in crime, so to speak, so we won enough to buy more land to add to our part of the McKay ranch.\u201d</p><p>Georgia raised her head from his chest and looked at him. \u201cGood for you. But now that you\u2019ve told me, a game of strip poker ain\u2019t in the cards for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d win. I\u2019d get you half-nekkid and I\u2019d start thinkin\u2019 raunchy thoughts...\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI like your raunchy mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sweetness, you ain\u2019t seen the raunchiest parts.\u201d He nipped the top of her ear. \u201cYet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still sandbagging tournaments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce in a while. Dalton is still goin\u2019 strong. That runner\u2019s high after winnin\u2019 big is dangerous stuff. But it ain\u2019t like he\u2019s blowing money left and right. We are each other\u2019s checks and balances system, so it didn\u2019t happen to either of us, because we saw so many guys who fell prey to that mindset. Always wanting that next big win. Quarter of a million dollars one week; then they\u2019d lose it all the following week. We treated gambling like a business. Only playing one type of game. Only entering events where the buy-in was high because the payout was high.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, fascinated again by another facet of this man. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because me\u2019n Dalton keep it to ourselves. Brandt knows we won some money because he\u2019s on the land deed. Our cousin Ben knows because we tried to do a business deal with him a year and a half ago, but it fell through. But no one in my family knows and that\u2019s the way we wanna keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t breathe a word, I promise.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI\u2019m boring compared to you. You have this secret life and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tell stopped her protest with a kiss. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After he released her mouth, she rested the side of her face on his chest. He nuzzled the top of her head and continued his caresses on her arm.</p><p>A soft breeze blew. Between the sway of the hammock, the comforting beat of Tell\u2019s heart beneath her ear, and the chirping crickets, Georgia could\u2019ve easily fallen asleep. Being with him like this settled every ragged nerve inside her.</p><p>\u201cYou up for more ice cream?\u201d he murmured a little while later. \u201cBecause one bowl doesn\u2019t count as wallowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. But I am pretty comfy right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could tell, bein\u2019s you were snoring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I did doze off. But I\u2019m blaming you. You\u2019re so easy to be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether I oughta take that as a compliment or not,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>Georgia pecked his pouting lips. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll eat another bowl of ice cream if it\u2019ll make you happy. How do we get out of this contraption?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraddle me.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cNice try, Mr. Insatiable.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and lightly tapped her ass. \u201cI\u2019m serious. You bein\u2019 on my center of gravity will stabilize us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. But if I feel your dick get hard, I can\u2019t be held accountable for attacking you.\u201d She balanced one hand on his shoulder and threw her other leg over his pelvis.</p><p>\u201cToo late. I\u2019m always hard around you. Hang on.\u201d Gripping her hips, Tell twisted and the hammock swung upward as he dropped both feet to the ground. Then he stood, sliding his hands down to cup her ass as he carried her into the house.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to carry me everywhere,\u201d she said halfheartedly.</p><p>\u201cI like it. You\u2019re pocket-size.\u201d He laughed when she drummed her heels into his butt. \u201cBesides, you ain\u2019t wearin\u2019 pants. It\u2019s the least I could do.\u201d</p><p>Tell set her on a kitchen chair. Looking at him now, she understood Mr. Sweet and Funny had taken a powder, leaving Mr. Intense in charge.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna want that shirt back now.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate sped up and a tingle of anticipation rolled through her.</p><p>\u201cAlso, I don\u2019t want you dripping ice cream on your panties, so you\u2019d better take them off too.\u201d</p><p>Once she stood naked before him, he offered a wolfish grin. \u201cI\u2019ll be feeding you. My way. If you don\u2019t stay still, well, darlin\u2019, I\u2019m gonna be forced to tie you up.\u201d</p><p>Her midsection went hot and tight. And wet, a little further south.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now sit in the chair so I can reach all parts of you while I dish up.\u201d</p><p>What the heck did he mean so I can reach all parts of you? Georgia slid her naked, flabby ass to the edge of the seat. But being short, it put her head and her neck at a weird angle. She\u2019d been so busy trying to get herself situated that she hadn\u2019t noticed Tell stood not two feet away, holding a bowl.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna work. Hop up on the table.\u201d</p><p>Although it was still warm in the house, the table surface was cool on her butt. Her legs dangled over the edge and she braced her hands behind her.</p><p>When she saw the flour sack dishtowel in Tell\u2019s hand, she said, \u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d with just a little trepidation.</p><p>\u201cTo keep your arms outta my way. \u2019Cause I have the feeling this is gonna make you a little jumpy.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t fidget as he bound her, but her body was hyperaware of his. Then he ran his fingertips up the outside of her arms, over her shoulders, stopping to cup her face in his hands.</p><p>\u201cReady for your ice cream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmm. Yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen up.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes after he spooned in the first bite of butterscotch ripple. The creamy goodness slid down her throat.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. Eyes on me.\u201d</p><p>She gazed at him as he slipped the spoon into her mouth. As soon as she swallowed, Tell\u2019s lips were on hers; his tongue was diving into her mouth. The shock of his warm tongue against her cold one, the sweet taste of the ice cream and the familiar taste of Tell had her moaning. She wanted to curl her hand around the back of his neck, holding him in place as she lapped up every bit of this new taste combo, but her hands were out of commission. So when Tell broke the kiss, she whimpered.</p><p>\u201cTake another bite before it melts.\u201d He fed her three bites, hungrily watching her mouth as she licked her lips. After the next spoonful, he kissed her again. Talk about melting. Hot and cold. Sweet and intense.</p><p>Keeping his lust-filled blue eyes on hers, he held the spoon at chin level. He tipped the spoon to the side and ice cream dribbled on her breast, sliding down the center of her chest.</p><p>She gasped.</p><p>\u201cOops. Looks like I\u2019ll be havin\u2019 a taste too.\u201d His tongue started at the bottom of the drip and he slowly licked up, savoring her ice-cream-flavored skin.</p><p>With the way Tell stood between her thighs, he had to know how wet this was making her.</p><p>The next pass, he used the end of the spoon to paint her lips with ice cream. Then he licked and nibbled, teasing her endlessly with mouth-on-mouth action, but denying her a full-blown kiss.</p><p>Talk about erotic. He\u2019d feed her a bite. Then he\u2019d hold the spoon just out of her reach and angle it, so the thick droplets never landed in the same place on her body twice. And only once on her nipple.</p><p>But he cleaned off every last speck of melted ice cream. Suckling to the point that she started to shake. Inside. Outside.</p><p>Georgia was damn close to begging.</p><p>And he knew it.</p><p>Then he hooked his foot around the chair, bringing it to the table, sitting so close her crotch was right in his face.</p><p>Her entire body flushed at the intense way he stared at the most intimate part of her.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn, you look so pretty like this.\u201d He traced her slit from the top of her pubic bone down to her entrance. \u201cJudging by how wet you are, you must really like ice cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell. Please.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at her, desire burning in his eyes. \u201cOh. Sorry. I\u2019m bein\u2019 selfish. Did you want another bite?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t mind if I finish it off?\u201d</p><p>Dear God. She would not survive this. Would. Not. Survive.</p><p>Georgia was helpless to do anything but watch as Tell used one hand to pull back the skin surrounding her clit. Then he took the spoon out of the ice cream dish and placed the cold metal directly on that swollen flesh.</p><p>Her body jerked and she yelled, \u201cSweet Jesus, that\u2019s cold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Huh. Imagine that. Lemme warm it up for you.\u201d He removed the spoon and placed his mouth over the spot.</p><p>His hot, wet, sucking mouth.</p><p>But he only sucked briefly. He switched it up and licked her pussy as if he were eating an ice cream cone. One long lap after another. Then he nuzzled the inside of her thigh...and again reached for the spoon.</p><p>\u201cOh. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes. \u2019Cause you don\u2019t know how much I love me some sweet, sticky cream.\u201d Tell coated the back of the spoon with more melted butterscotch swirl. Except this time, he squeezed her nipple as he placed the spoon on her clit.</p><p>Georgia bowed back as if he\u2019d attached jumper cables to her body. Every pulse point screamed for release. Even her toes were twitchy. Her mind was focused on one thing: must come.</p><p>Tell left the spoon in place, rubbing the curve over the sensitive nub until the metal warmed from her body heat.</p><p>This was torture.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze winged to his. He exposed her swollen clitoris. He lowered the spoon, tilting it so the drop of ice cream landed right on her clit.</p><p>This time, she screamed. One more drop and she\u2019d explode.</p><p>And like he\u2019d read her mind, he poised the spoon higher above her sex. When he tipped it, the droplet hung in the air, falling in slow motion. When that icy drop connected with her hot button, she started to come.</p><p>Then Tell\u2019s hot mouth was there, sucking on her ice-cream-cooled clit. Tonguing her through an orgasm of epic proportions. When the powerful climax ended, she floated down to the table like a butterfly.</p><p>Her butterfly haze didn\u2019t last long.</p><p>Tell pulled her up by her shoulders and put his mouth on her ear. \u201cI need to fuck you, Georgia. Given how hard I am, it\u2019s gonna be short.</p><p>But not sweet.</p><p>He flipped her over on her belly. Something soft and nubby kept her hips from digging into the edge of the table. With her hands bound and her feet unable to touch the floor, Georgia was completely at Tell\u2019s mercy.</p><p>Callused hands lifted her butt higher. Then the head of his cock nudged her wet center and he snapped his hips, driving into her at full throttle. \u201cCome for me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. The last one\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can feel it, baby, it\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>He bottomed out on his next thrust and she almost lost her mind. He fucked her so hard the table moved. He fucked her so hard each fast stroke was like a mini-orgasm\u2014the head of his cock scraped her G-spot and then immediately connected with her cervix, making her pussy muscles repeatedly spasm around his thick shaft.</p><p>On the next plunge, Tell roared his release. The frantic pumping of his hips slowed and stopped, although he maintained a firm grip on the outside of her thighs, as if he needed something solid to hold him up.</p><p>Georgia felt the hard wall of his chest and stomach when he layered his body over hers.</p><p>His breathing was ragged. His body shook. Heady stuff that she affected this man this way.</p><p>\u201cBaby. You... Wow. That...\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cThere are no words for what that was.\u201d</p><p>Such a sweet, hot man. She turned her head and kissed the corner of his mouth. \u201cFor me too. But cowboy, I think my arms are numb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. Sorry.\u201d He stood and pulled out slowly. When he tried to set her on her feet, her knees buckled.</p><p>\u201cWhoa, darlin\u2019. Hang on. I gotcha.\u201d Tell swept her into his arms and headed to his bedroom.</p><p>She rested her face against his neck, still happily muddled from the hour-long\u2014or so it seemed\u2014orgasm. He held her closely against his strong body. She felt his erratic pulse beneath her lips and tasted the salt on his skin. Everything about him was so devastatingly masculine. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He gently set her on the edge of his bed and reached around to undo the towel. As soon as he freed her, he massaged her wrists, forearms and biceps. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Tired.\u201d She rubbed her mouth on the dark hair bisecting his torso from his chest hair to his groin. He smelled so good right there. All warm, musky male.</p><p>\u201cStop tempting me to go another round with you tonight, woman.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you could, couldn\u2019t you? Go another round.\u201d</p><p>Tell tipped her chin up to peer into her face. \u201cThat\u2019s the sex-drunk part of you talking.\u201d He brushed his thumb over her lower lip. \u201cBut yeah. All I have to do is look at you and I want you.\u201d</p><p>This man could undo her on more levels than she had brain power to contemplate.</p><p>\u201cGood to know. But you wore me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo crash. It\u2019s been a long night. I\u2019m draggin\u2019 ass myself.\u201d He pulled the sheets back for her and she crawled in.</p> <p>As she nestled her head into the pillow and drifted off, she wondered if she should ask him what happened next, not only tomorrow, but next week and in the next month, now that the reunion was over.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Georgia woke up alone. Not the first time that\u2019d happened when she spent the night at Tell\u2019s place. The man had to get up at the crack of dawn every morning\u2014didn\u2019t matter if it was the weekend.</p><p>A soft breeze wafted through the bedroom window. She rolled onto her stomach, stretching out on the cool sheets that smelled like Tell. She\u2019d never paid much attention to a man\u2019s scent before, but his was so distinctive\u2014sunshine, salty musk, the subtle aroma of laundry soap and a hint of lime shaving cream.</p><p>Mmm. She wondered if his scent would linger on her skin all day. There was incentive not to jump in the shower. Maybe if she remained naked, when Tell returned, he could rub that scent all over her body again.</p><p>She was imagining Tell\u2019s very inventive ways of waking her up, when voices drifted down the hallway. She rolled and jackknifed, clutching the sheet to her bare chest. Who was here at\u2014she squinted at the alarm clock\u2014nine thirty on a Sunday morning? She listened. She couldn\u2019t discern the words, but she made out two distinct male voices.</p> <p>Relax. Probably just one of his brothers.</p><p>Wasn\u2019t like she could go out and meet the fam. She\u2019d have to stay put because her only clothing was the fancy dress she\u2019d worn last night. A dress that Tell had thoughtfully draped over the chair. When had he done that?</p><p>Was it a prompt for her to get dressed? Since he\u2019d also set her underwear, bra, shoes and purse on the dresser\u2014directly in her line of sight.</p><p>Her doubts from last night pushed front and center.</p><p>What happened now? He\u2019d taken her to the reunion; she\u2019d lined up judging gigs for him. Technically they\u2019d each gotten what they wanted. Tell hadn\u2019t mentioned wanting more.</p><p>Neither have you.</p><p>So what were her options?</p><p>Crawl back in bed and yank the covers over her head?</p> <p>Get dressed and face the day\u2014and Tell?</p><p>Option two won out.</p><p>When she entered the kitchen, Tell didn\u2019t hug her or kiss her. In fact, he didn\u2019t even get up from his seat at the table. He just gave her a once-over and a small smile. \u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is my brother Dalton.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze winged between the two men. Same dark hair, same blue eyes. Dalton had rugged features where Tell\u2019s were sharply defined. Dalton was a big guy\u2014he had a couple inches on Tell and thirty pounds\u2014all muscle, from the looks of it. Most likely Dalton had the same shit-eating grin as his older brother. But there was no sign of it as his gaze moved over Georgia. She fought the urge to fuss with her disheveled appearance, choosing instead to raise her chin a notch and give him an equally cool stare. \u201cHey, Dalton. I remember you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. You\u2019re lookin\u2019\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tell smacked him in the back of the head. \u201cShut it, asshole. Why are you even here? Don\u2019t you have something to do today?\u201d</p><p>Dalton scowled. \u201cNot me, we. I\u2019m waitin\u2019 on you, because we both have to deal with that one thing, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat one thing?\u201d Tell asked with confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou know. That one thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh! That one thing. Gotcha.\u201d</p><p>Talk about vague. Was \u201cthat one thing\u201d some secret man code for lemme help you get rid of your pesky overnight female guest?</p><p>Yes, if the looks exchanged between the McKay boys were any indication.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s cheeks burned. Yeah, she was some class act the morning after her high school reunion\u2014wearing last night\u2019s wrinkled clothes, smelling of sex, sporting bed head and dragon breath. No wonder Tell had the look of a trapped animal. Was he worried she\u2019d somehow embarrass him in front of his studly younger brother? By acting clingy? Or worse...by making herself at home?</p><p>Screw that. She\u2019d hold her head up high. She could act casually slutty, as if rolling out of a man\u2019s bed after a night of hair-pulling, toe-curling sex was a regular occurrence for a tigress like her.</p><p>Big talk, Hot Lips. You\u2019d run out the door if you could.</p><p>Her fingers tightened on her purse. \u201cI know you\u2019re a busy man, Tell. But I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll need a ride home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll take you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to ride along?\u201d Dalton asked.</p><p>Both she and Tell froze, but they didn\u2019t look at each other.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019ll be back in thirty and we can go do that one thing.\u201d</p><p>So Tell wasn\u2019t planning to hang out at her place.</p><p>Georgia could feel Tell\u2019s gaze on her as he held open the front door. She never pulled the I\u2019m-so-busy-I\u2019m-constantly-needed-on-my-cell-phone type of avoidance\u2014but she was doing it now.</p><p>She was so engrossed in the info on her phone she didn\u2019t even glance at Tell after he helped her into his pickup. She was so immersed in the text scrolling across the screen she paid no attention to Tell McKay at all. Muttering to herself as she pretended to ignore the Wyoming countryside rolling by out passenger side window.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Tell finally asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She paused, wondering if she should take the chance and ask if she\u2019d see him this week.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry Dalton showed up this morning. I completely forgot I told him I would\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up the hand that wasn\u2019t poking keys on her phone\u2019s keypad, but she didn\u2019t deign to look away from the screen. \u201cNo need to explain. I had to hit the road anyway, I\u2019m just sorry I had to tear you away from your plans and you have to give me a ride. This is why I insist on driving. I hate being stuck somewhere without my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakin\u2019 you home ain\u2019t a problem, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>The hard set to his jaw and the clipped tone belied that statement. \u201cI see my boss left me several e-mails about expecting updated status reports on three projects I was supposed to have finished last week. Now I know what I\u2019ll be doing this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Georgia heaved a heavy sigh. \u201cBurning the midnight oil. I won\u2019t have time to breathe, let alone do anything else.\u201d There was Tell\u2019s opening, if he wanted it.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t take it. He didn\u2019t counter with a list of things he needed to accomplish this week and then ask if they could carve out time for each other at some point.</p><p>Tell left the engine idling when he pulled into her driveway. He didn\u2019t offer to help her out of his truck like he always did. But he did reach for her hand.</p><p>Georgia looked at him. Damn man was so freakin\u2019 gorgeous it was unreal. And it smacked her pride that he was done with her. Fine. She\u2019d be done with him too.</p><p>Better to end it now rather than dragging it out until the end of summer. Didn\u2019t last night with all the people in this town who are happy to see you miserable just prove that nothing, not even a smokin\u2019 hot, super sweet cowboy who rocks your world in bed and comforts you when you cry, will convince you to stay in Sundance, Wyoming, anyway?</p><p>That snarky little conscience of hers had taken on a southern drawl and prompted her back to the cold reality of this situation.</p><p>Sweet Tell brought her knuckles to his mouth for a soft kiss. \u201cI had a great time with you last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another.</p><p>He said, \u201cGeorgia. I\u2014\u201d at the same time her cell phone rang in her hand.</p><p>Dammit. And it was her boss too. Calling her on a Sunday. She hadn\u2019t been lying entirely; she had a shit ton to do this week.</p><p>Tell retreated. \u201cYou\u2019d better get that, bein\u2019 you\u2019re so busy and all.\u201d</p><p>Georgia snatched her purse and bailed out without looking back.</p><p>Late Monday morning, Tell drove to Ben\u2019s place to work on the baler.</p><p>They\u2019d been wrenching on the machine for over an hour when Ben said, \u201cI\u2019m takin\u2019 a break before I haul out the sledgehammer and use it to try and fix this piece of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea.\u201d Tell threw his tools onto the canvas cloth.</p><p>\u201cSo how was your reunion?\u201d</p><p>He wiped the sweat from his brow. \u201cAll right, I suppose. Didn\u2019t seem a whole lot different from high school, except for the bar in the gym.\u201d And for the fact he fucked Georgia in the history classroom.</p><p>Ben chuckled. \u201cBooze was the only thing that made mine bearable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps if you\u2019ve got a hot woman hanging on your arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know. I went to my reunion solo.\u201d</p><p>That surprised Tell. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I wouldn\u2019t have gone at all except I found out the girl I\u2019d been crushing on for years was coming. Naturally I wanted to show her how much she\u2019d missed out on by not getting with me back then, and by giving her the chance to rectify that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did it work?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cOh yeah. We drank. We danced. We ignored everyone. We ended up doin\u2019 it in the boys\u2019 locker room and missed the awards ceremony. Then we went back to her hotel room and fucked all night. Her plane left early the next morning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe went our separate ways. We both got what we wanted. No regrets, no promises, no invites to become Facebook friends. Just one night of turnin\u2019 those teenage fantasies a reality.\u201d Ben popped the cap on a bottle of water and drank. \u201cDid it play out that way for you too?\u201d</p><p>Tell leaned against the side of the barn, dreading that scenario. \u201cIt\u2019s different for me because Georgia is back in town for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlong the lines of what you said. Wondering if we just scratched an itch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinkin\u2019 that\u2019s all there is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I know there\u2019s more than that since we\u2019ve been hangin\u2019 out the last two weeks. But that don\u2019t change the fact the only reason we started spending time together was because she needed a date for the reunion. Now that it\u2019s over... I don\u2019t know where we go from here.\u201d</p><p>Ben frowned. \u201cYou haven\u2019t discussed it with her?\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m the fun hookup guy, remember? My morning after conversations are more along the lines of, Hey, darlin\u2019, have you seen my pants?\u201d</p> <p>His cousin laughed.</p><p>\u201cThen Dalton showed up Sunday morning two hours early. We\u2019d promised Brandt and Jessie we\u2019d be at their place when Dad came over to see Tucker. But my dumb-ass little brother made it sound like some big, stupid secret, callin\u2019 it that one thing because neither of us wants to talk about our fucked-up family in front of someone that ain\u2019t family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Georgia thought you were what? Tryin\u2019 to get rid of her?\u201d</p><p>Tell groaned. \u201cYep. Then she was dismissive. Like she couldn\u2019t wait to get the hell away from me. And she was goddamn vague about her plans for this week. Complaining about bein\u2019 so swamped she\u2019d barely have time to breathe. Basically, she said don\u2019t call me; I\u2019ll call you. So see why I\u2019m stuck on what to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess if she ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere, I don\u2019t see the harm in letting it ride. Give yourself a couple of days away from her to figure out if you wanna continue what you started and let her do the same.\u201d</p><p>Sound advice. Not what he wanted to hear though. \u201cThanks, man. I appreciate it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo problem. You gonna be crushed and moping around like a kicked dog if she\u2019s done with you?\u201d</p><p>Probably. \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCouldn\u2019t resist. But seriously, why aren\u2019t you talkin\u2019 to your brothers about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would if I could catch Brandt between diaper changes and Dalton between poker games.\u201d</p><p>Ben\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cLeft you holding the bag again, did they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike that\u2019s a surprise. You know how it goes, Ben. Seems us middle kids\u2014you, Colt and me\u2014always get stuck with a shit ton more chores than the oldest or the youngest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sir. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. Just because Brandt has added on the responsibility of parenting a kid doesn\u2019t give him the right to blow off his ranch responsibilities. I know you and Dalton shouldered way more of the work in the last six months. I\u2019ve been there, cuz, and it sucks ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had that issue with Quinn?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. Prince Adam arrived and Quinn\u2019s priorities shifted, which meant the day-to-day ranch stuff shifted squarely onto my shoulders. Chase wasn\u2019t around. My dad tried to pick up the slack, but shit wasn\u2019t getting done. Pissed me off. I let my brother know it. Was ugly for a couple weeks, because Quinn is one stubborn cuss, but he got back on track. It would\u2019ve gone on for as long as I let it go on. Confront your brother, Tell, or nothin\u2019 will ever change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. I guess if it was just ranch issues with my brothers, I\u2019d be okay, but family stuff can eat away at me until I\u2019ve been chewed up and spit out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething going on with Uncle Casper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Dad ain\u2019t the problem, if you can believe it. My mom... Jesus. She\u2019s so involved in her own life she can\u2019t see that other folks have lives too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeaning, she expects me to...\u201d Tell shook his head. \u201cNever mind. I feel like a fuckin\u2019 whiner. No one can take advantage of me without my permission, right? So I just gotta buck up and remember to say no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan. As far as Dalton not pulling his weight?\u201d</p><p>Tell shrugged. \u201cHe ain\u2019t bad. He covers for me about as much as I cover for him. It\u2019s just Brandt who\u2019s the deadweight.\u201d</p><p>Ben shot the baler a disgusted look. \u201cSpeaking of deadweight... I\u2019m sick of fucking with this thing. It\u2019s plain wore out. Time to put in a request for a new one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter all the times it jammed last summer, I\u2019ll back you on that request.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis ain\u2019t the only piece of equipment that\u2019s seen better days. Seems everything breaks at the same damn time.\u201d</p><p>Ainsley\u2019s car pulled up and Ben\u2019s entire demeanor changed. \u201cLooks like my lunch is here.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t sound like Ben was talking about food.</p><p>Tell took that as his cue to leave.</p><p>On Monday, Georgia loaded her briefcase, trying not to dread the process of cold-call sales pitches. It\u2019d be easier to drive the ten blocks to Sundance\u2019s main drag rather than hoof it in four-inch wedge sandals. The day was much warmer than forecast, and she\u2019d be sweating like a whore in church by the time she reached her destination.</p><p>She waited in her car for a moment as she scanned the list of possible advertising sponsors for the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo program guide. Barbara\u2019s suggestion of hard-selling the locals\u2014especially after the previous rodeo promotion company\u2019s lack of communication\u2014scared Georgia a little. They\u2019d both agreed playing catch-up at this late date might mean no business owners would be interested. No sales would reflect badly on her, so she had no other option but to channel her inner saleswoman and sell, sell, sell.</p><p>Luckily the committee that handled hiring the stock contractor, the entertainment, the rodeo announcers, the special guests and the individual chute sponsors also had commitments from the banks in Sundance for major sponsorships of the rodeo itself.</p><p>Her idea\u2014albeit not an original one\u2014was to get the businesses in Sundance, Moorcroft and Hulett to sponsor a grand prize called the cash cow, where the winner could choose between a fully processed and packaged whole cow or the cash equivalent. Their company had seen success with this type of promotion for a small rodeo in Oklahoma, and the participating businesses had a big uptick in the amount of walk-in traffic to their stores.</p><p>Georgia inhaled a couple of breaths to calm herself and smoothed the wrinkles from her khaki linen skirt. New businesses had popped up in the years she\u2019d been away, so she\u2019d start there.</p><p>Fields, an upscale restaurant that featured locally grown ingredients from vegetables and grains to beef, pork and chicken, took out a big ad.</p><p>The hardware store bought a full-page ad. As did Lettie from the Golden Boot. Then Georgia had to wonder if some of the businesses were doing it out of pity because she was a poor pitchwoman.</p><p>So? Her inner demon argued. A sale was a sale. And if she had to answer gossipy questions to make that sale, so be it.</p><p>She\u2019d convinced the dentist\u2019s office to advertise. As well as the feed store. The local implement dealership was providing ball caps, T-shirts and Frisbees for the breaks between events, and they placed a quarter-page ad anyway.</p><p>All the places agreed to allow promotional signage and flyers in their establishments, in addition to the entry boxes for the grand prize.</p><p>When her stomach growled, she realized she\u2019d missed lunch. She ducked into Dewey\u2019s for a quick bite.</p><p>The restaurant was nearly empty. Thankfully the waitress who\u2019d filled her ear with nastiness about Tell wasn\u2019t serving. She ordered the soup and salad special, shuffling through her notes while she waited. She had quite a few businesses left to approach in Sundance and she hadn\u2019t even started in Moorcroft or Hulett.</p><p>The server set the salad down first and spilled the soup. When she swore in Russian, Georgia\u2019s gaze snapped to the willowy blonde. Then she apologized in English. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s pretty obvious I haven\u2019t filled in as a waitress recently.\u201d</p><p>Georgia said, \u201cNo worries,\u201d\u2014in Russian.</p><p>That startled the woman. \u201cIt\u2019s not often I run across someone in Sundance who speaks Russian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother is from Russia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. I was born in the Ukraine. I knew many women who found husbands here. Do you speak Russian fluently?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust passably.\u201d Georgia slid her paperwork aside and pulled the salad and soup closer. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome to join me if you\u2019re not busy.\u201d</p><p>The woman smiled. \u201cReally? That would be great. Let me grab the iced tea.\u201d She returned and refilled Georgia\u2019s glass. \u201cBusy lunch. Feels good to be off my feet.\u201d She took a long drink of tea. \u201cI\u2019m Domini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNamed after Soviet Georgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, few people catch that. I haven\u2019t seen you in here before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m usually in the back, making schedules and placing orders. I used to cook, hostess and serve, but I\u2019m part time now.\u201d Domini shrugged. \u201cMost people think I\u2019m crazy for working at all when I have six children at home.\u201d</p><p>Georgia nearly choked on her soup. \u201cYou have six kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All of our sweet darlings came to us through adoption. While I love being a wife and mother, I need something for me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother didn\u2019t understand that until she divorced my father.\u201d Georgia stabbed a few pieces of lettuce onto her fork.</p><p>\u201cSo your mother...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas basically a Russian mail-order bride? Yes. It\u2019s strange to say, even now. How about you?\u201d</p><p>Domini shook her head. \u201cI came to the US with a church group. Became a citizen and met my husband here a few years later. I spent most my life in an orphanage, so I am grateful that Cam has a large family in the area and they\u2019re willing to help out with our kids. Are you from around here?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Georgia shared the edited version of her life, finishing with, \u201cIt\u2019s strange to be back. We had our ten-year high school reunion Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband is a deputy. He was disappointed the police didn\u2019t get called to the gym to break up any fights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is your husband?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCam McKay.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t it just figure? Another McKay. \u201cTell was my date to the reunion.\u201d</p><p>Domini pointed at her. \u201cAha! You\u2019re the one they were talking about. The beautiful woman from Tell\u2019s past.\u201d</p><p>She muttered, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the problem? Tell\u2019s definitely got a past now, with his love \u2018em and leave \u2018em reputation. So watch your step with him. Now that I\u2019ve done my duty in warning you\u2014\u201d Domini gestured to the pile of papers, \u201c\u2014what are you selling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAds for the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo program guide.\u201d Georgia grinned. \u201cWanna buy one or ten? All the other restaurants in town have bought space.\u201d</p><p>Domini rubbed her hands together. \u201cAbsolutely. Can\u2019t let our competition get the jump on us. What are the options?\u201d</p><p>When Georgia hesitated, Domini said, \u201cMy sister-in-law Macie McKay owns this restaurant, so I do have the authority to make these decisions. But you can call her directly if you prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just... I thought the McKays were ranchers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost are. But one McKay spouse or another owns each of the businesses on this side of the block. And Keely\u2019s husband Jack owns the whole building. But that is a good thing because you\u2019re involved with Tell. They should all be easy sales for you.\u201d</p><p>Before Georgia could assure her she\u2019d never use Tell that way, Domini gave her a shrewd look. \u201cI\u2019ll make you a deal. If I buy ad space, will you help me out? The community center is hosting a heritage festival Thursday night. In addition to the ethnic food, I planned on teaching the kids how to count to ten in Ukrainian. If you came, you could teach them to count in Russian. It\u2019d only be for two hours.\u201d</p> <p>Her knee-jerk reaction was to say no. But it\u2019d be good for business if she showed a presence at and an interest in community events. \u201cI don\u2019t have to wear a costume or anything?\u201d</p><p>Domini laughed. \u201cNo kokoshnik. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, since you\u2019re not insisting I wear one of those weird Russian headdresses my mother tried to foist on me... I\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>By the time seven o\u2019clock rolled around, Georgia had taken a break from the task lists Barbara had e-mailed and had poured herself a glass of white wine. She curled up on the porch swing, soaking in the last golden rays of sunlight. When her phone rang, she had the tiny hope it was Tell. But it was her mother. \u201cHey, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoyah krasivaya doch.\u201d</p><p>Her mother always called her my beautiful daughter.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from you. How was the reunion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeh. It was sort of fun to see everyone, with the exception of Deck and Tara-Lee.\u201d She pushed off the railing, setting the swing in motion.</p> <p>\u201cNo issues with Deck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe cornered me. But it got handled.\u201d Georgia sipped her wine. \u201cThe worst part of the night was when they did the memorial tribute to RJ.\u201d</p><p>Her mother was very quiet. \u201cHave you been...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not yet. I\u2019ll go. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you will. You\u2019re a good daughter and a good sister.\u201d She laughed softly. \u201cI had a weird flashback the other day. A coworker\u2019s daughter is getting her tonsils taken out, and I remembered when you had your tonsillectomy. When they finally brought you back to your room, RJ wouldn\u2019t leave your side. He just crawled right into your bed with you and announced he was staying there all night because he didn\u2019t want you to be scared.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cThe little sneak had packed his backpack with a flashlight, your favorite stuffed animals and a bag of marshmallows because they\u2019d be soft enough for you to eat.\u201d</p><p>Georgia closed her eyes against the grief that could still slice her to the bone. For all his wild ways, RJ had always been so sweet and protective of her. He\u2019d brought the flashlight so they could cuddle up under the covers and read his comic book stash, trying to convince her that being in the hospital was just like camping out, so she wouldn\u2019t be afraid. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten about that. I do remember that RJ convinced the nurses we had to have ice cream every hour. \u201c</p><p>\u201cMy boy did inherit his father\u2019s knack for using charm to get what he wanted.\u201d She cleared her throat. \u201cSpeaking of... What did your father have to say when he called you?\u201d</p><p>Georgia frowned. \u201cHe called you after he talked to me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often does he call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery couple of months. Usually after he\u2019s been drinking. That\u2019s the only time he can open up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom. You don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can handle Robert. So anyway... How is work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. You know how much I dislike cold-call ad selling, which is probably why Barbara is making me do it. So far I haven\u2019t run into any businesses that were screwed by the promotion company we took over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s okay? Being back in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. I just keep telling myself it\u2019s temporary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might drive up to see you.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>They talked for ten more minutes, firming up the date for her mother\u2019s visit. After she hung up, Georgia had a melancholy feeling she couldn\u2019t shake. After spending the last two weeks with Tell, it\u2019d hit her tonight, how alone she was in her life. Physically distant from her mother. Estranged from her father. If she was honest, her friends in Dallas were her coworkers and she wasn\u2019t close to any of them. She didn\u2019t know her neighbors in the gated community where she rented her condo. She went to the movies alone. She ate dinner by herself in front of the TV most evenings. She occasionally went out on a date. Most men weren\u2019t what she expected and certainly not what she wanted.</p><p>Definitely none were as fun, funny, insightful and sexy as Tell McKay.</p><p>It\u2019d been one day and she missed him.</p><p>Looked to be a long week.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Georgia hadn\u2019t called him Monday. Not that he\u2019d expected it. He\u2019d spent way too much time thinking about her, weighing Ben\u2019s advice against his gut instinct of driving to her house and kissing her stupid as a conversation starter. But he held off. Going a couple days without contact wouldn\u2019t hurt either of them. He told himself that, yet he couldn\u2019t figure out why he was on edge with an odd feeling of gloom until he realized it was because he missed her.</p><p>So when Tell\u2019s phone rang on Tuesday afternoon, he was disappointed it wasn\u2019t Georgia\u2019s number on the caller ID.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mom, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSamantha has a last-minute overnight seminar in Riverton. I already promised Bart I\u2019d go to the VA in Cheyenne with him for his outpatient surgery, and I can\u2019t bring Landon along.\u201d</p><p>No Hi, son, how are you? No What\u2019s new in your world? She cut straight to the chase; no pleasantries. Just like his father did. \u201cSo you\u2019re callin\u2019 because you need me to baby-sit Landon again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I know it\u2019s last minute, but I have no choice.\u201d</p><p>But I do. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you expect me to drop everything right now and drive to Casper? I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Her silence felt accusatory and Tell almost caved in.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with you?\u201d she demanded. \u201cYou never\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no?\u201d Tell paced to the window. \u201cI have plans tonight.\u201d No point in wishing he\u2019d told his mother no last week when he\u2019d cancelled a date with Georgia, but he could change the parameters from here on out. \u201cDid you ask Dalton or Brandt if they could help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrandt and Jessie have their hands full right now, doncha think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019m plenty busy myself picking up the slack around the ranch since Brandt is embracing fatherhood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on at the ranch isn\u2019t my concern,\u201d she said with a sniff.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because Landon had been your only concern the past few years.\u201d Just like Luke was always your number one priority.</p><p>Childish, probably, but accurate, and not the first time he\u2019d had that thought. But it was the first time he\u2019d voiced it to her.</p><p>\u201cTell McKay. That\u2019s not true. I thought you liked taking care of Landon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. I love the kid. But I hate that the only time I see him is when I\u2019m the last resort for childcare. How long before Landon will resent getting shuttled off to his bachelor uncle\u2019s at the last minute?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019re just being ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Silly Tell, flitting around like a damn butterfly without a care in the world.\u201d</p><p>A long pause. \u201cSon. Have you been drinking?\u201d</p><p>He forced a laugh. \u201cLook, Mom, I gotta go. I\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really saying no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I really am. Bye.\u201d He hung up. And it felt good.</p><p>An hour later Tell was thinking about a prime rib sandwich as he got ready for dart league, when he heard someone at his door. Doubtful it was his sweet woman, but he kept a goofy smile in place just in case as he snapped the last pearl button on his short-sleeved shirt and answered the door.</p><p>But his brother Brandt stood on the front porch.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro. Is everything all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot according to Mom.\u201d Brandt bulled his way inside.</p><p>\u201cMom called you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. She thought you were drunk or high or some damn thing, so she sent me to check on you.\u201d Brandt squinted at him. \u201cAre you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDrunk? No. High? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPissed?\u201d</p><p>Tell shrugged. \u201cGetting there, since my mommy called my big brother to make sure I wasn\u2019t being naughty or pouting. So maybe it\u2019d be best if you skedaddled on home to the wife and kiddie.\u201d</p> <p>Brandt didn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhat\u2019s goin\u2019 on? You never have words with Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t really an exchange of words\u2014except for the one word she didn\u2019t wanna hear when I said no to drivin\u2019 to Casper to take care of Landon tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe mentioned it, and I don\u2019t see what the big deal is.\u201d</p><p>That got Tell\u2019s back up big-time. \u201cYeah? Then why don\u2019t you hop in your truck and do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have a wife and a kid to take care of.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd because no one believes I have a life outside of ranch work, my free time is up for grabs? Ask Tell to make a three-hour trip, he won\u2019t mind. Guess what? I do fucking mind.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You were expecting I\u2019d be cracking jokes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad I\u2019m fresh out of funny.\u201d</p><p>They stared at one another. \u201cHow many times has Mom asked you to watch Landon in the last year?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least twice a month. Except it\u2019s gotten more frequent since calving ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you say yes every time she asks.\u201d A statement.</p><p>Tell nodded. \u201cExcept for today. That don\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna stop helping out entirely; I\u2019m just not doin\u2019 it today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow that I\u2019ve heard your side, I\u2019m glad you stood up to her, because Mom has gotten...pushy lately.\u201d Brandt sighed. \u201cSome days, she reminds me of Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s seen it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve noticed it and so has Jess. But I know you, Tell. That alone ain\u2019t enough to set you off.\u201d</p><p>Set him off? He\u2019d been downright pleasant to his mother. How would people react if he really went off?</p><p>\u201cYou poke at me until I start talkin\u2019, so I\u2019m gonna do the same to you, bro. What else is on your mind?\u201d Brandt asked. \u201c\u2018Cause you\u2019ve been actin\u2019 pissy. I suspect it\u2019s got something to do with me.\u201d</p> <p>Tell counted to twenty in an attempt to temper his response, but maybe it was better to let fly. \u201cFine, Brandt, here it is. You\u2019ve been a shitty ranching partner the last six months. I understood your distraction when Jessie was pregnant. But now that Tucker is here, I\u2019ve waited for you to step up and do your part and it hasn\u2019t happened yet. I\u2019m frustrated and tired of cuttin\u2019 you slack. I\u2019m forced to make decisions because you won\u2019t, and then you question me on every damn thing I decide. Me\u2019n Dalton are tired of it.\u201d</p><p>Brandt\u2019s face turned a mottled red.</p><p>A few excruciatingly tense moments passed and Tell wondered if Ben had given him bad advice all around: about confronting the family problem head-on with his mom and Brandt, as well as staying away from Georgia.</p><p>Then Brandt dropped onto the couch. \u201cFuck. When did I become that guy? The guy who does the minimum amount of work, who comes in late, leaves early and puts his life ahead of everything else?\u201d Brandt chewed that over for a bit. \u201cChrist. I\u2019m actin\u2019 just like Luke did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said that, but since you did... Yeah. Maybe a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI\u2019m sorry, Tell. There ain\u2019t no excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t happen anymore. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>Brandt pushed to his feet. \u201cSo, you tired of riding herd on me yet?\u201d</p><p>Just like that, Tell knew Brandt\u2019s slacker days were behind them. Neither needed to beat this issue to death; it was over and done with and they\u2019d move on. Now he wished he would\u2019ve said something sooner. \u201cMaybe a little.\u201d He grinned and lightly punched Brandt in the arm. \u201cHey. Maybe Dalton will fuck up and you\u2019ll be off the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t put it past that kid. He\u2019s always got some damn secret.\u201d He snorted. \u201cKid. Now I really sound like Luke. Anyway, thanks for the kick in the ass before you had to kick my ass.\u201d Brandt cuffed Tell on the arm. \u201cSo as long as we\u2019re bein\u2019 all touchy-feely and shit... Jess wants you to come over for supper tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I can\u2019t. I\u2019m working a rodeo in Belle Fourche all day tomorrow that lasts into the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess I deserve to do chores by my lonesome for a change, huh?\u201d He smiled and punched Tell in the arm just a little harder than the first time, which was a sign things were getting back to normal. \u201cCome by anyway if it ain\u2019t too late, because we\u2019re usually up.\u201d Brandt smirked. \u201cI promise we won\u2019t ask you to baby-sit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that it ain\u2019t great to see you, Thurman,\u201d Tell said, sliding into the booth at Ziggy\u2019s, \u201cbut you don\u2019t normally call on league night lookin\u2019 for a drinking buddy. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Thurman swigged his beer. \u201cI\u2019m not lookin\u2019 to get drunk. I\u2019m headed outta town tomorrow and I wanted the lowdown on you and Hot Lips, since you guys took off so fast Saturday night. How\u2019re things goin?\u201d He waggled his eyebrows. \u201cPlanning that trip down the altar yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off. She\u2019s busy this week so I haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d That sounded plausible. Casual. Not like she\u2019d dumped his ass. \u201cI\u2019ve been dealin\u2019 with ranch stuff and the always fun family shit anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the fun family shit have anything to do with Dalton?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a couple of things. Normally I don\u2019t put much stock in rumors...but this one about Dalton caught my interest.\u201d</p><p>Thurman wasn\u2019t the type to gossip, so Tell immediately went on alert. \u201cDon\u2019t keep me in suspense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently he rented a motel room in Hulett sometime in the last month. Claimed he was trying to set a new McKay record for the most women fucked in a single night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. There\u2019s a life goal. And he\u2019s makin\u2019 it sound like all the single McKays ever did was sit around bragging about female conquests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family has a reputation, Tell. Whether it\u2019s bullshit or deserved, ain\u2019t my concern.\u201d Thurman shrugged. \u201cI just wanna make sure somebody knows what Dalton is up to and that he ain\u2019t knocking up half the young ladies in the damn county.\u201d</p><p>Their food arrived, which gave Tell time to consider this news regarding his brother.</p><p>Something had changed with Dalton right around the time their father had checked into rehab. With so many other things on his mind, maybe he hadn\u2019t paid as much attention to his little brother\u2019s escapades. But Dalton was a twenty-five-year-old man, not a child. He didn\u2019t need a baby-sitter.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful quiet, Tell.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Thurman. \u201cJust debating on whether it\u2019s my responsibility to check up on him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it ain\u2019t. I didn\u2019t tell you this because I expect you\u2019ll stake out the Shady R Motel in Moorcroft to see if Dalton\u2019s truck is in the lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate it, even though it don\u2019t make me happy.\u201d Tell signaled for another beer. \u201cCurious, though. Did your source say how many women Dalton...serviced that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? You think your record might have his beat?\u201d Thurman teased.</p><p>Tell flipped him off.</p><p>\u201cI heard Dalton was with thirteen different chicks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirteen? Holy shit.\u201d</p><p>Thurman shoved his plate aside and leaned closer. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the kicker. My understanding is he did it with all thirteen women in the room with him. And these ladies were giving him pointers and feedback.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a sex focus group?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr a sex seminar.\u201d</p><p>Tell shook his head. \u201cDamn. I don\u2019t even wanna think about twelve women standin\u2019 around, watchin\u2019 me have sex with another woman and critiquing my performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven when I was a teen and my dick was hard all the freakin\u2019 time, I don\u2019t think I jacked off thirteen times in one day, say nothin\u2019 of getting it up and getting off that many times in a few hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoggles the mind, don\u2019t it? I\u2019d guess he\u2019s beat Chase and Colt, who I\u2019d lay odds were previous McKay record holders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m gonna ask them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton might. Just for bragging rights.\u201d Thurman drained his beer. \u201cCome on. Forget about it. I\u2019ll let you lose a game of pool to me before you lose at darts.\u201d</p><p>On the drive home, Tell realized he hadn\u2019t managed to put Georgia out of his mind, even for three hours. He\u2019d found himself looking around the bar, hoping she\u2019d show up.</p><p>He missed her. Given his schedule, tomorrow was a wash as far as reconnecting, but if he hadn\u2019t heard from her by Thursday night, he was showing up on her doorstep.</p><p>Wednesday morning, Georgia tackled the businesses on the other end of the Sandstone Building. First stop: Healing Touch Massage.</p><p>A soft chime sounded as she walked through the door. The space had been decorated with western touches\u2014fake cowhide print chairs in the reception area, a coffee table crafted from logs. With mocha-colored walls and plush carpeting, the area embodied a sense of calm.</p><p>From the back, a voice trilled, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in a sec.\u201d Then a drawer slammed and the pregnant blonde Georgia had met at Dairy Queen ambled around the corner.</p><p>Oh hello, hostility. This was going to be a fun sale.</p><p>Georgia smiled brightly, hoping it didn\u2019t look cheesy. \u201cGreat place you have, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Are you here for a massage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m selling advertising space for the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo program guide.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>AJ rested her folded arm on her belly. \u201cI bought an ad last year and I didn\u2019t see the benefits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the committee hired a new PR company. We\u2019re expanding the guide this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked where the ad money actually goes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA portion goes to printing the brochures. A portion goes to the local committee. They use it to try and bring in bigger sponsors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo local sponsorship by local businesses isn\u2019t enough? If you\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry, why should I fork out my money?\u201d</p><p>Talk about prickly. \u201cLet me explain. Bigger sponsors will provide bigger payouts for the event purse, which will attract better competitors, which will bring more people into the area and into the area businesses. We aren\u2019t looking to replace the business ad you\u2019d place with one for a bigger sponsor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to see examples of ads we\u2019re doing for other businesses? And hear the promotion I\u2019ve sketched out, which requires little to no effort on the part of the advertisers?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>When Georgia had shown AJ all the options and the pregnant woman\u2019s only responses were a sniff, a grunt or a shrug, Georgia lost all confidence in herself and any hope of a sale. She tidied up her papers. \u201cThanks for listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d AJ\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cIf you\u2019re done, why do you still look so tense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you make me nervous.\u201d</p><p>AJ blinked with total distrust. \u201cBecause you want me to buy an ad that badly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d She blew out a slow breath. \u201cBetween us? Cold-call selling is not my strong suit. Add in trying to convince people that I\u2019m not the aloof cheerleader they remember, but a professional woman...isn\u2019t exactly a cakewalk.\u201d Why don\u2019t you just blurt out all your insecurities in front of a potential client, Georgia?</p> <p>\u201cI understand where you\u2019re coming from because I\u2019m definitely not the mousy girl I was in high school. And thank God for that.\u201d AJ stepped out from behind the counter. \u201cCome on. I\u2019m gonna give you a little shoulder massage. On the house.\u201d</p><p>Georgia blurted out, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can feel the tension rolling off you. I have a Swedish in thirty minutes and it\u2019ll be good to limber up my hands.\u201d AJ led her to what looked like a beauty chair, but in reverse form, with an open oval to place her face in and padded arms beneath it. The footrest was adjustable, she could put her feet in front, or behind like she was riding a motorcycle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll need to take off your jacket. The blouse can stay on.\u201d AJ leaned closer and tugged on the material. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019ll rip.\u201d</p><p>Rip? Like AJ planned to massage her violently enough to tear clothing? \u201cAh. I don\u2019t know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax.\u201d AJ stood beside the chair, tapping her foot almost in challenge, waiting as Georgia climbed into the contraption.</p><p>Deep breath.</p><p>\u201cThere. Now just pretend we\u2019re two friends chatting at the beauty shop.\u201d</p> <p>Friends? Right. AJ could teach torture tactics. Georgia gasped when two fingers sank into the skin beside her shoulder blades, almost to the bone.</p><p>\u201cYou have had a massage before, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yeah.\u201d Just not like this. Then she felt several hard pinches up the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cSo as to not keep you in suspense, I\u2019ll buy an ad,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cHas your business been doin\u2019 well?\u201d</p><p>More pressure as AJ ground her thumbs across Georgia\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s not my business.\u201d Georgia explained, glad AJ couldn\u2019t see her face when she grimaced in pain.</p><p>\u201cWhen I graduated from trade school and set up shop in Sundance, I wasn\u2019t sure I could make a go of it. Now I\u2019ve got a steady enough clientele that I could be open eight hours a day, six days a week if I chose, but I keep it part time.\u201d She grunted. \u201cSo you\u2019ve hooked up with Tell.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t take her long to bring that up. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hanging out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you two were a couple.\u201d</p><p>Georgia purposely ignored the past tense form were. \u201cWe went to our class reunion together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI skipped my reunion. Keely and Chase were stars of our class anyway.\u201d AJ pulled on a section of skin. \u201cKind of like you were the star of your class.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot something I wanted, believe me. And I never felt that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck was the star. I was the girlfriend in the background with the cool, fun brother everyone loved.\u201d</p><p>AJ\u2019s hands stopped moving so vigorously. \u201cAw, shoot, Georgia, I forgot that your brother died. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. In some ways Tell reminds me of RJ. He\u2019s outgoing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means Tell goes out all the damn time. He\u2019s had a lot of girlfriends, I mean a lot, but he\u2019s never had a serious girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>Rather than gasp and say I had no idea he was such a stud, she casually remarked, \u201cYes, that has come up in conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re all a little protective of him.\u201d</p><p>Oh for Godsake, really? Like Tell McKay needed protection from her? She couldn\u2019t let that comment slide. \u201cBecause innocent Tell has absolutely no experience with women like me, right?\u201d Georgia said with an edge. \u201cI\u2019m the ball-busting bitch from his past who\u2019s set her sights on breaking his poor little heart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, snap,\u201d AJ said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the first one to warn me off sweet, funny, perfect Tell McKay, AJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said he was perfect, but I\u2019ll agree he\u2019s sweet and funny. And I wasn\u2019t warning you off him as much as I was just warning you. Tell isn\u2019t ready to settle down. So don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d</p><p>Then it felt as if AJ were slicing along both sides of her spinal cord to make it easier to rip the bones clean out. With her bare hands. Or perhaps her teeth.</p><p>Finally AJ said, \u201cDone.\u201d</p><p>Georgia pushed herself up. \u201cThanks for the massage. Once I have a better handle on my schedule, I\u2019ll book a full appointment.\u201d She slipped on her jacket. \u201cLet\u2019s get the ad set up before your next victim arrives.\u201d</p><p>She smiled cheekily at AJ and was totally shocked when the cranky pregnant woman laughed and said, \u201cYou know, cheerleader, I kinda like you.\u201d</p><p>Despite the sale, Georgia was feeling less than confident at the next stop: India\u2019s Ink and Sky Blue.</p><p>A woman and two small boys sat at a child-size plastic table by the front counter. A dark-haired baby bounced on the woman\u2019s knee.</p><p>The woman wore a flowery sundress and a whole lot of tattoos. Her short, dark hair had randomly scattered streaks of electric blue. \u201cHi. If you\u2019re here for a tat, it\u2019ll have to wait until my husband returns for my little helpers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for that.\u201d</p><p>Suspicious eyes zeroed in on Georgia\u2019s briefcase. \u201cWho are you and what are you selling?\u201d</p><p>How many freakin\u2019 times would she have to go through this spiel?</p><p>As many as it took to fill up the damn program guide.</p><p>Before she could regurgitate the pitch she\u2019d committed to memory, the oldest boy said, \u201cMama, look! I drawed a fish!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s real good, Hudson baby, see if you can draw another one.\u201d</p><p>He scowled at his mother. \u201cI\u2019m not a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I forget you\u2019re a big boy now.\u201d</p><p>These kids were the most beautiful children Georgia had ever seen. Had to be McKay kids with that black hair and those vivid blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou were saying?\u201d the woman prompted.</p><p>\u201cSorry for staring, but your children are gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThank you. They get those genes from their daddy.\u201d She held out her hand. \u201cIndia McKay.\u201d</p><p>Georgia shook it. \u201cNice to meet you, India. It seems you\u2019re busy, so I can come back later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Stick around. I don\u2019t usually bring the kids to work with me, but every once in a while I don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d She kissed the top of the baby girl\u2019s head. \u201cShow me what you\u2019ve got. Spread out on the counter, away from madly coloring little boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d After Georgia lined up the pieces and made her sales pitch, she felt India staring at her.</p><p>\u201cNow I know why your name is familiar. You\u2019re dating Tell.\u201d</p><p>That connection took all of thirty seconds. \u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>India\u2019s blue gaze sharpened. \u201cWhat do you mean you guess?\u201d</p><p>How could she admit that the R word had never come up between them during the two weeks they were boinking like bunnies? \u201cUmm... It\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it comes to a McKay male. They are highly territorial.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wondered if the guys in the McKay family would take that as an insult or a compliment.</p><p>\u201cSo? What\u2019s the deal with you two?\u201d</p><p>This woman just expected her to blurt it out?</p><p>India laughed. \u201cOh, I get why you\u2019re hedging about your relationship status and using the word complicated. Because Tell is in the d-bag stage right now.\u201d She patted Georgia\u2019s forearm. \u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. We\u2019ve all been there.\u201d</p><p>After the contracts were signed, a loud crash sounded behind them. The youngest boy had kicked over the table and was smacking it with a fat table leg.</p><p>\u201cEllison McKay! Drop that and park your butt on that chair right now, mister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me start counting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. One.\u201d</p><p>Ellison threw himself on the floor and started crying. His brother seized the opportunity to jump on him. Which only made the boy shriek louder.</p><p>\u201cHudson! What on earth is wrong with you? Get off your brother.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The boys paid no attention. They rolled around on the floor. Dodging punches and punching back. Yelling. Crying.</p><p>The baby girl suddenly let loose a loud wail.</p><p>\u201cCome on, McKenna baby, not you too.\u201d</p> <p>Georgia gathered her stuff, thankful they\u2019d concluded business before the tantrums started.</p><p>The door chime jangled, but that didn\u2019t end the chaos.</p><p>A wolf whistle pierced the air. Then a man separated the boys. \u201cHey, hey, you two. No hitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in time, Colt,\u201d India said.</p><p>The younger boy clung to the man\u2019s neck when he stood. Colt settled the kid on his hip and smoothed the older boy\u2019s hair. \u201cYou wanna tell me what\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p> <p>Hudson shook his head.</p><p>Then the man briefly looked at Georgia. And she just about choked on the puddle of drool forming on her tongue. This guy... Wow. Yeah, the kids had definitely inherited his amazing looks.</p><p>But then he only had eyes for his wife. \u201cSorry to interrupt, Indy. I\u2019ll get the boys outta your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work. But you should meet Georgia Hotchkiss. Georgia, this is my husband, Colt McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. As in Tell\u2019s Georgia?\u201d</p><p>And she thought the people in Sundance were gossipy? They had nothing on the McKay family.</p> <p>India elbowed him. \u201cSometimes there\u2019s a disconnect between your mouth and your brain. Yes, this is the Georgia who knows Tell. No, she doesn\u2019t belong to him, caveman McKay.\u201d</p><p>Colt grinned. \u201cNice to meetcha, Georgia. I\u2019m gonna hafta rib my cousin, because he\u2019s dating way out of his league.\u201d</p><p>Georgia blushed.</p><p>India bent down to hug Hudson. Then she stood and kissed Ellison\u2019s cheek. \u201cBe good for Daddy today, boys.\u201d She turned away.</p><p>\u201cHey, Mama. Where\u2019s my kiss?\u201d</p><p>She sighed and stood on tiptoe to reach his lips for a quick peck. But Colt wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and held his wife in place as he gave her a very thorough kiss.</p><p>Georgia felt like a voyeur, seeing the intimate connection between these two, surrounded by their rambunctious kids, but existing only in the moment with each other.</p><p>Would she ever allow herself to have that kind of deep connection with a man? Or would she always pull back?</p> <p>Like you\u2019re pulling back with Tell? Like you\u2019ve pulled back with everyone since RJ died?</p><p>She shoved everything into her briefcase. The tattoo art on the inside of the glass case caught her eye. Some designs were really cool, especially the memorial tattoos. Some were portraits, some were just dates, some were crosses, or some were a combination of all three.</p><p>\u201cSee anything you like?\u201d India asked.</p><p>\u201cAre all these your designs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Were you considering a memorial tattoo?\u201d</p><p>Georgia looked up. \u201cI never have before now. But it seems...\u201d</p><p>India patted her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to mark a sad event. But if you decide to do it, I can design anything from gaudy to discreet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll definitely be back.\u201d</p><p>That night as Georgia wrote her sales report for her boss and mapped out her plan for the businesses in Moorcroft the following day, she kept sneaking glances at her cell phone. Checking it like some smitten teenage girl, wondering if her phone was somehow...broken because another day had gone by and she hadn\u2019t heard from Tell.</p><p>So call him.</p><p>Right. After hearing his family\u2019s concerns that she was some sort of femme fatale heartbreaker? Now she was uneasy enough about the situation that she wouldn\u2019t call him first. Not out of pettiness; out of self-preservation.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Early Thursday morning, Tell glanced at Dalton, standing on his left. Man. His baby brother looked like roadkill. Then he noticed Brandt yawning. They were a lively bunch.</p><p>Cord had called a meeting at the sorting pens, which was neutral ground and the center of the ranch.</p><p>Pickups were parked in a lopsided circle. His cousins were spread out in groups of brothers. Kane and Kade were in a deep discussion. Colby, Cord and Colt were laughing about something. Quinn and Ben were standing together, not talking at all.</p><p>He spoke to Brandt. \u201cYou have any idea what this meeting is about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Wish I\u2019d brought more coffee. I am draggin\u2019 ass today.\u201d He yawned again. \u201cTucker cried all night. Woke us up every hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d</p><p>Brandt offered a small smile. \u201cOh, it ain\u2019t so bad. It\u2019s just frustrating when we can\u2019t figure out why he\u2019s cryin\u2019. The only thing that calms him down is bein\u2019 held, so me\u2019n Jess take turns.\u201d</p><p>Dalton leaned closer. \u201cEither of you got any Tums? I\u2019m about to blow chunks after way too much drinkin\u2019 last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s some in the glove box,\u201d Brandt said. When Tell gaped at him, he said, \u201cWhat? Jess ate Tums by the handful when she was pregnant. I kept \u2019em in my truck since I was her chauffeur.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t what surprised me. It was the fact you didn\u2019t go all \u2018you\u2019re a dumb-ass\u2019 on our little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m too fuckin\u2019 tired to care.\u201d Brandt shot him a smirk. \u201cAnd I\u2019m practicing not bein\u2019 a dick.\u201d</p><p>Tell snorted.</p><p>Cord stepped forward and all conversation ended. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a formal shareholders meeting since around this time last year, so I figured we\u2019d get it out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re doin\u2019 this without the previous McKay generation in attendance?\u201d Quinn asked.</p><p>\u201cTechnically, they\u2019re shareholders, but they gave up voting rights when they passed us the reins.\u201d</p><p>It went unsaid that none of them wanted to deal with Casper after what\u2019d happened last year. An endless prayer followed by an endless litany of criticism and complaints.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t gotta go over the financials because you all got copies relating to your shares. We all had a record year last year and so far it\u2019s lookin\u2019 like this one might be even better.\u201d</p><p>Heads nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat said, we\u2019ve gotta replace a lot of equipment, and that\u2019s expensive, but since it\u2019s equipment we all use it, the purchase will come out of the main ranch account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re payin\u2019 cash?\u201d Ben asked.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what we need to vote on,\u201d Cord said. \u201cWhether we wanna take out a loan or use the cash reserves.\u201d</p><p>Colt spoke up. \u201cI\u2019d rather we used some of the cash, say thirty or forty percent, and finance the rest. If we\u2019ve still got a solid amount of cash this time next year, then we can look at payin\u2019 off the remaining amount. Or extending the loan another year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Kade said. \u201cWho knows what the economy, the price of feed and the livestock market will do in the next twelve months? Better to play it safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other comments or suggestions?\u201d Cord asked.</p><p>Ben raised his hand. \u201cAt the risk of ruffling some feathers, I suggest we make sure we\u2019re getting the lowest rate from Settler\u2019s First Bank before we commit to borrowing money from them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSez the competing bank president\u2019s husband,\u201d Tell said dryly.</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>\u201cI agree with Ben,\u201d Brandt said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to talk to American West Bank to see what they\u2019ll offer to get some of our business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just to be clear, I won\u2019t be involved one way or the other. I just wanted to mention it,\u201d Ben added.</p><p>\u201cSo, show of hands on usin\u2019 a partial down payment?\u201d</p><p>All hands went up.</p><p>\u201cGood. Show of hands on me, Kade, Brandt and Quinn finding the lowest loan rate?\u201d</p><p>All hands went up.</p><p>Cord stroked his goatee. \u201cMotion passes and all that shit. What\u2019s next?\u201d</p><p>Kade said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019re talkin\u2019 about joint expenses, something\u2019s gotta be done with that bunkhouse. Over the last few months, me\u2019n Colby found a ton of beer cans inside and outside. All the wood we had stockpiled has been burned, so someone has been livin\u2019 there. Or more likely, kids have been usin\u2019 it as a party house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce it becomes party central, it\u2019s gonna be hell to get them kids to stop goin\u2019 there,\u201d Colby added.</p><p>\u201cAnd Cam can\u2019t patrol that area all the time because it\u2019s abusing his position,\u201d Colt pointed out. \u201cAny ideas on how we oughta handle it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say all ten of us sit inside. When the little shits show up, we reinforce with ten loaded shotguns that they\u2019re trespassing on private property,\u201d Dalton suggested.</p><p>Chuckles.</p><p>\u201cI vote for burning it down,\u201d Tell said. \u201cAin\u2019t like we use it all that much anymore anyway. Not during calving season, and we haven\u2019t played poker there in well over a year.\u201d</p><p>Everyone looked at Tell like he was holding a can of gasoline and a blowtorch.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Tell, can\u2019t you be serious for one fuckin\u2019 second?\u201d Kane demanded.</p><p>Tell hated how his face heated. \u201cI am serious. It ain\u2019t like we can move it, since we poured concrete footings. We used cheap materials to build it and we haven\u2019t been takin\u2019 care of it, so it is gonna fall into ruin. Better we torch it ourselves than to wait for some dumb fucking teenagers to accidentally light it on fire, as well as the damn grass surrounding it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust torch it?\u201d Kade said. \u201cSeems wasteful.\u201d</p><p>Discussion broke out. Tell knew nothing would be decided today. He whistled and everyone stopped talking. \u201cI believe there are two options on the table. Cord? Let\u2019s vote.\u201d</p><p>Cord cocked his head. \u201cYou\u2019re pushy today, Tell. What\u2019s up? Got someplace to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s volunteered to walk a group of senior citizens across the street,\u201d Colt said.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s gotta polish up his comedy routine for Wyoming\u2019s Funniest Person contest at Cheyenne Frontier Days,\u201d Colby quipped. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s judgin\u2019 a swimsuit contest in his bedroom,\u201d Kane said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll bet he wants to get out of here because he\u2019s got a hot date with Hot Lips,\u201d Dalton said slyly.</p><p>Tell pushed him. \u201cFuck off.\u201d He looked at his cousins. \u201cAll of you can just fuck the fuck off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking of... I met your woman at India\u2019s shop. She is a knockout. Indy says she\u2019s sharp.\u201d Colt paused and smirked. \u201cSo what in the hell is she doin\u2019 with you?\u201d</p><p>Laughter.</p><p>\u201cReally funny, cuz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, AJ mentioned that your latest squeeze had shown up at Healing Touch. Evidently you were a main topic of conversation,\u201d Cord said.</p><p>Tell muttered, \u201cFuckin\u2019 awesome. Now I have to wonder if India tattooed Georgia before or after her massage with AJ.\u201d</p> <p>Colt shook his head. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t getting a tat. She was selling advertising.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to think of it, Skylar told me about this charming little bombshell from Sundance who stopped in to the Sky Blue manufacturing plant and dropped your name.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s gaze zoomed to Kade. \u201cWhen was this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWednesday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like your lady was makin\u2019 the rounds,\u201d Kane drawled. \u201cShe showed up at Ginger\u2019s office too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWanna take bets on whether she approached Domini at Dewey\u2019s? I\u2019m guessing she hit Keely up for ad sponsorship too.\u201d Dalton looked at Ben. \u201cHow about Ainsley?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAinsley approved an ad for American West yesterday. And she took out a personal ad for my furniture business after Georgia mentioned she loved the coffee table I\u2019d made that she\u2019d seen at Tell\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>Tell could just see Georgia sauntering into his cousins\u2019 wives\u2019 businesses and cranking the charisma on high. His gut seized and his heart stopped. Jesus. Georgia hadn\u2019t shared any private stuff about them, hoping it would spur a sale?</p><p>\u201cSounds like this juicy Georgia peach you\u2019re banging is beautiful, smart and on her game. How long you think you\u2019ll last with her?\u201d Colby asked with a grin.</p><p>More chuckling.</p><p>\u201cAt least until she\u2019s sold ad space to all of Tell\u2019s relatives for the rodeo program guide,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cThen she\u2019ll probably dump his ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. Fuckin\u2019. Ha.\u201d The teasing pissed him off. It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise his cousins were still doing what they had always done; making him feel like he wasn\u2019t up to McKay standards. Like it was a miracle a sexy, smart, savvy woman like Georgia would be interested in him.</p><p>But maybe...there was a grain of truth to that. Georgia had made it plain on Sunday she\u2019d be busy working this week.</p><p>Evidently she\u2019d been busy all right... Busy hitting up all his goddamn relatives for money.</p> <p>\u201cBack to the business at hand, let\u2019s vote on the bunkhouse,\u201d Cord said. \u201cWho wants to torch it?\u201d</p><p>Tell raised his hand and looked around. Not even his brothers backed him on the idea? That sucked.</p><p>\u201cWho wants to discuss this at a later date?\u201d</p><p>The majority of hands went up.</p><p>Kade shook his head. \u201cFine, we can table it for now, but we need to do a daily check until we make a final decision, since we\u2019re headed into fire season. And that means everyone will do his part. I\u2019ll write up a schedule and give everyone a copy. In the interest of fairness, we\u2019ll take one-week shifts and go from oldest to youngest.\u201d</p><p>Colby playfully punched Cord in the arm. \u201cThat means you\u2019re up first, old man.\u201d</p><p>The meeting broke up. Brandt, Tell and Dalton were the last to leave. And because Dalton had opened his big mouth, he was about to get an earful.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bein\u2019 a dick in front of everyone.\u201d</p><p>Dalton frowned at him. \u201cWhat was I a dick about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBringing up Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tell, don\u2019t be such a fuckin\u2019 girl. We give each other shit like this all the time. And if it\u2019d been somebody else, you\u2019da jumped in too.\u201d</p><p>Tell knew his brother was right, but it still stung to be on the receiving end.</p><p>\u201cYou oughta be glad I did, \u2019cause it sounds like you didn\u2019t have a clue about what she\u2019s been doin\u2019.\u201d Dalton gave him a curious look. \u201cYou haven\u2019t heard from her at all since we saw her on Sunday?\u201d</p><p>Damn annoying to admit, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. She was awful damn detached that morning. Like adios sucker, I got what I wanted from you\u2014a date to the reunion\u2014and now I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she couldn\u2019t possibly want more from me than that?\u201d Tell demanded.</p><p>Dalton rubbed a spot between his eyebrows. \u201cLook. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re shocked that she\u2019s takin\u2019 advantage of her connection to you to sell advertising to our family members. Georgia Hotchkiss is a user. She always has been. She always will be. Them type of people don\u2019t change, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always jumped through hoops for her. No matter what she\u2019s asked you. You didn\u2019t moon over her like a lovesick fool, but you were a damn sight giddy whenever she asked for your help with some stupid school project.\u201d</p><p>Tell fumed, but he didn\u2019t lash out, which Dalton took as a sign to keep talking.</p><p>\u201cWho ended up filling a thousand helium balloons for junior/senior prom? You. Was Georgia there after she begged you to help her? Nope. Who had to work the concession stand at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes events? You. And you never was the churchy type like her. Was Georgia there? Nope. Who ended up doin\u2019 all the research and work for the history project senior year? You. Did your partner Georgia help at all? Nope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that shit from the past matters. She has changed. And none of us can be held accountable for who we were in high school.\u201d Jesus. He was beginning to sound like a broken record.</p><p>Dalton started to open his mouth, but Brandt elbowed him, warning, \u201cLeave it be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. If Dalton\u2019s got something else to say, let him, because God knows he ain\u2019t held back so far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Tell, you\u2019d see it if you weren\u2019t lookin\u2019 at her with stars in your eyes. Georgia is back in town to show the people that she ain\u2019t the goody-goody she used to be. Who better to have in her bed for a few weeks before the reunion than a wild McKay? The same McKay her ex hated. The same McKay she\u2019s always easily manipulated. The same McKay who\u2019s been crushing on her for thirteen years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Brandt snapped. \u201cTell\u2019s a big boy. I have a hard time believing he wouldn\u2019t see through that bullshit.\u201d</p><p>While Tell appreciated Brandt sticking up for him, he knew that Dalton\u2019s speculations weren\u2019t that far off base.</p><p>But he had no fucking idea what to do about it.</p><p>One thing was for damn sure; he wasn\u2019t gonna let it ride.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Georgia never imagined that community events were this much fun.</p><p>The years she\u2019d lived in Sundance, she\u2019d only participated minimally in club, school and community events because her parents preferred she devote her free time to church activities.</p><p>Her nervousness about helping out at the heritage day event quickly disappeared when tons of kids showed up at the booth, eager to learn. They\u2019d begged her to recite the alphabet after hearing her count to ten in Russian, telling her how cool it was she knew another language. Which was ironic, because she\u2019d been embarrassed by her mother\u2019s ethnicity as a kid and had hated it when her mother spoke to her in Russian.</p><p>Because this was Sundance, she recognized a lot of people. Not only schoolmates, but teachers and ranchers and people she\u2019d known from church and those who knew her father and mother.</p><p>During a lull, a young blond boy raced up to the booth and bragged he spoke Portuguese. He rattled off numbers and phrases, only to be contradicted in Portuguese by a dark-haired girl who appeared to be his little sister.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know everything, Sophia,\u201d he scoffed.</p><p>\u201cYes I do,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>A devious smile settled on his lip and he asked Georgia, \u201cHow do you say big mouth in Russian?\u201d</p><p>The girl growled and pushed him, sounding like she was cursing at him in Portuguese.</p><p>A shrill whistle had them breaking apart.</p><p>Georgia looked at the trio moving toward the kids. Two good-looking men\u2014one fair and blond, the other man dark-haired with golden skin\u2014and a petite woman. With a hint of Native American heritage and the gait that said real cowgirl, Georgia recognized her immediately. \u201cChassie West?\u201d</p><p>The woman stopped and handed the dark-haired toddler sleeping on her shoulder to the blond man. She cocked her head. \u201cAs I live and breathe, Georgia Hotchkiss, what the devil are you doin\u2019 back in town?\u201d</p><p>Georgia headed straight for Chassie and gave her a big hug. \u201cYou look great! I wondered if you were still around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe took over my dad\u2019s ranch a few years back.\u201d She patted her kids on their heads. \u201cI see you\u2019ve met our oldest kids, Westin and Sophia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were explaining they speak Portuguese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s from Brazil.\u201d Chassie gestured to the stunning dark-haired man. \u201cThat\u2019s Edgard.\u201d Then she pointed to the blond guy grinning at the little girl skipping around them. \u201cThis is Trevor. They are the kids\u2019 fathers.\u201d</p><p>Edgard offered his hand. \u201cAlways enchanted to meet a beautiful friend of our Chassie.\u201d</p><p>Trevor rolled his eyes. \u201cBrazil nut there always has to be the charming one. Nice to meet you, Georgia. You must\u2019ve gone to school with our Chass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we went to the same church. But I\u2019ll admit the last time I set foot in it was at RJ\u2019s funeral.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame thing happened with me after Dag and my dad died.\u201d</p><p>Georgia and Chassie exchanged a long look. Some people mired in grief turned toward the church for solace. It was rare to find another person who\u2019d purposely turned away from the church, when those familiar rituals and tenets seemed like meaningless platitudes. Understanding passed between them as they recognized they\u2019d both lost more than just family members by making that choice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chassie reached out and squeezed her hands. \u201cSo what are you doin\u2019 back in Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>Georgia gave her the condensed version.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love to get together sometime,\u201d Chassie said.</p> <p>\u201cMe too. What\u2019s your number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it!\u201d Sophia said and rattled it off in English. Which prompted Westin to repeat it in Portuguese. Which prompted another argument that Edgard and Trevor immediately nipped in the bud.</p><p>Chassie jotted down her number. \u201cGive me a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, please call her,\u201d Trevor said, kissing Chassie\u2019s cheek. \u201cShe don\u2019t get out as much as she should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m happy at home with you guys,\u201d Chassie protested.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we with you, querida, but sometimes it\u2019s good to mix it up, no?\u201d</p><p>Chassie snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re both just hopin\u2019 Georgia takes me out drinkin\u2019 so I come home and get wild.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love it when you\u2019re wild, darlin\u2019,\u201d Trevor said. \u201cYou turn into something extra special.\u201d</p><p>Edgard and Trevor looked at each other and laughed when Chassie hip-checked them both.</p><p>\u201cNow that my men have thoroughly embarrassed me, I say we go get a drink right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Mama, you promised we\u2019d make cookies tonight,\u201d Sophia complained.</p> <p>\u201cNo worries, Chassie. I\u2019ll take a rain check. And I will call you, I promise.\u201d The family walked away, and Georgia grinned at Westin shouting goodbye to her in multiple languages.</p><p>As the two-hour event wound down, she glanced across the aisle to India, who was applying a fake tattoo to a pigtailed blonde girl. The women she\u2019d met who\u2019d married into the McKay family were all so different. Not at all like the traditional ranch wives she\u2019d known growing up. Georgia remembered that Chassie West was related to some of the McKays, and it appeared she wasn\u2019t living the traditional lifestyle either.</p><p>Georgia had thirty minutes to wander through the exhibits before the event ended. Most the booths were dedicated to agriculture. A few civic organizations, the western preservationist society, the banks, restaurants, and even a couple of local bands had set up displays. For some reason she wasn\u2019t nervous at all about approaching these people and striking up a conversation. Probably because she wasn\u2019t selling anything.</p><p>As she turned the corner, she saw the Sundance High School Rodeo booth. And sitting at the table was Tell McKay.</p><p>Her heart stumbled a little. The man was something. Even wearing a scowl as she approached him.</p><p>\u201cHey, Tell. I\u2019m surprised to see you here.\u201d</p><p>Tell seemed equally shocked to see her. Not in a good way. \u201cGeorgia. Didn\u2019t think community things were your style.\u201d</p><p>That was kind of snarky.</p> <p>\u201cYou here beating the bushes for business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh right, that\u2019s because you\u2019ve already tackled that problem this week, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He pushed to his feet and leaned so close, with such hostility, she was tempted to take a step back. \u201cYou know exactly what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about. Don\u2019t play innocent, Georgia, it\u2019ll just piss me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you complaining because I\u2019ve been so busy this week that I haven\u2019t had time to call you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. The fact I haven\u2019t heard from you ain\u2019t really a surprise because you got what you wanted from me. I thought it\u2019d be different with you this time. But it sure as fuck smacks my pride when your user tactics are pointed out to me by members of my own goddamn family.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth and waited for him to get to the point, since it was obvious he\u2019d just gotten started.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how in the hell I didn\u2019t see past the way you\u2019ve showed up in Sundance actin\u2019 like you own the place, leading me around by my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has a leash around your neck or your balls, least of all me. So quit giving me the wounded man routine and get to the real issue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe real issue is you approached all my cousins\u2019 wives about buying sponsorships for the rodeo program. Actin\u2019 like we\u2019re a couple to guarantee a sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crap, Tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? So you haven\u2019t been asking members of my family for money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have, but it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complete and total bullshit that you used me to get to them. I\u2019m beyond pissed off about this, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>So am I. She stared at him, biting her tongue, attempting to remain civilized.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t got anything to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I have something to say. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed a quirky little thing about the greater Sundance, Moorcroft and Hulett metro area, but quite a few of the businesses are owned by someone in the McKay family. So yes, I approached AJ, India, Skylar, Domini, Ginger, Keely and Ainsley.</p><p>\u201cI also approached the owners of all the bars, restaurants, retail stores, the dentist, the doctor and the sheriff\u2019s department. So I didn\u2019t single out the McKay family for my nefarious plan of promoting a rodeo that will benefit all the business owners in the area. FYI: I didn\u2019t drop your name. Your family members brought up our intimate involvement, not me. And I\u2019ll remind you the see and be seen strategy of convincing everyone in town of our couplehood before the reunion was your idea. Now you\u2019re pissed off it worked? Or were you just hoping people would believe it long enough so you could brag to your McKay cousins that you finally nailed the prom queen?\u201d</p><p>That retort caused the vein in his temple to pulse. \u201cDon\u2019t you twist this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you act like this is a personal assault on you. It had nothing to do with you until you made it about you. I sure as hell don\u2019t need your permission to do my job. Get your facts straight before you start tossing out accusations.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced. Her body vibrated with anger and outrage. And hurt. God, it hurt that Tell thought so lowly of her. The man who\u2019d talked so boldly about people changing...believed she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>His eyes flashed a warning, but no guilt. \u201cThis is not the time nor the place to have this discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou started it!\u201d Take it down a notch. Act cool. \u201cBesides.\u201d She flipped her hair over her shoulder in complete dismissal. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to discuss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. I will be at your house as soon as this thing is over, so you\u2019d better be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis thing is already over.\u201d Georgia turned and walked away, ignoring his attempts to get her attention, fighting her impulse to flip him off.</p><p>Call her contrary, but she didn\u2019t trot home to wait for Mr. Accusatory. She headed straight for the Golden Boot.</p><p>She slipped into a booth and ordered a vodka tonic and a grilled ham and cheese sandwich.</p><p>Tell\u2019s anger surprised her because she hadn\u2019t seen him angry. He was so easygoing at times she wondered if anything made him mad. She\u2019d seen his intense side. His bossy side. But neither of those could be mistaken for anger.</p><p>He had no right to be angry. And she was so fucking pathetic for wondering what angry sex would be like with him that she didn\u2019t notice she\u2019d drained her entire drink in about one minute.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia?\u201d</p><p>Startled out of her glum mood, she glanced up to see Leah and Roxanne standing at the table edge. \u201cHey ladies, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you waiting for Tell or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I helped out at the community center and stopped in\u2014\u201d to avoid Tell, actually, \u201c\u2014for a bite to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMind if we join you?\u201d</p><p>She managed to hide her surprise. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d</p><p>Roxanne and Leah already had drinks. Pink ones. \u201cWhat are you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCosmos. Ned teases me endlessly about my love of girly drinks. But if I drink beer, I feel like shit the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBull, Rox. You feel like shit because you\u2019re usually doing tequila shooters and drinking beer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. So let\u2019s order a cosmo for Georgia so we don\u2019t look like lushes.\u201d</p><p>After they toasted, Leah blurted, \u201cYou are so different from what I remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve had the big change of heart? Did I pass some secret test?\u201d</p><p>Leah looked thoughtful. \u201cWell, we did take a hard look at our small-town, bitchy selves after what you said in the parking lot that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019ve gotta respect you called us out on it. Plus, it took a lot of balls to show up at the reunion. Not only because Deck is now your ex, but also because you lost RJ.\u201d Roxanne patted her arm. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine losing my sister. Sometimes she annoys the piss outta me, but she\u2019s my best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s probably why I didn\u2019t have many close girlfriends in high school\u2014because I had RJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019ve got us now, and we\u2019re making up for lost time.\u201d Roxanne smiled. \u201cNow that we\u2019re pals and all, I gotta ask you something. And be warned, it\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, Rox, way to put her on the spot,\u201d Leah grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou can ask, but that doesn\u2019t mean I have to answer,\u201d Georgia said coyly.</p><p>\u201cWere you really a virgin throughout high school?\u201d Roxanne leaned forward. \u201cI mean, you proudly wore a purity ring. And Ned said Deck got pissed whenever someone asked him if you two were doin\u2019 it. But I\u2019ll bet you were doin\u2019 the nasty and lying about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically, yes, I was virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTechnically?\u201d Rox repeated.</p><p>\u201cDeck and I didn\u2019t have intercourse until we were married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo in other words, you messed around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot. I had broad knowledge of certain non-penetration acts involving my hands and mouth.\u201d She smirked and pinned Leah with a look. \u201cHow about you and Warner?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leah laughed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t save it for marriage. But you probably got the better end of the deal by holding Deck off for a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe benefit of lots of foreplay because that\u2019s all you could do. Once you start screwing...that groping, grinding and crazy-kissing part of sex becomes less important.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never thought about it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell does any guy know about sex at age sixteen anyway?\u201d Rox sighed. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why I was bitter about you wearing that purity ring. I shoulda waited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know part of the reason Deck and I were at the altar a month after graduation was so he could finally fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Roxanne choked on her drink. \u201cNo shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a good way to start a marriage,\u201d Georgia said dryly. \u201cBecause the deed lasted less than a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was the other reason Deck married you?\u201d Leah asked.</p><p>\u201cTo go into the family cattle business with my father and RJ.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy parents weren\u2019t happy about me\u2019n Warner tying the knot when I turned nineteen. They wanted us to wait. We didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The sandwich arrived and the conversation lagged while she ate.</p><p>As soon as Georgia finished eating, Leah whistled for the waitress. \u201cA round of shooters.\u201d</p><p>Those shooters went down the hatch pretty damn easily. Especially when the toasts were directed to our new fun friend, Georgia.</p> <p>I do too know how to have fun, Tell.</p><p>And Georgia was having a great time. Amidst Leah and Roxanne\u2019s heated discussion about the TV show Tabatha\u2019s Salon Takeover, a couple of young, good-looking guys came by the table and hit on them. Georgia might\u2019ve felt self-conscious that two married women were more accomplished flirts, but these ladies were just too damn entertaining. Somehow the duo convinced the guys to buy them another round of shots and then charmed them into leaving.</p><p>Leah and Roxanne called their technique for procuring free drinks the power of the cleavage.</p><p>A power Georgia breezily admitted she\u2019d been born without. Which sent her new pals into hiccupping laughter.</p><p>Roxanne got that look in her eye again and Georgia braced herself. \u201cOkay, Miss G-Thang. Next snoopy question. Can you still do a herkie?\u201d</p><p>Georgia rolled her eyes at Roxanne. Miss G-Thang was her new nickname? \u201cThose are easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. You\u2019re the one who said it\u2019s easy,\u201d Leah said with sweet belligerence. \u201cSo do one.\u201d</p><p>She could stall. The chatty pair would probably forget about it and move onto another topic. \u201cI\u2019ll need another shot.\u201d</p><p>Leah motioned to the cocktail waitress and she dropped off three tequila shooters.</p><p>Roxanne smirked. \u201cAre you gonna do the shot before you jump? Or after?\u201d</p><p>Now she was stuck. \u201cAfter.\u201d</p><p>The women clapped and whistled like her private cheering section.</p><p>Georgia scooted out of the booth. She\u2019d done this many times, piece of cake. She briefly closed her eyes\u2014whoa, not good for her balance after a few drinks\u2014and reopened them, smiling, bouncy, peppy, in total cheerleader mode. She clapped her hands twice and followed it with a double fist pump.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on a roll, sista. Do it!\u201d They chanted Georgia, Georgia, Georgia.</p><p>She brought her body into alignment. She threw her arms in the air, performing back-to-back herkies. And she added in a pike, just to mix it up.</p><p>Applause broke out. Even some catcalls.</p><p>Breathing a little hard and thankful she practiced Pilates to stay limber, Georgia knocked back the shot and exchanged high fives with Roxanne and Leah.</p><p>\u201cNow one of you has to do something since I totally humiliated myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Leah said, sliding out of the booth. \u201cEver seen the movie Coyote Ugly? That\u2019s me\u2019n Rox\u2019s favorite. And sometimes, if it\u2019s kinda slow in here, Lettie lets us do that boot-scootin\u2019 dance on the bar. Let\u2019s ask her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut only if you\u2019ll do it with us, Georgia.\u201d Roxanne cocked her head, sizing Georgia up as she scooted from the booth to stood beside her. \u201cMen love to watch chicks\u2019 body parts bouncing. If you did a couple cheerleading jumps off the end of the bar? All sexy-like? Dude. We\u2019d be drinkin\u2019 free all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHells yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m talkin\u2019 about,\u201d Leah said, giving them each a fist bump.</p><p>\u201cSorry, ladies, but that ain\u2019t happening.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s heart jumped into her throat when she heard Tell\u2019s voice behind her. She turned around and looked into his furious face.</p><p>\u201cHi, Tell,\u201d Roxanne said brightly. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying to spoil our fun, sounds like,\u201d Leah said suspiciously, \u201cwhich is ironic since Tell McKay is the self-proclaimed king of fun, right?\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s eyes never left Georgia\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m lookin\u2019 for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Didja have a date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Georgia said to him. \u201cBut if you wanna hang around, after I\u2019m done dancing on the bar I\u2019ll sell you some ad space for the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo program guide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot. Fucking. Funny. Say your goodbyes, Georgia. We\u2019re leavin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Then Roxanne and Leah were flanking her. \u201cNot so fast. You\u2019re looking a little pissed off, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am pissed off and this doesn\u2019t concern you, Roxanne. So butt out,\u201d Tell said in a measured tone.</p><p>Leah wagged her finger in his face. \u201cAccording to the girlfriend code\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tell put his mouth on Georgia\u2019s ear. \u201cYou can walk out. Or I carry you out. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>His he-man tactics ticked her off, making her bolder than usual. Or maybe that was the booze. Putting her hand on his chest, she pushed him back. \u201cYou butt out, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Roxanne and Leah released a chorus of oohs.</p><p>Georgia turned her back on him and continued the conversation, although Tell\u2019s angry gaze was hot enough to burn holes in her clothes. \u201cDo we choose our own music for the table dance? Because \u2018Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\u2019 would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her sentence ended in a shriek as Tell picked her up and tossed her over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakin\u2019 good on my warning.\u201d</p><p>She kicked and thrashed until he clamped his arms more tightly around her legs. She beat on his butt with her fists. \u201cLet me go, you jackass.\u201d</p><p>Tell strode away. Jeers, whistles and more catcalls followed them outside.</p><p>So did Roxanne and Leah. They were trying to free her from Tell\u2019s fireman\u2019s hold until he yelled, \u201cEnough! This is between me and Georgia. Now go on home to your husbands before I call them myself and tell them what you\u2019ve been up to tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know what we\u2019ve been doing?\u201d Roxanne demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ve been watchin\u2019 you for the last two hours.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cUh. Georgia, we had a great time tonight, but we\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Leah made the universal hand signal for call me and their boots were smoking, they took off so fast.</p><p>Traitors. Leaving her with a pissed-off Tell.</p><p>\u201cPut me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I put you down, I\u2019m putting you over my knee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry it and I\u2019ll rack you,\u201d she snarled.</p><p>\u201cTough girl, are you now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCaveman, are you now?\u201d she mimicked.</p><p>His response was a low-pitched warning growl.</p><p>She thrashed, smacking her hands into his butt as he carried her to God knew where.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Tell flipped her around and set her on her feet. Then he pulled her blouse over her head and down to her wrists, tying some cowboy knot that immobilized her arms from hands to elbows.</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking serious? You tied me up with my own goddamn shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. And if you keep bitching at me, I\u2019m gonna gag you with your bra too.\u201d</p><p>She gasped. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare.\u201d</p><p>Tell was right in her face. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>Shit. His don\u2019t fuck with me male thing was a total panty-dampening turn-on.</p><p>What the hell is wrong with you?</p><p>That made her rally. \u201cIf you think for a second I\u2019ll let you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He rested his hands on her shoulders and placed his thumbs over the pulse points in her neck. \u201cTwo things. First: do you really think I\u2019d hurt you, Georgia? Out of anger? Because if your answer is yes, well, then the second thing don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes searched his. Tell might push her boundaries, but he wouldn\u2019t do anything she didn\u2019t want him to. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Second thing: we\u2019re gonna air out our differences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I be tied up during this discussion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you wanna be?\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to deny it, only to have Tell\u2019s mouth on hers. Kissing her with such potency she felt her resistance melting into a warm puddle alongside her sanity.</p><p>The longer he kissed her, the more she understood the different ways he could communicate everything about the way he felt, just with his wicked mouth.</p><p>He released her mouth in tiny increments, smooching, nibbling, nuzzling, leaving tiny love bites until they were both breathing normally again. \u201cNow, see? Ain\u2019t it better that I didn\u2019t gag you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed.</p><p>\u201cBut I am gonna keep you trussed up for a little while yet. Gives me all sorts of interesting ideas. Hang on.\u201d He swept her into his arms, carrying her to the passenger side of his truck. \u201cAnd you might as well relax, \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna be a long night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Once they were in Georgia\u2019s house, Tell made his move. Before she turned the lights on.</p><p>Not that she could with her hands tied.</p><p>Good thing she couldn\u2019t see his smug smile about that fact. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They probably oughta talk, because unresolved issues hung between them, but talking wasn\u2019t his strong suit. He always said the wrong thing, which made the situation worse. Or he cracked the wrong joke at the wrong time. When he tried to be serious, no one took him seriously\u2014another drawback from being known as the fun-lovin\u2019 jokester. Everyone expected him to be that way all the time.</p><p>He crowded her against the wall, bracing his hands by her head. Then he began the seduction, whispering, \u201cClose your eyes,\u201d into her ear.</p><p>\u201cUmm. What happened to us talking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we were gonna air out our grievances.\u201d He nibbled on her lobe.</p><p>\u201cWithout words?\u201d</p><p>Tell pressed an openmouthed kiss behind her ear. \u201cActions speak louder than words, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cThe words will come after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I touch you.\u201d He rubbed his mouth over her skin. \u201cAfter I taste you. I\u2019m dyin\u2019 for you, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>Another shiver, followed by a moan.</p><p>\u201cArch your neck.\u201d He trailed sucking kisses down the cord straining in her neck. Stopping to sweep his lips across her collarbone. \u201cBe honest. Me goin\u2019 caveman on you turns you on.\u201d</p><p>No response.</p><p>He bit down on the skin between her neck and shoulder.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s entire body vibrated.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you jerk. You know it does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does knowin\u2019 what you like make me a jerk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause whenever you use that bossy tone and then put your mouth on me, I lose any rational train of thought. And I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m mad at you too. So maybe it\u2019s not my mouth you oughta be worrying about, sweetness, but my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember when I warned you that anything you did to me, I\u2019d do to you? Do you have any idea how many times your hand connected with my ass tonight?\u201d</p> <p>She immediately stiffened. \u201cNo! And even if I did, they shouldn\u2019t count because I was under duress!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuress?\u201d he growled. \u201cHot lips, I was under duress seein\u2019 you drinkin\u2019 with them wild women, wondering what all you were tellin\u2019 them about us.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes locked defiantly to his. \u201cI had four drinks over two hours. And I didn\u2019t tell them anything. What goes on between you and me stays between you and me. I don\u2019t kiss and tell, Tell.\u201d She snickered, but her humor faded when he didn\u2019t laugh. \u201cYou still look surprised that I\u2019m not blabbing far and wide, so you really must think the worst of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here if I\u2019m such an untrustworthy blabbermouth?\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his jaw along hers. \u201cYou know why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Especially not after you accused me of taking advantage of your family because we are...whatever this is.\u201d</p><p>Looked like it was up to him to define it. \u201cWhatever this is...is a relationship. Although neither of us wanted to name it, that\u2019s what it\u2019s been since day one.\u201d He eased back and peered into her eyes, half-afraid she\u2019d deny it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good with that?\u201d she asked carefully.</p><p>\u201cYep. Are you? If we continue to keep it casual?\u201d</p><p>Georgia lifted her chin. \u201cJust sex?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s been about more than just sex for us since day one too. I can admit that now. Can you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She briefly closed her eyes and pressed her mouth to his. \u201cI missed you this week. I thought about you a lot. And I\u2019m sorry that I was too unsure about us and this...relationship just to pick up the damn phone and call you.\u201d</p><p>This sweetness was one of his favorite things about her. \u201cSame here. For us supposedly bein\u2019 ten years older and wiser, we sure acted like teens a snit, didn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly. \u201cLet\u2019s not do that anymore. We\u2019ll act like adults. So should we spit on our hands and shake on it? Or will a pinkie promise work better?\u201d</p><p>Damn woman made him laugh. \u201cHow about if we just seal the deal with a kiss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d She took his mouth like she owned it. And damn if that didn\u2019t make him hard as a fucking fence post.</p><p>Once he caught his breath, he said, \u201cAs long as we\u2019re clearing the air, I\u2019m sorry I listened to bullshit speculation from my family before I talked to you. You deserve better from me. I was a dick. It won\u2019t happen again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>Georgia seemed taken aback by the apology. She was even more surprised when he murmured, \u201cThat said, darlin\u2019, you\u2019re still getting a spanking.\u201d Then he fused his mouth to hers. Kissing her until his cock was hard as concrete and her lithe body bowed into his.</p><p>When they came up for air, Tell loved the bee-stung look of her lips after his harsh kisses.</p><p>After untying her shirt and freeing her arms, he said, \u201cTurn around.\u201d As soon as she was in position, he nuzzled the back of her head, breathing in her scent. \u201cSince I\u2019m feelin\u2019...generous, I\u2019m gonna let you keep your pants on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it won\u2019t be your bare hand on my bare ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound disappointed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing. Because you earned fourteen pops on this perfect butt of yours.\u201d He kept his mouth by her ear, teasing with his hot breath and hotter words. \u201cHow pink you think your ass will be when I get done?\u201d</p><p>She squirmed.</p><p>\u201cI guarantee we\u2019ll both feel the burn, even through the denim.\u201d He traced the curve at the top of her ear with a fleeting lick of his tongue. \u201cBut if you were bare-assed, I\u2019d use my tongue to cool down those flaming cheeks when I finished.\u201d His nose slipped behind her ear, following that section of skin to the hollow below the lobe. \u201cCan\u2019t you just feel my mouth all over your sweet ass?\u201d</p><p>He felt her swallow hard.</p><p>\u201cBend over and brace yourself.\u201d</p><p>Georgia flattened her palms on the wall, making her body into a ninety-degree angle.</p><p>Goddamn she looked beautiful. He ran his hands up her spine and across the compact line of her shoulders. There was just one problem. He slid his hands into her hair and tugged her head up. \u201cBetter. Stay like that.\u201d</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder at him, not defiantly, but warily. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna need to see your face, sweetness. See if you like what I\u2019m doin\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me to stop and I will.\u201d</p><p>Georgia broke eye contact first.</p><p>Tell let his hands roam over her. Never staying too long in one place. Rubbing. Stroking. Petting. Building the tension. He finally gave in and smacked her left butt cheek.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She dropped her chin to her chest and seemed to gather herself. Then she raised her head, ready for the next one.</p><p>But Tell had no intention of dragging this out or making her count the strokes. He swatted her ass with hard, fast strokes. By the time he finished, Georgia had been pushing back into him for each spank. Her breathing came in short pants and she whimpered softly. Sexily.</p><p>Slapping his hands on the wall above hers, Tell caged her body beneath his.</p><p>Georgia cranked her head around to get at his mouth. Kissing him crazily. Hot flashing tongue, lips shifting on his as she tried to swallow him whole.</p><p>That buzz of need became louder and louder until Tell had to force himself to stop kissing her. \u201cI gotta know... Are you wet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she practically sobbed. \u201cI never knew it could be like that... God. That was nothing like the spankings I got as a kid.\u201d</p><p>He released a strangled laugh.</p><p>She rolled her spine against his chest, pressing her ass into his groin. \u201cPlease. I feel like I\u2019m about to burst.\u201d</p><p>After one last nip to her nape, Tell pushed upright. Then he tugged on her shoulders and spun her back into the wall, again trapping her body beneath his. \u201cI want you in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Another soft pass of his lips over hers. \u201cAnd I want your mouth on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A pause as his intent became clear, then, \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLift your arms.\u201d As soon as she did, Tell whisked off the lacy camisole and filled his hands with her breasts. He pressed kisses from her mouth, down her throat, between her cleavage, lowering himself to his knees, continuing his southerly progression, only stopping when he reached the waistband of her jeans. Stopping to marvel that this beautiful woman was sharing so much with him besides her body.</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm. Sorry. Just takin\u2019 a minute to admire the view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Could you admire and take my jeans off faster? Because you\u2019ve got me all kinds of worked up.\u201d</p><p>Smirking at her, he fingered the button before his thumb flicked it open. Then he worked her zipper down slowly. Such a fucking rush, watching the heated impatience warming those icy-blue eyes.</p><p>Georgia lifted a brow. \u201cRemember that whatever you do to me, I do to you\u2014the exact same way.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and yanked her pants to her ankles. \u201cStep outta them shoes.\u201d After she kicked them and her jeans aside, he placed his mouth over her mound. Tonguing her clit through the silky fabric. Breathing in the scent of her arousal. Snaking his tongue beneath the elastic to taste her.</p><p>\u201cGod. Do that about a hundred more times, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a minute.\u201d She really got squirmy when her panties were gone and no barriers remained between them. He slid his hands up the inside of the thighs, intending to spread her open for a little kiss, when Georgia clamped her hands around his face and her legs shut.</p><p>\u201cHuh-uh. My turn. Stand up so I can strip you.\u201d She smirked. \u201cAnd play with you a little.\u201d When he was on his feet, she pushed him against the wall.</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>Georgia attacked the buttons on his shirt. Once it hung open, her hands were everywhere on his chest. The way her nails scraped down his pectorals hardened his nipples and his cock, making it damn hard to swallow. She swirled her finger inside his belly button. She traced each rib. She outlined every cut muscle. With her tongue. Oblivious to the way his body shook, she played with his nipples. Sucking, biting. Twisting with just the tips of her fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Generally driving him out of his fucking mind, which he probably deserved.</p><p>She knelt at his feet and said, \u201cGimme your heel so I can take off your boot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay, I can do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll either let me do it, or that big cock of yours isn\u2019t going in my mouth.\u201d</p><p>A little shocked by her vehemence, Tell lifted his foot. \u201cWho made you boss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just did.\u201d She cupped her hand around the bootheel and pulled up. \u201cNext.\u201d</p><p>This was weird. And thank God he\u2019d put on clean sweat socks today. Ever since he was a kid, he\u2019d been self-conscious about his smelly feet. He reached down to pull her up before she could get a whiff, but she slithered out of his grasp.</p><p>\u201cI mean it, Tell, knock it off. You keep your hands on the wall and let me do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Be honest. \u201cBecause...fuck. My feet smell like something goddamn died in my boots, okay? I don\u2019t want you...\u201d</p><p>Georgia merely blinked at him as she tugged off his sock. Then she bent down and...</p><p>No. Holy mother of God, no...</p><p>She licked his foot, straight across the knuckles of his toes. Twice. Then she slipped her tongue between the webbing of each toe. Twice.</p><p>Fuck. His knees damn near buckled. He just about shot in his jeans. Who knew that was so erotic? And goddamn she turned an embarrassing moment into something so sweet and hot.</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t protest when she removed his other sock. But he was in no way prepared for when Georgia licked and sucked on his toes. Who knew an invisible line ran from his feet to his balls? Every lick felt like she had her tongue on his sac.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>When she rose to her knees, he grabbed her biceps and hauled her up so they were nose to nose. \u201cYour pussy in my face. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>He picked her up and carried her into the living room, setting her on the reclining chair.</p> <p>Georgia\u2019s eyes were enormous and brimming with heat. He stripped off his jeans and boxers. His gaze encompassed the reclining chair as he walked toward her.</p><p>\u201cShould that wild look in your eyes scare me, cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you\u2019re not flexible enough for the way I wanna try this. But I saw you doin\u2019 them cheerleading jumps, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna be an issue, bendy girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019ve got my attention.\u201d Her eyes ran the length of his body and zeroed in on his cock. \u201cBut then, you\u2019ve had it since the instant I saw you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d Tell set his palms on the cushiony armrest and kissed her. \u201cRemember when you said you\u2019d take me any way you could get me? Inside, outside, upside down? Well, sweetness, we\u2019re about to test that last one.\u201d He patted her thigh. \u201cSpin around so your head is in the seat and your legs are on the backrest.</p><p>She shot him a crooked grin and flipped around.</p><p>And motherfuck if it didn\u2019t make his mouth water, seeing her legs splitting into a V, showing that juicy pussy. He grabbed a pillow off the couch and nestled it behind her butt.</p><p>With the recliner back a click, her head hung off the edge of the seat and her legs were splayed around the sides of the chair.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s breath caught when Tell widened his stance and rested on his forearms on the arm rests. Then he put his mouth on her wet sex.</p><p>She moaned.</p><p>He could feel her ragged breath on his shaft. The first tentative lick. The wet heat of her mouth enclosing the tip. Then her fingernails raking up the insides of his thighs to reach his balls.</p><p>Christ. He was not gonna last.</p><p>Without the use of his hands, he had to get creative with his tongue and lips and teeth on her pussy. When he pulled back from jamming his tongue in that creamy channel, he let his five o\u2019clock shadow lightly graze her clit.</p><p>That caused her to arch, which sent his cock all the way into her throat.</p><p>Don\u2019t come.</p><p>Georgia clutched the outside of his thighs, setting the pace of how deep and how fast she\u2019d take him. And holy crap could she take him deep in this position.</p><p>He lapped at her clit. Swirled his tongue around it. Flicked it, teased it until her legs shook and her belly muscles tightened. She was close.</p><p>And thank you, Jesus, because he didn\u2019t know how much longer he could hold off. With her jacking motions and the saliva from her wet mouth making his cock so slippery and ready to blow.</p><p>Tell zeroed in on that swollen pearl. His face was coated with her juices, and as he licked that swollen nub, his tongue still sought out more of her creamy taste.</p><p>Never enough. He\u2019d never get enough of this woman.</p><p>She nearly arched off the chair when she hit her peak.</p><p>His cock had slipped out of her mouth as she wailed a long stream; the only discernible word was his name. Her pussy spasmed against his mouth with such strong pulses he wanted to roar with pride that he\u2019d brought her to this point.</p><p>With just his mouth. Heh heh.</p><p>Tell nuzzled the inside of her thigh and the top of her mound as the orgasm wound down. Wishing he could use his hands to stroke and soothe her as well.</p><p>Then that wonderful, wet, sucking mouth was on his cock again. Focused on the head while her fingers stroked his balls and shaft. When he pumped his hips, she moved her hand faster.</p><p>That spark of release began in the base of his spine and traveled up, slowly, like a roller coaster climbing that first hill. His stomach was tight; his ass was clenched waiting for that first drop...and then bam. Plummeting into a chasm of dark pleasure. Come shooting out the end of his dick in hot bursts, and a thick tongue swallowing and a soft muscle milking the head until he had nothing left. Not seed. Not breath. Not sanity.</p><p>Whoo-ee.</p><p>After he\u2019d realized his arms were quaking, he stood.</p><p>His head was still spinning, his heart still thumping, and he glanced down at Georgia to see the same dazed look on her face. Her upside-down face.</p><p>Then she grinned at him and waggled her eyebrows.</p><p>In that moment he knew this woman was everything he\u2019d ever wanted.</p><p>When she spun around, he hauled her into his arms, giving her flirty kisses and a slap on the ass. \u201cYou.\u201d Kiss. \u201cKnocked.\u201d Kiss. \u201cMy.\u201d Kiss. \u201cSocks.\u201d Kiss. \u201cOff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I pulled them off, but I\u2019ll take the compliment, sexy beast that you are.\u201d She smoothed her hands over his chest. \u201cSo are we okay? Is there anything else that happened this week that I need to explain?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I meant what I said, Georgia. I should\u2019ve come to you first, instead of showin\u2019 up all pissed off after the fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that an apology for throwing me over your shoulder and hauling me out of the Golden Boot?\u201d</p><p>He flashed his teeth in a predatory smile. \u201cNope. I\u2019m not sorry about that at all. I shouldn\u2019t have been so pigheaded about callin\u2019 you either.\u201d He brushed her wild strands of hair back in place. \u201cI\u2019m not good at this datin\u2019 stuff. I\u2019ve always claimed I don\u2019t like playing games, but it appears that\u2019s what I was doin\u2019 with you. Testing you to see if you really wanted to see me after the reunion. Waitin\u2019 to see if you called me first.\u201d His cheeks burned. \u201cI know. What am I? Fourteen? That was just fuckin\u2019 stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of unsettling that we both keep reverting to adolescent behavior.\u201d</p><p>Somehow Tell kept himself from making farting noises. Although Georgia probably would\u2019ve laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll try harder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow how about if we get cleaned up, pop some popcorn and make out on the couch for a little while before I have to go home?\u201d He saw disappointment in her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t stay tonight. Can you come to my place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have to leave early for the two-day rodeo in Evanston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I could go with you.\u201d Sometimes being a rancher sucked ass. \u201cBut I promise I\u2019ll have a fun surprise planned for when you get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFun,\u201d she repeated. \u201cShould I be scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>\u201cMiniature golf,\u201d Georgia repeated.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to play mini golf with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your big, fun surprise?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cCome on. Admit you weren\u2019t expecting that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. And I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t know why you picked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you need fun in your life. And as the McKay who\u2019s been called the ambassador of fun, aka the boy who won\u2019t grow up, I have much better ideas on how to have fun\u2014with our clothes on\u2014than you do.\u201d</p><p>As flip as his answer sounded, Georgia read between the quips. \u201cDo your cousins call you that because they believe you\u2019re out having fun all the time, while they\u2019re tied down with wives and kids? Do any of them know how hard you work on the ranch? Or how much time you volunteer to the community? Or how much time you spend helping out your immediate family? If anyone deserves to cut loose, it\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>His beautiful smile faded and she wanted to kick her own butt for causing it.</p><p>\u201cTell. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s none of my business.\u201d</p><p>He curled his hand around the side of her face. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by what you pick up on that most people, even my own family, don\u2019t. The truth is, there wasn\u2019t a lot of fun in my house growing up, so I learned to make my own. That way when I was away from home, I couldn\u2019t blame anyone but myself for how things played out. Havin\u2019 fun didn\u2019t come natural, as my brothers can attest. Dalton is better at cutting loose than Brandt is, just because he\u2019s younger and I could beat it into him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly, even when a little pain had lodged below her heart.</p><p>\u201cSo what do ya say? A trip to Spearfish for putt-putt golf and a steak dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I resist?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After the ninth hole out of eighteen, Georgia realized why she never played mini golf: because she sucked at it.</p><p>She sighed and smacked the crap out of her stupid pink ball, and it bounced out of the stupid maze into the stupid grass.</p><p>\u201cAh, sweetness? That was your eleventh stroke. Why did you hit it so hard?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I was hoping the ball would blow up so I didn\u2019t have to finish this dumb game.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and his damn dimples winked at her.</p><p>Argh. She wanted to whack the golf club against the wooden bridge out of pure frustration. How could Mr. Mini Golf Pro Tell have such a great disposition when she was having a lousy time?</p><p>Then those devilish dimples were right in her face. \u201cSuch a sexy pout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pouting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, you are. Want me to tickle a smile out of you again?\u201d</p><p>Georgia swung the golf club like a baseball bat and snarled.</p><p>Tell held up his hands in surrender and backed off. \u201cOkay, I\u2019d rather see you pout than let you brain me with a putter because I\u2019m winning.\u201d His lips twitched. \u201cSo let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t make the game more interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? Are you gonna let me turn that replica gold-miner\u2019s shack into a real fire trap when I throw a match on the roof?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cEver notice you have violent tendencies when you\u2019re not winning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho likes losing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a game. It\u2019s supposed to be fun. F-u-n, Georgia. Spell it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-u-c-k your f-u-n, McKay.\u201d</p><p>The man busted a gut, which made it impossible to stay mad at him. She smiled. \u201cFine. What\u2019s your suggestion for f-u-n?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you went thirty-seven strokes over in the first round, let\u2019s make the extra strokes...count in the second game.\u201d</p><p>This could be entertaining. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery penalty stroke\u2014meaning anything over six shots per hole\u2014will earn you a penalty when we get home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of penalty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hard smack on your butt. You across my knee. Bare-assed.\u201d He shrugged and tossed the neon-green golf ball in the air and caught it. \u201cI\u2019d probably tie your hands. Maybe even gag you.\u201d</p> <p>Gulp. \u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>A smirk. \u201cSame deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not fair! You haven\u2019t had a single hole over three strokes this entire game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better concentrate, hadn\u2019t you? If you don\u2019t want your ass smarting come morning.\u201d He plundered her mouth with a toe-curling kiss. \u201cYou can ask for my assistance at any time. Because, hot lips, you\u2019re gonna need all the help you can get. I am so lookin\u2019 forward to meting out your penalties.\u201d</p><p>Hah! She\u2019d show him. She\u2019d win this damn game. Or at least keep herself from getting a minimum of nine butt slaps.</p><p>That\u2019s when Georgia started to have fun. Tell teased her endlessly. Trash-talked her at every hole. Copped a feel whenever possible. Snuck kisses. Touched her just because he always had to be touching her. Which was really hot. He touched her in a way that was sweet to her, but held the back the fuck off she\u2019s mine vibe to any guy giving her a once-over.</p><p>By the time they reached the last hole, she\u2019d had a miraculous improvement in her golf game. Only three penalty strokes, which Tell offered to waive if she gave his cock three long, thorough strokes. With her mouth.</p><p>Heckuva deal, in her opinion.</p><p>At Applebee\u2019s, Tell insisted on sitting on the same side of the booth as her. She ordered a dirty-girl lemonade and he opted for Crown and water.</p><p>They talked while waiting for their food. Easy conversation about their work plans for the upcoming week. She told him about the rodeo, but decided not to mention the committee had hired Deck as a judge.</p><p>She felt like a complete idiot that she\u2019d missed Deck\u2019s name on both the PRCA and non-PRCA judges\u2019 list. Granted, his name was at the bottom, since he didn\u2019t judge much, but after their run-in, she\u2019d flipped through her paperwork and discovered they were working at another event this summer. All three of them\u2014Deck, Tell and her. Together. That oughta be a laugh riot\u2014not.</p><p>She decided to avoid mentioning it until right before the actual event. It wasn\u2019t worth getting Tell\u2019s back up or setting them both on edge. And who knew what would happen between her and Tell between now and then? Maybe they\u2019d break up.</p><p>The thought of that caused her stomach to somersault. Letting him know she was leaving at summer\u2019s end would be the responsible thing to do, but the more time she spent with Tell, the more time she wanted to spend with him. And she knew if she told him, he\u2019d end it now. She wasn\u2019t ready for that.</p><p>Georgia sighed softly and laid her head on his shoulder\u2014just because she could.</p><p>\u201cBe honest. Did you have fun today?\u201d Tell had one arm around her and gently trailed his fingertips across her bicep.</p><p>\u201cYes. I always have a great time with you. No matter if we\u2019re having a popcorn fight, or if we\u2019re out at a bar, or if we\u2019re in bed. I like being with you, Tell.\u201d</p><p>He cupped his hand around her jaw, turning her face toward his. Georgia expected a gentle peck, but he flipped all her switches to overload with a hungry kiss.</p><p>The insistent mating of mouths was a little much for a public restaurant. But again, Tell lived in the moment. He\u2019d just told her he felt the same way, without saying anything at all.</p><p>\u201cFor pity\u2019s sake, Tell McKay, what is wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t rip his mouth from hers as he ended the kiss, but every muscle in his body seized up. He glanced at the man standing at the end of the table.</p><p>The resemblance was obvious.</p><p>\u201cDad. What are you doin\u2019 here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidja forget I spend Sundays in Spearfish goin\u2019 to church? Not that you\u2019ve ever bothered to visit my house or the Lord\u2019s house.\u201d</p><p>The man\u2019s mean blue-eyed gaze landed on Georgia. \u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia Hotchkiss. Who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell\u2019s father. Not that I wanna claim him some days when he does stupid stuff like this.\u201d</p><p>Before she responded, Casper McKay slid into the opposite bench seat. He scrutinized Tell. \u201cSo I hadta hear from my brothers the annual meeting was held last week. Why didn\u2019t one of you boys tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you can\u2019t vote, and after what happened last time, you can\u2019t honestly be surprised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, they can talk about drinkin\u2019 and whorin\u2019 all day long, but when I asked to say a prayer before the meeting started, you\u2019da thought I\u2019d asked to rape a goat.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s cheeks turned bright red. \u201cJesus, Dad. Do you have to do this now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch your language,\u201d Casper snapped. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine this lady wants to hear your filthy mouth.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I wanna hear his dirty talk more than you can fathom, you clueless SOB.</p><p>Tell said nothing. Just sipped his drink.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t heard from Brandt since I saw my new grandson last Sunday. You were there when he promised to call me.\u201d</p><p>Georgia realized that one thing Dalton and Tell had referred to was code for a family situation involving the prickly Casper. What a relief.</p><p>\u201cI imagine he didn\u2019t call because he\u2019s tired of hearin\u2019 you just rag on them to get the baby baptized according to your time frame.\u201d</p><p>Casper\u2019s nostrils flared. \u201cAlways gotta place the blame on me, doncha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it usually falls on you.\u201d</p><p>What was taking their food so long?</p><p>Georgia looked up to see Casper staring at her. \u201cHotchkiss, huh? You Robert\u2019s kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. What church do you go to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, that\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Tell.\u201d She smiled at Casper. \u201cWhen I lived here before, we were Evangelical Free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia recently moved back to Sundance from Dallas,\u201d Tell offered.</p><p>\u201cThe girl can speak for herself, can\u2019t she?\u201d Casper retorted. \u201cIt\u2019s so like you, boy, always trying to smooth things over. We\u2019re just talkin\u2019. Ain\u2019t like I\u2019m gonna tell her embarrassing secrets about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad. Stop.\u201d</p><p>Casper stretched his arm across the back of the booth. \u201cDidja talk to your mother about her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Georgia. And I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s any of your business what Mom and I talk about.\u201d</p><p>Casper grinned meanly at Tell and addressed Georgia. \u201cBetter watch this one. He ain\u2019t interested in settling down. Especially if he ain\u2019t mentioned you to his mama yet.\u201d</p><p>Tell drained his drink.</p><p>Georgia hadn\u2019t been raised to backtalk her elders. So as much as she wanted to brag that the kinky, anything-goes sex was keeping her interest, not the chance to snag a McKay, she wouldn\u2019t dare. But it broke her heart to watch Tell being miserable.</p><p>\u201cHis mother and I got divorced,\u201d Casper said out of the blue.</p><p>\u201cMy folks got divorced too, after my brother, RJ, died in a car accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember that. But it wasn\u2019t no accident. He was drivin\u2019 drunk, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d And thank you for pointing that out.</p><p>\u201cI done my share of that. Ain\u2019t proud to say it even when I know now I had angels watching over me. Praise the Lord he\u2019s on my side, helpin\u2019 me stay outta the bottle. You\u2019re lucky he didn\u2019t take no one else with him. Not like what happened with my oldest son, Luke. Some jackass didn\u2019t know how to drive in the fog and my boy paid the price.\u201d</p><p>Finally their food arrived and Georgia hoped Casper would take a hike. But she feared he might be inclined to stay and say grace.</p><p>Tell started shoveling in the side of mixed veggies.</p><p>Casper said, \u201cYou know it wouldn\u2019t kill ya to say thanks to the Lord for all you\u2019ve got before you eat like you\u2019ve never seen food.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Tell kept chewing.</p><p>\u201cYou are stubborn.\u201d Then Casper addressed her. \u201cYou wanna hear stubborn? When Tell was about fourteen, we had this old, worthless fishing boat. He thought he could get it runnin\u2019, despite the fact he\u2019s hopeless when it comes to mechanical stuff. I told him he was wastin\u2019 his time. He spent every wakin\u2019 hour workin\u2019 on it when he wasn\u2019t doin\u2019 stuff around the ranch. Somehow he convinced Luke to help him haul it to the lake.\u201d Casper grunted. \u201cThat sucker sank like a rock, with the bow sticking straight up. So when we\u2019re in the midst of a drought, that end sticks out \u2019cause the water table is so low. Since Tell fastened some kind of ridiculous pirate flag on it, everyone knows it\u2019s his. Everyone sees his mistake. Stubborn kid shoulda listened to me.\u201d</p><p>Tell looked up, his eyes dark with anger. \u201cI\u2019d appreciate you leavin\u2019 now, Dad. I am on a date. You\u2019re the third wheel that nobody wants.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s face warmed from Tell\u2019s harsh words.</p><p>But it didn\u2019t faze Casper. He slid out of the booth. \u201cFine, I can take a hint. Be seein\u2019 you.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>She focused on her pasta. When she glanced over at Tell, he\u2019d stirred his food but hadn\u2019t eaten much. Poor baby. She wanted to wrap her arms around him, but he\u2019d see it as pity, not comfort.</p><p>He must\u2019ve sensed her staring. But he didn\u2019t lift his head. \u201cSorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you had any control over where he showed up for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Well. Can we just forget it?\u201d</p><p>Tell only ate half his steak and the waitress boxed up the remainder. Georgia sensed his impatience for her to finish so they could get out of the restaurant.</p><p>In the truck, he didn\u2019t pat the seat for her to scoot over. He didn\u2019t snatch her hand. Tell just hunched over the steering wheel and drove in silence.</p><p>Halfway home, she peered around the invisible elephant in the truck cab. \u201cIs it always like that with your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sometimes it\u2019s worse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to say\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Can\u2019t we just drop it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re upset and hurting and I want to help you.\u201d Georgia picked up his hand and kissed his palm. \u201cPlease. You\u2019ve been there for me and you have no idea how much I appreciated that. You need to talk about this, Tell. And I\u2019m right here. Ready to listen. Without judgment.\u201d</p><p>A few long miles passed. Then he said, \u201cHe got worse after Luke died, but that nasty attitude is just who he is, whether he\u2019s drinking or sober with the light of God shining down on him. No one in our family can stand to be around him. You can see why.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how my mother put up with it for as long as she did. She finally chose a different life and I\u2019m happy for her. Yet that leaves me\u2019n my brothers dealing with Dad without her as a buffer.\u201d</p><p>Georgia knew exactly how that felt, but this was about Tell. Not her.</p><p>\u201cIt never changes. God, he\u2019s been embarrassing me my whole life. I wish I could say it wasn\u2019t as bad because at least he wasn\u2019t drunk. But I still hold my goddamn breath anytime he opens his mouth in public. And usually with good reason.\u201d</p><p>She waited for him to continue.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cLook. I appreciate what you\u2019re wantin\u2019 to do, but nothin\u2019 is gonna get rid of this lousy mood anytime soon, so it\u2019d be best if I took you home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot happening. We can chill out at your place, but I\u2019m not leaving you alone to wallow. We wallowed pretty good together last time, if I recall.\u201d</p><p>Tell shot her a look. \u201cYou expecting ice cream will help?\u201d</p><p>She leaned over to smooch his strong jaw. \u201cIce cream always helps. But this time I get to dish it up.\u201d</p><p>Tell needed to clear his mind after the run-in with his father. He\u2019d cracked open a couple of beers, but they were basically untouched on the coffee table, and he and Georgia were entwined on his couch, attempting to watch TV.</p><p>\u201cYou still seem tense.\u201d</p><p>Lie. Make light of it. Crack a joke. But he couldn\u2019t. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cYeah? And how\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake off your clothes and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Didn\u2019t have to tell him twice. He got naked, whipping his shirt and his camo shorts on the floor.</p><p>She watched as his sleeping dick stirred. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>Tell stretched out with his arms folded behind his head, letting her look her fill.</p><p>Georgia scooted between his legs. Running her palms over his thighs, she stopped to trace the muscles in his quads with her fingertips. Using such tender caresses it seemed every hair on his thighs stood straight up, vying for her attention.</p><p>\u201cIs this your way of distracting me?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She touched his knee. \u201cOne of the ways I\u2019ve got planned for tonight.\u201d</p><p>He remembered he\u2019d said that to her the night of the reunion. But the look in her eyes wasn\u2019t soft or sweet. Just determined. \u201cAre you gonna torture me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. I like touching you. Don\u2019t you like it?\u201d Her fingers fluttered around his groin, but she didn\u2019t touch his dick.</p><p>At all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like it better if you were touchin\u2019 me in one spot in particular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She spread her hands over his pecs and kissed his sternum, keeping her eyes on his. \u201cMaybe I wanna drive you a little crazy. Like you do to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI drive you crazy?\u201d</p><p>A dangerous smile curled her lips and Tell wondered if he should be worried. \u201cYou know you do.\u201d</p><p>Her soft, warm lips followed the slope of his shoulder.</p><p>First thing she did was kiss him. Taking over his mouth completely. Sliding her tongue deep. Sucking and swirling and licking until his body was racked with need.</p><p>From just a kiss.</p><p>He went to move his arms, to try and regain some control, but her fingernails dug into his biceps. She lifted her lips briefly to warn, \u201cLeave \u2019em there. And drop your head back. This stubborn chin of yours is in my way.\u201d She placed kisses in a straight line from his chin to his collarbone. The wet glide of her mouth over that section of skin caused gooseflesh to erupt from the back of his neck to his knees. He must\u2019ve made a noise because Georgia just kept right on doing it.</p><p>As her hands traveled all over his lower belly, he found himself clenching his fists. His jaw. His butt cheeks.</p><p>\u201cThis is supposed to be relaxing you,\u201d she murmured, kissing his lower ribs.</p><p>\u201cThe last thing I wanna do with your hands on me is zone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen this oughta keep you awake.\u201d She licked his shaft from his balls to the tip like his cock was a meat Popsicle.</p><p>Goddamn that felt good. He about choked on his tongue when she stuffed his entire shaft into her mouth. Sucking so hard her cheeks hollowed. Taking him so deep the head of his cock bumped her soft palate before slipping into her throat. Making a little hum of happiness that vibrated from his balls to the back of his neck.</p><p>Then she released his cock gradually, stopping to let the lower rim of his cockhead catch on her bottom teeth. She tongued the underside with hot, wet lashes. Once he got used to the ticklish sensation and anticipated another sweeping lick, Georgia backed off.</p><p>His thighs shook. He gritted his teeth against bumping his pelvis up as her lips firmly enclosed the crown. She suckled gently, when he ached for that fast, wet push and pull of his dick plunging in and out of her mouth.</p><p>Georgia teased. Rolling his sac with a tender touch. Sucking on his balls as her hand jacked him slowly. Then she\u2019d switch it up, squeezing, licking, lapping with abandon, and she jerked his shaft hard and fast.</p><p>Pure. Fucking. Torture.</p><p>Soft hands. Warm mouth. Heated breath. Wicked tongue. Tell\u2019s body vibrated. He squeezed his ass, his abs, his calves, attempting to hold off and prove...what? That he had stamina?</p><p>Fuck stamina. He needed to come now. \u201cEnough. Finish me.\u201d</p><p>She released his cock, angling her head to nuzzle the inside of his thigh, keeping those sexy eyes on his. \u201cHow do you want me to finish you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHands on my thighs. Lean in, but arch back. That\u2019s it.\u201d He fisted his shaft, still slippery from her saliva. \u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Tell beat off, each stroke faster. That tingle in his tailbone was a brief warning and a drop of come landed on her chin before he shoved his cock between her lips and groaned, \u201cSuck me down. All of it,\u201d as he shot his load.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s cheeks indented and her throat muscles kissed his cockhead with each swallow.</p><p>Hot. Wet. Tight. It felt so goddamn good. Keeping his grip on her head, he closed his eyes, bumping his hips into her face with each pulse, letting himself drift into the peaceful place she\u2019d brought him to.</p><p>Teeth sinking into his cock stirred him from his orgasmic stupor.</p><p>He swept his thumbs across her cheekbones as he withdrew from the haven of her mouth. \u201cLook at you. So pretty and naughty on your knees.\u201d</p><p>She blinked slowly and gave him the lopsided smile.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mere.\u201d Tell hauled her across his lap and kissed her, his tongue dueling with hers. \u201cMmm. The taste of my come on your tongue is a fuckin\u2019 turn-on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do seem more relaxed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks to you. You sucked all the tension and all the poison right outta me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she swatted him.</p><p>Tell stretched out on the couch, bringing her on top of him. Running his fingers through her soft hair as her head rested on his chest. He was totally content. \u201cWhat\u2019s on your agenda for this week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWork. I\u2019ve set up radio interviews for upcoming events. Getting competitors to agree to talk on live radio is a pain, so I\u2019ve lined up a stock contractor and a committee member in case there\u2019s an issue.\u201d She sighed. \u201cWith just me here, I don\u2019t have backup for anything, from event staffing issues to breakdowns in communication with committee members.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAny problems with the rodeo this weekend in Pine Haven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But it\u2019s tiny and so last-minute they aren\u2019t expecting miracles on the PR front.\u201d Her face turned thoughtful as she buried her fingers in the dark hair on his chest.</p><p>\u201cSomething else on your mind, sweetness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing big. It\u2019s just weird. People I knew in passing, or who knew RJ, or my parents, or from school approached me at the community center.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeems once I volunteered for something, they assumed I\u2019m interested in volunteering for other community projects. Before I knew what was happening, I agreed to help with a fundraiser for the chamber of commerce and help organize a workshop for the competitive cheer squad.\u201d</p><p>What had these people said to Georgia to garner her interest in community activities? It had to benefit the PR company in some way.</p><p>Not nice, Tell. Be happy she\u2019s not sitting at home.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a meeting about the cheerleading workshop on Tuesday night.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re skipping out on meeting me at Ziggy\u2019s for dart league?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot. I forgot. I can cancel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sweat it. We can meet up afterward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. As long as you\u2019re in volunteer mode, I could use some help with the rodeo club fundraiser week after next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDone. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He let the tips of his fingers follow the planes and angles of her face. \u201cBring that mouth over here. I need another taste.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him with such fire his cock hardened.</p><p>\u201cSweetness, you got way too many clothes on.\u201d</p><p>She raised a haughty eyebrow. \u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYours. Strip.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Georgia stood beneath the bank sign in Moorcroft, debating whether to cross the street to have lunch at the Mexican joint or head down the block to the greasy spoon, when the door to the bank opened and her father stepped into the sunshine.</p> <p>She blinked at him for a second or two, wondering if her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p><p>He seemed equally stunned. Then he wrapped her in a bear hug. \u201cGeorgie! My goodness, girl, I was just thinking about you and here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLookit you. No bigger than a minute. I forget what a shrimp you are,\u201d he teased. Then he added, \u201cBut damn, girl, you are a beauty. Lucky thing you got your mama\u2019s looks, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Mom says I got your temperament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet she didn\u2019t say you were lucky getting that trait. What\u2019re you doin\u2019 in Moorcroft?\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, expecting he would demand to know why she hadn\u2019t called him to say she\u2019d be in the area, but he just looked at her expectantly. Happily. \u201cI made a few sales calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I have to get back\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t even gonna let your old man buy you lunch?\u201d</p><p>Hello guilt. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll let you buy... As long as it\u2019s Mexican.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>Her father hadn\u2019t argued or insisted on eating at the restaurant of his choice? That was different.</p><p>Maybe he was different.</p><p>They walked together, her father making small talk about the weather and hinting about big news in his life.</p><p>After they were seated with menus, Georgia studied Robert Hotchkiss as he slipped on a pair of reading glasses.</p><p>It\u2019d been two years since she\u2019d seen him when he\u2019d shown up in Dallas, out of the blue. He didn\u2019t look much different. Same pale brown eyes. Same shaggy gray hair. Same rotund carriage.</p><p>He glanced up with a small smile. \u201cWhatcha havin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe beef enchilada platter. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSteak is probably the safest, although my doctor wants me to eat more green shit.\u201d</p><p>Georgia smiled. \u201cMom tried to get you to eat more green shit for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe finally did develop my taste for all the different ways she could cook beets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy borscht never tastes as good as hers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mama\u2019s cookin\u2019 is just one of the many things I miss about her.\u201d</p><p>The waiter served their drinks\u2014iced tea for her, a beer for her father\u2014and took their order.</p><p>They snacked on chips and salsa. The restaurant had typical Mexican d\u00e9cor\u2014pi\u00f1atas hanging from the ceiling and gaudy sombreros on the brightly colored wall. Plastic cactuses scattered throughout. Mariachi music playing in the background. Strands of chili pepper lights draped from the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your mother... I talked to her the other day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>His bushy eyebrows rose. \u201cWhat\u2019d she say about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that you called.\u201d She stirred a packet of sugar in her tea. \u201cShe\u2019s coming to visit.\u201d Why had she told him that?</p><p>\u201cIs that right? She didn\u2019t mention it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was surprised to hear that you call her regularly.\u201d</p><p>He honestly looked perplexed. \u201cWhy? Irina was my wife for twenty-five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured after the ugliness of your divorce...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, Georgie, after RJ...everything got way out of hand. I never expected...\u201d He sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated and I never was good at uncomplicating things. But I\u2019m awful good at makin\u2019 them worse.\u201d</p><p>Georgia bit her tongue. Changing the subject would be the safest way to finish this lunch. \u201cWhat\u2019s this big news you mentioned earlier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna retire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? When?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSoon as the paperwork is sorted out. I sold the hog farm to a corporation outta eastern South Dakota. Shocked me how good of a deal they offered. And, well, I ain\u2019t getting any younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just turned sixty-eight, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. That sounds old to a twenty-eight-year-old, huh?\u201d</p><p>It did sound old. Her dad had been forty when she and RJ were born and her mother only twenty-two. During her childhood she hadn\u2019t noticed the eighteen-year age gap made a difference in her parent\u2019s relationship. But she wondered if that was why she\u2019d never dated older men.</p><p>\u201cI tried to call you on your birthday last month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She aligned the bottom of the knife with the bottom of the spoon. \u201cI don\u2019t celebrate or do anything anymore. It\u2019s just another day.\u201d</p><p>Her dad chuckled. \u201cYour mom used to go all-out for your birthdays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe year we got the squirt guns was the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t you break yours right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. RJ busted his. He was so upset I gave him mine and we swore we\u2019d never tell.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose. \u201cI never knew that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were pretty good at covering for each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd sticking up for each other. I remember the summer you two were seven. We\u2019d just moved to the farm and I caught RJ climbing on the barn with a quilt that he intended to use for a parachute when he jumped off the roof. The kid like-ta give me heart failure. I paddled his ass good.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThen you marched up to me, bold as brass, and told me I\u2019d better spank you too, since it was your quilt and you planned to jump off right after him.\u201d</p><p>Georgia smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you noticed I wore extra clothes as padding.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNope. I didn\u2019t catch that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was RJ\u2019s idea. He wished he\u2019d thought of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine. You two were always thick as thieves.\u201d</p><p>That comment kicked her grief to the surface, not that she\u2019d ever buried it deep. She scrambled to change the subject. \u201cSo retirement, huh? What will you do with yourself when you don\u2019t have to slop hogs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll end up baby-sitting Deck and Tara-Lee\u2019s kid,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cBut since he\u2019s getting a cut of the profit, Deck will likely be takin\u2019...\u201d He glanced up sharply. \u201cSorry. I know Deck is a sore subject.\u201d</p><p>Do ya think?</p><p>\u201cBut now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, I want to explain\u2014\u201d</p><p>Georgia held up her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t go there. Please. We were having a nice lunch and I don\u2019t want my appetite spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do need to talk about this at some point, Georgie. It\u2019s been seven years.\u201d</p><p>The food arrived.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your main responsibility in this job?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Grateful that he\u2019d switched topics, she smiled. \u201cI\u2019m at the rodeo grounds to make sure our portion of the event is handled properly. Working with the committees beforehand. Selling ads. Lining up radio spots.\u201d</p><p>He sliced off a big chunk of meat. \u201cWhat happens when the summer rodeo season ends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI return to Dallas. But keep that to yourself. I don\u2019t want any of our contractors afraid I\u2019ll bail out early, since we\u2019re the new kid around town.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and steadily demolished his steak.</p><p>The conversation lagged, but not due to tension.</p><p>\u201cThanks for inviting me to lunch, Dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d He leaned back in the booth, folding his arms and setting them on his belly. \u201cSo am I gonna get to see you again before you take off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try. The road runs both ways. You could venture to Sundance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d</p><p>Her father was looking at her in a way she\u2019d never seen before\u2014with regret. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople change, Georgie. Holdin\u2019 a grudge ain\u2019t no way to go through life.\u201d</p><p>Was he talking about her forgiving Deck?</p><p>Maybe he\u2019s taking about you forgiving him.</p><p>She inhaled a slow breath. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTook me a while, but I\u2019m finally starting to realize what anger cost me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were you angry at?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod. For takin\u2019 my boy away. I lost my faith.\u201d</p> <p>Robert Hotchkiss had always been a man of faith, not merely paying lip service to being a Christian. He\u2019d tried to lead his life according to God\u2019s rules and by example, expecting his family to follow suit. It hadn\u2019t been the easiest way to grow up, but she hadn\u2019t questioned it. Not until RJ had died. Although she\u2019d veered away from the teachings of the church, she still didn\u2019t judge those people who abided by the tenets of their religions, just as long as they didn\u2019t try and push their beliefs on her.</p><p>So his response about losing his faith startled her\u2014maybe that\u2019s why her father had become so unrecognizable in the wake of RJ\u2019s death. He\u2019d had no one to turn to. So he\u2019d turned on everyone.</p><p>\u201cBut the worst part?\u201d he continued in a small voice. \u201cBecause of that anger, I also lost your mom. And you. I lost everything and everyone that mattered to me.\u201d He looked down. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right. And I don\u2019t know what I can do to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Neither do I.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m willing to do anything, Georgia.\u201d</p> <p>What did it mean that he wanted to try and make amends?</p><p>Her phone buzzed, reminding her of her next appointment. She said, \u201cDad, I have to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand. Thanks for makin\u2019 my day. I...hate that it\u2019s this way between us. I don\u2019t know you as an adult, Georgie. That makes me sadder than anything in the world,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Completely at a loss, Georgia mumbled, \u201cSee you,\u201d and practically ran out of the restaurant.</p><p>Tell\u2019s week started out on a sour note and went downhill from there.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Georgia at all on Monday and when he called her, she sounded preoccupied, although she swore she was just tired.</p> <p>Tuesday night was a wash. She\u2019d invited him to her place after his dart game ended, but the way she\u2019d gone on about how much fun she\u2019d had with the new people she\u2019d met and the old friends she\u2019d reconnected with had brought out a jealous streak and he\u2019d just gone home. Alone.</p><p>Wednesday night was Georgia\u2019s girls\u2019 night with Stephanie. And Leah and Roxanne. And a bunch of other women. Evidently she\u2019d had a great time, a fact he\u2019d heard Thursday morning from Ned. And even Dalton.</p><p>Weren\u2019t you the one who encouraged her to cut loose? Have fun. Make friends. Get involved?</p><p>Yeah. Might make him paranoid, but now that Georgia had found a new crowd, maybe a cooler crowd, was she ditching him?</p><p>The niggling doubt was confirmed Thursday night when Tell tracked Georgia down at the Golden Boot\u2014thirty minutes after they were supposed to meet for supper at Fields. He leaned against the wall and watched her as she chatted with the mayor, the superintendent of schools, the owner of the local real estate company, and the lawyer for a methane gas company.</p><p>All single men.</p><p>All gazing at Georgia with lust-filled eyes.</p><p>All dead men, as far as Tell was concerned.</p> <p>But rather than storming over and hauling her ass out like he had before, he hung back. Just as he had in high school. Waiting for her to notice him.</p><p>You\u2019re still a wannabe, McKay. Nothing has changed.</p><p>Bullshit. But tuning out that voice of doubt and reminding himself to act like a mature adult in this relationship didn\u2019t spur his feet to move. He was stuck in hell, seeing Georgia laughing with these clowns, oblivious to the fact she\u2019d missed their date.</p><p>Thirty minutes passed while he remained in the shadows, nursing a beer. Thirty long minutes in which he didn\u2019t cross Georgia\u2019s mind once because she\u2019d made no effort to contact him.</p><p>Sobering and humbling.</p><p>He texted her.</p><p>I must\u2019ve mixed up my nights. Thought we had a date at Fields. I\u2019m tired and going home. Catch up with you later. T~</p><p>Maybe it was perverted, but he hung around to see her reaction.</p><p>Georgia fished out her cell from the pocket of her suit jacket and glanced at the screen. Guilt crossed her face and she swore. She immediately began punching buttons. Soon after his phone buzzed in his hand.</p><p>No, it was tonight. Sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to stand you up. I got sidetracked. Are you still waiting at Fields?</p><p>Tell waited a solid five minutes before he responded.</p><p>No worries. We\u2019ll go another night. Got a busy day tomorrow anyway. See you @ the Pine Haven Rodeo Saturday.</p><p>Georgia frowned and texted furiously, ignoring the men at the table.</p><p>I\u2019m really sorry. Can I come out to your place and make you supper?</p><p>Probably made him a petty dick, but he just wanted to be mad at her.</p><p>No. I can\u2019t text and drive, so I gotta go. See you.</p><p>Tell finished his beer. Wondering if Georgia would stay at the bar and drink with these guys or if she\u2019d head home.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t stick around to find out.</p><p>He dreamt of her that night. Dreamt of being back in high school. Dreamt of being invisible. Dreamt of gazing at her adoringly from the sidelines.</p><p>Georgia. Beautiful, perfect Georgia. His Georgia. Not the unattainable Georgia from the past.</p><p>He approached her in the lunchroom. But she wouldn\u2019t deign to look in his direction or even speak to him.</p><p>He pulled her hair and called her name in history class, but she wouldn\u2019t acknowledge him at all.</p><p>In the next dream frame, Georgia was surrounded by his cousins. Strong, strapping McKays. With those black Irish good looks. Rich men. Successful ranchers. Oozing confidence. Spreading charm.</p><p>When he wormed his way through the throng to get to her, he was roughly jerked back. Put in his place at the end of the line.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want you,\u201d Kade sneered.</p><p>\u201cShe never has, she never will,\u201d Colby hissed.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s too good for you,\u201d Colt added.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t man enough to handle her,\u201d Ben warned.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s using you, and you\u2019re a loser who lets her,\u201d Dalton said with derision.</p><p>His father appeared\u2014all mean attitude and ugliness. \u201cYou\u2019re an embarrassment to the McKay name.\u201d Casper turned his back on Tell, shunning him.</p><p>Then, one by one, his McKay relatives started laughing at him. Pointing. Whispering. Making fun. Taunting him. He tried to run away but his feet were buried in the earth.</p><p>The real kick in the balls came when Georgia looked at him with pity and contempt. \u201cYou didn\u2019t really think you had a shot at me, did you?\u201d</p><p>He woke up angry. Irrational anger from a stupid dream, but he hated there were some truths in his fears. That he\u2019d never be good enough for her. In her eyes and everyone else\u2019s eyes. Truths that made him feel raw and helpless. Truths that made him a little desperate to dispel those fears by any means.</p><p>Chores kept him hopping all Friday morning. So when his caller ID said Chase, he almost didn\u2019t answer, but curiosity got the better of him. \u201cOmigod! Is this really Chase McKay? World champion PBR bull rider? Callin\u2019 me? I\u2019m so honored!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, it is, and why don\u2019t you just go ahead and pucker up to kiss my famous butt for that smart-ass comment.\u201d</p><p>Tell laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, cuz?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in town for the Upton Rodeo tomorrow afternoon. Pressing the flesh, passing the word about safety helmets. I got to talkin\u2019 to Verna, the Upton Rodeo secretary, and she told me they\u2019re short a judge for tomorrow. I told her I\u2019d call and see if you\u2019re interested in subbing.\u201d</p><p>Hell yes he was interested. Then it hit him. He couldn\u2019t. It was too bad Georgia had hired him to work the Pine Haven Rodeo tomorrow.</p><p>It\u2019s too bad Georgia has blown you off all fucking week.</p><p>Whoa. Seemed his subconscious was still bitter.</p><p>But the bottom line was the Upton Rodeo was a PRCA-sanctioned event. More money, more prestige than a dinky-ass nothing rodeo. Not to mention he\u2019d get to share the spotlight with his celebrity cousin for an afternoon.</p><p>No one would fault him for taking this opportunity.</p><p>Well, Georgia might.</p><p>Well, she could just suck it up.</p><p>\u201cTell? You there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Sorry. That sounds great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome. I\u2019m sure you know the drill by now. Lookin\u2019 forward to seein\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t check her phone Saturday morning until after she\u2019d weeded her vegetable garden, showered and finished half a pot of coffee. She smiled, seeing a text from Tell at six a.m. She loved the pictures he\u2019d text from his early morning ranch chores. Or just the sweet things he\u2019d text because he\u2019d been thinking about her. Those messages had been scarce the last three days. She\u2019d just chalked it up to them both being busy. She scrolled through the text:</p><p>Sorry, but I have to back out of judging the Pine Haven Rodeo today. A family thing came up\u2014don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not serious and I\u2019ll text you when I can. T~</p><p>What was she supposed to do now? Two judges were the minimum requirement. She tried eight numbers on the judges list and no one was available.</p><p>That\u2019s when she panicked.</p><p>Think, Georgia.</p><p>One solution occurred to her. She dismissed it. Several times. Until she just went ahead and made the call, pacing as the line kept ringing. Then a gruff voice said, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Dad. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgie! I\u2019m okay. I\u2019m happy to hear from you. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Deck around?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then, \u201cOh. You didn\u2019t call to talk to me?\u201d</p><p>His hopeful tone had dimmed and she felt guilty. \u201cI\u2019m actually in a time crunch. I need to talk to Deck and I didn\u2019t have his number. It\u2019s strictly a business question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, dear, is there coffee left?\u201d her mother trilled as she entered the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is in Sundance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I told you she planned to visit. Now is Deck around or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. He\u2019s here. Hang on.\u201d</p><p>Muffled voices mixed with the sounds of hogs going hog wild in the background and then Deck came on the line. \u201cRobert said you needed to talk to me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cut right to the chase. Be professional. \u201cYes. I\u2019m short a judge for the Pine Haven Rodeo today. Would you be willing to sub?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho backed out?\u201d A snicker. \u201cIt was McKay, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Dammit, Tell, you owe me for this. \u201cYes. Look, the event is two-and-a-half hours, tops. It starts at one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStandard non-PRCA pay rate. There\u2019s food for contestants, judges and committee members. Plus, I could swing a companion ticket for Tara-Lee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do I need to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne.\u201d</p><p>A pause. \u201cI suppose I could help you out. Just this one time.\u201d</p> <p>She closed her eyes, glad he hadn\u2019t tacked on since you\u2019re desperate and McKay left you in the lurch. \u201cThank you, Deck. I really appreciate it. The paperwork will be in the secretary\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have done this before.\u201d The phone clunked. \u201cHang on, Robert wants to talk to you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill your mother be at this rodeo?\u201d her father demanded.</p><p>Georgia held her hand over the phone and glanced at her mom, leaning against the doorjamb. \u201cAre you coming with me today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than sitting here doing nothing. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad wants to know.\u201d</p> <p>Irina Hotchkiss slowly sipped her coffee. \u201cIs he going?\u201d</p><p>For the love of God.</p><p>\u201cI am not the go-between. You two are adults. Figure it out. But I\u2019m leaving in half an hour.\u201d She handed her mother her cell phone and ran upstairs to finish getting ready.</p><p>When Georgia returned downstairs, her mother waited by the door. In a new outfit. A cleavage-baring outfit.</p><p>Do not ask why she\u2019s got the girls out in full display.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Georgia asked brightly.</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019ve decided to follow you in case I get bored and want to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Georgia handed her mother a spare house key and a complimentary ticket. \u201cI\u2019ll be busy. Just text me and let me know what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p> <p>That way she wouldn\u2019t have to run interference between her parents and deal with her ex-husband.</p><p>As Tell slipped on the official black-and-white PRCA judge\u2019s vest, he heard Verna calling, \u201cMcKay?\u201d</p><p>Both he and Chase said, \u201cYes?\u201d then they laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for judge McKay, not rider McKay,\u201d Verna said, handing Tell a clipboard. \u201cWe\u2019re just glad you\u2019re here and didn\u2019t have anything else goin\u2019 on today.\u201d</p><p>Nothing else going on. Right. Backing out on Georgia was a shitty thing to do, but he hadn\u2019t lied exactly. Being here was a family thing. This was the first time he\u2019d be a judge when his world champion bull riding cousin, Chase McKay, took to the dirt.</p><p>Chase had agreed to ride as an expo at the last minute. The promotion company was all over the place, scrambling to make the most of the opportunity. Which made him wonder what Georgia was doing.</p><p>Cursing your name, most likely.</p><p>He signed off on the paperwork. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe hang tight. There are a couple camera crews setting up for interviews.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>Chase shrugged. \u201cWelcome to my life.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYeah, it sucks to be you. Married to a gorgeous movie star, livin\u2019 the high life on a beach in California, and let\u2019s not forget that teeny tiny PBR World Champion belt buckle you\u2019re sporting.\u201d</p><p>A big grin split Chase\u2019s face. \u201cIt is good to be me.\u201d He ran his finger over the big buckle. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe I won last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserved it. You had a great season. Are your brothers and folks here today to cheer you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no. Mom and Dad are in Phoenix, staying with Sierra since Gavin has a week-long conference in Atlanta.\u201d He frowned. \u201cThat girl is givin\u2019 Gavin fits and he can\u2019t trust his ex with her anymore either. Ben and Ainsley are in Gillette for a wedding. And Quinn and Libby are in Spearfish today for Adam\u2019s T-ball game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are you stayin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tonight. I\u2019m crashing at Ben\u2019s place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAva\u2019s not with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>Chase smirked. \u201cFuckin\u2019 spectacular. I\u2019m the luckiest man in the world.\u201d</p><p>Tell punched him in the shoulder. \u201cLookit you, all in love and shit. Never thought I\u2019d see you pussy-whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cSpeakin\u2019 of pussy... I stopped into AJ\u2019s place early this mornin\u2019 for a massage. She mentioned you were makin\u2019 time with one Georgia Hotchkiss. Ain\u2019t she the smokin\u2019 hot cheerleader from your class? Her boyfriend was on the rodeo team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We\u2019re hanging out sometimes. No big deal.\u201d He gave Chase a cool stare. \u201cHow in the hell did that come up in conversation with AJ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvidently AJ is tryin\u2019 to marry you off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Georgia? Jesus. It was just last week all them women were all gunning for her, afraid she\u2019d break my poor little heart while she reached into their purses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s changed. They\u2019re singing her praises now. AJ thought with me bein\u2019 the former bad boy McKay that you\u2019d listen if I spewed hearts and flowers about how much happier my life is now that I\u2019ve settled down.\u201d Chase shrugged. \u201cAll true. But I remember bein\u2019 pissed off when our cousins tried to tell me the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe McKays are a meddling bunch,\u201d Tell grumbled.</p><p>\u201cThat ain\u2019t gonna change. So is she here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She\u2019s working another rodeo event today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChase?\u201d A smartly dressed woman stepped into the tent. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d He clapped Tell on the back. \u201cCome on, cuz, it\u2019s time for your close-up.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, Tell had no idea how Chase did this bullshit every day, cameras filming and photographers snapping shots and microphones shoved in his face, recording his every word like gospel. Tell resisted sneaking behind him and making bunny ears. That would just be immature. Funny as hell, but definitely juvenile.</p><p>Finally the PR woman ended the interviews.</p><p>They wandered behind the chutes and split up. Tell got his head in the game, and it was time to rodeo.</p><p>Every event went like clockwork. Chase was last to ride. His ride was an exposition, but that didn\u2019t mean it was a gimme. The bull they\u2019d paired him with hadn\u2019t been ridden and was a beast at almost two thousand pounds.</p><p>The bull went vertical out of the chute.</p><p>Chase held on. He spurred, one with the animal through every twist, turn and jump. The crowd went nuts, aware they were witnessing a textbook, picture-perfect ride.</p><p>Tell scored the bull and the rider very high. Not because Chase was his cousin, but because the man was sheer poetry on the back of a bull.</p><p>Final score was ninety-three points.</p><p>After the buckles were awarded, Chase gave his spiel about helmet safety issues, and a good portion of the crowd stayed to listen.</p><p>Tell checked out with the rodeo secretary, waiting for Chase to finish yet another interview. And he wasn\u2019t the only one waiting. He casually checked out the women hanging on the corrals, anticipating Chase\u2019s appearance. As if Chase was gonna look twice at any of these bunnies when he had the stunning Ava Cooper in his bed every night.</p><p>\u201cThat was some ride,\u201d a busty blonde said.</p><p>Her redheaded friend nodded. Then she gave Tell a once-over. \u201cHey. You\u2019re one of the judges.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou caught me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really cute. God, I love them dimples.\u201d Her gaze dropped to the waistband of his jeans and seemed disappointed he wasn\u2019t wearing a buckle. \u201cDidja used to compete in rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few years back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh. I can tell,\u201d the redhead cooed. She squeezed his biceps. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the body for it.\u201d</p><p>The blonde, not to be outdone, thrust her tits in his face. \u201cYou\u2019re used to ranking bulls and riders. What would you rank me?\u201d</p><p>He bit back the damn close to desperate comment that popped into his head. He let his gaze travel over her. \u201cOn a scale of one to ten? Pretty lady, you\u2019re a solid fifteen. And that\u2019s before I see how well you can ride.\u201d</p><p>She tittered.</p><p>Next thing Tell knew, he was surrounded by half-a-dozen women. All laughing at his jokes, pawing at him. Making sexual promises with their mouths and their eyes.</p><p>What about Georgia?</p><p>What about her? She\u2019s not here. And all these lovelies wanted to do was hang out with him.</p><p>Because they like you? Or because they\u2019re hoping Chase will show up?</p><p>And for the first time ever, Tell didn\u2019t dread that scenario. Wouldn\u2019t that be sweet? Seeing the surprised look on his famous cousin\u2019s face when he finally realized that Tell wasn\u2019t the scrawny runner-up in everything? That Tell had his own moves and his own group of hot chickies vying for a down and dirty piece of him?</p><p>Shallow, McKay, really fucking shallow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirsty,\u201d brunette number one complained.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d said the busty blonde.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d said the redhead.</p><p>The expectant looks leveled his way prompted him to say, \u201cI can\u2019t stand to see you beauties suffering from dehydration. How about if you all head on into Moorcroft and save us a table at Ziggy\u2019s? The first round is on me.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>\u201cOutstanding job, Georgia. We can\u2019t thank you enough for going above and beyond for our little rodeo.\u201d</p><p>Georgia beamed at Esther Theel, committee chair. \u201cIt truly was my pleasure. I hope the Pine Haven Rodeo continues for many years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet we\u2019ll be moving it from this weekend next year, so we ain\u2019t competing with the Upton Rodeo.\u201d Esther gave her a shrewd look. \u201cI should be glad that Barb Wyre PR isn\u2019t promoting that one. Or else you wouldn\u2019t have had time for us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Today had been full of lucky breaks. Not only that Deck had agreed to sub at the last moment, and he hadn\u2019t been nasty, but due to her PR efforts the attendance at this rodeo exceeded initial expectations.</p><p>\u201cAs happy as I am with the gate, concession stand and beer garden receipts, I can\u2019t help but wonder if our take would\u2019ve been higher if we\u2019d hitched our wagon to a celebrity rider like Chase McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause Chase was featured at the Upton Rodeo today.\u201d</p><p>Instead of blurting, \u201cHe was?\u201d Georgia meticulously straightened a stack of papers and wondered why Tell hadn\u2019t mentioned it.</p><p>\u201cAll sorts of media coverage from what my spies tell me.\u201d Esther ran her hand through her short gray hair. \u201cEspecially after that ninety-three point ride. But I gotta say, it\u2019s a good thing the ride was for exhibition, because that score would definitely be called into question, bein\u2019s Chase McKay\u2019s cousin was a judge.\u201d</p><p>Georgia stilled.</p><p>Tell. You lying piece of shit. A family thing my ass.</p> <p>The Upton Rodeo was a much bigger event and PRCA-sanctioned to boot. Had he really thought she wouldn\u2019t find out why he\u2019d blown her off? Or didn\u2019t he care that his defection had left her scrambling to fill his judge spot at the last minute? Especially after she\u2019d gone out of her way to find him more judging gigs?</p><p>Or maybe this is finally payback for all the times you left him high and dry.</p><p>The knowledge lodged in her belly like a boulder.</p><p>Esther said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t gonna bring this up, but wasn\u2019t Tell McKay supposed to judge here today?\u201d</p><p>Now she had to try and save face for both of them. \u201cYes. He\u2019d gotten double-booked and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I ain\u2019t surprised this dinky event wasn\u2019t his priority since his cousin is big-time. I was just curious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand Chase McKay is generous with his time and celebrity, especially with rodeos in his home state. You should look into booking him for next year before Upton gets ahold of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe we should have you look into it, so we\u2019ve got you locked in for PR for us,\u201d Esther said slyly.</p><p>Georgia forced a laugh and looped the messenger-bag strap over her shoulder. \u201cWho knows where I\u2019ll be next year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you are interested in having an early word with McKay, Ziggy\u2019s is the hangout spot for the rodeo crowd after a performance. I was thinking of heading over there myself.\u201d</p><p>No way. Georgia was not going to Ziggy\u2019s. Forcing a public confrontation with Tell wasn\u2019t smart, given that last time they\u2019d had words he\u2019d thrown her over his shoulder and carried her out of the bar.</p><p>So she\u2019d head home, make plans with her mother and have a quiet evening. With lots of wine. With lots of whining.</p><p>The staunch self-warning did no good.</p><p>An hour later, Georgia found herself looking for parking in Ziggy\u2019s lot.</p> <p>She paid the cover charge at the door. As she made her way through the crowd, she caught her first glimpse of a familiar face: her father\u2019s. That was weird. He\u2019d never been the type to hang out in bars, even before RJ died. Georgia inched forward to see who shared his booth and her eyes bugged out.</p><p>What the hell? Her parents were having supper together?</p><p>She watched them for several more minutes. Although they were talking, neither looked happy about the conversation. Maybe it was better she wasn\u2019t there to mediate; heaven knew she hadn\u2019t done a great job in the past.</p><p>Still, the whole thing left her unsettled. Today\u2019s issues and events left her out of sorts and on edge.</p><p>Of course, that\u2019s when she heard his laugh. Deep, rich and strong.</p><p>Georgia turned toward the sound and saw Tell in a circular booth, surrounded by women. Laughing with them. Drinking with them. Charming them. Lapping up every bit of female attention.</p><p>A jealous rage rose in her. She wanted to punch him in his handsome face for his part in her tension-filled day.</p><p>But she had no idea how to handle this. Standing here, secretly shooting eye daggers at his female tablemates, was pointless. Should she storm up and introduce herself as Tell\u2019s...what? High school crush? Or go all hard-ass businesswoman and demand an explanation of why he\u2019d blown off a professional engagement?</p><p>The longer she wallowed in indecision, the more she understood...she wouldn\u2019t do jack shit. That reaction sent her spiraling back in time. When Deck had done or said something wrong and she\u2019d kept her mouth shut rather than confronting him.</p><p>When the single guys who\u2019d been circling her started moving closer with that hey baby come here often? gleam in their eyes, Georgia decided to go. But in trying to avoid the sharks eyeing her like chum, she\u2019d snagged Tell\u2019s attention.</p><p>Their eyes met. She expected him to look away quickly. Guiltily. But he kept focused on her. Part challenge, part some other fucked-up male pride thing that she didn\u2019t want to deal with.</p><p>Now she\u2019d look even more pathetic if she fled.</p><p>Her fight or flight decision was postponed when a male voice said, \u201cGeorgia?\u201d</p><p>Then she was face to face with Chase McKay. The man was built like a bulldozer. Eyes\u2014the same mesmerizing blue as Tell\u2019s\u2014stared back at her. His wide smile was pure McKay too. She blurted, \u201cYou remember me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Chase didn\u2019t shake her hand; he hugged her. Hugged her. \u201cYou look fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Thanks. So do you.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her like he had a big secret. \u201cMy cousin is a dumb-ass. Bein\u2019 pigheaded is a rite of passage for us McKays, but this one is gonna be especially sweet to pay forward.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Georgia just blinked at him.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t have much time, so we\u2019ve gotta get maximum play outta this play.\u201d He stepped to the side so they were both within Tell\u2019s view. \u201cI heard from Dalton that Tell got pissy when he thought you were hittin\u2019 up our relatives for sponsorship money? Can you imagine how much it\u2019ll eat at him, wondering if you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to sweet-talk me into makin\u2019 an appearance at a rodeo for your PR firm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you want Tell to think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he needs to wake the fuck up. And since what goes around comes around, I\u2019m doin\u2019 him a favor. So, darlin\u2019, look like you\u2019re pouring on the charm.\u201d</p><p>Georgia slapped on a smile. \u201cEven when I\u2019m ticked off at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s surrounded by them bunnies?\u201d Chase scoffed. \u201cHe ain\u2019t hanging around them chicks to make you jealous. It\u2019s got something to do with me, which is all kinds of fucked up. Why are you so ticked off at him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he left me holding the bag.\u201d She told him about Tell backing out of the Pine Haven Rodeo.</p><p>\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m shocked. Two years ago, Tell wouldn\u2019t let me compete in a PRCA event under another name. He\u2019s always doing the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s use it against him.\u201d Chase mimed signing a document on his hand. \u201cWanna play a game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake Tell\u2019s head explode.\u201d Chase\u2019s eyes twinkled. \u201cCome on, it\u2019ll be fun. We\u2019ll just casually walk out the front door as if we\u2019re deep in conversation.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t know what purpose this would serve. This wasn\u2019t a sexual flirtation between her and Chase McKay. She\u2019d followed his career and knew the bull rider was happily married.</p><p>They stopped in the middle of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long now,\u201d Chase said.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bitchier you are, the more he\u2019ll try to get you alone to sweet-talk his way outta the doghouse. But stay firm, Georgia, because he\u2019s gotta learn how to do some serious groveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will never understand men.\u201d</p><p>Chase laughed. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve said that...I ain\u2019t feelin\u2019 manly. It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 bizarre that I just channeled exactly what my wife would say.\u201d</p><p>And as Chase had predicted, Tell barreled out, straight toward them. \u201cJust what in the hell is goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m talking to Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your damn business,\u201d Georgia snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it\u2019s not. What does she want from you?\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact Tell towered over Chase by at least six inches, Chase herded his cousin back. \u201cAre you always so damn suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf the two of you becoming buddy-buddy? Yes. You\u2019re a celebrity, Chase. She\u2019s in PR. Do the math.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did do the math and came up one judge short for the Pine Haven Rodeo today,\u201d Georgia said sweetly. \u201cRing any bells?\u201d</p><p>Tell froze. He blushed. He opened his mouth but no sound came out.</p><p>Chase shook his head. \u201cNot cool, cuz. You ain\u2019t the type to shirk your responsibilities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a PRCA judge. I should\u2019ve been on the roster for the Upton Rodeo in the first place. Besides, the Pine Haven Rodeo is small-time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem cowgirls and cowboys who paid money to compete in it didn\u2019t think it was small-time,\u201d Chase said hotly. \u201cJesus. When did you get to be a rodeo snob, Tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you talk to me about bein\u2019 a snob, Chase.\u201d</p><p>Chase focused on Georgia. \u201cWho\u2019d you get to fill in as a judge on such short notice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck Veldekamp.\u201d She felt Tell\u2019s angry eyes trying to melt her face.</p><p>\u201cSo because Tell backed out, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHad to beg my ex-husband to help me? Yeah.\u201d She looked away. \u201cWhich was humiliating because Deck knew Tell was the one who cancelled on me at the last minute. Oh, and so did the rodeo committee secretary, so it was an all-around fabulous day.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s learning to grovel curve was short because immediately he was in Georgia\u2019s space, forcing her to meet his hangdog gaze. \u201cShit, Georgia. I\u2019m sorry. So sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She stared at him coolly.</p><p>\u201cI never thought... Goddammit. I\u2019m such a fuckin\u2019 bastard for doin\u2019 that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d guess you\u2019re pretty fucked,\u201d Chase said cheerfully. \u201cLyin\u2019 to your woman for personal or business reasons is never a good idea. And from where I stood in the bar tonight, you looked awful close to cheatin\u2019 on her, too, with some of them horny toads known as bunnies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot. Helping,\u201d Tell said through gritted teeth. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get the hell out of here before I lose my sense of humor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll go. But remember, Georgia. I owe you a good PR turn. Just name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that\u2019s generous, Chase, it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is partially my fault Tell wasn\u2019t at the Pine Haven Rodeo. I asked Verna to bump one of the judges and requested Tell as a replacement. I had no idea he had other judging duties lined up for today.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p> <p>\u201cOf course the only reason I got the gig was because of you.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s embarrassment softened her temper. Why hadn\u2019t she considered it would still bother Tell to be in his cousin\u2019s shadow? That if he had the chance to step out of it and into the spotlight, he\u2019d take it?</p><p>Georgia wanted to look at the gravel beneath her feet or the streetlight or the stars above\u2014anything but the misery in Tell\u2019s eyes. But she forced herself to stay firm.</p><p>\u201cSo, cowboy, what do you want to apologize for first?\u201d</p><p>Georgia was asking him. Like he had a clue. Wasn\u2019t like he could ask the self-centered teenage boy he\u2019d reverted to for advice.</p><p>Man up. Think.</p> <p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t reach for her, as much as he wanted to. \u201cCan we go someplace where I can explain in private?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flashed a warning. \u201cI don\u2019t want an explanation, I want an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean to give you an apology. Even if it takes all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf by takes all night, you\u2019re thinking that you and I will get naked and have wild sex\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I mean, yes, I wanna have wild sex with you all the fuckin\u2019 time.\u201d Shit. That hadn\u2019t come out right. Tell shoved his hands in his pockets and took a step back. \u201cI swear. I just want to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go to my house because my mom is staying with me.\u201d</p><p>Was that part of the reason she\u2019d been so scarce this week? And why hadn\u2019t he known? Because you got your feelings hurt and you\u2019ve been sulking. \u201cHow about my place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>The short drive would give him time to figure out what the hell to say to her.</p><p>He opened the windows in his trailer to let in the cooler night air. He poured two glasses of tea, setting a sugar canister and a spoon beside hers. By the time he\u2019d changed clothes, she was coming up the drive.</p><p>His heart beat as loudly as her knocks on the door.</p><p>\u201cHey. Come in.\u201d</p><p>She kicked off her shoes, making herself at home like she always did. After stirring three spoonfuls of sugar into her tea, she sat in the corner of the couch with her feet tucked under her.</p><p>Tell gulped half his tea, wishing it was whiskey, and perched on the coffee table across from her. \u201cFirst off. I\u2019m sorry for bailing on the Pine Haven Rodeo. It won\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re only scheduled for three more rodeos in conjunction with Barb Wyre PR?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because it was a shitty thing to do. You deserve better after all you\u2019ve done for me. I can\u2019t apologize enough, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if I\u2019d known Chase was pullin\u2019 the strings in Upton, I definitely would\u2019ve been in Pine Haven.\u201d He set her tea on the side table and took her hands in his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to call Deck. Was he a prick to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot bad, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Tell rubbed her knuckles on his cheeks. \u201cI missed you this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Didn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</p><p>A tiny frown line appeared between her eyebrows. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see you Monday. You didn\u2019t come to Ziggy\u2019s Tuesday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I did ask you to come to my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But you stood me up Thursday night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that wasn\u2019t intentional,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cDo I? Because I went lookin\u2019 for you. And I saw you cozied up in a booth with the movers and shakers in Sundance. Every one of them slick dudes was flirting with you. Made me crazy. I knew if I stuck around, I\u2019d end up in a bar fight with one of them, so I took off.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes cooled. \u201cIf you were there, then you know I wasn\u2019t flirting back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll my brain saw was those successful guys. And how freakin\u2019 beautiful you are. And then I wondered what the hell you\u2019re doin\u2019 with me. I figured you had the same thought and were finding new people to hang out with as a way of ending it with me.\u201d He had to look away. Christ, he\u2019d already said too much.</p><p>Georgia\u2019s fingers were firm on his chin as she turned his face toward hers. \u201cIt was a business meeting over cocktails. Not my idea. And trust me, it wasn\u2019t fun. Even though I had to pretend it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I would\u2019ve interrupted your meeting to remind you of our dinner date?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI probably would\u2019ve kissed you. Just like this.\u201d Her lips met his in a hard kiss. Then her grip on his chin tightened. \u201cAs long as we\u2019re on the subject, what was up with you and those rodeo groupies? Were you hanging out with them to make me jealous? As a payback for the jealousy you felt Thursday night?\u201d</p><p>Feeling his cheeks heat, he jerked his chin out of her grasp. Then he pushed to his feet, grabbed his tea and retreated to the kitchen. Tempting to pour a slug of Irish in it.</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>Her soft voice was directly behind him, but he didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cTalk to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>He hated to talk about this stuff. He hated acknowledging that he had personal insecurities, so why point them out to others? But for some reason, laying himself bare to Georgia wasn\u2019t as unnerving as shutting her out. She might not understand, but the fact she was here meant she cared on some level.</p><p>A fact Chase had shoved in his face. His cousin had been lying in wait for him by his pickup, grabbing another chance to chew his ass. Reminding him that one good woman was one in a million, but Tell didn\u2019t have to go through a million women to find her.</p><p>Sometimes Tell hated that fucking bastard.</p><p>Mostly because he knew Chase was right. Tell had found that one woman in Georgia. And he hadn\u2019t mustered the guts to let her know how he felt. But maybe showing her that he could talk about his feelings and shit would be the first step.</p><p>Tell inhaled a slow breath. \u201cDo you have any idea what it\u2019s like to be so deep in someone\u2019s shadow you disappear? That\u2019s how it is with me when it comes to Chase. He\u2019s the star. Here, there and everywhere else. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 he doesn\u2019t deserve it. He\u2019s always had the talent, the women, the fame, the money, the charm, the good looks. I pale in comparison to him on every level.</p><p>\u201cChase let me tag along to rodeos when I was fifteen or sixteen. Didn\u2019t matter if it was because he felt sorry for me because of my family situation, or that I was nowhere near him as far as ridin\u2019 skills. I felt cool...until some asshole tossed off a stupid comment about I wouldn\u2019t be allowed to hang around with Chase if I wasn\u2019t his poor, wannabe, butt-ugly relative. I didn\u2019t have the life experience to let it roll off me, so it ate at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my cousin\u2019s ridin\u2019 skills I envied. He always had all these women around him. So the night this older chick was all over me and I thought I was hot shit. I had the moves, right? Come to find out, she was one of Chase\u2019s castoff bunnies. She wanted to fuck a McKay, and since Chase was unavailable she made do with me. I never wanted to feel second-best again. But I have. So many times. So today I wanted him to see that I had my own posse. I wasn\u2019t that scrawny kid stuck with his seconds.\u201d</p><p>A gust of wind blew so hard it rattled the screen door.</p><p>\u201cHas that been a big life goal of yours? To have your own pussy posse?\u201d Georgia asked without sarcasm.</p><p>Tell spun around, ready to deny it, but something in her eyes curbed his intent to lie. \u201cNot my only goal, but a pussy posse was definitely one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you reach it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God you crossed that one off your bucket list.\u201d</p><p>Thank God she wasn\u2019t pissed off and throwing things at him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Georgia. I was a fuckin\u2019 idiot today. Remember when you told me that selling advertising to my relatives had nothin\u2019 to do with me personally? This is sorta the same situation. Me flirting with those women had nothin\u2019 to do with you personally. And you hafta believe I didn\u2019t plan on takin\u2019 any of them women up on their offers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you. I surprised myself by how much I wanted to challenge them all to a hair-pulling, eye-scratching cat fight.\u201d</p><p>Nice boost to his ego that she had been jealous. He rested his chin on top of her head. \u201cSo are we okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. Once again we dropped the ball on that adult relationship thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Fightin\u2019 with you sucks. I hate it. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship long enough to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I feel special.\u201d</p><p>You are special. So special it scares the crap outta me.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll point out the weeks we\u2019ve had fights is when we haven\u2019t spent time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA simple solution would be to spend all our free time together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, darlin\u2019, will you stay with me tonight?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She tipped her head back to look at him. \u201cYes, but no sex, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you really gonna hold me to that?\u201d Tell feathered his thumb over the pulse point in her neck. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched you all week. It\u2019s makin\u2019 me crazy. I\u2019ve been thinkin\u2019 about the wild, raunchy, kinky things I wanna do to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen another night will allow you to add to those fantasies, won\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cIt might kill me.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed softly. \u201cYou\u2019ll survive. We\u2019ll find something else to keep us occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could teach me how to play poker.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cNot strip poker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoilsport.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr we could watch a movie. Heckle bad TV shows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that include makin\u2019 out on the couch and letting me at least cop a feel?\u201d Tell waggled his eyebrows with such exaggeration she giggled.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I can prove it. Three or four times at least.\u201d Then he blew in her ear and felt her shiver from head to toe. \u201cAm I changing your mind, sweetness?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAs much as I love slipping between the sheets with you, I just like being with you. You make me laugh. You\u2019re easy to talk to. And you don\u2019t treat me like a dumb cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the hell ever said that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots of people. Not just kids at school. I heard someone say it was a good thing I was a pretty girl because I\u2019d never get by on my brains.\u201d She smiled sadly. \u201cOne time Smitty made that kinda crack around RJ. My brother clocked Smitty so hard he broke Smitty\u2019s glasses. So you\u2019re not the only one with self-doubts, Tell. As much as I\u2019d like to pretend I overcame it, some of those attitudes and comments have stuck with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it we have a better memory for the bad things that are said?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cMaybe because it makes us appreciate it more when someone says something nice?\u201d</p><p>He smooched her nose. \u201cYou\u2019re so smart.\u201d</p><p>The sweet-smelling scent of woman roused him.</p><p>Handy that she wasn\u2019t wearing panties.</p><p>Tell squinted at the clock. Four thirty. He had to start chores in another hour anyway, so he may as well use this time to his advantage.</p><p>Georgia slept on her side, curled into a ball.</p> <p>He slipped his fingers beneath the hem of the T-shirt she\u2019d borrowed, finding her warm, soft skin. When his hands began the thorough ascent of her spine, her back bowed and she made a humming sound. A sound which traveled straight to his dick.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia,\u201d he whispered, breathing in the heady scent of her hair.</p><p>\u201cMmm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s morning. Do you know what that means?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe went to bed too late?\u201d she murmured sleepily.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His mouth found the shell of her ear and he followed it with his tongue. \u201cIt means I can make love to you since night is over.\u201d</p><p>She half-rolled into him, tangling their legs and rubbing her smooth, muscular calf over his. \u201cBut I\u2019m tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wake you up.\u201d He kissed the corners of her eyes. Her temples. The edges of her smile. \u201cI want you like this. Warm and sweet and barely awake in my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cM\u2019kay.\u201d She rose up enough to ditch the shirt. \u201cYou always have such great ideas.\u201d Then she rolled onto her back, keeping her arms above her head and her eyes closed.</p><p>Tell nuzzled the outside curves of her tits, inhaling the fragrance of her skin first thing in the morning. The underswell tasted tangy\u2014of her sweat and sleep. He sucked a tiny love bruise on the upper curve, then he focused his attention on her nipples. Sucking. Licking. Biting. Pinching. Pleasing himself with her body and turning her into a squirmy, sighing mass.</p><p>His fingers trailed over her slit, finding her core hot and wet. He swirled those digits into the sweet cream.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s awake now,\u201d he murmured and tapped her hip. \u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone likes to take me from behind,\u201d she murmured back as she rolled onto her belly.</p><p>He made a place between her legs and hiked up her hips. His hands roamed over her arms, her strong back, her hips and her ass. Goddamn she had the finest ass. He scattered kisses down her torso. Tracking the line of her spine from her shoulders down, pressing openmouthed kisses in the dimples of her ass. He rubbed his morning whiskers on her cheeks, then traced the crack to her tailbone, loving the hitch in her breath when his tongue dipped down to circle her anus.</p><p>Then he caged her body beneath his and aligned his cock. His need to rut on her nearly overtook him as he slid home. But he paused just to breathe, just to absorb this perfect union of bodies as he made love to her. Savoring her every moan. Savoring every connection of his hard flesh into the softness of hers.</p><p>All at once he ramped up the tempo. Pounding into her. Going primal at the visual of his big, rough hands gripping her ass cheeks. His rigid cock disappearing into her wet and welcoming cunt.</p><p>Georgia pushed her hips back, taking every slamming thrust.</p><p>He could go for hours in the morning, so a quick rise to orgasm caught him off guard. He released a soft snarl as jets of hot come shot out of his dick. White spots, black dots all danced behind his eyelids, and he kept up the rapid rhythm until he felt dizzy and realized he\u2019d been holding his breath.</p><p>That\u2019s when he also realized he hadn\u2019t worn a condom.</p><p>Falling onto his hands, he sucked in air and didn\u2019t bother to try and stay the trembling in his limbs. \u201cDammit, Georgia, I\u2019m sorry. I forgot a condom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m on the pill, so we\u2019re protected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God.\u201d</p><p>He pushed back to his knees and gently rolled her over, knowing she hadn\u2019t come yet. Running his palms up the outside of her legs, he stopped to span the sexy curve of her hips. Then he moved his hands up her belly, molding her compact ribcage, squeezing those plump tits and cupping her slim shoulders. \u201cSo perfectly beautiful. Everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But bein\u2019 able to touch you like this, anytime I want? Is a dream come true for me.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wreathed her arms around his neck. \u201cAre you always such a sweet talker at the butt crack of dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could learn to be. If we did this every morning to start the day out right.\u201d He shoved his cock in deep on the first stroke.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She arched. \u201cI love that you\u2019re still hard. Even after you come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do it to me. I can\u2019t get enough of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m so close. Don\u2019t slow down.\u201d She moaned when he angled his pelvis, brushing over her clit.</p><p>Tell buried his face in her throat. \u201cIt\u2019s there, baby. I can feel your pussy tightening around my cock.\u201d He panted as he rammed into her hard, bottoming out with each thrust. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s body arched so much he could only see the tip of her chin as she unraveled. Her nails were digging into his ass so deeply he knew he\u2019d bear gouges on his butt cheeks.</p><p>That\u2019s when he fused his mouth to hers and lost himself in the taste of her kiss. That\u2019s when Tell knew he\u2019d do anything to keep her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Hello, walk of shame.</p><p>With her mother in the house.</p><p>But worth it. So worth it.</p><p>Georgia tiptoed up the stairs, noticing the door to the guest bedroom was closed. She stripped and crawled between the sheets, drifting to sleep with a smile on her face.</p><p>She woke up three hours later and brewed a pot of coffee to chase away her lethargy. Tempting to laze in the sun like a contented cat today. But since she hadn\u2019t spent time with her mother yesterday, she wanted to do something fun today.</p><p>Fun. Tell McKay was definitely rubbing off on her.</p><p>As she crossed the foyer to get the newspaper, she heard a loud thump in the guest bedroom. She glanced at the clock. Strange that her early-bird mother wasn\u2019t up at nine o\u2019clock. Maybe she was sick.</p><p>Georgia scaled the stairs, pausing outside the door. She heard more thumps. \u201cMom? Are you all right?\u201d She opened the door and froze upon seeing her father\u2019s bare back and naked butt bouncing as he nailed her mother from behind.</p><p>\u201cOmigod! What are you doing?\u201d As if it wasn\u2019t obvious.</p><p>Her mother shrieked and her parents collapsed on the bed, her father valiantly yanking the covers over them.</p><p>That was the last thing Georgia had ever expected to see. Or wanted to see, quite frankly.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia, it\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of my business and I\u2019m...\u201d Running like hell. She slammed the door, racing downstairs and outside.</p><p>The sky was blue, the grass was green, the sun was yellow. Nope, she hadn\u2019t somehow wandered into another dimension.</p><p>Good. God. She\u2019d walked in on her parents having sex. Her divorced parents. Robert and Irina Hotchkiss hated each other. Didn\u2019t they?</p><p>There\u2019d be hell to pay if she lost her deposit because her amorous parents\u2014for the love of God\u2014had put dents in the Sheetrock from the headboard banging into the wall.</p><p>How long had this been going on? And what did it mean?</p><p>Georgia had no idea how long she sat curled up in the swing, random thoughts bouncing in her head. She jumped when the screen door creaked.</p><p>\u201cGeorgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s coffee in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, about what you\u2014\u201d</p><p>She held up her hand. \u201cI don\u2019t ever wanna talk about it. Ever. Or think about it. Ever. I\u2019m sorta hoping the sun will fry my retinas and burn out the images no child should ever see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being ridiculous,\u201d her mother chided. \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time your father and I have had sex since we divorced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOmigod, Mom. I don\u2019t need to know that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That I still like sex? Or that I still like sex with Robert\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop talking! Stop talking right now.\u201d Georgia stuck her fingers in her ears and said, \u201cLa la la I can\u2019t hear you,\u201d just in case her mother kept blathering on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was some maturity.</p><p>That sent her mother stomping off, and she slammed the back door.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t exactly mature either.</p> <p>She should\u2019ve stayed with Tell until he finished chores. Then she wouldn\u2019t have known her parents were some sort of fuck buddies.</p><p>Fuck buddies.</p><p>Her parents.</p><p>She\u2019d laugh if she didn\u2019t feel like crying, yelling and hiding\u2014all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cAre you done with your snit?\u201d her mother asked with that imperious Russian inflection.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Metal scraped across the cement and her mother parked herself in front of the swing so Georgia couldn\u2019t escape. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you walked in on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as sorry as I am,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, you\u2019re a little old to be traumatized by this! Especially since chances are high you and Tell McKay were doing the exact same thing last night.\u201d</p><p>Do not blush. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have to see it, did you? And what am I supposed to think? Are you and Dad getting back together?\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked shocked by the question.</p> <p>Or was that guilt because she was just using her ex-husband for sex?</p><p>\u201cThe truth is I don\u2019t know what happens next. Robert and I...have issues. Too many, it seems. And then when I see him again, it\u2019s like those issues disappear.\u201d</p><p>Good Lord. Was she talking about...lust?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why when I left him I had to move far away. Because when we\u2019re in those intimate moments, everything else fades into the background. Then reality sets in and I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you still love him?\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes met hers. \u201cI never stopped loving him, moyah doch. I just couldn\u2019t live with him anymore.\u201d</p><p>Georgia felt the shock of that statement clear to the marrow of her bones. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. Neither of you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings that happen privately between a husband and wife aren\u2019t meant to be shared. Especially not with children.\u201d She shoved a hand through her hair. \u201cRobert and I were both so raw and angry after RJ died. He wanted a fresh start. I was too mired in grief to question him. When I woke up out of that fog, he and I immediately started playing the blame game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout RJ dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, about you. I hadn\u2019t realized how much you\u2019d pulled away from everyone. Robert blamed me for that. I blamed him for making us move to a hog farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t pull away from anyone. I tried to be the glue that held everyone together. You and Dad. Me and Deck.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou were a mess. Such a mess that you don\u2019t remember it. Sweetie, you\u2019re still a mess. You don\u2019t let anyone get close to you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened to deny it but she honestly couldn\u2019t. So she deflected. \u201cAre you saying the fact my husband was banging another girl is somehow...my fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, no. We shoulder a lot of the blame in accepting Deck into our family. We thought he made you happy. And he wanted to marry you...you never said otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Her parents hadn\u2019t seen anything wrong with encouraging her to get married right out of high school. Early marriage was the norm for women in her family. Her mother had married at nineteen. Both her grandmothers had been married off by age seventeen. And she and Deck weren\u2019t the only couple from their class to exchange I dos the summer after graduation.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t undo any of those past mistakes, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>That sense of surrealness washed over her again. They\u2019d never talked about any of this.</p><p>\u201cThen after RJ died, your father relied heavily on Deck because he couldn\u2019t count on me. Robert lost his faith and I\u2019d always used his unwavering belief in God to bolster mine. Without his convictions...I had none. So we both lost our way. We\u2019re slowly but surely finding it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you finding your way back to each other?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cPerhaps. But regardless what happens, I believe it\u2019s time you mend fences with your father.\u201d She held up her hand. \u201cAnd no, he didn\u2019t put me up to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where to start.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIronically enough, neither does he.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut he has mentioned making an effort, not that I know what that means.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had lunch together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Robert made it sound much more involved than that.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t need to point out her father\u2019s grandiose schemes to her mother. \u201cWell, if I see Dad, I\u2019ll make the effort too. For as long as I\u2019m in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it all right if I let him know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She stretched out on the porch swing. \u201cSo what do you wanna do today? It\u2019s not supposed to be too hot. We could hike the long trail around Devil\u2019s Tower. Or maybe head to Spearfish Canyon to see Roughlock Falls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well. I promised Robert I\u2019d help clean out the house. I left things there and he doesn\u2019t know what to do with them now that the place has been sold.\u201d</p><p>Her mom was ditching her? For her dad? Unbelievable.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re not mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s fine. I tentatively had plans with Tell anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said too much about him.\u201d Her mother sipped her coffee. \u201cMakes me think there\u2019s more to this thing with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m not sticking around. I have a life in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d</p><p>She hated it when her mom said hmm. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re being honest with yourself. It feels to me like you came back to Sundance because you\u2019ve got unfinished business here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boss didn\u2019t give me a choice. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have chosen to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now that you\u2019ve been here awhile, has that attitude changed?\u201d</p><p>Yes. And I don\u2019t know what to do about it.</p><p>Her mother laughed. \u201cYou and RJ both had that look. When I see that stubborn tilt to your chin, I know the subject is closed.\u201d She stood. \u201cI have to meet your father and I don\u2019t know how long this will take. So, umm...don\u2019t wait up.\u201d</p><p>Georgia waited a whole hour before she called Tell.</p><p>\u201cHey, sweetness, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how you\u2019re always surprising me with spur-of-the-moment fun? Today is your lucky day, cowboy, because I\u2019m returning the favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right? And what fun stuff can I look forward to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe in a bikini. Wear your sexy board shorts and bring a towel.\u201d</p><p>When Tell didn\u2019t immediately respond, she worried she\u2019d taken it for granted he\u2019d have Sunday afternoon free. \u201cLook. If you don\u2019t want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get your panties in a twist. It\u2019s not that. I\u2019m more surprised than anything.\u201d His voice dropped to a deep rasp. \u201cAnd I\u2019m feelin\u2019 a little cocky that you\u2019re takin\u2019 the lead. Admit it, hot lips, you like that I\u2019ve helped you unleash your fun side.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her forehead against the closet door. \u201cI appreciate it more than you can possibly know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow soon do I need to be ready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s rough-tipped index finger trailed up the inside of her arm, sending ripples of gooseflesh from her wrist to her shoulder. \u201cCome on. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re always up for trying something new.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t blush.</p><p>\u201cThink about it. You\u2019re breathing hard. Sweating from the effort. And when you\u2019re in the moment, feeling weightless and boneless, you never want it to end.\u201d</p><p>Georgia gave him a droll stare. The man made everything sound like sex.</p><p>\u201cI see them wheels churning, Georgia. You want to. You know you want to.\u201d He rubbed his mouth across her knuckles. \u201cPlease say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain something to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does a grown man have a gigantic trampoline?\u201d</p><p>Tell shrugged. \u201cI got it for Landon. He loves the damn thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. You got it for Landon. Like you got the zip line for Landon.\u201d</p><p>When he offered that completely sheepish, totally charming grin, she melted. \u201cBusted. I always wanted one when I was a kid and Dad never let us have one. So I\u2019m makin\u2019 up for lost childhood opportunities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad.\u201d She frowned. \u201cWhat else did your father deny you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVisits from Santa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. No Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy or the Great Pumpkin either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor baby.\u201d Joking aside, it caused a dull ache to imagine a young Tell, missing out on some of the best aspects of being a kid. That sense of wonder. And the possibility that magic existed. Her parents had given her that.</p><p>\u201cThe weird thing? We had dirt bikes. Guess Pop didn\u2019t care if we broke a bone or cracked open our skulls bein\u2019 reckless boys, but stockings filled with candy and toys were dangerous.\u201d He smiled but it didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy dad was furious when I made the cheerleading squad. He said it was too dangerous being tossed up in the air. But he had no problem with RJ getting on the back of a bull or a buckin\u2019 horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks. But on the bright side for me, my dad was an equal opportunity hater. No one got special treatment\u2014we all just got bad treatment.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Tell said that, she knew he regretted his honesty. He tried so damn hard to be the happy-go-lucky guy. If she kept thinking about the sweet little boy who\u2019d never gotten a visit from Santa, she might start weeping. So she offered up her own recent parental issues.</p><p>\u201cSo in the rush to see your half-naked, totally-buff body glistening in the sun, I forgot to share what I saw this morning after I got home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tell kissed her fingertips. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t say it, I had an awesome time with you at the waterslide park. Damn near perfect day\u2014you prancing around in a tiny bikini. Me getting to slather sunscreen all over this creamy skin.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI still can\u2019t believe you went down the Turbo-Slam. Twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost lost my bikini bottoms on that butt buster,\u201d she muttered. It had been a great afternoon. Tackling the various slides. Racing him to the bottom. Spinning down the white water \u201criver\u201d in inner tubes. Swimming with Tell was an experience in itself. His hot, wet, muscular body sliding against hers. Being weightless in his arms. Kissing him underwater.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Georgia,\u201d he said silkily.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Just flashing back to some of today\u2019s high points.\u201d She smiled. \u201cAnyway, I heard strange noises in the guest bedroom. When I went upstairs to check, I caught my mom and dad banging the holy hell out of each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. I asked if they were getting back together and she couldn\u2019t answer. But she had no problem admitting she still loves my dad. And evidently she still loves having sex with him.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed soothing circles on the base of her thumb. \u201cAre you freaked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little. She said some other things about the time after RJ died that caused me to wonder if I didn\u2019t see things clearly because I was in shock. Not Deck stuff, but family stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you needed a dose of fun today.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI needed a dose of you today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime.\u201d Tell placed a gentle kiss on her lips. His eyes were all soft and she felt that melting sensation again.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever wonder what it\u2019d be like if your parents got back together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t happening. My folks hate each other. Even when things were shitty at home, they never said the kind of mean crap to each other that they let fly in public now. My mom went through a major transformation and she\u2019s happier, but she\u2019s also very self-involved. I understand why she\u2019s that way, since she did everything for everyone else for so many years and little for herself. But she\u2019s not the same person. Makes me sound like a bratty kid, but sometimes I miss the mom I used to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d Georgia\u2019s mother had gone from a reserved Christian homemaker who deferred to her husband in all things to a Russian interpreter with the INS and a vocal supporter of MADD.</p><p>\u201cI figured you of all people would.\u201d He tugged on the bikini string hanging around her neck. \u201cDo you know how much I love bein\u2019 able to talk to you? About anything? You never tell me to grow up or chill out.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s stomach flipped at Tell\u2019s admission, and it scared her too because she was starting to rely on him. She\u2019d sworn she would never be that type of woman again, even when her subconscious reminded her she\u2019d never relied on Deck. It hadn\u2019t been love for either of them; it\u2019d been a marriage based on convenience and family expectations. She steered the conversation back to where they\u2019d started. \u201cSo do you think all our familial issues could\u2019ve been avoided if we\u2019d had a trampoline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPossibly. After seein\u2019 your mom and dad doin\u2019 the nasty, there\u2019s all the more reason for you to go crazy and bounce that image right out of your head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow often do you jump on it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll the damn time.\u201d He grinned. \u201cEspecially if I\u2019ve had a shit day. Hard to be in a pissy mood after bouncing around in the air for a while. So whaddya say? Hop on up. Show me some of them cheerleading jumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I pull something, you\u2019d better be willing to rub out any kinks.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s blue eyes went from flirty to fiery. \u201cOh, darlin\u2019, I can get all the kinks worked outta you and then some.\u201d</p><p>Her heart rate spiked when he lifted her arm to his mouth and kissed the sensitive skin of her inner forearm. Tell kept his panty-melting gaze on hers as he licked the bend in her elbow. Just the tip of his tongue tracing the crease of her elbow like he was tasting her slit and Georgia felt the answering pull in her sex.</p> <p>\u201cI wanna see you.\u201d</p><p>See me what? Come unglued from you licking my damn elbow? Sure. I\u2019m already there. \u201cSee me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLetting go.\u201d Tell angled forward, dragging his mouth down the side of her neck. \u201cYou taste good. Like sweat, sun, suntan oil and chlorine. And wait... Do I detect the taste of...fear?\u201d</p><p>She shoved him. \u201cNot funny. I\u2019m not scared. I have been on a trampoline many times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I know. But I ain\u2019t gonna believe you\u2019re not scared until you hop on up there and show me some hot moves, hot lips.\u201d</p><p>After expelling a heavy sigh, Georgia crawled onto the springy surface. The sides of the trampoline were enclosed with flexible posts and netting to keep bouncers from flying out.</p><p>Tell hung on the outside of the net, a silly grin on his handsome face.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. Heading into dangerous territory, Georgia. This was starting to feel like more than just a summer fling.</p><p>Wow. You\u2019re just figuring that out now?</p><p>The black material was taut and warm beneath her bare feet. She\u2019d bounce a couple of times to get her bearings. Perform a few basic jumps and call it a day. But once she started jumping, she wanted to keep jumping. Seeing how much more air she could catch. Using each landing to propel her higher. Testing her limits.</p><p>She threw her arms up like she was diving into the sky. Then she threw her arms out into a T. She bounced and spun a circle in the air. She bounced and landed on her knees, quickly twisting her body before the next bounce so she landed cross-legged. Performing that move faster and faster so she looked like a Cossack.</p><p>Tell watched her, his fingers threaded through the mesh barrier.</p><p>As Georgia bounced and twirled, she felt light as a feather. Carefree. Happy. Especially when she looked at Tell, knowing if he hadn\u2019t pushed her, she\u2019d still be sitting at the table, yammering on about family problems she had zero control over.</p><p>\u201cShow me some cheerleader jumps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind?\u201d she asked, breathing hard.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite was those splits in the air.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Like this?\u201d Georgia bounced twice, extending her arms and her heels simultaneously.</p><p>Tell whooped. \u201cGoddamn. That was perfect! Do it again.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Georgia bounced harder and caught more air as she stretched herself out like a starfish.</p><p>With Tell egging her on, she performed a couple herkies, pikes, figure nines and back flips, ending with a backscratcher and a reverse twist.</p><p>Feeling lightheaded and giddy but amazingly juiced up, she slowed the bounces and crawled on her knees to where Tell stood. On impulse, she kissed him through the netting. The only places they touched were mouths and fingertips. Erotic and somehow intimate.</p><p>But he broke the kiss far too soon. He rested his forehead against hers. \u201cWill you do something for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Then his fingers were on her chin, forcing her to look at him. \u201cTake off your bikini.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I have another fantasy involving you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery adolescent.\u201d There was his sheepish grin again. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always been a simple guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me this simple adolescent fantasy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Jumping on a trampoline. Nekkid.\u201d</p><p>It took a beat for that to sink in. \u201cOmigod. You cannot be serious.\u201d</p><p>His dimples winked when that bad-boy grin emerged. \u201cI\u2019m totally serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fuckin\u2019 sexy as hell. Seeing all those nekkid girl parts bouncing. Makes me crazy to think of seein\u2019 every bit of your sweet pink pussy when you do a split jump.\u201d</p><p>She was pretty sure her eyes bugged out of her head.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cShocked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My God. How long have you been thinking about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor. Ever. Since the first time I saw you in that itty-bitty cheerleading skirt getting thrown in the air, givin\u2019 everyone in the stands a glimpse of your sweet little ass cheeks. I jacked off to that image more times than I can count.\u201d He actually growled. \u201cSo yeah, I\u2019ve been dreamin\u2019 about this a long damn time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been out here in the buff on your trampoline with your dangly male bits bouncing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no.\u201d He smirked. \u201cI could hurt myself. Bruising my chest when my hard-on bounced against it.\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cYour chest? Cocky much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard you complaining much about me bein\u2019 cocky.\u201d Tell just grinned. \u201cLook, Georgia, darlin\u2019, I wasn\u2019t gonna ask you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you know it\u2019s a ridiculous request?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because I knew you\u2019d say no.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed on him. This was one sneaky-ass man.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said with such an angelic expression she had to laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t try and pull that innocent look, McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he said again. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who said you\u2019re not very adventurous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? I\u2019ve made my case and my point. You won\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>Do not fall for this. Do not.</p><p>She poked his chest. \u201cYou know what, cowboy? I\u2019m about to get daring. Very daring. Like Criss Angel kind of daring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d She shimmied her swimsuit bottoms off and threw them at him. \u201cBut...if you want me to strip the rest of the way, you\u2019ve gotta do something for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it.\u201d</p><p>Georgia cocked her head and focused on his crotch. \u201cI wanna see you whacking off like you did more times than you can count when you were thinking about me bouncing on a trampoline.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s cheeks turned pink. \u201cFunny, Georgia.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. If you want me to jump nekkid, then you will be stroking yourself while you watch me.\u201d</p><p>Ten whole seconds passed until Tell yanked down his board shorts. \u201cTake off the top.\u201d</p><p>She untied the swimsuit top, spun it around her finger and tossed it at him. The hook caught on the netting.</p><p>Tell wrapped his hand around his girth and started to stroke slowly.</p><p>She fell onto her back and bounced a couple times before spreading her legs as she moved her pelvis up, directly in line with Tell\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah. Sweet Georgia has left the building. Bring on Bad Georgia.\u201d He whistled a few bars from \u201cThe Strip\u201d and she laughed.</p><p>Put on a good show. Make him drool. Make him shoot Make him yours forever.</p><p>Tell\u2019s left hand was curled into the mesh; his right hand firmly jacked his cock. His eyes were that deep blue as he stared at her from beneath lowered lashes. His lips were parted, releasing broken breaths.</p><p>Rolling to her feet, Georgia began to jump. Her boobs jiggled and immediately her nipples hardened.</p><p>And his focus zoomed to her chest.</p><p>Imagine that.</p><p>After a few high jumps, she spun around. Letting him watch her ass shake.</p><p>He groaned behind her.</p><p>She performed a frog leap around the perimeter of the trampoline. Then she did a few twists and faced him again.</p><p>Bouncety-bouncety.</p><p>That hand started moving faster after her first straddle-split jump. She did jumping toe touches. Pikes. More straddle splits.</p><p>Her wiggle, jiggle, flounce and bounce routine really got to him because he let go of his dick and croaked, \u201cStop. Goddammit, stop, I can\u2019t take any more.\u201d Then both his hands were white-knuckling the netting.</p><p>When Georgia dropped to her knees to catch her breath, her body started to stiffen up in places. She\u2019d be sore tomorrow. Really sore in more places than her little-used gymnastics muscles if she had her way.</p><p>She crawled across the trampoline, but Tell didn\u2019t open his eyes. But his gaze did snap to hers when she licked his fingers through the mesh. \u201cSo? Did this live up to your fantasy?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>A tiny spark of fear began to burn.</p><p>Then his fingertip was tracing her lip. \u201cThis is a million times better.\u201d</p> <p>His words stirred the bad girl into action. She sucked his thumb into her mouth, swirling her tongue around it. Moaning that she could taste his musky essence lingering there.</p><p>He groaned, \u201cFuck. Me.\u201d</p><p>The digit slid out with a wet pop. \u201cGood plan.\u201d Georgia rolled herself up, letting her nipples poke through the mesh.</p><p>When Tell tried to capture one, she pulled back and laughed seductively. \u201cYou can have me any way you want me, McKay, but you\u2019ve gotta catch me first.\u201d</p><p>Tell scrambled over the edge of the trampoline like a primate scaling a banana tree.</p><p>God he was amazing. All focused, aroused male.</p><p>He yanked his shirt over his head so they were both naked. Wild. Circling each other like wrestlers in the ring.</p><p>Then Tell said, \u201cFuck this,\u201d and launched himself at her, taking the brunt of their bounce on his back as he knocked her off her feet.</p><p>She shrieked and he spun her facedown, resting on his haunches as he hiked up her hips.</p><p>\u201cI caught you.\u201d He slid her knees out, making a place for himself behind her. He spread her thighs and impaled her to the root on the first deep stroke. \u201cAnd you\u2019re all mine now. Say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all yours.\u201d Georgia pushed back to meet his thrusts. Losing her balance when they bounced together, but it felt too good to stop. He\u2019d find the rhythm; he always did.</p><p>He pulled out and she whimpered. He sat back, legs out in front of him, and brought her on top of his lap. \u201cThat ain\u2019t workin\u2019. You drive.\u201d</p><p>She took his hard length in her hand, aligned it to her core and dropped her hips until he filled her completely.</p><p>Tell groaned against her chest, his mouth following the damp curve of her breast to her nipple.</p><p>Georgia threw her head back and dug her nails into his shoulders. Trying to find the right tempo of when to lift and lower. Every time she tried to bring that thickness in deeper, they\u2019d bounce\u2014not in a productive way, but in a way that sent them off-kilter. Tell tried to balance them by keeping his hands on the trampoline behind him, but between the suntan oil, the sweat and the bouncing, they slid sideways whenever she moved.</p><p>He winced and said, \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is pinching my balls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d She carefully scrambled off him.</p><p>Tell reached between his thighs and readjusted himself.</p><p>She was sweaty, frustrated and she needed a goddamn orgasm. Now. Maybe they should just go in the house.</p><p>Georgia looked up to see Tell stalking her on all fours, planting random kisses on her quivering flesh as he positioned his body over hers.</p><p>The heat in his eyes made her mouth dry.</p><p>He scooped her up, clutching her butt cheeks in his hands and said, \u201cWrap your legs around my waist.\u201d</p><p>As soon as she did, he slid her onto his straining dick in one sure and sexy move.</p><p>Yes. She glanced down, his knees splayed wide, his flat belly rubbing against hers with every roll of his hips as his shaft disappeared inside her.</p><p>He murmured, \u201cGoddamn you feel good on me.\u201d</p><p>She surrendered to the sensations of hot, sweaty, intense sex. Feeling those big hands of his squeezing her ass as he helped her ride his cock. Feeling his mouth attacking her throat as their slick bodies glided in opposition.</p><p>When their joined bodies bounced, it drove him deeper inside. Every. Time. And she cried out every time. Despite the heat of his body and the rays of sun beating down, her entire body was a mass of goose bumps.</p><p>So close. The tightening sensation started in her tailbone and radiated upward.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re there, baby. Take me with you.\u201d</p><p>And when Tell gently bit on her earlobe, she lost it.</p><p>The orgasm hit her with the force of a hurricane; no storm warning, it just swamped her. Wave after wave of pleasure crashed over her, making it hard to breathe, to think, to hold on as the power of it inundated her.</p><p>The roaring in her ears stopped. Her body quit vibrating from the last storm surge and she slumped against Tell. Sated. And sleepy. The climax flattened her completely.</p><p>Then Tell\u2019s hands were holding her face. His sweet, hot mouth was on hers, kissing her with that perfect mix of reverence and gratitude.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuck,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cDid you get the name of the coal train that hit us?\u201d</p><p>She snickered. \u201cNo, but at one point I\u2019m pretty sure I heard circus music.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman. Once you started to come, you kept coming, and I was toast.\u201d He placed soft kisses on wherever his lips could land. \u201cSo fuckin\u2019 hot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you broke me. I\u2019m pretty sure I have trampoline burns on my knees and elbows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you don\u2019t have them on your balls,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>Georgia thrust her hands into his hair, tilting his head back to gaze into his eyes. \u201cBuck up, cowboy. The trampoline was your idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think I\u2019m gonna complain about a sex injury that I got after fucking on a trampoline?\u201d He grinned and punctuated each word with a kiss. \u201cNot. On. Your. Life. Baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just proved it.\u201d He swatted her ass. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go in and get cleaned up.\u201d</p><p>Although the suntan oil and sweat was scrubbed clean from her body, Georgia wasn\u2019t anxious to leave the enclosed shower. Hot water, hot man, after hot sex\u2014what more could she want?</p><p>\u201cGod. Your skin is amazing. I could spend all day just touchin\u2019 it. So soft. So perfect.\u201d Tell\u2019s finger followed the arch of her spine from the middle of her back, down the crack of her ass.</p><p>She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Those hypnotic blue eyes never left hers. The shower pelted her shoulders, spraying fine water particles on his face. The misty droplets caught on the dark hair on his cheeks and on his long eyelashes. In that moment, with his intense gaze, he was the most breathtaking man she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Oh, he was dangerous. She\u2019d do anything he wanted, be anything he desired, if only he\u2019d look at her like that forever.</p><p>But you\u2019re leaving, remember?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about it now. Not when Tell was setting her blood on fire with the heat in his eyes and turning her world upside down with the addictive power of his touch.</p><p>His finger stopped on her anus. He insistently stroked the pucker. Pressing a little harder, inserting just a fingertip inside, continuing to gently swirl against the clenched muscle.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t look away even when her cheeks turned bright red. No man had ever breached that part of her.</p><p>\u201cEver been fucked here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Tell made a soft snarl. \u201cThis is mine. If you hadn\u2019t noticed, I ain\u2019t a patient man when it comes to what I want from you. And I want everything.\u201d</p><p>Georgia lost the ability to breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou will give it to me, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want it now.\u201d He angled the shower spray so it hit the floor. Then he reached for a small tube, cracked it open and coated his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou keep lube in your shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. I like to jack off in here.\u201d</p><p>Her heart raced when he lowered his head.</p><p>He allowed two soft brushes of his lips over hers and whispered, \u201cRelax.\u201d Then he plunged his tongue into her mouth as he slipped his finger into her ass.</p><p>That felt weird. Not bad, just not normal. She kissed him as that slippery digit moved in and out, her body tensed with anticipation and a little fear.</p><p>His mouth slid to her chin and he scattered kisses up the line of her jaw, dipping down to suck on the spot on her neck that made her crazy. Dizzy. Mad with want.</p><p>Those warm, full lips feathered across her ear. \u201cCome like this. Touch your clit.\u201d</p><p>Reaching between her legs, she reveled in the eroticism of Tell\u2019s hand already there. She placed her hand on his, feeling him slide his finger deep into her anal passage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFuckin\u2019 hot as hell, Georgia. Give me more.\u201d</p><p>She let her fingertip pass over the strip of skin separating the two openings. She wiggled her middle finger into her pussy, coating it with her juices and dragging her fingertip to the swollen flesh.</p><p>\u201cWhen I fuck your ass this first time? I\u2019m gonna take you from behind. That way I can pull your hair and bite the back of your neck because I know that drives you wild.\u201d</p> <p>God, it turned her on when he whispered such raunchy things. Soft moans began to drift from her mouth as she fingered her clit and Tell worked another finger into her ass. Stretching her. Building another level of anticipation to the point she began to shake.</p><p>When she realized the head of his cock was rubbing on the inside of her arm, she moved her arm faster, increasing the friction for both of them.</p><p>Tell snared her mouth in a blistering kiss.</p><p>Georgia lost herself in this moment. Touching. Tasting. Absorbing the new sensation. Feeling hot, wet flesh sliding together. Hearing harsh breathing and the patter of water droplets against the glass shower door.</p><p>Her finger flicked her clit rapidly until the tingling energy gathered momentum at the base of her spine.</p> <p>Tell ripped his mouth free and rasped, \u201cEyes on mine as you come.\u201d</p><p>That demand tipped her over the edge.</p><p>She moaned his name as the pulsations overtook everything. Her ass clenched around his finger. Her pussy spasmed and her clit pulsed. She gasped with each throb of pleasure, watching satisfaction flare in Tell\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Then his fingers were gone and he ground out, \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>Her heart still crashed against her chest as she braced herself.</p><p>He spread her ass cheeks and the thick cockhead slipped over her anus. Back and forth until she had the burning need for more contact.</p> <p>\u201cTell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelax and let me in, sweetness. It\u2019ll feel amazing. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. One, two, three prods. On the fourth stab, the tip breached that resistant ring.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, baby. I\u2019m gonna go slow.\u201d Then his mouth was skimming her shoulder as he eased in, inch by inch.</p><p>Her ass burned. But an odd sort of burning that wasn\u2019t painful, just constant.</p><p>\u201cSo tight. Goddamn. It\u2019s like having my dick in hot velvet. You okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna move now.\u201d</p> <p>He withdrew, not fully, and pushed back in. Slowly. Carefully. Methodically.</p><p>Tell was the mindful lover, even when she felt his shaking and his need to unleash the power of his body on hers. The burning had faded and again, Georgia had that unnamed need for more.</p><p>\u201cTell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me. Like you want. Remember when you said you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about breaking me when you fuck me hard? Do it now.\u201d</p><p>A warning growl was all she got before his hand was fisted in her hair, pulling her head to the side so his mouth could latch onto her neck.</p><p>That\u2019s when he withdrew past the tight muscle and slammed back in.</p><p>Goose bumps erupted as he fucked her. Pausing at her sphincter, rimming it before pushing his thick shaft into her bowels. The bite of pain in her scalp matched the bite of pain in her ass and she liked it; she liked letting go.</p><p>His hips pistoned faster. Harder. Drilling into her anal passage with every deep plunge He released a hoarse shout and wet warmth bathed her swollen tissues. He pumped and pumped until he had nothing left. Until he was panting. Until he muttered nonsense into her hair. He cranked her head around and took her mouth in a brutal kiss. A kiss that was the perfect end to this dark pleasure.</p><p>His spent cock retreated and he turned the water spray on them, although it was nearly ice cold.</p><p>Georgia faced him, curling her hand around his nape, resting her damp forehead on his chest. Letting his body hold hers up because she felt as solid as a noodle.</p><p>Then those rough hands swept up her back, making her shiver anew.</p><p>\u201cHad enough water games for today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t move much as Tell tended to her. Lifting her out of the shower. Toweling off every inch of her body. Spreading her out on his rumpled sheets.</p><p>He kissed her with pure sensuality. Soft, wet and slow. \u201cDon\u2019t think for a second you\u2019re not adventurous. That you\u2019re anything less than fuckin\u2019 perfect.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when she fell in love with him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Georgia Hotchkiss was his girlfriend.</p><p>For real.</p><p>He grinned at himself in the mirror as he shaved, repeating the phrase out loud. \u201cGeorgia Hotchkiss is my girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>And if that didn\u2019t beat all.</p><p>They\u2019d been damn near inseparable over the last three weeks. Georgia\u2019s job responsibilities had tapered off, leaving her with free time. Time she preferred to spend with him. If she stayed overnight, she\u2019d get up at dawn to help him with chores. Then they\u2019d have the rest of the day together.</p><p>She loved exploring the ranch on the back of his ATV. He\u2019d always figured she was a girly girl, but she didn\u2019t mind getting dirty.</p><p>He\u2019d taught her how to ride a dirt bike, but his heart had almost stopped when she\u2019d wiped out and skidded across the ground. By the time Tell had removed her helmet and protective gear, she\u2019d regained her breath. She batted at his hands when he insisted on checking for broken bones and bruises. The damn stubborn woman had climbed back on the bike, determined to make the tight corner. Which she did.</p><p>Georgia had been so pumped full of adrenaline, she\u2019d fucked him like a wild cat on the hood of his truck. And that\u2019d been a sight to behold\u2014her beautiful skin glowing as the sun\u2019s last rays kissed her damp flesh. Her lips open as she cried out in passion. Her nails digging into his forearms as he made love to the woman who\u2019d captured his interest like no other. A woman he\u2019d started to need like a drug. She was a painkiller, a mood enhancer, an aphrodisiac all wrapped up in one tiny, potent package.</p><p>If Tell really thought about it, he might consider that feeling was love. But never having been in love before, he wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>He scraped another layer of whiskers from his face. Georgia\u2019s skin was so delicate he had to shave twice a day or he\u2019d leave beard burn on her skin. He flashed back to the day last week she\u2019d forbidden him to shave because she wanted to see those marks on the inside of her thighs and her breasts.</p><p>She\u2019d been awful damn squirmy at dart league that night. But knocking back shots with Roxanne and Leah dulled the discomfort, because he\u2019d looked over to see her performing a herkie off the end of the bar.</p><p>Little Miss Georgia had gotten her butt paddled good for that one.</p><p>And she\u2019d loved every minute of it.</p><p>Steam fogged up the bathroom mirror and he swiped it clean. Just thinking about her raised his temperature. Sex with Georgia? Beyond spectacular. More exciting, spontaneous, comforting, fun and hot than he\u2019d ever dreamed it could be with one woman. But as much as he lived to get that sexy woman nekkid, the times they spent out of bed were beyond ordinary too. He\u2019d never imagined she\u2019d be so insightful. She didn\u2019t expect him to always slap on a happy face. If he had a shit day, he didn\u2019t have to hide it. But his shit days were few and far between recently. And he credited her for that.</p><p>She fit in with his friends. Being part of a couple bridged a gap he hadn\u2019t known existed. Almost like his buddies took him more seriously since he\u2019d settled into a steady relationship. Which was ironic, since he found himself wanting to stay home with her more than going out on the town. Over the years he\u2019d secretly sneered at his cousins and married buddies and their seemingly limited amount of free time. But now he understood why the guys wanted to stay home with their wives.</p><p>Even Brandt and Jessie encouraged Tell to bring Georgia over for supper. Her bout of shyness vanished when she held baby Tucker, and she and Jessie chatted like old friends. Tell was fascinated by how babies pulled women together. When he started to imagine a black-haired little boy with Georgia\u2019s pale-blue eyes and his smile, he figured Dalton would whap him in the head for thinking like a girl.</p><p>He turned the taps on and sluiced away the shaving cream. As he patted his face dry, he tried to remember how he\u2019d agreed to help chaperone the dance put on by the Sundance High School Booster Club. Right. Georgia. After assisting him with rodeo club fundraisers and helping the cheerleaders, she\u2019d had the great idea to bring together all the school clubs for one fun event. Everyone was excited and Georgia was creating positive buzz.</p><p>The only sour note was their parental situations. Georgia\u2019s mother had started pressuring her to work on rebuilding a relationship with her father. Tell couldn\u2019t fault Georgia for her trepidation. Only a person who\u2019d suffered through family dramas understood that forgiveness wasn\u2019t automatically given. Sometimes it wasn\u2019t earned. And sometimes letting go was the best option. Not politically correct, but often necessary.</p><p>Not that Tell\u2019s situation with his father had changed much. Casper only called to rail on Tell about something. And he hadn\u2019t heard from his mother beyond a couple of short texts. She must not have needed a baby-sitter.</p><p>As far as Tell was concerned, out of sight, out of mind was the best way to deal with his folks. He couldn\u2019t change them or their behavior, so why even try now? He was beyond pretending it would make a difference. The only control he had in the situation was not letting his past ruin his future.</p><p>A future he hoped to have with Georgia.</p><p>After he\u2019d tried her phone for the twentieth time and the call was immediately kicked over to voice mail for the twentieth time, he drove into town. His panic increased when he pulled up in front of her house and saw her car parked in the drive. What if she was sick? She didn\u2019t answer his knock.</p><p>Tempting to break in, but he found a space between the fence and a lilac bush that allowed him to enter the backyard. He hoped she\u2019d just lost track of time and was sitting on the swing, enjoying the late afternoon sunshine on this mild summer day.</p><p>No sign of her.</p><p>Tell tried the handle on the back door and discovered it was unlocked. He stepped into the kitchen and called out, \u201cGeorgia?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silence.</p><p>The coffee pot was half full of cold coffee. One bowl, one spoon and one cup were in the sink. Just as he decided to check her bedroom upstairs, he noticed her cell phone on the table. Right next to a calendar.</p><p>He didn\u2019t pay much attention to dates, and most days he\u2019d be hard-pressed to answer if someone asked him the actual date. He saw that she\u2019d written in events for all the days of this month except for one. This day, the third of August, was devoid of any marks.</p> <p>A punch of sadness hit him as well as guilt.</p><p>Now he had a pretty good idea where she was.</p><p>It was so like Georgia not to mention it. He hoped she wouldn\u2019t reject his comfort because he hadn\u2019t remembered what today was.</p><p>Although it wasn\u2019t far to the cemetery, Tell opted to drive. The gates were still open and he parked in the empty visitors\u2019 lot. Gravel crunched beneath his boots as he started on the first path.</p><p>This was one of the few places in Sundance where deciduous trees grew. Weeping willows, which were appropriate, he supposed. Soft breezes stirred the branches. Dappled sunlight threw shadows on the manicured grounds and across the headstones.</p> <p>Tell avoided the cemetery as a general rule. The McKays had their own section in the far corner, in the oldest part, since his great-great-grandfather Jonas McKay had been one of the first settlers in Wyoming Territory. The odd thing was he\u2019d only been in this cemetery twice. For his grandfather Jed McKay\u2019s burial and when they buried Luke. He remembered his surprise at seeing how few McKays were buried there, and feeling sadness at how much space was available for the existing McKays</p><p>He\u2019d never understood why his mother came here bearing flowers and tears\u2014because Luke wasn\u2019t here. Were visits solely a reminder of the finality of death? Or some weird prompt for survivors not to forget the loved one they\u2019d lost?</p><p>Trying to keep his morbid thoughts at bay, he scanned the neatly ordered sections of grave markers, some elaborate, some simple, some so weathered by the harsh Wyoming elements the names and dates were no longer visible.</p><p>Then he saw her, five rows over, sitting cross-legged, her back to him. Her glorious black hair shone in the sunlight.</p><p>Part of him wanted to leave, to let her have the private moment, just relieved he knew where she was.</p><p>But a bigger part of him wanted her to realize he was there, ready to give her whatever she needed, whenever she needed it.</p> <p>And that\u2019s when Tell knew that he was in love with her. Not the beautiful girl from his past he\u2019d put on a pedestal. But the beautiful, complex woman she\u2019d become, even when she swore she wasn\u2019t sure who that woman was. The woman he\u2019d cherish every damn day of his life, if she let him.</p><p>Confessing his love while she wept at her brother\u2019s grave could possibly be the worst timing in the world.</p><p>He approached her cautiously.</p><p>Georgia glanced up when Tell\u2019s shadow fell across her. She wiped her tears and managed a wan smile. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I\u2019m surprised you found me.\u201d</p><p>Tell crouched down, within touching distance if she was so inclined to reach out for him. \u201cAs far as hiding places go, this is a pretty good one. Or a pretty bad one, depending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad, mostly. But no one looks at you funny if you\u2019re sitting alone crying.\u201d She sniffled. \u201cMostly they just leave you be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p> <p>He watched her, not shocked by her grief, but by the fact that she wasn\u2019t chasing him away. Maybe she did need him for more than sex and good times.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been here since a year after his accident.\u201d Her fingers plucked pieces of grass, turning the blades into green confetti. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I expected to be different. Maybe if I started talking to him, like in the movies, his ghost would appear. But to be honest, I\u2019d probably wet my pants and run away screaming if that did happen.\u201d</p><p>He had no idea what to say to that, so he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cI miss him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you do, baby.\u201d</p><p>Georgia ripped up more grass. Tears streamed down her cheeks. Her chin trembled.</p><p>He felt so damn helpless, even when he knew exactly what she was going through. He dealt with the anniversary of Luke\u2019s death differently, surrounding himself with people\u2014strangers usually\u2014so he had no choice but to slap on a happy face and not dwell on the loss.</p><p>Several long moments passed. Then she blindly reached out to him. \u201cI...\u201d</p><p>Tell stood and picked her up like she was a child, cradling her to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>She melted into him, with a whispered, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart, sweetness. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake me home.\u201d</p><p>He headed back to his truck, wishing he could wrap her in cotton batting and keep her safe from all the hurt the world inflicted. He rubbed his lips over her crown, breathing in the scent of her, murmuring assurances he\u2019d be there for her, no matter what.</p><p>She\u2019d stopped crying, but she clung to him.</p><p>By the time he reached the parking lot, a prickly feeling caused the hair on the back of his neck stand up. He turned and saw an older man standing at the opposite end of the path.</p><p>A man he recognized as Georgia\u2019s father.</p><p>Tell started in that direction, but the man shook his head. Then he pointed to Georgia, indicating Tell should continue as he was, tending to the weeping woman in his arms. Tell nodded, but it made him uneasy, given the strained relationship Georgia had with her father.</p><p>\u201cWhere to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour place.\u201d</p><p>Such a surprise that she preferred his crappy trailer to her house in town. Wait. Did she consider his place...home?</p><p>She stayed in the middle of the bench seat, tucking herself against his side so no space remained between them. Tell idly played with her hair, letting music from the radio fill the silence on the drive to house.</p><p>Once they were inside his trailer, he noticed her cradling her arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep forgetting about my tattoo and then I rub against it.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cWhen did you get a tat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore I went to the cemetery. It\u2019s a memorial tattoo India did for RJ. So I don\u2019t forget what he meant to me.\u201d</p><p>Oh. Sweetness. You are such a beautiful woman. Inside and out. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She blew out a long breath. \u201cOkay. It hurt a lot. I cried while she was doing it. I cried when she finished.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe the tears weren\u2019t only from the pain of the needle?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her beautiful eyes were wet again. \u201cNo. How did you know?\u201d</p><p>He just stared at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Thoughtless of me, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes I\u2019m so...selfish in my grief I forget I\u2019m not the only one in the world who\u2019s lost a brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s lost your brother,\u201d Tell said gently.</p><p>Georgia touched his face, her palms lightly resting on his jaw as her thumbs stroked his cheekbones and his temples. \u201cYou are a good man, Tell McKay. Everyone underestimates you, don\u2019t they? Believing you\u2019re just a laid-back, fun-loving guy out for a good time. You keep things light because you don\u2019t want people to realize the intensity of emotion inside you.\u201d</p><p>How in the hell had she seen that?</p><p>\u201cThank you for letting me see that part of you. Thank you for letting me have some of your strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnytime, sweetness. Anytime.\u201d</p><p>She looked down and tears dripped on her jeans. \u201cI\u2019m so tired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. C\u2019mere.\u201d Tell hauled her onto his lap.</p><p>She wiggled until she found her spot and sighed.</p><p>He kissed her crown. \u201cRest. I\u2019ve got ya.\u201d</p><p>They both dozed off.</p><p>Georgia shifted and something sticky rubbed on his arm.</p><p>He glanced down and saw blood. He kissed her forehead, wanting to wake her up gently. \u201cGeorgia? You\u2019re bleeding through the gauze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuess that\u2019s my sign it\u2019s time to clean the skin and change the bandage.\u201d She sat up. \u201cAre you squeamish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Why? Do you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d</p><p>Tell followed her to the bathroom.</p><p>She ripped off the gauze and surgical tape. She wet a big cotton square with water and squirted on antibacterial soap, dabbing at the crusted blood. After rinsing with clean water, she patted the area dry. \u201cWanna see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah.\u201d</p><p>Georgia showed him the inside of her forearm. Black block initials RJ outside a red circle. But upon closer inspection, the circle appeared to be in 3D, like a woman\u2019s rounded belly, with the yin and yang symbols at the center.</p><p>\u201cThis is perfect. Did you design it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust the rough sketches. India did the real design work.\u201d</p><p>Tell stroked the crease of her elbow. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment thing for you.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s how you end up with bad tattoos, with random, meaningless Chinese symbols, according to India. I scheduled an appointment for today several weeks ago. Right after I decided to make a permanent mark on my body to match the permanent mark I\u2019ve had on my soul ever since RJ died.\u201d</p><p>Poor woman had such deep pockets of sadness inside her. \u201cI could\u2019ve gone with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And I appreciate the offer. But it was something I had to do on my own.\u201d</p><p>She smeared A&amp;D on the surface and he covered it with gauze. He kissed each side of the tattoo. When he glanced up at her, tears pooled in her eyes again.</p><p>\u201cThank you. It feels better already.\u201d</p><p>Tell tucked a strand of hair behind her ear, then followed the line of her jaw to the other ear. \u201cLet me love on you a little while, Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like I need extra TLC today?\u201d</p><p>Yes. \u201cMaybe after seeing you like this...I\u2019m the one who needs it.\u201d</p><p>Her sweet, lopsided smile nearly undid him. \u201cOkay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her softly. Slowly. Waiting for that moment when she swayed into him. When that happened, he lifted her in his arms and carried to his bedroom. He kept his mouth on hers as he undressed her, his hands lovingly caressing every section of skin he exposed. \u201cLie back.\u201d</p><p>While she stretched out, he stripped and rolled on a condom.</p><p>He positioned himself above her, loving how her arms immediately circled his neck, pulling him closer. His cock needed no guidance; it connected with her opening and he eased inside on a slow, wet glide. Resting his forehead to hers, he stayed still, losing himself in this moment.</p> <p>Then Georgia\u2019s hands were gripping his hair, pulling his head back to look into his eyes. \u201cHey. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m not. She had no idea how everything had changed for him today. Realizing he loved her and hoping a part of her was attuned enough to him to sense the change. He held her gaze as he started to move, her tight channel such a perfect fit.</p><p>She rolled her hips up to meet his easy thrusts, not in an attempt to get him to increase the pace, but showing him this wouldn\u2019t be him making love to her\u2014but them making love together.</p><p>Even when her climax was within reach, she didn\u2019t lock her legs around his waist, grab his ass and grind into him. She just let him, let the connection of their bodies take her there.</p><p>Tell watched her beautiful face awash in pleasure. When he couldn\u2019t hold back another second, he threw his head back, feeling her mouth on his throat, sucking in time to the pulses shooting out of his cock.</p> <p>It was glorious, this love thing.</p><p>His damn legs almost wouldn\u2019t hold him when he scooted off the bed to ditch the condom. He scrutinized himself in the mirror as he washed his face and hands. Wondering if being in love made him look different.</p><p>Nope. He looked the same, except for the huge fucking hickey Georgia had given him on the side of his neck. He\u2019d never understood the appeal of those marks until now. For the next couple days, he\u2019d remember the woman he loved had given it to him in a moment of passion.</p><p>Georgia was propped on the pillows, the sheet clutched to her chest when he returned. Some of the shadows were gone from her eyes, and she smiled at him. \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>He pounced on her. \u201cYou.\u201d He pecked her lips. \u201cRocked.\u201d Another peck. \u201cMy.\u201d One last smooch. \u201cWorld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd thank you for... Omigod, is that a...hickey?\u201d Her cheeks turned the same color as the mark she\u2019d left on his skin. \u201cI did that?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep. And I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s what made me come so hard.\u201d</p><p>She blushed deeper. This woman was such a contradiction, Bold one second, shy the next. He loved that about her.</p><p>You love everything about her, you fucking sap.</p><p>\u201cSo what else do you wanna do tonight? We could hang out in bed. Watch a movie. I\u2019ve probably got frozen pizza. There\u2019s beer and soda in the fridge.\u201d</p><p>Georgia set her hands on his face again, touching him with such tenderness and gratitude. \u201cThank you, Tell. I don\u2019t care what we do as long as I do it with you.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t keep it light, he might fall at her feet and beg her to stay with him every night. \u201cNow that there are no limits, I\u2019m thinking about breaking out the cuffs.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Georgia watched from the medical tent as Tell chatted with a group of guys before the performance started.</p> <p>The man was magnificent. Not just his physique. Not just his face. Not just his charm. Not just his ease with people that put them at ease. All those things by themselves were pretty impressive, but were powder-keg potent wrapped up in one hunky cowboy package.</p><p>This was the last event they\u2019d work together before the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo next weekend. That would be a tense situation since Deck was also scheduled to judge.</p><p>Not that she\u2019d told Tell about it.</p><p>Not only that, she hadn\u2019t let him know she\u2019d be leaving in two weeks. Every time she thought about broaching the subject, fear would overtake her. Imagining the accusations and hurt in his eyes sent a shiver of dread zipping up her spine.</p><p>She had no choice but to go back to Dallas. Her position wasn\u2019t freelance; she couldn\u2019t do it from here. She doubted there were any jobs for her in her field in Sundance, Moorcroft or Hulett.</p><p>If you could find work here, would you stay?</p><p>In a heartbeat.</p><p>Georgia couldn\u2019t think along those lines. Barbara was pleased enough with her job performance that she\u2019d scheduled a review for two weeks after her return to the office to discuss her promotion.</p><p>What would a promotion mean? More money? Couldn\u2019t be much; she was still a lower-tier employee, which was why Barbara\u2019s insistence that Georgia relocate to Wyoming for the summer had come as such a surprise. A couple coworkers had been jealous, even when they had families and couldn\u2019t take the job anyway. Maybe it stung a little that the people she\u2019d considered her friends hadn\u2019t bothered to call her in the last eleven weeks.</p><p>But Roxanne and Leah called her. So did Stephanie. She\u2019d had lunch with Chassie. Domini made time for her when she dropped in to Dewey\u2019s. India called to see how she\u2019d fared after getting a tattoo. Even AJ called and nagged her to come in for a massage.</p><p>What a change from when she\u2019d first arrived in town.</p><p>She no longer dreaded going to the grocery store, worrying who she\u2019d run into, even after she\u2019d run into Tara-Lee. She could talk to people about RJ without breaking down. She liked exploring her domestic side, cooking dinner for Tell and working in her tiny garden. She looked forward to hanging out with the friends who\u2019d become more than just drinking buddies. She\u2019d discovered that volunteering gave her a sense of purpose as well as satisfaction.</p><p>The sobering part was when she realized that she wouldn\u2019t have any of that when she returned to Dallas.</p><p>But mostly, she wouldn\u2019t have Tell.</p><p>So she would have him now. She\u2019d take him as many times as she could get him, in as many ways as possible.</p><p>Georgia felt the other men\u2019s eyes on her as she approached Tell. \u201cGentlemen, can you excuse us? I need to talk to Mr. McKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLead the way, Miss Hotchkiss.\u201d</p><p>Their formal use of titles wasn\u2019t fooling anyone, not that they\u2019d tried keeping their relationship under wraps.</p><p>Wanting privacy, Georgia wandered to the far side of the corral, away from contestants and other rodeo officials.</p><p>The scenery was spectacular. Breathing in a lungful of clean air, she knew she\u2019d miss the scent of sage and how scorching hot days were tempered into cool mountain nights.</p><p>When she turned around from admiring the view, another amazing view greeted her.</p><p>Tell\u2019s back rested against a corner section of the metal corral. His head was cocked at a jaunty angle, shadowing his face beneath the brim of his hat. \u201cDid you need something official, Miss Hotchkiss?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou still pissy with me?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes trapped hers. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d broken down the night before last, guilt-ridden by her inability to give him the truth on any level. His immediate need to comfort her had increased her feelings of guilt and she\u2019d taken off without explanation. She\u2019d called later and apologized, making up a story about work stress, but she sensed he hadn\u2019t believed her.</p><p>She sauntered forward, wearing a you-want-it-bad-boy smile on her lips. \u201cWill you let me make it up to you?\u201d</p><p>His big hands curled around her hips and he yanked her against his body. \u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d</p><p>Her lips met his in a slow slide. She wanted a gradual shift from sweet kisses to fiery. But as usual Tell wrested control. Kissing her passionately. Trying to push her to the point where her need for him overtook her common sense.</p><p>Not this time. In a moment of spontaneity, she decided to see just how far she could push him. Georgia broke the kiss with a murmured, \u201cBad boy, McKay.\u201d</p><p>He smiled against her cheek, but didn\u2019t apologize.</p><p>She shifted her stance. Her right hand trailed down his vest, stopping at his belt. A quick tug and the buckle was out of her way, allowing access to his button and zipper.</p><p>\u201cWhile I appreciate your intent to make this right between us, we should hold off\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t intend to hold off. I intend to get you off. Right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeorgia. We\u2019re in public. Anyone could wander back here and see what you\u2019re doin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d better keep an eye out, hadn\u2019t you?\u201d She lowered the zipper and slipped her hand between his boxers and his warm skin until she found her prize. Tell\u2019s cock wasn\u2019t completely hard\u2014she\u2019d soon fix that. \u201cBesides, it looks like we\u2019re having a private, intense conversation. No one will bother us. Westerners are polite that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s gotten into you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA sense of adventure. My own personal brand of fun.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI deserved that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd more.\u201d She loved how his shaft swelled in her hand and she kept squeezing until he was fully erect. Then she began to stroke. Not slow and easy. Quick and hard, exactly how he liked it. She let her lips whisper across his ear. \u201cI wish my hand was slippery with lube.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet baby Jesus,\u201d he hissed.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should kiss my neck a little, so it looks like we\u2019re making up from a lover\u2019s spat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are gonna pay for this bossiness,\u201d he murmured, nuzzling the side of her face.</p><p>\u201cWill you force me to my knees? So you can feel this\u2014\u201d she jacked his shaft twice, \u201c\u2014gliding across my tongue as you fill my mouth with every inch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re yanking on the devil\u2019s tail here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I though I was yanking on something else.\u201d The tip of his cock leaked steadily and she moved her hand faster. She lost herself in the moment\u2014she\u2019d actually taken Tell by surprise.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn that feels good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t throw your head back and look like you\u2019re about to come.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t squeeze so hard unless you\u2019re tryin\u2019 to keep me from coming,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>\u201cI want you to come. I want to feel those pulses that make you groan and your body shake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t be long. You rev me up in record time, hot lips.\u201d</p> <p>The husky voice wound around her body like a velvet caress. \u201cGive it to me, Tell.\u201d</p><p>He let his head fall forward. His grip on her hips increased but he didn\u2019t buck his hips into her hand. He was completely passive, letting her control his pleasure. Trusting her.</p><p>She increased her rhythm. As soon as she heard a catch in his breath, she smashed her mouth to his. Swallowing his groan of satisfaction. Kissing him crazily as he spilled warm and wet over her fingers.</p><p>The pulses in his shaft stopped and he released one last shudder. Several tender kisses later, Tell leaned back to gaze into her eyes. Everything she\u2019d ever wanted was right there.</p><p>Her heart seized up. How could she ever leave him?</p> <p>\u201cGeorgia, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She carefully removed her hand. \u201cNothing. You\u2019ll have to deal with fastening your jeans. My hand is a little sticky.\u201d</p><p>His laughter morphed into a masculine growl when she brought her fingers to her mouth and sucked. One by one.</p><p>Then he kissed her. His way. With such sweet deliberation tears threatened, and when he finally released her mouth, she was shaking.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s put that sadness in your eyes, sweetness. But you can talk to me about anything.\u201d</p><p>Tell\u2019s tender loving care the day he\u2019d tracked her down at the cemetery had rocked her to her very foundation. He hadn\u2019t offered platitudes or tried to cajole her out of a mood. He\u2019d just seen to her, accepting her pockets of sadness, offering her his comfort until she took it.</p> <p>Just say it, Georgia. Flat out. I love you, Tell McKay.</p><p>The announcer\u2019s booming voice came over the loudspeaker, shattering their moment.</p><p>And when she retreated, Tell let her.</p><p>The sun beat down. Dust clogged his nostrils. Last he\u2019d heard, the temperature had hit the one hundred degree mark. Usually the dirt in the rodeo arena registered ten degrees hotter, so it was a damn oven. Everyone suffered when it was this hot. The animals, the competitors, the crowd. His shirt was soaked clear through. Even his jeans were moist from sweat streaming from every pore on his body in an attempt to cool off. He mopped his face with a towel every chance he got, but it didn\u2019t help much.</p><p>Tell\u2019s day had started out with a pissing contest with the stock contractor, because he\u2019d disqualified one horse and two bulls due to heat exhaustion. The contractor demanded the second judge reassess the livestock, but Tell hadn\u2019t seen hide nor hair of the other judge yet.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t seen Georgia either. The last couple days had been pretty hectic, but he felt as if she was hiding something from him. Probably just paranoia on his part, given both their tendencies to avoid conflict. They were still taking baby steps with their relationship. But if he had his way, they\u2019d take that giant leap and move in together.</p><p>He paced behind the chutes, anxious for things to get started. Then he saw Deck. Since the man was headed straight for him, Tell couldn\u2019t pretend he hadn\u2019t seen him.</p><p>You really going to run and hide from this pompous prick like you did in high school?</p> <p>No. Hell no.</p><p>He stood his ground, arms folded on his chest. \u201cVeldekamp.\u201d</p><p>\u201dMcKay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurprised to see you back here behind the chutes at this rodeo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Tell shrugged. \u201cThought it\u2019d be a bad memory for you, considering how publicly you crashed and burned on your home turf that summer after graduation. Gotta be a kick in the balls that your rodeo career never reached the epic proportion you bragged it would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you...\u201d He muttered, \u201cFrom Georgia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was all around town. Funny, ain\u2019t it, how happy some folks are to see others fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t fail, I got injured. Big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least I tried. Unlike some people, I don\u2019t got nothin\u2019 to prove. I was a state champion. You know what they say. Them that can, do; them that can\u2019t are bitter pricks about others\u2019 success.\u201d</p><p>Such bullshit. But it was hitting the mark.</p><p>\u201cBesides, I\u2019m not here as a spectator,\u201d Deck said. He looked at Tell\u2019s vest. Then in his eyes. His lips twisted in a parody of a smile. \u201cGuess Georgia forgot to mention that I\u2019m the second judge today.\u201d</p><p>Tell felt every muscle in his body seize up.</p><p>Was Deck fucking serious? He had to work with this asshole? Tell fumed silently, knowing Georgia had made herself scarce today because she hadn\u2019t wanted to give him the news.</p><p>What else was she hiding from him?</p><p>Doesn\u2019t matter. Suck it up and do your job.</p><p>At least Tell was the senior judge. He gave Deck a once-over. \u201cYou\u2019re late. Get your vest on, and then do a quick stock check. Report back here immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting off on bossing me around, ain\u2019t ya?\u201d Deck said.</p><p>He offered him a shit-eating grin. \u201cLike you wouldn\u2019t fuckin\u2019 believe. And it\u2019s a damn cryin\u2019 shame they took away my bullwhip.\u201d</p><p>Tell focused on his job and making sure Deck did his part. It surprised him how close their scores were on the rough stock events. It didn\u2019t surprise him that neither of them could contain their mutual hostility when they had to confer.</p><p>After the bull riding ended, the prizes were awarded. The crowd was huge this year. How much of that was due to Georgia\u2019s PR efforts? He hung around watching the contestants and the stock contractor loading up. Probably half his family was in the stands, but he didn\u2019t want to deal with them or mingle with his friends. He wasn\u2019t the brooding type very often and he tended to lie low when that personality tic appeared. He didn\u2019t want to do much of anything except talk to Georgia and get to the bottom of why she was acting so distant.</p><p>He headed toward committee headquarters.</p><p>Deck waylaid him outside the loading chutes. \u201cWhere\u2019s Georgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you need from her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your concern.\u201d Deck crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cMake you feel like a big man? Getting named most changed at the reunion and acting all hot shit here at the rodeo?\u201d</p><p>Tell didn\u2019t want to do this, but Deck had been pushing his buttons for years and he knew this was about to get ugly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say you becoming a judge was all about reliving your glory days, but you never had any, did you? All the glory went to your cousin Chase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it make you feel like big man again, talkin\u2019 shit to me like you did a decade ago?\u201d Tell leaned in. \u201cGrow the fuck up, Deck. You\u2019re only embarrassing yourself.\u201d</p><p>Deck\u2019s mouth flattened. \u201cNo more than you are, trailing after Georgia like a lovesick pussy.\u201d</p><p>Feet scuffled in the dirt around them as people gave them a wide berth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d</p><p>Neither Tell nor Deck took his eyes off his opponent to acknowledge Georgia.</p><p>About damn time she showed up. When Tell saw her move into his line of vision, he said, \u201cGeorgia. Why don\u2019t you head on out to the rodeo grounds. This doesn\u2019t concern you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr so McKay wants you to think. But it\u2019s always been about you,\u201d Deck said with a sneer.</p><p>Tell\u2019s head said don\u2019t take the bait, but his mouth had already engaged. \u201cIs your dick attitude because I have her now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have her? For how long?\u201d</p><p>Saying forever seemed cheesy, but he wanted Deck to know what\u2019d grown between him and Georgia this summer was the real deal. So he said, \u201cFor keeps.\u201d</p><p>Deck broke eye contact and looked at Georgia. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know, does he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, talk to me, asshole, not her. Know what?\u201d</p><p>Deck released a sharp bark of laughter. \u201cThe joke is on you, McKay. Georgia is leaving at the end of the summer, as soon as rodeo season slows down. She never intended to stay in Wyoming permanently.\u201d</p><p>No. That couldn\u2019t be true. She wouldn\u2019t do that\u2014flat-out lie to him. Tell spun around and faced her, his eyes searching hers as he bridged the short distance between them. So when Tell saw that look on Georgia\u2019s face he hadn\u2019t been able to place before, he finally recognized it: guilt. He wished the hot dirt would just swallow him up right now.</p><p>You\u2019ve been played for the fool again. When will you ever learn?</p><p>Automatically he started backing up, away from her, tempted to turn tail and run.</p><p>But she kept up with him, step for step. \u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was scared to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you could tell your ex-husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t tell him. My dad must have. No one was supposed to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes it so much better.\u201d He lowered his voice so only she heard him. \u201cDo you remember when you asked me if I was playin\u2019 a game? Is that what you\u2019ve been doin\u2019 this whole time? Stringing me along so you could watch me unravel when you cut ties here for good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. God no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you feel anything for me, Georgia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He could work with that. \u201cThen can you really turn your back on this? On us? Return to Dallas and pretend this never happened?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the side, to Deck, and she sighed. \u201cI only came to Sundance because I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>A swift kick in the balls couldn\u2019t have hurt worse.</p><p>If he stood there another second, he\u2019d probably break down. Beg her not to go.</p><p>In front of Deck Veldekamp.</p><p>That would only be slightly less humiliating than the fact he\u2019d fallen in love, for real, with a woman he still couldn\u2019t have. His heartbeat slowed, becoming a dull thud in his ears as he turned from her and started to walk away. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No surprise Deck wouldn\u2019t let it go.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just like the song, ain\u2019t she?\u201d Deck called out. \u201cGeorgie Porgie kissed the boys and made them cry. Wasn\u2019t there a line in there about bein\u2019 a coward and running away? That fits you, McKay, don\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Against his better judgment, Tell wheeled back around. \u201cYou are a fucking moron. But if you really want me to beat your face in, keep it up. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for years. We\u2019ll see if you\u2019re tough when your buddies aren\u2019t holding me down so you can beat on me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t man enough to take it. Never have been. Never will be.\u201d Deck took a blatant step forward. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>Deck didn\u2019t expect the first punch so fast. The second punch knocked him off-balance. The third punch sent him sprawling in the dirt.</p><p>Tell pounced on him, his fists connecting with flesh and bone. He let fly with years\u2019 worth of pent-up rage.</p><p>Deck didn\u2019t defend himself at all.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tell didn\u2019t get many licks in before he was rudely ripped away from pummeling Deck\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the world is goin\u2019 on here?\u201d the man demanded.</p><p>Tell fought the adrenaline rush and jerked out of the man\u2019s hold. All he cared about was Georgia. Who was crouched in the dirt next to Deck. Her hand on his arm. Her angry glare aimed right at him. At him. Not at Deck.</p><p>All the breath whooshed out of Tell\u2019s body, along with that tiniest bit of hope.</p><p>\u201cWhat has gotten into you?\u201d she hissed. \u201cWhy did you attack him?\u201d</p><p>Just out of Georgia\u2019s line of sight, Deck\u2019s lips lifted into a greasy grin that showed blood on his teeth.</p><p>The fucker had won. Georgia had chosen Deck again.</p> <p>Tell stepped back.</p><p>When Deck opened his big, fat mouth, Tell turned and walked away.</p><p>Georgia had an overpowering sense of loss as Tell disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>She shook her head to try and clear the confusion. She\u2019d been right there and she had no idea what\u2019d just happened. Tell and Deck had been arguing about some past slight and then they were on the ground, Tell throwing punches that Deck hadn\u2019t attempted to defend.</p><p>Something was wrong with that picture.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna go running after McKay now? Dry his tears? \u2019Cause guaranteed the loser is crying. He always does.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him \u201cWhy would he cry? You didn\u2019t even land a punch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this time.\u201d He wiped blood from his smirking mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s the first occasion me\u2019n him have locked horns? Nope. But I always beat his ass down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways? When was the last time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnd of senior year.\u201d</p><p>All the blood drained from her face. She remembered Tell had come to school a complete wreck. He\u2019d claimed the damage was from getting thrown off a bucking horse. \u201cThose bruises on his face were your doing? You went after him? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he gave you a ride home and he knew better than to touch what didn\u2019t belong to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stranded me at school. He drove me home. That was it.\u201d</p><p>Deck shrugged. \u201cNot according to him. He tracked me down, said you were miserable and cryin\u2019 because of me and that you deserved someone better, so I oughta leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>She backed away. \u201cI had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t. Even McKay ain\u2019t stupid enough to brag about getting the shit kicked outta him.\u201d</p><p>Georgia wasn\u2019t talking about the fight. She was shocked that Tell had stood up for her years ago. A girl he barely knew.</p><p>\u201cSeeing that look on McKay\u2019s face when I told him you weren\u2019t sticking around? Priceless.\u201d</p><p>God. She felt sick to her stomach and as confused as ever. \u201cWhy do you hate him so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t hate him. I just like putting him in his place.\u201d</p><p>So it hadn\u2019t been about her. Just another example of Deck getting his kicks out of being a bully. And Deck knew she\u2019d take the side of the guy on the receiving end of punches, not the side of the guy throwing them. She\u2019d played into his hands perfectly.</p><p>\u201cThe committee can hold on to my check for another week or so, right?\u201d</p><p>Georgia refocused on her asshole ex-husband. \u201cI guess. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe\u2019n Tara-Lee are movin\u2019 to New Mexico.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When did this come about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Robert gave me money from the sale of the hog farm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs my dad going with you?\u201d</p><p>Deck snorted. \u201cNo. Why would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s been like a father to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Robert ain\u2019t my dad. And it\u2019s always been a little creepy how he acted like he was.\u201d</p><p>But only up to the point where it benefited Deck, when Robert forked over a pile of cash to a guy he\u2019d considered his son. \u201cAfter all my dad did for you? You\u2019re just gonna take the money and run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI earned every penny of that money for the years I slaved at that hog farm,\u201d he retorted hotly. \u201cRobert and I are friends, Georgia, but mostly we\u2019re business partners. Now the business is sold, we\u2019re parting ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness partners?\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been much more than that.\u201d Hadn\u2019t they?</p><p>Deck shook his head. \u201cI like Robert. He\u2019s a great guy. I know you need someone to blame for how things ended up with your father after RJ died, but your dad didn\u2019t choose me. Your mom left. You left in mind and spirit months before your body did. Robert didn\u2019t have anyone else but me. I never tried to take RJ\u2019s place, Georgia. I never tried to take yours, either. Robert\u2019s been a broken man for a long time. Maybe it\u2019s time you step up to the plate and help put him back together.\u201d</p><p>Deck\u2019s accusations settled in and he walked away for good.</p><p>Georgia had a weird punch of anxiety when she pulled up to the house she hadn\u2019t seen in years. The house she\u2019d fled from and never looked back.</p><p>It\u2019s concrete and wood. Neither the structure nor the memories contained within have power over you.</p><p>As she started up the sidewalk, she caught movement out of the corner of her eye. She saw her father sitting on a pile of tires, staring at the house. Even from a hundred feet away, an aura of defeat surrounded him.</p><p>\u201cDad?\u201d</p><p>He turned his head toward her as she erased the distance between them. \u201cGeorgie?\u201d</p><p>Her retort, \u201cDoes anyone else call you Dad?\u201d came out a little harsh.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Deck at the Devil\u2019s Tower Rodeo. I\u2019m a little shocked he\u2019s just up and moving to New Mexico.\u201d</p><p>He grunted.</p><p>\u201cWere you surprised he\u2019s leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Deck\u2019s been restless and lookin\u2019 for an exit since he knocked up Tara-Lee. After nearly nine years, we were both ready to move on.\u201d He spit a stream of tobacco juice on the ground and squinted at her. \u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI came to see if you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve still got that sweet streak you inherited from your mother.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not okay. Haven\u2019t been for quite a while. I\u2019m tired. Some days it\u2019s just too much. And now... It ain\u2019t like I\u2019ve got anywhere to go.\u201d</p><p>Georgia didn\u2019t know what to say. Her father was the most closemouthed person she\u2019d ever met. So he must really be in distress if he was opening up to her.</p><p>\u201cThings between you and Mom...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIrina ain\u2019t invited me to live with her in Boulder if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. I\u2019d go in a heartbeat if I thought there was a chance she\u2019d take me back. But I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t wanna hear about that.\u201d He squinted at her. \u201cToday was the last rodeo for that PR company you work for?\u201d</p><p>Who had he heard that from? She hadn\u2019t told him and it wasn\u2019t common knowledge. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when are you going back to Dallas?\u201d</p><p>The idea of getting in her car, leaving Tell and Wyoming, made her stomach hurt, her eyes burn and her heart heavy. Her life had changed these past months. Changed for the better. Although if she talked to Tell, she doubted he\u2019d see any change in her at all, since she\u2019d kept the truth from him again.</p><p>\u201cMaybe the question oughta be are you going back to Dallas?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. My time here has turned out differently than I imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Tell McKay played a part in that?\u201d</p><p>No reason to lie now. \u201cA big part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good man. I saw him...makin\u2019 sure you were okay on the anniversary of RJ\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him in shock. \u201cTell never said anything about you being at the cemetery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t there for you any more than you were there for me. It\u2019s a day I\u2019d like to forget, but I can\u2019t seem to, no matter how hard I try.\u201d He pointed to her tattoo. \u201cYour brother would like you done that in his memory.\u201d</p><p>Georgia saw his expectation\u2014he wanted her to say something poignant, but the words wouldn\u2019t come.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m sure whatever you decide about stayin\u2019 here or returning to Dallas, Barbara will understand. She\u2019s a tough old broad, but she\u2019s able to look at things from different angles. It\u2019s why she\u2019s been so successful.\u201d</p><p>The hair on the back of Georgia\u2019s neck stood up. \u201cWhoa. Are you telling me you know Barbara Wyrelinski?\u201d</p><p>Her father nodded.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you known her?\u201d</p><p>A pause. A heavy sigh. \u201cForty-some years. She\u2019s the sister of my army buddy who got killed in Vietnam. She sorta adopted me as her big brother. We both had interest in the western lifestyle and we stayed in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been around the world and I\u2019ve got lots of friends you aren\u2019t aware of,\u201d he said tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI get that. But this is my boss we\u2019re talking about, Dad. In the four years I\u2019ve worked for her, she never once mentioned knowing you. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wouldn\u2019t let her tell you.\u201d</p><p>Georgia frowned. She thought back to her conversations with Stephanie. About the odds of getting assigned a job in Sundance, Wyoming. So what were the odds that Barbara, a business owner from Dallas who just happened to be a friend of her father\u2019s, just happened to be one of the employer interviewers in Laramie, Wyoming, four years ago?</p> <p>Astronomically slim.</p><p>Then she knew. Her father had set up the entire thing. He\u2019d always run her life with a heavy hand and it seemed no matter how far away she moved, she\u2019d never be out of his reach.</p><p>She stood and paced angrily, kicking up dust that reeked like pig manure. \u201cI always believed I\u2019d nailed that interview with Barbara on my own merits. But now I find out you...\u201d Her entire body burned with humiliation.</p><p>\u201cYou did get hired on your own merits, Georgie. Yes, I asked Barbara to do the official interview at UW, but she does that all the time. And she wouldn\u2019t have hired you as a favor to me\u2014she\u2019s too shrewd a businesswoman for that. Barbara liked what she saw in you\u2014that\u2019s why she offered the job. And I\u2019ve not meddled in your life since.\u201d</p><p>Her head spun. \u201cDid Mom know about this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one but me\u2019n Barbara knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you think it was wrong if you had to keep it a secret? From everyone? Especially me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have done, Georgie, if I\u2019d told you that I\u2019d asked an old friend to interview you? You would\u2019ve refused the meeting out of anger and resentment, just because that option came from me.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth. Closed it. That wasn\u2019t true. Was it?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll agree some of your anger toward me is justified. But you are my daughter. I care what happens to you. As your father, you can\u2019t fault me for tryin\u2019 to help you secure a job so you could provide for yourself. I\u2019ll repeat, the only part I had in this process was getting you the first interview. The rest you did on your own. And you should be proud of that. God knows I am.\u201d</p><p>Georgia was too mad to acknowledge his pride in her. \u201cAnd what part did you have in convincing Barbara to assign me to a job in Sundance?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>He looked away.</p><p>\u201cNot meddling in my life anymore? Bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what it looks like. But Larry and Kim Pradst, who own L bar K, are friends of mine. They\u2019ve stuck by me when no one else did. When they hit tough times because of Larry\u2019s cancer, I gave them Barbara\u2019s name for a possible buyout since rodeo promotion is part of her business. Barbara handled it from there, but the Pradsts knew you worked for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause I told \u2019em.\u201d His voice dropped. \u201cThey got a promise from Barbara that you\u2019d take over their events in Wyoming, if only for this season.\u201d</p><p>Throughout her realizations and recriminations, one question kept repeating in her head: had her life ever been her own? Had she ever been allowed to make her own decisions?</p><p>Her father\u2019s gruff voice roused her. \u201cGeorgia Lou. Please. Stop cryin\u2019. You\u2019re gonna make yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to find her cheeks were wet. And although the sun beat down, she was cold. So cold. She shivered.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotta go. I\u2019ve gotta...\u201d What? Where did she go when her life was in shambles?</p><p>Then her dad did the strangest thing. He hauled her into his arms, hugged her tightly, patted her back awkwardly and released her abruptly. \u201cI know you\u2019re upset. But that was the last thing hanging between us. Now that everything is out in the open, we can start fresh. I don\u2019t wanna lose you, now that there\u2019s a chance we can fix this.\u201d</p><p>Georgia nodded numbly, trying to ignore the pleading tone. The only thing she wanted to fix right now\u2014was a drink.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>At the Golden Boot, Georgia poured her heart out to Stephanie.</p><p>Stephanie made sympathetic noises, patted her hand, handed her tissues, ordered her another drink. \u201cG, you know I love you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And can I just say the day we became college roommates was one of the luckiest days of my life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a suck-up,\u201d Stephanie said dryly. \u201cBut that sweet sentiment doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll sugarcoat my observations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Georgia wiped her eyes. \u201cWhich is why I had to tell someone who\u2019d have an unbiased opinion.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie thoughtfully stirred her drink. \u201cI\u2019m usually the first to point out there\u2019s no wrong way to grieve, but the way your father handled RJ\u2019s death? Was the wrong way. Many families implode after that type of event. Yours is no exception. It\u2019s always seemed to you that your dad chose Deck over you. I can\u2019t speak to the logic of that, except to point out that if your father had kicked Deck to the curb, would you have pitched in and helped him with the hog farm?\u201d</p><p>Georgia wrinkled her nose. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad, who was grieving, threw himself into a new enterprise to take his mind off his loss and pain. He needed help, but he didn\u2019t get it from his wife or his daughter. Who was the one person that did support him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Deck. His son-in-law, the man you married, the guy he considered part of his family. That\u2019s natural, Georgia. Maybe it wasn\u2019t natural for you to leave and Deck to stay, but that\u2019s how it played out. And wishing it was different won\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever crossed my mind to ask Deck to come with me, because it was him I wanted to get away from.\u201d She winced. \u201cI wasn\u2019t exactly a good wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were too young to be saddled with the responsibility of marriage. Add in the other stuff... I\u2019m surprised you lasted two years. You bailed only a few months after your mother. Didn\u2019t change the fact your dad still needed help. Deck stood by him. I highly doubt your father agreed with Deck\u2019s treatment of you.\u201d</p><p>Hadn\u2019t her father tried to explain, in his gruff way, that a woman leaving a man makes the man do stupid things? Strange to think her dad hadn\u2019t been talking about Deck and her. He\u2019d meant that he hadn\u2019t been thinking straight when his wife had left him.</p><p>How could Stephanie be turning this issue on its head and making Georgia sympathetic toward her father?</p><p>Maybe you\u2019re finally growing up and putting those perceived slights in the proper context. Seeing it from your dad\u2019s point of view. Seeing that the tragedy of RJ\u2019s death made everyone act irrationally. Including you.</p><p>\u201cHis only option was to somehow make it up to you. When it came time for you to spread your wings, he wanted you to have a safe landing, so he brought in Barbara.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut isn\u2019t that controlling and manipulative?\u201d Georgia asked.</p><p>Stephanie sighed. \u201cOnly if he told you he\u2019d brought Barbara in especially for you and expected you\u2019d take the job offer no matter what it was, because refusing it would ruin their friendship, and he\u2019d gone to all the trouble for you, so you\u2019d better fall in line.</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t tell you he\u2019d set it up, probably because you\u2019d refuse a great opportunity on principle. Yes, you scored the interview because of him, but you scored the job on your own. And sweetie, you\u2019re really na\u00efve if you think that type of nepotism doesn\u2019t happen all the time, in every corner of business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about this summer rodeo gig? He basically set that up too.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie rolled her eyes. \u201cYes, you\u2019re having such a lousy time in Wyoming. Not stuck in a stuffy office. Reconnecting with old friends. Proving yourself in sales and event management. Having fun. Acting your age for a change.\u201d She leaned closer. \u201cNeed I point out that you\u2019ve fallen in love with Tell McKay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s scary, these feeling I have for him. But whatever he might\u2019ve felt for me? I destroyed by lying to him. I saw it on his face, Stephanie. Distrust, disbelief and disgust.\u201d Georgia briefly closed her eyes, trying to blink away that image. \u201cHim washing his hands of me is probably for the best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best for who? You\u2019re the happiest you\u2019ve ever been\u2014or you were up until today. You can just snap your fingers and forget all that, like it never was?\u201d</p><p>Georgia shrank back in the booth. \u201cGod no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you expect Tell can forget it? And he will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a fair comparison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is fair, because it\u2019s true. Tell loves you. I could see it that night at the reunion regardless if he was ready to admit it yet. You\u2019re so worried about everyone making decisions for you that you don\u2019t realize by walking away you\u2019re doing the same thing to him.\u201d</p><p>That stunned her. \u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake control of your life. Nothing is predestined, Georgia. People make major changes in their lives every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut my job is in Dallas. My life is there.\u201d</p><p>Stephanie smacked her hand on the table. \u201cCan you please admit that you only really started living your life when you returned to Wyoming?\u201d</p><p>That stung, but didn\u2019t make it any less true. She\u2019d been going through the motions in Dallas. Work. Sleep. Weekends that she largely spent by herself. Living in limbo. Waiting for...what?</p><p>A man like Tell to come into her life?</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t need a man to make her complete.</p><p>If that was true, why had she felt so hollow? So incomplete? Didn\u2019t she have what every college grad wanted\u2014a job, a decent place to live and a little money in the bank?</p><p>Yes. Wasn\u2019t that enough?</p><p>No. It never had been. Just like being Deck\u2019s wife hadn\u2019t been enough.</p><p>Being with Tell gave her something she\u2019d never had from any person or place or job\u2014a feeling of home. An intimate bond that grew stronger every day. The kind of connection she had been too afraid to forge, fearful she\u2019d lose it once she found it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s when Georgia knew she\u2019d do whatever it took to keep the happiness she\u2019d found here. Taking such a scary leap made her stomach roil, but if she didn\u2019t have faith in her ability to choose her own path, she still was letting everyone else pull the strings. And she was done with that. Starting now. At least if she fell flat on her face this time, she\u2019d know exactly who tripped her up.</p><p>She glanced up and saw Stephanie grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d make the right choice. I\u2019m here for you, whatever you need. Now go get your man and start your happily ever after.\u201d Stephanie hugged her and left.</p> <p>As Georgia headed toward the door, she caught a glimpse of a black-haired man on the outskirts of the dance floor. Her heart skipped a beat. Had Tell shown up looking for her after all?</p><p>But after watching the guy, she realized he was a McKay, just not her McKay.</p><p>It was Dalton. A drunk Dalton. He\u2019d sway one way, catch himself, and snap his body straight. He was trying to pay attention to a slender brunette giving him the mother of all lectures.</p><p>He reached out to stroke the woman\u2019s hair and she dodged his hand. When that motion sent him falling forward, she grabbed the front of his shirt and jerked him upright.</p><p>That\u2019s when everything went to hell. Dalton trapped the brunette\u2019s face in his hands and kissed her. Not a gentle peck, but a tonsil-scratching kiss.</p> <p>She broke his hold and pushed him. Dalton\u2019s arms flailed and he landed hard on his ass. She stepped over him before stomping away. A couple bar patrons helped Dalton to his feet, but he angrily waved them off and staggered down the hallway to the back door.</p><p>Concerned, Georgia followed him outside.</p><p>Dalton wasn\u2019t leaning against the building or lying in a heap on the ground. And in the state he was in, he couldn\u2019t have gotten far. She saw him standing beside a white pickup.</p><p>Surely he didn\u2019t intend to drive home?</p><p>Despite three-inch heels, she ran. He had the driver\u2019s-side door open by the time she reached him, but he\u2019d dropped the keys on the ground.</p><p>She swooped down and plucked them up. \u201cLooking for these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. They musta fallen outta my hand.\u201d He swayed and kept one eye shut as he looked at her. \u201cGeorgia! Hey. It\u2019s the hot chick banging my brother, that lucky bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo nice of you to point it out,\u201d she retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou still got my keys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. But I\u2019m keeping them because you are not driving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that. I\u2019m fine ta drive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p><p>He loomed over her. \u201cGimme my goddamn keys.\u201d</p><p>She lost her mind on him. She shoved him against the cab and stood on her toes to get in his face. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to do this. It would destroy your brothers if something happened to you. You\u2019re a fucking idiot to even think about getting behind the goddamn wheel when you\u2019re drunk.\u201d She stepped back, her breath coming in hot, angry bursts. One fist clenched around the keys, one fist ready to knock him the fuck out if he made a move for them.</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d Dalton\u2019s belligerent stance vanished. He dropped his chin to his chest, probably to hide his embarrassment. \u201cSorry. I don\u2019t know what I was thinkin\u2019. I\u2019d never...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right you\u2019d never. Get it through that thickheaded McKay skull of yours: you are not driving. I\u2019ll call Tell to come and get you.\u201d</p><p>Dalton\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cNo. Keep my family out of it. I don\u2019t want them to see me like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Drunk?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cLike a fuckin\u2019 chump.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Georgia stared at him. \u201cDalton. Honey. You\u2019re kind of a mess. Will you let me drive you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause of Tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Because of RJ.\u201d</p><p>Another moment of silence passed between them, broken by the shouts of partyers exiting the bar.</p><p>He said, \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll take you up on that ride.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him. \u201cI walked here from my place, so I don\u2019t have my car. You\u2019re a big guy and there\u2019s no way I can help you into the cab of this monster truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay. I can get in on my own.\u201d He hoisted himself up. Then he slid across the bench seat to the passenger side.</p><p>Georgia had driven her fair share of pickups, but this one was jacked up, tricked out, and she could barely reach the pedals. With her luck, Dalton would pass out before he told her where he lived. Driving aimlessly around rural Wyoming at eleven o\u2019clock at night with a brokenhearted drunk wasn\u2019t her idea of fun.</p><p>So call Tell.</p><p>No. Dalton had asked her not to. Which left her with one choice.</p><p>She parked his rig at the curb in front of her house because she feared she\u2019d take out the neighbor\u2019s bushes if she attempted to park in the driveway.</p><p>Dalton staggered out of his pickup and into her house on his own. She directed him to the living room couch.</p><p>He yanked off his boots out of habit and flopped on the sofa with a weary sigh. He draped his arm over his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be payin\u2019 for my damn pity party the rest of the night and most of tomorrow. Christ. My head is spinning like a fuckin\u2019 tornado.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want coffee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. Thanks. I\u2019m just gonna sleep it off.\u201d</p><p>She brought him a pillow and a blanket. \u201cThe bathroom is down the hall, across from the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna puke, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re worried about. I can hold my liquor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t pee on my sofa either. So you know where the toilet is in case you need to use it.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re funny. And sweet. Not at all what I thought you\u2019d be.\u201d</p><p>Georgia perched on the edge of the coffee table. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to ask what Tell has told you about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019, really. That says a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf my brother ain\u2019t talkin\u2019 about you, it means there\u2019s something there to talk about.\u201d</p><p>That made no sense.</p><p>\u201cYou ain\u2019t playin\u2019 him, are you?\u201d Dalton said softly. \u201cHe deserves better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell deserves the best because he\u2019s the best man I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you told him that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. But I intend to.\u201d</p><p>Dalton groaned. \u201cGood. But fuck. I\u2019m really gonna be the last single McKay standing, ain\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Yes, if Georgia had anything to say about it.</p><p>\u201cNight, Dalton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNight, John-Boy.\u201d</p><p>She froze. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothin\u2019. Drunk talk. Me\u2019n Tell and Brandt and Luke always pretended it was stupid the way the Waltons said goodnight to everyone at the end of the show. But we really thought it was kinda cool \u2019cause we never did that in our family. So we started doin\u2019 it as a joke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s weird? RJ and I did the same thing. \u2019Cept he always wanted to be John-Boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo did Tell. Bastard made me be Mary Ellen.\u201d</p><p>Georgia laughed. \u201cNight, Mary Ellen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Tell are two peas in a pod.\u201d</p><p>By the time she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she saw Dalton\u2019s breathing had slowed and he\u2019d passed out.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Sunday morning, Tell feigned sickness and skipped helping with chores.</p><p>He\u2019d spent Saturday night after the rodeo dozing off between shitty reality shows on the Discovery Channel. Point for him that he hadn\u2019t drunk until he passed out. His mind had just shut down on its own and his body followed. He wondered if this was how his days and nights would be if Georgia was out of his life for good.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t live like this. He couldn\u2019t go back to the way he\u2019d been. Well, he could, but his heart wouldn\u2019t be in it, not since Georgia took ownership of that motherfucker before she\u2019d stomped the piss out of it.</p><p>This brokenhearted shit sucked.</p><p>Being without Georgia sucked.</p><p>The rest of the day and all of the night sucked too.</p><p>Monday morning, Tell and Dalton started and finished chores without talking, which wasn\u2019t unusual. Sometimes they\u2019d go as long as a week without discussing anything besides ranch work. Working with the same people every day, and knowing that would continue for the rest of his life, made it easy to shove things aside, figuring they\u2019d have lots of time to talk.</p><p>But that didn\u2019t hold true with Luke, did it?</p><p>\u201cSo you didn\u2019t get to help out with the bonfire yesterday,\u201d Dalton said.</p><p>Tell\u2019s gaze snapped to him. \u201cWhat are you talkin\u2019 about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cColt, Kane, Ben and Brandt torched the bunkhouse yesterday morning. \u201c</p><p>That floored him. \u201cWhat? When was that decided?\u201d</p><p>Dalton shrugged. \u201cSpur of the moment. Colt showed up to do his check of the place and found a dozen kids passed out in there. Was the same kids everyone\u2019s been seein\u2019. Guess they got mouthy. Colby found trees they\u2019d cut down and a fire pit out in the middle of the damn field. Appears everyone\u2019s had enough. Kane and everyone else are kicking themselves because we shoulda listened to you sooner. They were gonna let you do the honors, but Brandt said you were sick and he\u2019d take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, I\u2018m glad to hear they don\u2019t think I\u2019m always jokin\u2019 around and they take my suggestions seriously sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of \u2019em think you\u2019re a clown. It was just an extreme solution to the problem. So points for you, bro, in the McKay hierarchy.\u201d</p><p>Tell rolled his eyes. \u201cWere you there yesterday morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a little while. Then I had something else goin\u2019 on.\u201d</p><p>The way Dalton fidgeted, Tell knew something was up. \u201cSpill it, D.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot what?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat parcel of Charlene\u2019s land.\u201d Dalton reached into his back pocket and pulled out a slip of paper. \u201cGot her notarized intent to sell. We didn\u2019t get it as cheap as I would\u2019ve liked. Five hundred acres with highway access. Plus she\u2019s giving us the option of buying some of the corrals and equipment.\u201d</p><p>Tell just stared at his younger brother, a mix of pride and fear filling him. \u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>A sheepish grin stole over his face. \u201cI\u2019ve been takin\u2019 advantage of your workhorse ways as much Brandt has. But it\u2019s paid off for all us. We\u2019ll own that land free and clear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFree and clear? Where\u2019d you get the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom poker tournaments. When you stopped goin\u2019 with me, I upped my bets and stopped playin\u2019 it safe. In the last year and a half I...ah\u2014\u201d he laughed self-consciously, \u201c\u2014been flyin\u2019 to Vegas in addition to hitting all the big tournaments around here. And I\u2019ve done well.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t take money out of our joint account.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes I did. I took out half over a long weekend. Used it as seed money and doubled it in three days. So I returned the money and have been usin\u2019 the profit from that to gamble with.\u201d Dalton held up his hand. \u201cNo, I ain\u2019t addicted to gambling. It was a tool to get us what we needed. And a way to prove myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDalton. You\u2019ve gotta know...\u201d How did he say this without getting his brother\u2019s back up? \u201cI never expected that from you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich was why I needed to do it. Look, Brandt is the oldest, you\u2019re the smartest and I\u2019ve always been the youngest. That\u2019s how everyone sees me.\u201d He kicked a clod of dirt. \u201cI needed to prove to myself and to you guys that I could contribute something to the running of the ranch besides manual labor. Money is something we always need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmen to that.\u201d Tell elbowed his brother. \u201cYa little lyin\u2019 sack of shit. How much money you got squirreled away?\u201d</p><p>Dalton grinned. \u201cPlenty. Even after buyin\u2019 the land. We\u2019ll bring Brandt in on the plans for the feedlot, but I think we\u2019d better keep it from everyone else until it\u2019s a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear ya. But I gotta ask if Rory Wetzler has anything to do with your reason to keep it on the down low?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPartially. I just don\u2019t want our cousins to get a jump on our new enterprise. But I did hear an interesting bit of gossip from Ben yesterday morning. I guess Rielle is scrambling to find another place to live because Gavin got sole custody of Sierra and he\u2019s movin\u2019 to Sundance. In the next couple weeks before school starts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. Really? That\u2019s a shocker. It\u2019s gotta make Ben and Quinn happy though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see. Gavin ain\u2019t exactly a McKay\u2014in more ways than one. I guess Sierra has been runnin\u2019 with a bad crowd and Gavin has had it.\u201d</p><p>This was the opening Tell had been looking for. \u201cSpeaking of running with a bad crowd... I heard an interesting rumor about you awhile back.\u201d</p><p>Dalton looked him in the eye as he swigged from the water jug. \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were havin\u2019 some sort of gang bang in a motel in Hulett, where you were the bang-ee. Rumor says you had thirteen women with you, and you fucked every single one while the other women watched.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cChrist. No wonder the McKays have such a bad reputation for bein\u2019 man-whores with a taste for multiple partners. Not that them rumors weren\u2019t partially based on fact. But the facts get distorted. Big-time. Yes, I was with some women in a motel room. But it sure as fuck wasn\u2019t thirteen. It was only three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly?\u201d Tell repeated.</p><p>\u201cThis is gonna sound really weird, but two of the chicks were lesbians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the third?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe woman I\u2019d been seein\u2019. Willa.\u201d</p><p>Tell frowned. \u201cThis is the first time you\u2019ve mentioned her.\u201d</p><p>Dalton focused on digging a rock out of the dirt with the toe of his boot. \u201cThat\u2019s because I ain\u2019t exactly proud of her. I met her and her friends in a strip club. That right there shoulda been my tip-off they liked T and A a little too much. Willa had just gotten out of a relationship and was lookin\u2019 to have some fun. Right up my alley. She pitched this foursome idea to me. The horny bastard that I am, I agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt was fuckin\u2019 bizarre, bro. After I was with each one of them, then they were with each other. Doin\u2019 stuff I ain\u2019t ever seen even in porn. And then it was like I wasn\u2019t even in the room. Willa dumped me Saturday night. I shoulda let it go but I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s when she told me she was goin\u2019 back to her ex. Her ex-girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tell breathed.</p><p>\u201cYep. Evidently I\u2019m so fuckin\u2019 bad in bed that I can turn a woman back into bein\u2019 gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. You don\u2019t really believe that.\u201d</p><p>He kicked a clump of clover. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. And as long as I\u2019m confessing shit, you oughta know... I had a pretty good lyin\u2019 streak goin\u2019 there over the years about how many chicks I banged. Pretending to be a McKay stud who knew everything about sex backfired on me big-time. I ain\u2019t gonna go into details about what happened, \u2019cause it\u2019s the most embarrassing thing I\u2019ve ever done and I have been forgiven by the person involved. In the meantime, I\u2019ve been tryin\u2019 to get all the sexual experience I\u2019d been pretending to have. Which is how I ended up doin\u2019 it with three lesbians. I should just stick to poker. I\u2019m one helluva lot luckier in cards than I am in love.\u201d</p><p>Seeing his little brother so dejected and his face so red from embarrassment, Tell attempted to lighten the mood. \u201cSo Dalton and three lesbians walk into a strip club...\u201d</p><p>Dalton said, \u201cFuck you,\u201d but he smiled. \u201cThat brings me to the next point. I was at the Golden Boot Saturday night. Georgia saw me make a drunken idiot of myself and she took my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were gonna drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess. She took me to her place to sleep it off.\u201d Dalton looked him in the eye. \u201cI take back the shitty things I said about her. She didn\u2019t have to help me; she coulda let me sleep it off in my truck. But takin\u2019 in a stupid cowboy like me showed her generous nature. That\u2019s not the type of thing a user does. She\u2019s sweet and fierce and smart and loyal. She is something special.\u201d</p><p>Don\u2019t I know it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a lucky guy, bro. She\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say anything about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that you\u2019re the greatest guy she\u2019s ever known. She seemed sorta sad. Did I miss something? Why weren\u2019t you guys together Saturday night after the rodeo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We had a big blow-up when I found out she never intended to stay here permanently.\u201d</p><p>Dalton raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re just gonna let her go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve got a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. Don\u2019t be a dumb-ass, Tell. Convince her to stay. Wow her with some of that McKay mojo I\u2019m lacking.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cRight. Like that\u2019ll work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you oughta tell her the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist. You\u2019re really gonna make me say it? Tell her that you love her and can\u2019t live without her.\u201d</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be that simple. Could it?</p><p>It was worth a shot.</p><p>Tell grinned at his brother. \u201cThanks, bro. You know, you\u2019ve got a romantic streak. There may be hope for you yet. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m goin\u2019 to get my woman.\u201d</p><p>Tell cleaned up and dressed in better clothing than he normally wore on a Monday afternoon. On the drive into town, he cautioned himself not to ask what the hell she\u2019d been doing whoopin\u2019 it up in the bar after the shit that\u2019d gone down between them at the rodeo Saturday afternoon. He composed snappy comebacks\u2014a mix of charm, snark and wit. Then he practiced keeping his face a blank mask when he imagining her saying it was a fling, I\u2019m returning to Dallas and never coming back, but he knew he\u2019d never pull it off because he\u2019d be crushed beyond repair if she left.</p><p>So what would he do to get her to stay?</p><p>What would it take for him to follow her?</p><p>He\u2019d never considered that option. Could he seriously pull up stakes and leave his family and everything he\u2019d ever known? Just to be with a woman?</p><p>Yes. If that woman was Georgia.</p><p>Whoa there. Before he started packing his shit and looking for cowhand jobs in Texas, he\u2019d better find out if that was something Georgia wanted.</p><p>Tell fought a massive wave of anxiety as he knocked.</p><p>The door swung open and Georgia froze.</p><p>His heart began that slow, sad tumble to his feet until Georgia threw herself into his arms and squeezed him so tightly his heart stopped beating entirely. \u201cCowboy hottie, I am so happy to see you. If you wouldn\u2019t have come to me today, I was gonna drive out to your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Georgia tugged him into the living room and shoved him on the couch. \u201cI didn\u2019t call you because I had some important things to deal with first, not because I was waiting to hear from you first. We\u2019re beyond that behavior, aren\u2019t we?\u201d She perched on the edge of the coffee table, facing him.</p><p>\u201cI hope so. What\u2019s goin\u2019 on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know we need to talk about a lot of stuff. But before we get all this out in the open, I have to ask you one thing.\u201d Her eyes searched his. \u201cDid you mean it when you told Deck that you wanted me for keeps?\u201d</p><p>With all my heart. With everything I am. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure? This thing with us was supposed to be a fun diversion with some smokin\u2019 hot sex thrown in and it turned into so much more than that. I don\u2019t think either of us was prepared for how fast everything changed. Although it\u2019s pretty obvious it never was casual. It\u2019s always been something special between us. Something I\u2019ve never felt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Georgia was babbling? He put his hands on her cheeks. \u201cSweetness. Calm down. And if you\u2019re sayin\u2019 what I think you\u2019re sayin\u2019, well, I need to hear every word. Loud and clear.\u201d</p><p>She blurted out, \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>There was that falling sensation again. \u201cRun that by me one more time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I love you so much it scares me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does it scare you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter RJ died, I closed myself off from all relationships. I couldn\u2019t lose anyone else I cared about if I didn\u2019t bother to care about anyone\u2014a friend or a lover.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve needed to deal with this for a long time. It\u2019s not surprising it came full circle in Sundance. When I was forced to take this job, I swore I\u2019d come back here, exorcise my demons and move on. Then I got involved with you. You changed everything. You challenged me. You accepted me. You freed me.\u201d</p><p>He had to breathe slowly, steadily, because the roaring in his ears threatened to drown out the sound of her words.</p> <p>\u201cI only just realized I\u2019m tired of blaming everything that\u2019s wrong with my life on someone else. On my early, crappy marriage to Deck. On RJ dying. On my parents splitting up. On the way my dad grieved. On my job. Over the last day, it\u2019s become obvious I need to take responsibility for myself and my own happiness and live my life on my terms.</p><p>\u201cThe God\u2019s honest truth is you make me happy. Happier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. And isn\u2019t that feeling worth something when making a life-changing decision? Shouldn\u2019t that feeling of happiness determine everything? Yes. So I quit my job yesterday.\u201d</p><p>His voice was barely above a whisper when he asked, \u201cAre you sure that\u2019s what you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. So my decision to give up my life in Dallas to be with you here in Sundance is not politically correct. I\u2019m supposed to believe I don\u2019t need a man to make me happy. But you know what? That\u2019s crap. That\u2019s me listening to other people\u2019s opinions instead of listening to my heart. My heart is telling me to stay here with you, Tell McKay. My heart loves you. I love you. I love everything about you.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine anything better than waking up with you every morning. I love how much you make me laugh. I love how you\u2019ve taught me how to have fun. I love how you\u2019ve shown me what a sense of community means. What friendships mean. I love how you understand family issues and don\u2019t believe everything has to have a quick fix. I hate that we\u2019ve both dealt with sadness and loss, but I love I have you to talk to about it. You accept it all. Every part of me.\u201d</p><p>If Tell\u2019s mouth weren\u2019t so damn dry and his heart weren\u2019t beating a million miles an hour, he might have thought he was actually dreaming.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had so many choices made for me throughout my life. This time I\u2019m taking a stand and making my own choice. This time I\u2019m choosing you.\u201d</p><p>As calm as he appeared on the outside, on the inside his inner teenage boy was yelling, In your face, suckas, this girl is mine!</p><p>She blushed and fiddled with the collar of his shirt. \u201cSo, ah, please don\u2019t tell me you were coming here to break up with me or something.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. He laughed until he cried. Or maybe he was crying because this woman had just made him the happiest man alive. He brought her close enough to stare into her eyes and feel her stuttered breath on his lips. \u201cI\u2019m not breaking up with you, but you should understand that I\u2019m not good at this because I\u2019ve never said it before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell, you don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do. I love you, Georgia. I\u2019ve come to some of those same realizations too. I wanna be with you so much that I was ready to move to Dallas if that\u2019s what it\u2019d take for us to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a fuckin\u2019 heartbeat. I want a lifetime with you. Marriage, babies, havin\u2019 our family and friends over for dinner, goin\u2019 out on the town, planting a garden and sinking our roots in deep. I\u2019ve seen my cousins so happy, and they\u2019ve each built their own family. I\u2019ve wanted that for myself, but I didn\u2019t think it was possible until you. You make me feel so much. Make me feel things I\u2019ve never felt before. And yes, it\u2019s scary as hell for me too.\u201d</p> <p>They stared at each other.</p><p>She grinned and said, \u201cWow. That\u2019s some grown-up stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Mushy stuff too.\u201d He kissed her fingertips. \u201cI love everything about you. I love that you get everything about me, and apparently you still love me anyway.\u201d</p><p>She laughed softly.</p><p>\u201cYou make me happy, Georgia. And I will spend the rest of my life makin\u2019 sure you don\u2019t regret choosing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already don\u2019t have any regrets.\u201d She kissed him with passion, heart and fire; he sucked it down like a narcotic. Drugged on the taste of her, the feel of her, this woman who loved him.</p><p>He broke the kiss to murmur, \u201cAnd don\u2019t take this wrong, but you don\u2019t hafta get a job right away if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019ll support you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee how sweet you are?\u201d She nipped his chin. \u201cThank you. I appreciate it, but I\u2019ve got a few offers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeah and Roxanne have offered me a job at the beauty shop. Stephanie said she\u2019d hire me to organize her filing system. Domini mentioned they\u2019re always shorthanded at Dewey\u2019s, so I could probably wait tables. At the fundraiser, the cheerleading coach said there was an assistant cheer coach\u2019s job for me at the school if I wanted it. And the Sundance Chamber of Commerce might be looking for a part-time PR person. So I\u2019ve got options. The job doesn\u2019t matter as long as I get to come home to you every night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that you mention it, I was sorta kicking around the idea of takin\u2019 on a roommate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. But it\u2019s gotta be someone special. A woman who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m gonna be a rancher the rest of my life. A woman who is okay with me judging the occasional rodeo. A woman who knows I can\u2019t cook. A woman who understands that once she moves in, she ain\u2019t ever movin\u2019 out. A woman who knows that I\u2019ll love her and cherish her and protect her every day of her life. That this is for keeps.\u201d</p><p>Georgia\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cI\u2019m so ready to sign on the dotted line for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd ain\u2019t it lucky I just happen to have a pen?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGod. I love you, Tell McKay. My very own cowboy hottie. I will take you up on your roommate offer, if it includes trampoline and zip-line privileges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to go to Dallas and load up my stuff and cancel the lease on my condo, but that should only take a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 with you.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows rose. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure as hell ain\u2019t gonna let you drive across the damn country by yourself dragging a U-Haul. You\u2019ll need help loading your stuff. And I wanna see where you lived and worked because that\u2019s part of who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho I was,\u201d she corrected. \u201cYou also want my colleagues and former boss to know exactly who I\u2019m leaving Dallas for.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThat too. You\u2019re mine now, hot lips, and I\u2019m gonna take great pride in letting everyone know it. Especially letting you know it.\u201d He brushed his lips over hers softly. \u201cDespite you actin\u2019 so tough, I suspect you\u2019ll shed a few tears, sayin\u2019 goodbye to that life, and you\u2019ll need me around for comic relief on the long drive back home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you for a lot more than comic relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good to know. I love you. You\u2019re gonna get mighty sick of hearing me say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m pretty sure I can find a whole bunch of fun things to do between here and Dallas. Amusement parks and the like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell no. You\u2019re never getting me on a roller coaster, McKay.\u201d</p><p>Tell just grinned and kissed her, knowing how sweet it would be when they teetered on the edge of the first drop, seeing the loops and turns ahead, and then experienced that sudden fall. She\u2019d be screaming her head off, hanging on for dear life, but having the time of her life because she was with him. </p> </body></html>"]
