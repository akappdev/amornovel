It had all been so easy. She had come with him just like that. Girls like her always did. The ones with the low self-esteem, the girls who sat alone in the corner of the nightclub while their friends danced in the centre of the dance floor. Men hovering around them like flies around shit. They were all shit. However, the girls in the corners were different.</p><p>They would giggle as he complimented them. They weren\u2019t used to that \u2013 it embarrassed them \u2013 but boy did they enjoy hearing what he had to say. Of course they did \u2013 no one paid them compliments \u2013 no one noticed them, they were hidden in the corner. He noticed them though, he had noticed her.</p> <p>She trembled before him, wishing now that she hadn\u2019t had so much to drink. Her knees didn\u2019t knock together because of the Smirnoff Ice the guy had plied her with. They knocked together out of fear. She had never been naked in front of anyone before \u2013 she\u2019d never had reason to. No one had asked her to take off her clothes like he had. His voice had been soft \u2013 coaxing \u2013 as her dress fell to the floor. At first she had giggled and covered her flesh with her arms, but he had gently pulled them away. That gorgeous smile of his had told her that it was okay - he liked her - he really did.</p><p>Oh, yes.</p><p>He eyed her. So much flesh, he smiled to himself. Enough to go around.</p><p>\u201cPlease just let me call my mum,\u201d the girl sobbed in his arms.</p><p>He held her gently and smelt the fear which leaked from her in waves. His heart quickened just like hers.</p> <p>\u201cMy roommate will be back soon,\u201d the girl whispered, squirming against his smooth chest. She secretly knew that her friend wouldn\u2019t be home until morning, and by then, she would be dead. She knew that and she wanted her mum. Just to speak to her, to hear her voice one last time. \u201cPlease...\u201d she whispered, looking up into his dark eyes.</p><p>His eyes hadn\u2019t been so dark in the nightclub. Back there, they had twinkled as he had flirted with her as he had whispered all the things that she\u2019d always longed a boy would whisper to her. His mouth had been different, too. In the unlit corner of the nightclub, his lips had felt soft like new-born skin as they had brushed over her cheek, making her skin tingle. Now, in the gloom of her room, his lips seemed to have stretched somehow, as if pulled up behind his ears, and all the girl could think of was Heath Ledger disguised as the Joker.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the guy\u2019s lips; it was what lay behind them that told the girl she would never hear her mum\u2019s voice again. The two ivory-looking points jutted from his black gums like blades.</p><p>There was a noise and the girl glanced up. It was the sound of her bedroom door being pushed open. She was saved; her roommate was back already! She peered over his shoulder and looked towards the open doorway, her eyes brimming with hope.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d she breathed, she was now wanting her heart to stop and put an end to the suffering she knew was going to come.</p><p>The figures standing in the open doorway stepped into the room. Both were young, no older than twenty-five. One male, one female. They ignored her question and spoke to the other.</p> <p>\u201cYou have done well,\u201d the male said, his lips seeming to spread up and open across his face, revealing a set of razor-sharp teeth.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t come to talk,\u201d the female said. \u201cI\u2019m ravenous.\u201d</p><p>With his arms still wrapped around the trembling girl, the man looked back at the others, and with a smile, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s eat then.\u201d</p><p>The girl closed her eyes at the sight of the freaky-looking mouths which lunged at her. A warm sensation raced through her body, and with it came a numbness and total darkness.</p><p>The three of them fed. They gorged themselves until they could eat no more.</p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Thaddeus Blake sat with his back to the river and spied through the heavy traffic. He watched the young girl, who sat hunched on the steps of the Embankment Tube Station. The February evening was bitter, and Thaddeus Blake watched as she tucked her dirty hands into the sleeves of her worn sweater. This was the seventh night he had spent sitting across the road from her, looking on as she implored the passing commuters to part with some spare change. Most ignored her whilst looking straight through her skeletal frame. The odd few did toss her coins, but others, usually older men, would pause beside her as they shared a few discreet words. The girl would become angry and start to shout at them. Her words were drowned out by the sound of passing night buses and taxis.</p><p>Sometimes, when she collected enough for food or a drink, she would disappear. Thaddeus would continue to wait in the dark, neatly dressed in a near black suit, crisp white shirt, with a blood-red silk tie. Hands laced in lap, legs crossed at the ankles, he would wait for her to return. She always did, sometimes after only a few minutes where she would resume her position on the steps. On two occasions she had been accompanied by a younger girl - fourteen-years-old, perhaps? He couldn\u2019t be sure. She was scruffy-looking too - but unlike the other, the younger girl would sometimes sway on her feet, toppling over and collapsing onto the ground, consumed by drugs or alcohol - probably both.</p> <p>But tonight, the older girl who had fascinated him so much was alone and having a rougher time than usual as she sat curled up, rocking back and forth in the cold. The commuters passed her by in busy streams, seeking the warmth of pubs, clubs, or the warmth of their lover\u2019s bed. Thaddeus pulled up the sleeve of his suit and read the time. It was just past eight. He would give it another two hours or so, and then he would approach the girl.</p><p>Thaddeus spent the next two hours dining at a restaurant just off Trafalgar Square. For a man of medium build, he could be known to eat a hearty meal, and tonight he had put away two very rare sirloin steaks with a side order of ham, a large plate of fried potatoes and sweet peas, finished off with a giant serving of blueberry pie. As a rule, he drank very little, wanting - always needing - to keep his wits about him. But tonight he had consumed three glasses of red wine. After his meal, he sat for a short time, smoking a cigarette in the dimly-lit restaurant with the smell and taste of fresh tobacco curling up from his full lips and lingering around his slender fingers.</p><p>He arrived back on the opposite side of the road from the Embankment Tube Station at just past ten. A chill wind had picked up and it ran its icy fingers through his messy-looking hair. He spied the young girl, who was still there, now standing faint and tired-looking against the white stone of the building. Thaddeus lingered for several minutes more, then gracefully crossed the road at the traffic lights and approached the girl.</p><p>She stood facing away from him, her long, matted hair whispering about her shoulders and hiding most of her face. Thaddeus came alongside her and stopped. Feeling his presence, she turned, and through her long fringe, looked up into his face. She figured on first sight that he couldn't be more than twenty-five years in age, but he could have been older. It was his eyes, she thought. They were two dark brown spheres, set deeply into his face. They were alive and sparkling in the light from passing traffic. They generated such life, they made the rest of his face look worn and tired somehow. The pallor of his skin was so very pale, she wondered if he were not ill. His lips were full in colour though, so very dark. A wave of untidy hair framed his face. It didn\u2019t look a mess by accident; he had styled it that way. The lower half of his face was covered in a few days\u2019 stubble, which had been neatly trimmed.</p><p>After what seemed like time unknown, she broke her study of the stranger\u2019s face and moved slightly away from him. She wasn't scared, but she knew these city types would rather not be seen with a tart, even if they did try and buy sex from her. That was a secret they kept hidden away in the backs of cabs, cheap hotel rooms, down infested alleyways, where if they could, they would leave her with their dirty secrets and return home to clean sheets and their even cleaner wives. She knew a lot of girls - and some boys - who did such things. Not her though - not ever. She would rather have starved.</p><p>Looking away from him, she said, \"What do you want, mister?\"</p><p>Still looking at her, Thaddeus replied, \"Just a few hours of your time.\"</p><p>No one had ever asked her for a few hours before, and she became a little nervous. She hid it well and said, \"Get lost, mister. I\u2019m not for sale.\u201d</p><p>\"Money isn't a problem, whatever you ask,\" he said back, his eyes still fixed on her, and even in the bitterly cold wind he could smell her. It was a musty, sweaty, unclean smell, and he wanted to cover his nose with his hand.</p><p>She felt nervous; something wasn\u2019t right. The girl couldn\u2019t help but wonder why this well-to-do type was offering her money like this, when all he had to do was call up an agency and get himself a proper tart.</p><p>\"No, sorry, mister, that sorta thing isn\u2019t my bag.\"</p><p>Thaddeus smiled and said, \"Why? Have you got yourself a better offer?\" He laughed softly into the evening but not mockingly.</p><p>\"Look, why don\u2019t you fuck-off? I said I ain't interested, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she snapped at him.</p><p>She had her back to him, but he could sense the fear in her voice. Thaddeus felt ashamed; he hadn't meant to scare her. So he spoke to her again, but this time soothingly, his voice like a song against the steady hiss of traffic. \"Look, I'm sorry if I have upset you, no harm was meant. I would just like to pay you for the privilege of your company for the next few hours.\"</p><p>The young girl listened to the sound of his voice, rather than what he was saying. She was caught by it. For a moment she was entranced by the sound of it. After mere seconds, she pulled herself together and wheeled around to face him. \"How many ways have I got to tell you? I ain't gonna screw you, however posh you talk with all your fancy words!\"</p><p>Thaddeus never broke his gaze, eyes locked onto hers as if they couldn\u2019t, or wouldn't let go. He spoke softly to her again.</p><p>\"I never said I wanted to bed you. Quite the opposite, in fact. All I want to do is buy you dinner and talk.\u201d Then showing her the palms of his hands, as if to prove she had no reason to fear him, he smiled again and said, \u201cJust talk.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She broke his stare for the second time that evening and rocked her head back, spilling laughter into the night. \"Yeah, right! You want to buy me dinner. Now I really have heard it all. I've been given some bullshit in my time, but that....\"</p><p>\"Look, I am being straight with you,\" Thaddeus cut in, his voice was sincere as he held her gaze again. \u201cI have no interest in having sex with you of any kind. I have no intention of harming you in any way. We can eat wherever you wish. I just want to talk to you.\"</p><p>The young girl felt the sincerity in his voice, and believed she saw it</p> <p>in those eyes of his . She felt drawn by them, could feel herself soften and weaken. The thought of a good meal sent her stomach into hungry convulsions. She spoke to him, this time calmer.</p><p>\"What do you want to talk about?\"</p><p>Knowing he had her, he took her gently by the arm and led her up to the Strand. \"You eat first,\u201d he said, \u201cthen I talk.\"</p><p>As they moved off, a very odd-looking couple but completely unnoticed in London, she thought whatever it was he wanted to talk about, she could listen to his voice all night long.</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, Thaddeus Blake was sitting opposite the young girl in a pizza parlour. He watched with some amusement as she forked large helpings of pasta into her hungry mouth. She washed every forkful down with a gulp of milk, leaving a white fringe across her upper lip. Thaddeus looked on with fascination as he smoked and drank a large mugful of sweet black coffee. Both the bitter scent of the coffee beans and the tobacco smoke, which lingered around his fingers, masked the stench that wafted across the table from the girl. As he pitched his cigarette out into the ashtray, she spoke to him through a mouthful of food.</p><p>\"You said you wanted to talk. Go on then.\" She knocked her fringe from her eyes, and Thaddeus noticed two things that pleased him. Although her hair was matted with dirt and grime, he could see that if it was washed, it would blaze a bright copper. What pleased him more than anything, were her eyes. Thaddeus knew that with some rest and healthy living, they would shine a beautiful green. Her lips were pale, seemingly bloodless, but with a strong cupid\u2019s bow.</p><p>\"How old are you?\" he questioned her.</p><p>She replied quickly without looking up from the plate of food. \"Twenty-one.\"</p><p>\"Truthfully, please,\" he asked again.</p><p>This time she did look up at him and met his gaze. \"Eighteen.\"</p> <p>Thaddeus nodded and spoke again, \"Friends or family?\"</p><p>She took another swig of the milk, swallowed hard, and then said, \"Are you taking the piss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Thaddeus said, regretting his naive line of questioning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in care for as long as I can remember,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so great. So I did a bunk when I was fourteen and came to London. Been here pretty much ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrugs?\u201d Thaddeus asked.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks,\u201d she said, forking more of the pasta into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t offering them to you,\u201d he shot back. \u201cDo you take them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of stuff I\u2019m not necessarily proud of,\u201d she said, staring at him across the table, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never done no drugs.\u201d</p> <p>Then leaning across the table, Thaddeus gripped hold of her left wrist and forced back the sleeve of her shabby sweater to the crook of her elbow.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she barked, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus looked at her pale arm. The skin was milky-white and unblemished. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and released her arm.</p><p>\u201cNo drugs, and no sex,\u201d she whispered, and pulled down her sleeve. Then fixing him with an angry stare, she added, \u201cI know your type. You think that everyone who is homeless is a drug-taking whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Thaddeus said, and an uncomfortable silence fell over the table. Thaddeus lit another cigarette as he watched the girl. When he had smoked it down almost to his knuckle, he said, \u201cWhat's your name?\"</p><p>\"Winter McCall,\u201d she said, forking the last of the pasta into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWinter? Is that some kind of street name?\u201d he asked her, feeling slightly amused.</p><p>She saw the smile tugging at the corner of his lips, and said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s my real name. Apparently I was born during the middle of the worst snowstorm in years. The snow was so deep that the ambulance got stuck before reaching the hospital. I was born in the back of the ambulance, so my mum called me Winter. Most people just call me Winnie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you prefer?\u201d Thaddeus asked her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care much,\u201d she shrugged, staring out of the window, wondering how long it would be before she was forced out into the cold again. Then, looking back at the stranger who had bought her dinner, Winnie said, \u201cSo what\u2019s your story? What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name is Thaddeus Blake, and I\u2019d like you to work for me,\u201d he said, then swilled down the rest of his coffee.</p><p>\"Sorry, mister,\u201d Winnie said, standing to leave. \u201cI don\u2019t need no pimp.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus moved with lightning grace and took hold of her hand before she could leave. \"I didn't mean that. I wouldn't be so vulgar to offer you such a proposition. The work isn\u2019t of that nature.\"</p><p>Winnie looked down into his eyes and saw the openness, that honesty she had seen before on the steps of the Embankment. He spoke again, his voice gentle as always, \"Please stay a while and listen to what I have to say, and if when I am finished you still want to leave, then you won't get any more harassments from me.\"</p><p>He let go of her hand. Winnie stood between the chair and the table. She looked down at the stranger before her and felt confused. On one hand he seemed strong and slightly arrogant, but on the other hand, he seemed gentle and a little naive. He implored her once more, his voice barely a whisper.</p><p>\"Please trust me. Stay a little longer. You can go at any time. I am true to my word.\u201d</p><p>Those last two words Winnie had heard so many times before in her life, and too often they had meant very little. For reasons she couldn\u2019t quite explain, Winnie found herself taking her seat once more on the opposite side of the table. Somehow, she felt strangely in control of the situation. She sensed a certain desperateness about Thaddeus Blake which he fought to keep hidden beneath his cool exterior.</p><p>\"Okay, I'm listening,\u201d she said, \u201cbut any funny stuff, and I'm gone, mister.\u201d</p><p>\"Please, call me Thaddeus,\u201d he smiled warmly.</p><p>Winnie eyed him cautiously and said, \u201cSo what kind of job are you offering?\"</p><p>Thaddeus drew a silver flip case from his breast pocket, opened it, and offered a cigarette to Winnie.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a habit I can afford,\u201d she said, waving the case away with her grubby hand.</p><p>Thaddeus put the case away after taking one for himself and lit it. Once settled, he spoke.</p><p>\"I\u2019d like you to come and work for me at my home in Cornwall. In the last year, I have purchased a big home there, which takes a great deal of looking after and care. All I'd ask of you is to keep it clean. Your other duties would be to prepare my meals and do my laundry.\"</p><p>Winnie watched him blow smoke out of his nostrils as she said, \"Ever thought about getting yourself a wife, mister. Or a maid?\"</p><p>\"I\u2019ve had both. My wife died almost a year ago of cancer, and the maid just didn't work out.\"</p><p>\u201cA wife?\u201d Winnie asked, unable to mask her surprise. \u201cYou must have married young. You can\u2019t be any older than twenty-five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met as teenagers,\u201d he said, turning as if to watch the people pass in the street outside. \u201cFrom the very first time I saw her, I loved her.\u201d</p><p>Winnie watched his pale reflection in the window and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that you weren\u2019t together longer. She must have died very young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe time we spent together was very special - it felt like an eternity,\u201d he whispered, looking back at Winnie.</p><p>Not knowing what to say next, and embarrassed by Thaddeus\u2019s obvious sadness, Winnie said, \u201cSo why didn\u2019t the whole maid thing work out?\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus stubbed out his cigarette, which was only half-smoked, and laced his hands over each other on the table. \"I have become somewhat of a recluse. I keep myself to myself. I tend to keep strange hours, mostly sleeping during the day and working through the night. It just got too much for my maid. She was old, and fetching my meals during the night and changing my linen became too much, and we parted company.\"</p><p>\"Ever thought about changing your sleeping pattern?\u201d Winnie asked dryly, eyeing him from beneath her matted fringe. \u201cIt might work wonders for your social life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say I prefer the moonlight,\u201d he smiled wistfully. \u201cBesides, after my wife's death, I had what you might call a breakdown. It wasn\u2019t my mind which was broken - it was my heart. I shied away from people and the daylight, and all that it offered in its bright and harsh clarity. I prefer the nights. They are quieter and full of peace, with everybody away in bed. I can come and go as I please without being disturbed. The world seems mine then, and mine alone. As I have said, I work at night and I find the peace it gives me refreshing.\"</p><p>\u201cWhat's your work?\"</p><p>\"I'm a writer; a poet in fact,\u201d Thaddeus explained. \u201cSo as I'm sure you'll understand, I enjoy the solitude of the night. It sounds a little pretentious, I know, but I prefer to work that way.\u201d</p><p>\"Okay, mister, but...\u201d Winnie started.</p><p>\"Please, call me Thaddeus,\u201d he reminded her with a smile.</p><p>\"Okay, Thaddeus,\u201d she said, \u201cbut what you\u2019ve said doesn\u2019t explain a great deal. Why choose me? I\u2019m a beggar, living on the streets of London, without anything to offer. To be honest, I can barely read and write...\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d had a chance to finish talking herself out of the job offer, Thaddeus cut over her and said, \u201cI've been in London over this last week visiting with my publishers, and each evening it has been my wish to walk along the river. Each night when I've reached the Embankment, there you have been, begging and being sneered at by strangers. Don't get me wrong; I'm not offering you pity or charity. If you do decide to come back to Cornwall with me, you'll be working hard for your keep. As I have already pointed out, I do have some strange habits, and perhaps a few requests from time to time that you might think a little odd, but let me assure you once again, I don\u2019t want you for sex of any sort.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Winnie looked across the table at him and asked bluntly, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not gay,\u201d Thaddeus said, with a smile. \u201cAs I have already explained, I\u2019ve been married. I loved my wife very dearly and she will never be replaced.\"</p><p>Winnie watched him. She had become good at people watching during the many hours she had spent begging outside railway stations, and she couldn\u2019t help but notice how his eyes grew almost black as he spoke of his wife. It was more than just sadness she could see in them; it was despair.</p> <p>\"How much will you be paying me?\" she asked, changing the subject.</p><p>\"You'll have your own private room. All food and any other extras will be paid for,\u201d Thaddeus explained. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to pay any bills. I\u2019ll give you two hundred pounds per week, to spend in whatever way you see fit, as long as you are there when I need you, and are willing to succumb to any other little request I might make of you.\u201d</p><p>Winnie swallowed hard. Two hundred a week. Lately, she'd been lucky if she'd scrounged two pounds a week from begging. Money aside, she was still wary of Thaddeus Blake. She only knew what he had chosen to tell her about himself.</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred a week, huh?\u201d she said, pulling the ends of her sleeves down over her dirty hands. \u201cA big house in the country... I didn\u2019t know anyone could make so much money from writing down a few fancy words that rhyme.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus laughed and said, \u201cI wish my poems made me money, they only make a fraction of my income - just pocket money, really. No, my wealth has been inherited. Like I have explained, I am the last and have no one to share it with \u2013 unless, that is, if you take me up on my offer.\u201d</p> <p>Winnie looked back at him across the table and said nothing.</p><p>\"What have you got to lose, Winnie?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Again, she said nothing and just stared into his brown eyes.</p><p>\u201cI have been honest with you,\u201d he shrugged, as if now the whole thing was not so important after all. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. No pressure. I have kept to my side of the bargain. I bought you dinner and we talked.\"</p><p>Sensing that her opportunity of escaping London and the evils she had discovered there was may be slipping away, she whispered, \"How can I be sure that I can trust you?\"</p><p>Thaddeus looked Winnie squarely in the face and said, \"You won\u2019t know unless you come back to Cornwall with me.\u201d Then pushing his chair back from the table, he added, \u201cThe hour is getting late. I\u2019ll be leaving tomorrow evening at seven from Paddington Railway Station. If you wish to take up my offer, meet me on the concourse and we shall leave together. If you chose not to meet me, I shall go back to my home and forget this meeting, and you.\"</p> <p>They parted company outside the pizza parlour, Winnie making her way back to the Embankment. After she was out of sight, Thaddeus hailed a taxi and disappeared off into the night. To him, the night was still very young, and he had a lot to do before dawn.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Winnie made her way back to the Embankment. It was close to midnight now, not that time meant much to her. The days, nights, and hours all just rolled into one. Normally there was no break from the constant feel of hunger that gnawed away at her insides. Tonight she didn\u2019t feel hungry; her shrunken stomach felt bloated, and it was a feeling that she had forgotten even existed. People poured out of the clubs and pubs, but they were nothing but ghosts to her. Or was it the other way around? She wondered. Was she the ghost? No one ever seemed to notice her, unless she made a complete nuisance of herself by thrusting her filthy hands under their noses, and asking for any spare change that they might have. Some gave her the loose coins they had jingling in their pockets, but others just looked away, their noses turned up. She didn\u2019t really blame them. Winnie knew she looked more like an animal than a human. Her hair was plastered with dirt, and her clothes were threadbare and just as dirty as her skin. Thanks to the city worker who thought it would be amusing to take a piss over her as she lay huddled in a shop doorway three nights ago, she now stank of urine, too.</p><p>Winnie reached the Embankment, and she could hear the sound of the water slosh against the shore. Party boats cruised over the black water of the Thames, the sound of muffled laughter and music being carried on the wind. Late night trains rattled over Blackfriars Bridge, taking the last of the commuters home for the night, just to turn around and come back again in a few hours\u2019 time and start all over. Drawing her hands up into the sleeves of her sweater, she felt the two bread rolls she had sneaked from the pizza bar. They weren\u2019t for her - they were for her friend, Ruby Little. Winnie didn\u2019t know her real name and she wondered if Ruby could still remember it herself. She was named Ruby because of the dirty red coat she always wore. Little, because she was little. It wasn\u2019t any more complex than that. However, Ruby was more than just little. She was fragile - like one of those china statues Winnie had often seen in the posh shops in Knightsbridge.</p><p>But what Winnie couldn\u2019t figure out was if Ruby was indeed a friend. She wasn\u2019t sure. Winnie cared for her - perhaps like a younger sister. Ruby could be trouble, though. Winnie knew that Ruby had stolen from her before - the little money she had managed to scrounge that day - Ruby had sometimes sneaked from her pocket while she had been sleeping. Ruby was just as hungry as her, but what pissed Winnie off, was that she spent the money on blow, or worse. Ruby was cracked out of her skull most of the time, and would need looking after. Winnie didn\u2019t always have time for that. Begging was a fulltime occupation. Hours spent watching over Ruby while she lay choking on her own vomit was time Winnie could spend hustling for money - money that would buy her more survival time. Even though Ruby would sometimes steal from her, she was company - someone to talk to when the nights were just too cold to sleep. Winnie had forgotten how many freezing cold nights they spent cuddled together for warmth over the last few years.</p><p>But Winnie knew that stealing from her wasn\u2019t the only way that Ruby made money. She turned tricks for the men who approached her. Winnie knew why - she knew why most of the girls and boys went with those men - they were feeding a hunger far worse than starvation - they were feeding their drug habit. Winnie had smoked some weed from time to time, but nothing more. There was no coming back when you had taken a step down that darker road. It wasn\u2019t food you were begging and stealing for anymore. You needed lots of money to satisfy that particular hunger - the kind of money you only made by selling yourself.</p><p>Winnie didn\u2019t want to go there - not ever. She would rather die. She had been used before by someone who claimed to have loved her.</p><p>In the glare of the night buses, Winnie darted across the busy road and cut across the small concourse of the Embankment Tube Station. The flush of warm air inside momentarily coloured her cheeks. Then she was back in the cold again, and heading left into the archways which ran under the bridge. During the day it was a busy thoroughfare, but as the moon rose and the city went to bed, the archways became a makeshift town of cardboard boxes, soiled blankets, and huddled bodies. Winnie stepped over the seemingly lifeless bodies in search of Ruby. There was a small alcove where Ruby usually slept, but peering into the darkness, Winnie could see that it was empty. She moved forward, one of the others curled beneath the arches had a dog, and it licked dirty drain water from the gutter. It made a yelping noise as Winnie passed by in the dark.</p> <p>Then, Winnie saw what looked like a heap of red blankets lying in the gutter just ahead. She approached them, and realised that it wasn\u2019t a pile of blankets that she could see, but Ruby\u2019s red coat. With the sound of her scuffed-out trainers snapping against the cobbled road beneath the arches, Winnie ran towards her friend. Ruby lay on her side, one arm jutting out from beneath her. Her small head was tilted forward, her chin resting against her chest.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ruby,\u201d Winnie said. \u201cI\u2019ve got you something.\u201d</p><p>Ruby didn\u2019t move, even though she had her eyes wide open.</p><p>\u201cLook what I\u2019ve got you,\u201d Winnie said, taking the rolls from her threadbare sleeves.</p><p>Ruby stayed still, not even her eyelids flickered.</p><p>Winnie crouched beside the girl, and it was then that she saw the thick stream of vomit trailing from the corner of her mouth. It was crusty-looking, and bubbles of dried snot blocked Ruby\u2019s nostrils.</p><p>\u201cHey, Ruby,\u201d Winnie said, shaking her friend gently by the shoulder.</p><p>Ruby\u2019s head flopped to one side and Winnie stared into her blank eyes. Her lips were mauve, the skin around them blue. Winnie knew that it wasn\u2019t just the freezing cold which had turned them that colour.</p><p>\u201cRuby?\u201d Winnie whispered, shaking her friend again.</p><p>Ruby just stared back at her, her eyes blank - dead.</p><p>With tears standing in her eyes, the two bread rolls fell from Winnie\u2019s hands and into the gutter. There was a woofing noise as the dog leapt forward and snatched them away in its jaws.</p><p>Then gently, as if handling one of those china statues, Winnie lifted Ruby into her arms and cradled her dead body.</p><p>\u201cSomebody help me!\u201d Winnie cried out loud, but the only response she got was the dog barking back at her from somewhere in the darkness. Winnie knew she had lost her only companion, however difficult she could be at times.</p><p>\u201cPlease somebody help me,\u201d she sobbed, but she knew nobody would.</p><p>Winnie looked into Ruby\u2019s upturned face, and the line of ropey vomit made her look as if she was smiling somehow. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d Winnie whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so scared.\u201d</p><p>But not because of the hideous grin spread across the dead girl\u2019s face, but because she knew that one day, however hard she tried not to succumb to the same nightmares that Ruby had lived, she, too, would end up dead. Winnie wasn\u2019t scared of dying - it was how she died that she feared. She didn\u2019t want to die like Ruby had; choking on the drugs which had been bought with the money she had got for selling her body. That was no way to live and no way to die.</p><p>But what choice did she have? And then she thought of the offer Thaddeus Blake had made her.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Thaddeus Blake had arisen from his hotel bed at five, just before dusk. He showered and dressed himself in a black turtleneck sweater, dark denims, and a deep blue jacket. On leaving the hotel, he had made his way to Oxford Street and purchased some clothes for his new traveling companion. He had no doubt in his mind that Winnie would be at Paddington Railway Station. Thaddeus had chosen a violet top, jeans and boots. As he lingered over the garments, he pictured Winnie in the clothes he had selected for her. He pictured her seething locks of copper hair bouncing delicately off the violet top. Thaddeus could also see her enchanting emerald eyes, enhanced by the colour of her hair. She was going to look perfect for what he had in mind for her. Underwear came next, selecting a pair of panties and bra. Then there was the smell - Winnie\u2019s smell. It wasn\u2019t her fault, he knew, but it was pungent and turned his stomach. So he chose some shampoo, soap, and perfume. Thaddeus paid for all the items in cash and left the store. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He now stood on the concourse at Paddington Station, a little before seven o'clock. The carrier bag with the clothes and his own leather suitcase sat neatly by his feet as he waited for Winnie to arrive. He watched the throng of commuters who waited restlessly, looking up at the luminous displays, checking to see what platform their train home that night would depart from.</p><p>Others seemed more relaxed and sat on heaped mounds of luggage, drinking from soda cans and chewing on cheaply-made sandwiches. The homeless continued to beg, and pigeons circled above in the diesel fumes which belched from the engines of departing trains. Thaddeus had no love for the city, and he longed to be back at home in the clean air and the safety of his sanctuary.</p><p>Without even noticing her arrive, Winnie had crept up beside him.</p> <p>\"What time does our train leave?\" she asked him.</p><p>He smiled with his eyes and replied, \"Seven-thirty.\"</p><p>Winnie stood, arms wrapped about her fragile frame which she hid beneath the same dirty sweater. She also wore the same faded denims as the previous night, which were covered from thigh to calf in grime and dirt. Her feet were clad in worn trainers, which flopped loosely about her feet, due to oversize and lack of laces.</p><p>Thaddeus could see at once that Winnie appeared disturbed in some way, and he wondered if she was going to turn and run at any minute. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>Winnie thought of Ruby, the last she had seen of her was being slid into the back of the hearse, zipped tight in a black plastic body bag. The police officers had asked her questions, but not many. It was obvious what had happened. Winnie didn\u2019t want to think about that - that was in the past now and she didn\u2019t want to go back there. So brushing aside her long, unruly fringe, she looked at Thaddeus and said, \u201cI\u2019m just a bit nervous, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have nothing to be nervous about,\u201d he smiled. \u201cI promise.\u201d Then, picking up the carrier bag in a quick movement, he handed it to her.</p><p>Winnie looked confused.</p><p>\"It\u2019s okay, I bought you some new clothes to travel in,\u201d he explained.</p><p>\"Look, I ain\u2019t no charity case. I got my...\" she started.</p><p>Thaddeus cut across her with a gentle smile dancing over his lips and in his eyes, and said, \u201cCall it an advance on your wages.\"</p><p>Winnie looked down, and pulling open the bag, she peered inside. She raised her eyebrows, and closing it she looked up at him.</p> <p>\"You were that sure that I'd come, you went and bought these clothes?\"</p><p>Without taking his eyes from her, he said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you would come, but I kind of hoped you would.\u201d He then took a metal comb from his back trouser pocket and handed it to her. \u201cGo freshen up.\u201d</p><p>Without looking back, she headed across the concourse in the direction of the female bathrooms where she could have a wash and put on the clean clothes. She had become used to washing in public bathrooms, but at least now she had some decent soap and shampoo to do the job properly. Winnie had also become accustomed to the stares that you got, but today she didn\u2019t care. Today she would leave the bathrooms looking as good as any of the other women who stood and preened themselves in the long mirrors above the sinks.</p><p>Winnie found the cubicle for disabled people and slipped inside, closing the door behind her. She chose that particular cubicle as they were bigger than the others, and they had their own sink and hand dryer. She could wash and change without others looking at her. Filling a basin with warm water, she leant forward at the waist and wetted her hair the best she could. Winnie squirted some of the shampoo into the palms of her hands and then massaged it into her hair. Leaning forward again, she washed the white foamy suds away. The smell of the shampoo was sweet and almost intoxicating and at once she started to feel better about herself. Then stripping down to her grey underwear, she refilled the sink with clean water.</p><p>She washed as best as she could, splashing her arms, legs, and face with water and soap. It felt as if she was washing away the last few years from the pores of her skin. Turning on the automatic dryer, Winnie angled the nozzle so as to dry her hair, face, arms, and legs. Then snatching up the bag of clothes Thaddeus had given her, she pulled them out and dressed.</p><p>Alone again, Thaddeus purchased Winnie a ticket from the automated machine. He knew the bag he had given to her contained one of the violet tops, with the black jeans and boots. A fire burnt in his stomach with anticipation as he waited for her to return. He wanted to see if she would look as good as he hoped. After waiting patiently for some time, Thaddeus looked up to see Winnie appear from the ladies bathroom. She came towards him, and his heart beat loud and fast in his chest as he looked on in wonder at the transformation. She was going to be perfect, he thought secretly to himself. The top hung loosely about her frame, shifting and whispering like a violet haze as she moved towards him. He figured her height to be about five-two without the boots, but now she appeared to be much taller. That was good, he thought - it was perfect. He noted that she had put his comb and the shampoo to good use, for her hair now hung in thick, fiery locks about her face and shoulders.</p><p>Winnie reached him, feeling fresh and excited in her new clothes. She couldn\u2019t remember feeling so good about herself. It was as if she was a person again.</p><p>\"How do I look, Thaddeus?\" she asked.</p> <p>He knew exactly how she looked, and it was better than he could\u2019ve ever imagined when he first caught sight of her a week ago, begging outside the Embankment Tube Station. Then as coolly as he could, and wanting to hide his own excitement, he looked at Winnie and simply said, \"You look okay.\" He then turned, snatched up his case and made his way across the concourse towards the platform where their train waited.</p><p>They boarded a first-class carriage and took their seats. Winnie excitedly sat in the window seat, as Thaddeus took the seat beside her. The train pulled effortlessly out of the station at dead-on seven-thirty in a cloud of oily blue diesel smoke. Winnie reclined her chair and relaxed, letting her heavy eyelids slide shut. Thaddeus turned slightly in his seat and studied her profile for the briefest of moments, then turned away, and as he did, his eyes turned black with horror. Across the gangway sat a man, the Evening Standard newspaper held up before him. Thaddeus read the bold black headline splashed across the front: \u201cFemale student found savaged in bedsit.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Their journey to the south west of England passed with little conversation. Winnie had slept most of the five hours away. She found the soft reclining chair just too comfortable. It was the nearest thing to a bed she had slept on for a very long time. She awoke occasionally as the train drew into stations along the route, and she would throw sidelong glances at Thaddeus. He seemed to be restless, strumming his long, slender fingers on the table before them. He stared deeply through the window and out into the night. The window threw back his own reflection, and he seemed to be staring back into his own dark eyes.</p><p>At Exeter, Winnie woke with her bladder pleading to be emptied. She pressed the flat of her hand against her tummy in fear of peeing herself. Thaddeus had gone from beside her, and she peered along the gangway in search of him. The aisle disappeared narrowly away in both directions, but she couldn\u2019t see Thaddeus. She spied his suitcase above her on the rack, and guessed he couldn't be far. Air whistled through her teeth, as she sighed and got up from her seat in search of the bathroom. The train seesawed back and forth as she passed amongst the rows of seats. There were only several passengers remaining in the carriage. Most were asleep, one or two were reading, and another sipped from a steaming cup of coffee.</p><p>The door which separated the carriages slid effortlessly open for her as she passed through. The bathroom door was showing the engaged sign and she waited patiently outside, her hand pressed flat against her stomach. Her need to go was desperate now, as she squeezed her muscles tight and pressed her legs together. She bit into her lower lip, draining the blood there. Not knowing for how much longer she could hold on, Winnie inched forward and rapped on the door with her fist, then tugged at the handle. As she pulled, the train lurched, throwing her forward as the toilet door was opened from the inside. Winnie tumbled into the waiting arms of Thaddeus.</p><p>\"Steady,\" he whispered, holding her tightly by both shoulders with his hands.</p><p>\"Sorry, I thought the door was jammed and I'm bursting....\" she groaned, her pale cheeks flushing scarlet.</p><p>\"Well I won\u2019t hold you up any longer,\" he smiled, releasing his grip on her. He slid past, then turning, he smiled back at her and said,</p><p>\"Would you like a coffee, Winnie?\"</p><p>Returning his smile, she nodded. \"That would be great, thank you.\"</p><p>He turned away from her and she closed the door. Winnie yanked down her jeans and panties, and hitching her top up about her waist, she sighed. Once finished, she pulled up her jeans and rearranged her top. She squeezed some soap from the container on the wall, and washed her hands in the warm water which tossed and tumbled from the tap. Winnie towelled her hands dry and turned to the mirror to straighten her hair, and paused. Several small drops of what looked like blood stained her top across her right shoulder, where Thaddeus had gripped her only moments ago. She dabbed at it with a wet towel, but the blood was sticky, and it just looked worse where she had tried to wipe it away.</p><p>Raking her fingers through her hair, she tried to hide the spots of blood which covered her shoulder. Satisfied that they were hidden, she left the bathroom. Returning to her seat, she found Thaddeus with two small cups of black coffee. Once she had sat down again, Winnie glanced down at Thaddeus\u2019s hands. He had tied a white-coloured piece of tissue around his right thumb.</p><p>\u201cHave you hurt yourself?\u201d she asked, taking a sip of the hot, sweet coffee.</p><p>\u201cMy cigarette case,\u201d he said, placing his hand beneath the table and out of sight. \u201cOne of the edges is slightly serrated. I\u2019ve been meaning to replace it for a while now, so it is my own stupid fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it need stitches?\u201d Winnie asked, thinking of the blood that was now on her top.</p><p>\u201cIt's just fine. I've covered it for the time being. I shall patch it up when I get home.\u201d Then, noticing the blotches of blood, he added, \u201cI'm sorry for ruining your top. You look really pretty.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The sudden compliment surprised Winnie, and although it was nice to hear - after all, who didn\u2019t like to hear compliments - she felt awkward and didn\u2019t know how to respond.</p><p>Watching her, Thaddeus said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the top, I shall replace it.\u201d</p><p>Then breaking his stare, and feeling her cheeks flush red again, she turned to look out of the window and said, \"You don\u2019t have to replace it, you've been too kind already.\"</p> <p>They arrived at St. Erth Railway Station just after midnight. The bitter night air engulfed them like an icy blanket as they climbed from the train.</p><p>They found a taxi easily enough, and it whisked them through the night to their final destination of St. Ives. The taxi driver pulled up short, just before the turnoff where the main road ended and petered out into a narrow, unruly lane. Thaddeus paid the fare as they clambered from the car with their luggage. They stood before the lane as the taxi's taillights disappeared into the distance.</p><p>\"The cab driver won\u2019t take us any further. The lane is too narrow and the wild bracken scratches the car. I can't blame him, the uneven road doesn't help the suspension either,\" he remarked as he picked up his case and guided her up the lane, leaving the main road and the warm, orange glow of the street lights behind them. Winnie stayed close behind him, then pausing; she looked back at the road. If she was going to back out now, this was her last chance. Where was she to go? She didn\u2019t know this part of England. She had never been to Cornwall before. What did she have to go back to? Winnie had come this far. Turning away from the road, Winnie was faced with the total darkness and silence that lay before her. It was in complete contrast to London at night, which had been bright and full of noise, people, and traffic. She had never known such silence and her new surroundings unnerved her. Thaddeus continued to move briskly ahead. Winnie could barely make out his form before her. Guided by the sound of his footfalls on the stony ground beneath them, she stepped forward into the dark and followed him.</p><p>Winnie tripped and stumbled in the dark, and she winced out loud as thorns and wild ivy clawed at her like greedy hands. Not once did Thaddeus trip himself up or snag his clothes on the undergrowth, which grew in a frenzy on either side of them. Winnie guessed that they must be climbing up, because her legs began to tire and her calf muscles ached. They must have been walking for twenty minutes or more, her labouring behind, as Thaddeus strode out ahead. She was just about to cry out and plead for a rest, when Thaddeus came to an abrupt halt. There was a sound in the darkness as she heard him loosen a bolt and swing open a gate. Winnie passed through behind him. Thaddeus closed it, and then strode out in front again.</p><p>After only a minute or so of walking, Thaddeus stopped again.</p> <p>Winnie heard him slip a key into a lock, then another, and then the sound of him pushing a door wide open. He disappeared for a moment, and then there was light. Winnie found herself standing before a large house. She guessed the building had to be very old from the little she could see by the light which spilled from within. She passed through the open doorway, leaving the cold and the night behind her. Thaddeus had disappeared. Winnie looked about the vast hallway she now found herself in. The walls were panelled in a rich, deep oak. Doors to rooms led off the hallway. A wide double staircase grew from the centre of the hall and spiralled upwards into the dark like an ancient spine. Thick patterned rugs covered the polished wooden floor. Portraits adorned the walls. She was no artist, and knew very little of history, but she could tell that the pictures had been beautifully painted, and were very old. She looked about for Thaddeus as she clutched the carrier bag to her chest.</p><p>\"Thaddeus, are you there?\" she called out. As the last of her words trailed off into the depths of the enormous house, lights flickered on from the landing above her. Looking up, Winnie saw Thaddeus standing at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\"Welcome to my home, Winnie. Come up and I shall show you to your room.\"</p><p>She moved across the hallway and climbed the stairs. At the top, Thaddeus led her down a long narrow corridor, stopping outside a door at the far end. Winnie stepped into the room and looked about in wonder. The room was finely furnished with a four-poster bed at its centre. White drawers and cabinets trailed away in either direction from the bed. A beautifully ornate dressing table stood in the far corner with a small, plush velvet-seated stool before it. A bay window, fringed with lace curtains and silk drapes, faced the bed on the opposite side of the room and added to its size. Walk-in wardrobes, carved in the same fashion as the other furniture, followed the line of the wall to the door where Winnie and Thaddeus now stood. Thaddeus stepped into the room and gazed about.</p><p>\"This is your room, Winnie.\" He crossed to the far side and swung open an adjoining door. Gesturing into the room, he said, \"This is your bathroom.\"</p><p>My own bathroom? Winnie wondered in awe, as she joined Thaddeus. A thick blue carpet covered the floor, and she could tell it was deep and soft as her boots sank into it. A round-shaped bath lay to one side, slightly sunk into the floor. There was also a shower and toilet. More white cabinets and drawers lined the walls. Crisp white towels hung from a rail fixed to the wall.</p> <p>\"Oh, my god, I can\u2019t believe this is going to be my room, it beats the Embankment any day.\"</p><p>Thaddeus caught her gaze and grinned, \"Well don't say anything, just enjoy.\"</p><p>Winnie went back into the bedroom and Thaddeus followed.</p><p>\"It's just that I get the feeling...\u201d Winnie started.</p><p>\"That it's all too good to be true,\u201d he cut in. \u201cThat I must have an ulterior motive for having you here?\" He looked straight at her, his face blank, not giving anything away. Then, turning, Thaddeus went to the bedroom door. He stopped and faced her again. \"I've given you my reasons and you decided to come. If you want to stay, do so, but if you feel you must leave, then go. It\u2019s entirely up to you, Winnie. The hour is late and I must work in my room before I rest. So I bid you goodnight. If you decide to stay, I\u2019ll be getting up at dusk tomorrow evening. Do as you please until then, but do not disturb me, whatever the reason.\" He then turned in the doorway and disappeared into the shadows, which were cast along the landing.</p><p>Winnie stood looking at the empty space where he had been. After several moments, she went to the door and shut it tight. There was no lock, she noticed. Taking a chair, Winnie wedged it against the door. She knew that it wouldn\u2019t keep anyone out, but the movement of it would wake her. It was better than sleeping with one eye open like she had on so many nights beneath the Embankment.</p><p>Winnie went to the bed, lay on it, and spent her first restless night in Thaddeus\u2019s house.</p><p>Chapter Six</p> <p>Winnie awoke at a little past nine to the sound of heavy rain beating against her bedroom window. A strong wind nagged and tore about the eaves with an icy fury. She laid spread across the bed, fully dressed. She hadn't felt secure or comfortable enough last night to strip herself bare and climb between the sheets. She had felt vulnerable in the dark, and a certain distrust for Thaddeus still remained. He had been right. The house, the bedroom, the new clothes, the chance to escape her life on the streets, and Thaddeus himself, all seemed too good to be true. She had spent her life distrusting people, because most had hurt her, or let her down in some way. The distrust she felt for her new surroundings and Thaddeus didn\u2019t surprise her.</p><p>She pulled herself up onto her elbows and gazed sleepily about her new room. It truly was beautiful with its apple white walls and lavish furnishings. It was the kind of room that she had only dared to dream about as a child, as she lay at night and tried to escape the drab surroundings of the care homes she was passed around. Winnie really didn't know what to make of Thaddeus, but so far, he had been nothing but generous, kind, and true to his word. If she left, what did she have to go back to? She had no money, no clothes, or a place to live. Who would employ her? She had been on that merry-go-round before. No one would give you a job if you didn\u2019t have a bank account. You couldn\u2019t get a bank account without an address, and around and around it went. If she stayed, saved the money that Thaddeus had promised to pay her, then perhaps she could afford to start a new life for herself. She could at last break that vicious circle which she had been trapped in for so many years.</p><p>Winnie swung her legs over the side of the bed. She pulled off her boots and wiggled her feet. Standing beside the bed, she let the soft carpet seep between her toes. Winnie headed for the bathroom, undoing the blood-stained top she still wore. She let it slide smoothly off her arms where it fluttered to the floor. Standing naked beside the sunken bath in just her panties, she bent over and loosened the taps. A torrent of hot water cascaded over the shining enamel of the bath. Winnie stepped out of her panties, then climbed into the bath and let the water rise about her. She stopped the flow of water nearly at brimming point and lay back in its warmth. The water soothed her body and she relished the feel of it against her skin. She had forgotten how long it had been since she had had a proper bath or shaved her legs. The strip washes she had managed to have in public bathrooms was nothing compared to this. Even though she had only washed her hair the night before at the station, she needed to wash it again. Winnie needed to wash every part of her past life from her hair, skin, from beneath her fingernails, and between her toes. Taking a nailbrush from the side of the bath, she covered it in soap and raked it up and down her arms, over the flat of her stomach, and down her thighs, until her skin glowed an angry red. She then shaved her legs and armpits.</p><p>The water had almost turned cold before she finally reached up for one of the pure white towels, which hung from the rail beside the bath. Standing, she hugged the towel about her frame and slowly began to dry herself. She fixed her hair, and with a new toothbrush she found in one of the bathroom cupboards, she brushed her teeth. It felt so good, that she brushed them twice. Once she was ready, Winnie stepped gingerly from her room at about eleven, dressed in one of the violet tops and short, neat black skirts that Thaddeus had chosen for her. She had pulled her hair back and fastened it in place with a black scarf she had found in one of the many drawers in her room. In fact, the closets and drawers had all been filled to the brim with expensive dresses, trousers, tops, skirts, shoes, hats, handbags, coats, and lingerie, but she had feared to touch any of these without the permission of Thaddeus. After all, she thought, they could\u2019ve belonged to his dead wife. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She slipped down the lengthy landing, passing closed doors on either side of her. Winnie figured that Thaddeus must be sleeping behind one of them, and not knowing which one, she dared not to enter any of them. He had asked her not to disturb him for any reason. After tiptoeing down the wide staircase, Winnie found herself once again in the vast hall she had stood in the night before. The light was better now, and she crossed to the portraits which hung on the walls. The wall before her was decorated with oil paintings of men. She couldn\u2019t be sure, but they appeared to be very old, if not hundreds of years old. The last picture hanging from the wall didn\u2019t look so dated. It was a beautifully crafted painting of Thaddeus himself. He stared out of the picture with its silver frame. His dark eyes, scruffy dark hair enclosing his pale face, and his broad mouth set in a nonchalant pose reminded Winnie of how strangely attractive Thaddeus was. He wasn\u2019t the typical good-looking guy, but there was something about him, she thought. Something different, but she hadn\u2019t quite figured out what.</p><p>Winnie passed back along the row, and two things puzzled her. None of the paintings had been signed by the artists, and the men in each painting bore a striking resemblance to Thaddeus himself. Their faces had subtle differences in shape, their hair fashioned in different styles to suit the particular period in time, but all of them had those dark, powerful eyes. Studying the paintings, Winnie decided that they must be his ancestors. She turned on the balls of her feet and crossed to the paintings hanging on the opposite wall. These were paintings of women. Again, all of which appeared to be extremely old. As in the male portraits, the women all bore a striking resemblance to each other. All had a fountain of fiery auburn hair, pale skin, the softest of pink mouths, and green eyes that shone out of the paintings like blazing emeralds. Again, these hadn't been signed.</p><p>Winnie crossed to the centre of the hall and looked from one set of paintings to the other. As she passed between them, she noticed that they sat exactly opposite each other, so that their eyes were locked on one another\u2019s. She stood in the vast hall, looking up at the paintings. Then when her neck began to ache, she clasped the handle of one of the doors which led from the hallway and eased it open. Peering around the edge of the door, she stepped inside. Winnie found herself in a large dining room. Hazy subdued light spilled in through tall bay windows that stood at the far end of the room and lightened her surroundings. There was a long mahogany table which could have seated at least twenty people comfortably down each side. Bookcases lined the remaining walls from floor to ceiling, with a ladder on wheels propped against the shelves at the far end. She noticed that each book was leather-bound in blues, greens, and deep reds. Their spines were adorned with impressive gold binding, as were the edges of the pages. Winnie closed the door behind her and crossed the hall to the door set into the opposite wall. She pushed it open and stepped into the lounge.</p> <p>There was another bay window spilling more grey light into the room. Dust moats danced in the slices of grey light. The rain continued to hurl itself against the windows and she wrapped her arms about her shoulders, shivering, and glad to be in the warmth. Squat, leather-backed armchairs and two-seater sofas furnished the room. There was an open fireplace, and Winnie could only imagine how beautiful it would look ablaze on a cold winter\u2019s night. In the far corner was the biggest television set she had ever seen, and she went over and switched it on. Sinking down into one of the luxuriant sofas, the TV screen flickered to life.</p><p>The midday news was just beginning, and she was surprised that it had gotten so late. She sat before the television more bemused by its size than the World events that were being read by the newscaster. The first story was about the failing economy, and how many more months the country was going to be in a double-dip recession. Winnie had never before concerned herself with such troubles, the life she had led on the streets of London were where her own survival had been her main concern. The second story did grab her attention, as the newsreader began to recount the details of the brutal murder of a student in London. The body had been found in a bedsit, not too far from King\u2019s Cross Railway Station. She remembered too well the bitter nights she had spent huddled up there, begging for money so that she could buy food. Winnie listened to how the police were appealing for witnesses. The story cut to a police press conference, where a balding police officer sat behind a large table crammed with microphones. The shoulders of his smart black tunic were covered in crowns, Winnie noticed. He didn\u2019t look like the average copper who would hassle her to move on or arrest her for begging; he looked way more important than that.</p><p>The police officer had a stern look on his face, and Winnie thought he looked uncomfortable sitting in front of the press before him. As he started to make his statement, Winnie understood why he looked so gaunt and stressed. He started by explaining that he had over twenty-five years of service within the police, but never in that time had he come across such a vicious and horrific crime.</p><p>\u201cWhat is the victim\u2019s name?\u201d one of the reporters shouted off-camera.</p><p>\u201cThat is information I need to withhold at this time, until we have confirmed the identity of the victim.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you still don\u2019t know who the victim is?\u201d another reporter asked.</p><p>\u201cWe believe it is the woman who rented that particular room, but we don\u2019t want to commit to anything until we have carried out DNA tests on members of the victim\u2019s family, to confirm or deny if it is indeed the woman who rented the room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe murder took place two nights ago,\u201d another reporter reminded him. \u201cHow is it you are still yet to identify the victim?\u201d</p><p>The police officer, in his neatly-pressed tunic and blazing crowns on his shoulders, looked sombrely at the reporters. He took a moment as if preparing himself for what he had to say next. When he was ready, he said, \u201cThe attack was so ferocious that it has as of yet, not been possible to properly identify the victim,\u201d the officer explained.</p><p>A buzz of excitement swept over the news-hungry reporters, the TV flickered with white light as a burst of cameras all went off at the same time. The officer blinked in the sudden glare of flashing lights.</p><p>\u201cSo what are the injuries?\u201d a reporter asked.</p> <p>The officer sat quietly for a moment, his Adam\u2019s apple rising slowly in his throat as he swallowed. Then looking at the reporters gathered before him, he said, \u201cIt would appear that the perpetrator performed cannibalism on the victim. Either that, or the deceased was attacked by a pack of wild animals.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this, the horde of photographers and reporters couldn\u2019t contain themselves any longer as they hailed a wave of questions at the now-dazed officer. Winnie lent forward and snapped off the television. She didn\u2019t want to hear about what was going on in London. She was away from that place now and didn\u2019t want to be reminded of it. More than that - she didn\u2019t ever want to go back. Maybe she had done the right thing by coming down to Cornwall with Thaddeus. It couldn\u2019t be any more dangerous than the risks she had taken to survive over the last few years. As she sat and wondered on the life she had led, and how she had never known what dangers each day might have brought, Winnie slowly gazed up where Thaddeus now slept in one of the rooms above her. As her thoughts turned to the man who had offered her a new start, she knew in her heart that she had taken another big risk.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Scaring herself with the news bulletin, and filling her head with paranoid thoughts about Thaddeus's motives for bringing her to his secluded home on the coast, Winnie knew she had to break the destructive train of thoughts which were now gnawing away inside of her. If she didn\u2019t stop listening to them - shut them out - she would go mad for sure. So switching the TV back on, she sat for the next hour and watched Sesame Street, trying to unburden her troubled mind with the company of Big Bird, Bert, and Ernie, Elmo, and the Cookie Monster. It wasn\u2019t a programme she had watched since being very small, and she enjoyed feeling like a little kid again.</p><p>By the end of the show she had counted to ten with the Count and discovered the letter 'E'. Winnie was in a much brighter mood. As the end credits rolled, she switched off the TV again, and passed through the lounge to the kitchen. It was huge, and like most of the other rooms in the house, it was furnished with all the modern appliances which were assured to make your life easier. A wooden table sat in the centre of the room surrounded by four chairs. Winnie crossed to it and found fifty pounds. Under the money, Winnie discovered a note. Scribbled across it were the words, Buy something nice for dinner - Thad.</p><p>Winnie had spent the rest of the day preparing Thaddeus's and her own evening meal. She had found little in the cupboards or freezer, so after cladding herself in a waterproof coat she had found hanging on the back of the kitchen door, she ventured out of the house in search of some shops. On her journey down from the house, she discovered that it occupied land which led down to a jagged-looking coastline and the sea. Looking out over the edge of the cliffs, with icy rain driving into her face, Winnie knew she had been correct the night before. The house was set high on a hill, surrounded by a dense crop of trees. As she looked out at the waves which crashed against the cliffs, she could see St. Ives stretched out before her and the continuing rugged coastline. Although the new world she found herself in was bleak and cold, she couldn\u2019t help but see its beauty. With the wind nagging at her hair, and rain running the length of her face like tears, Winnie followed the narrow coastal path below. In town, she came across a small supermarket. With some of the money Thaddeus had left on the table, she bought their dinner and made her way back up the hill to the house.</p><p>Winnie stood in the kitchen as the night soaked up the remainder of the day. She laid two places at the kitchen table, a knife, fork, and a spoon for each of them. A vase stood in the centre of the table filled with heather, which she had gathered on her return journey from the store. The meal was cooked and warming under the grill. Pleased with herself, she waited for Thaddeus to wake.</p><p>Her wait wasn't a long one as she heard movement from above, then the sound of his footfalls on the stairs. For the first time since arriving at the house, Winnie began to feel nervous. Not of the man himself, but of the little things. Like would they find enough to talk about, and were there going to be any of those agonising drawn-out silences? What would he be like to work for? Would he be an arsehole? She wondered.</p>  </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she heard him approach, she pulled the scarf from her hair, and with a quick flick of her head, sent her auburn hair cascading over her shoulders like liquid copper. She smartened her top and straightened her trousers with the palms of her hands. Winnie stood before the table as Thaddeus entered. He stood in the doorway, his hair more of a mess than she remembered. His eyes shone brilliantly like two glowing coals in his pale face. He wore a white shirt which was open at the throat, revealing just the brief glimpse of his chest. His legs were hidden beneath a pair of faded blue denims, and he wore loafers on his feet. Out of his suit, he looked younger - relaxed somehow.</p><p>Thaddeus smiled and said, \"Good evening, Winnie.\"</p><p>Smiling back, Winnie gestured to a seat. \"I've cooked your dinner, Thaddeus.\" It had been a long time since anyone had trusted her with any kind of responsibility. Okay, so she had only chosen the meal, cooked it, and prepared the table. To most, these were just a series of menial and mundane tasks, but it had given her a sense of self-worth and a glimmer of purpose. It had been a long time since she had felt either of those things.</p> <p>Thaddeus eyed the table curiously as he took his seat. Winnie turned to the grill, and covering her hands with a towel, she plucked two plates out and placed them on the table. She took her seat. Winnie looked across at Thaddeus, who sat staring down at the plate of fish fingers, oven-ready chips, and a mound of baked beans.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\" she asked.</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t realised I had employed you for your sense of humour,\u201d he said, not once taking his eyes off the meal before him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you mean?\u201d Winnie said.</p><p>Ignoring her question, he prodded one of the fish fingers with his slender fingers. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p> <p>Winnie remained silent, her own knife and fork poised over her plate of food. \u201cI don't know what you mean, Thad.....\"</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to be funny?\u201d he asked, cutting over her and fixing her with a dark stare.</p><p>Winnie felt flustered. \"No, Thaddeus, it\u2019s your dinner. I cooked it for you. Is there something wrong?\"</p><p>He scoffed a cynical laugh and pushed the plate back towards her. \u201cI\u2019d say there was something wrong, wouldn't you?\"</p><p>Seeing the rejection of her meal and all her hard work, she, too became annoyed. \"I'm not sure I follow.\u201d</p><p>\"This isn\u2019t a meal,\u201d he sneered.</p> <p>\"It looks like food to me,\u201d she shot back.</p><p>\u201cSurely you don\u2019t expect me to eat this?\u201d he said, looking down at the food again. \u201cThis isn\u2019t food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is where I come from,\u201d Winnie said, trying to hide her growing anger. Then pushing her chair back from the table, she stood up. With tears burning in the corners of her eyes and feeling useless, she looked at Thaddeus and said, \u201cWhen you\u2019re freezing cold, tired, and starving hungry, you would eat anything. I guess you wouldn\u2019t have the faintest idea how that would feel. I know people back in London who would sell themselves for a meal like that tonight.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus looked at her, his face impassive and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; perhaps we should Fed-Ex it to them.\u201d</p><p>Drawing a deep breath, Winnie clenched her hands into fists by her sides. She couldn\u2019t believe what she had just heard him say. With silent tears now streaming down her face, she looked at Thaddeus and said, \u201cYou prick.\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for him to reply, Winnie raced across the kitchen to the door. As if realising how much he had hurt her feelings, he dropped his head in shame. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew you!\u201d Winnie hissed, yanking open the door.</p><p>But before she even knew what was happening, Thaddeus was beside her, his hand gently falling upon her arm.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m truly sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\"Fuck off!\u201d she blurted out through her tears. Thaddeus removed his hand but stayed standing beside her. Then leaning in close to her, he whispered in her ear.</p><p>\"I'm sorry, Winnie. It was thoughtless of me. Please forgive me.\"</p><p>Covering her face with her hands, Winnie bent forward and began to sob. His apology seemed to have sent her into a new flood of tears.</p><p>Then reaching out, Thaddeus placed a hand lightly on her shoulder.</p><p>\"Shhh, Winnie,\" he soothed, \"I'm sorry, I never meant to make you cry.\"</p><p>She continued to sob, and through her tears she began to speak.</p><p>\"Not...not your fault...I'm a thick...bitch....\" Winnie sobbed. Perhaps she was thick? She wondered. After all, he wasn\u2019t paying her two hundred pounds a week to cook fish fingers. Why had Thaddeus found it necessary to be so cruel, though?</p><p>He removed his hand from her shoulder. It felt odd being so close to her. To be standing so close to Winnie was like betraying his wife in some way. The smell of Winnie\u2019s hair and skin stirred feelings in him. It reminded him of what his wife had once smelt like, and he wished now that he had got Winnie a different shampoo. It had been a mistake to buy the same one. However much he wanted to stand next to Winnie and convince her he was sorry for hurting her feelings, Thaddeus had to walk away.</p><p>\u201cYou're not thick, Winnie. You did your best under the circumstances. I should have realised that and been more understanding and less fussy. It won\u2019t happen again,\u201d Thaddeus said, going back to the table.</p><p>Winnie drew her head up. A thin line of snot trailed from her right nostril and she cuffed it away with her sleeve. She realised what she had done and knew that old habits were the hardest to break. She wasn\u2019t on the street anymore. It was more than that. Thaddeus had shown a flicker of cruelness she hadn\u2019t expected. What had she expected? She didn\u2019t know him. She knew nothing about him. Only what he had cared to tell her.</p><p>Staring at him, she spoke softly without any malice in her voice and said, \u201cI know it won\u2019t happen again, Thaddeus, because I'm leaving. You don't need a stupid tramp like me hanging around, cluttering up your beautiful home and cooking you naff meals.\"</p><p>Thaddeus looked at her, and for the second time since she had met him, Winnie saw desperation in his eyes.</p><p>\"Please don't leave, Winnie. We can work things out. Don't go back to London. It isn't safe for you there. You can stay here. I\u2019ll teach you to cook. We'll be good for each other.\"</p><p>Winnie looked upon his face. She felt confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of employing me to cook and clean for you if you\u2019re going to cook all the meals yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I was going to cook all the meals - I said I would teach you,\u201d he tried to smile, but that look of desperation still darkened his eyes.</p><p>\"But what do you get from this deal?\" Winnie asked with a shake of her head.</p><p>\"Like I said in London, Winnie, you take care of my home and put up with my eccentric ways, and I\u2019ll give you a home, a wage,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll even teach you to cook.\u201d</p><p>She began to dry her eyes and said, \u201cIt seems a little strange to me, Thaddeus.\"</p><p>\"What's so strange about it?\u201d he asked with a shrug of his shoulders. \u201cWe're both a little strange if you think about it. We can make a good team. You've got nothing to go back to, and I've got nothing up here all on my own. What do you say?\u201d</p><p>Winnie stared at him for a long moment. Half of her felt unsure of him, but there was another part of him that fascinated her, and she didn\u2019t know why. If he had wanted to have harmed her in some way - wouldn\u2019t he have done it by now? Okay, so he was pissed off with the whole fish finger thing, but she could tell by the size of the house, the material wealth, he was used to finer things. Maybe it was just one of his eccentricities he had warned her about. Besides, what was there to go back to? Getting into an argument about her cooking skills was nothing compared to what she had left behind. She knew in her heart that Ruby Little wouldn\u2019t have thrown away the chance, if she had been offered it.</p><p>Finally, she whispered, \"Okay, I\u2019ll stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Thaddeus whispered and turned away.</p><p>He scraped their uneaten meals into the trash. Placing their empty plates into the dishwasher, he looked back at her and said, \u201cGet a coat. I\u2019m going to take you out for dinner.\u201d</p><p>Winnie was just about to leave the room, when Thaddeus said, \u201cWear the grey coat with the hood.\u201d</p><p>Looking back at him, she cocked an eyebrow and said, \u201cWhy that particular coat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a hood,\u201d he said right back. \u201cIt\u2019s raining. Besides, I like the coat.\u201d</p><p>As she left the kitchen, he plucked a waterproof coat from the hook on the back of the door. Flicking off the kitchen light, he made his way to the front door. He took the silver cigarette case from his trouser pocket and smoked while he waited for Winnie. She hadn\u2019t been gone long when he heard her footfalls on the stairs. Thaddeus looked back to see Winnie step off the bottom stair and into the huge hall. The long, grey coat swished just above her ankles. She almost seemed to float towards Thaddeus who stood by the front door, the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. As she came towards him, Thaddeus noticed that she had daubed the faintest hint of green eye shadow above her eyes, a smudge of blusher on each cheek, and a deep, red lipstick now coated her soft lips.</p><p>He could hardly mask his smile as she stopped before him. \u201cYou look stunning,\u201d he breathed.</p><p>She let out a little laugh of embarrassment and blushed. \u201cI found the makeup on the dressing table in my room,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to use it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUse whatever you like,\u201d he smiled, and pulled the hood of her coat up so it covered the back of her head and the sides of her face.</p><p>\u201cWhose is it?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours,\u201d he said, hooking a long length of her hair out from beneath her hood so it hung against the right side of her face. \u201cPerfect,\u201d he whispered, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cPerfect for what?\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cFor dinner,\u201d he winked back and led her out into the night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The small coastal town of St. Ives was quiet during the winter months. There weren't any tourists and they wouldn\u2019t arrive until Easter, when all the little tea shops, ice cream parlours, and shell shops would open, eagerly awaiting the rush. Tonight was cold, and the rain drove into them as they walked huddled together down the meandering cobbled streets to the harbour. The smell of the sea was strong as it wafted on the wind and salted their lips. Boat rigging whipped vigorously against the masts of the boats moored in the harbour.</p><p>They came across the restaurant that Thaddeus had eaten in twice before since coming to live in the town. It was aptly named the Light House. On entering, their wet coats were taken from them, and they were ushered to a quiet table for two at the rear of the eating area. Thaddeus requested that Winnie be seated with her back to the restaurant window, which looked out onto the harbour. Their cutlery and wine glasses twinkled with a warm orange brilliance from an open fire that roared and spat a few feet from them. Thaddeus ordered a bottle of white wine, while Winnie gazed in awe about the restaurant.</p> <p>\"What are you having, Thaddeus?\" she asked over the sound of the snapping wood in the hearth.</p><p>He rested his hands beneath his chin and spoke, \"You were cooking dinner tonight, so you can choose.\"</p><p>She looked down at the menu and said, \u201cI wouldn't know where to start. You choose.\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her across the table. \u201cLet me see,\u201d he said reading the menu.</p><p>Before long, the waiter had arrived beside them.</p> <p>\"We would like two avocados for starters and for our main course, chicken stuffed with mushrooms, a side order of roast beef, and a mixture of vegetables.\"</p><p>Thaddeus looked up at the ruddy-faced waiter and smiled. \"Thank you.\"</p><p>\"Very good, sir,\" the waiter nodded and disappeared into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cBetter than those fish fingers, huh?\u201d Winnie smiled at him.</p><p>But it was as if Thaddeus hadn\u2019t heard her. He was suddenly staring over her right shoulder and out of the window and onto the street outside. It was as if someone or something had grabbed his attention.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay?\u201d Winnie asked.</p> <p>As if being snapped out of a dream, he looked at Winnie and said, \u201cEverything is just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat were you looking at?\u201d she quizzed him.</p><p>\u201cIt was nothing,\u201d he said back.</p><p>Thaddeus sat and watched the burning embers of the fire cast their golden reflections in her copper hair. The silky curls looked as if they were alight. Then a sudden urge came over him to reach out and lose his hands in its soft texture, to soak up its seething light through his fingertips. He stifled the temptation and spoke to her.</p><p>\"So if you don\u2019t mind me asking, where is your family? Do you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d</p><p>She looked squarely at him. \u201cI\u2019ve never known my father. He did a bunk before I was even born. My mum was only sixteen herself when she fell pregnant with me. I guess that\u2019s why she gave me up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGave you up?\u201d Thaddeus asked. \u201cAdoption, you mean?\u201d</p><p>Winnie could sense what she believed to be genuine concern in his voice for her.</p> <p>\"My mother had an older sister and she dumped me on her when I was barely two years old,\u201d Winnie explained. \u201cBut my auntie didn\u2019t really want me. She had three kids of her own. Her husband was hardly ever around. So she kicked me out into the care of the local authorities. I was bounced from one family to the next. Missed lots of school and stuff like that. When I was thirteen, I ended up living with this family called the Martins. The dad was a real pig, he made me unhappy. So I ran away when I was fourteen. Got picked up a few times by the cops and ended up back in care, but I never hung around for long. In the end, the cops stopped looking for me. They had more important stuff to deal with, right?\u201d</p><p>The waiter reappeared and opened the bottle of wine. Thaddeus seemed annoyed by the interruption. The waiter poured half a glass for Thaddeus.</p><p>\"Would you like to taste, sir?\"</p><p>Thaddeus kept his eye on Winnie and just waved his hand at the waiter, who acknowledged this by saying, \"Very good, sir.\u201d He poured a glass for Winnie, placed the bottle on the table, and left.</p><p>\"Where do you come from?\" Thaddeus inquired of her.</p><p>\"All over the place,\u201d she half-smiled. Then looking up at Thaddeus, she said, \u201cI haven\u2019t always been homeless since running away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow come?\u201d Thaddeus asked, taking a sip of wine.</p><p>\"When I was about fifteen, I was with this guy called Simon. He was older than me - not by much - but enough. Old enough for the council to pay his rent, so he had his own place. He was really good to me at first. You know, like real thoughtful and understanding,\u201d she said. \u201cI stopped wanting to run away because he made me feel special inside. For the first time, I felt needed.\u201d</p><p>\"What went wrong?\" Thaddeus asked, now regretting how he had patronised Winnie earlier that evening.</p><p>\"I guess he knew how much I needed him and he kinda took advantage of the fact,\u201d Winnie explained. \u201cI think he got to thinking that he could treat me however he wanted, because I needed him so much. You know, he thought because I didn't have much else going for me, I'd let him get away with whatever he wanted.\"</p><p>\"Did he mistreat you?\"</p><p>\"No, not really,\u201d she said, and briefly looked away.</p><p>In that moment Thaddeus knew that this Simon had hurt her and probably badly, but he didn\u2019t want to push her into telling him something that she was uncomfortable talking about.</p><p>\u201cHe never laid a finger on me,\u201d Winnie insisted as if being able to read Thaddeus\u2019s thoughts. \u201cHe knew I was insecure, and he played on that. To tell you the truth, Thaddeus, I would have preferred a good thump. At least you know where you stand, but when you\u2019ve got someone playing with your heart all the time, boosting you up one minute and knocking you down the next, you never know where you stand. Believe me, that hurt a lot more than a good thump.\"</p><p>Thaddeus sipped at his wine as the waiter reappeared and placed their starter before them. The waiter was gone as quickly as he had arrived. Thaddeus and Winnie tucked into their avocados.</p><p>\"How did he knock you down then?\" he pushed ever so carefully.</p><p>\"Bit by bit, he ate away at my confidence by sleeping with other women. He would tell me about them - how much better they were than me. He wanted me to try stuff that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with. My confidence got more and more knocked, and each day I continued to stay with him, I felt that little bit less special.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus pushed his empty plate away and took to his wine again. Winnie continued to eat.</p><p>\"So what did you do about this Simon?\" he asked her.</p><p>Winnie chewed over her last mouthful, and then continued her story. \u201cI did what I know best, and ran. I went back to London. At first I kidded myself that I would only stay a day or two. I fooled myself into believing that I would find work somehow. One day leads into another, then into weeks and months. You get dirtier; the tiredness drains you along with the hunger and the sleepless nights. Then the despair sets in. You end up staying - you become trapped.\u201d</p><p>Their empty starter plates were whisked away and their main course was laid before them. Curls of steam rose up off the chicken\u2019s golden and crisp meat, and the beef looked almost raw as it sat in a pool of its own juices, red with blood. The vegetables were in a side dish and they looked soft and bright in colour. Thaddeus picked up a large knife and began to cut away at the chicken. The knife slipped through its succulent body as easily as cutting butter. He laid several thick slices on Winnie's plate, as she in turn heaped a spoonful of vegetables onto Thaddeus's plate and then her own. Thaddeus helped himself to a large portion of the chicken, tearing both its legs off and placing them on his plate alongside a thick slice of the bloody beef. They both sat and forked the food into their mouths.</p><p>Thaddeus watched her while she ate, and something she had said played over and over in his mind. Winnie had said that what she did best was run - that\u2019s all she knew what to do. She had run from her aunt, run from the care homes, run from Simon to London, and had now run away from there to be with him. Winnie never seemed to hang around for too long and he knew that he would need her to stay a while longer - a lot longer. Thaddeus found himself captivated by her energy, her anger, the fire that seemed to burn brightly inside of her. She was alive and she wasn't stupid. He hadn\u2019t expected that - but he liked it. Those feelings he would have to bury somewhere deep inside. He couldn\u2019t afford to let himself care about her.</p><p>Winnie looked at Thaddeus, the crossed words they\u2019d had back at the house now seemed like a far-off memory. Nobody had ever bothered to sit and listen to her before. Nobody had ever cared enough. Thaddeus was already on his second helping of chicken when he noticed Winnie watching him over the rim of her glass as she sipped her wine. \"What about you, Thaddeus?\"</p><p>He looked straight at her as he refilled her glass again and said, \"What about me?\"</p><p>\u201cTell me about your life,\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned and looked into the fire. His voice was soft, almost a whisper. \u201cI wouldn't know where to start, Winnie.\"</p><p>The world swam lazily back and forth as the wine relaxed her and strengthened her confidence. \u201cHow about at the beginning,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thaddeus looked away from the fire and back at Winnie. \u201cThe beginning,\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cLife is full of beginnings and endings. I wouldn\u2019t know which one too chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart from the day you met your wife,\u201d Winnie found the confidence to ask him. \u201cYou said you knew you loved her from the very first moment you saw her. I\u2019d like to hear about that. It sounds romantic.\u201d</p><p>Again, Thaddeus looked away and said, \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about that. I still find the death of my wife hard to come to terms with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Winnie whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to...\u201d</p><p>\"Let\u2019s go home,\u201d he said, suddenly standing. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late and I have work to do.\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held out his hand and Winnie took hold of it. She swayed slightly and Thaddeus steadied her. The wine had clouded her mind, and Winnie failed to notice that there wasn't any cut on Thaddeus's hand. If she had noticed this, Winnie might have wondered where the blood had come from, the blood which had stained her top on the train as she ran away with Thaddeus to his home in Cornwall.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>The rain had started to ease a little, but it was cold, and Winnie pulled her coat tight about herself. With the hood pulled over her head, she peered beneath it and up at the night sky, which was heavy with clouds. The cold night air did little to clear the fog in her mind and she wished now that she had drunk just a little less wine. Thaddeus walked beside her, and every time she stumbled or lost her footing on the uneven dirt road which led up the hill, he would gently take her arm.</p> <p>Cold and wet, Winnie glanced at him and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you have a car, Thaddeus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, can you drive?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cNeither can I,\u201d he smiled back. \u201cI\u2019ve never had the need for a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said thoughtfully, but her head felt too woozy to think about it very much.</p> <p>They walked in silence until they reached the gate in the wall that surrounded Thaddeus\u2019s huge home. They cut through the crop of trees, the sound of rain drumming against the leaves overhead. Stepping out from amongst the trees, a single shaft of bluey-white moonlight had broken through the clouds and made a pool of light on the ground before the house. Winnie looked up and could see a half moon peering around the edge of a bank of clouds.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d she heard Thaddeus whisper.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed, the rain spattering her upturned face.</p><p>\u201cThe moonlight makes you look very beautiful,\u201d Thaddeus suddenly said.</p><p>\u201cAw, you\u2019re just saying that,\u201d Winnie giggled, looking at him. There was a part of her that so much wanted what he said to be true. She had never been told that before by anyone. Although it made her feel slightly uneasy coming from a man she hardly knew, she liked hearing those words. She liked the way he was looking at her.</p><p>Reaching out with his hand, Thaddeus brushed the damp lengths of hair from her cheeks, as if wanting to see more of her face. In the moonlight she truly did look beautiful, he thought, and he tried to push those feelings away. The moonlight made her look like china, fragile and breakable.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Winnie asked, slowly pulling his hand away from her face. Even through the fogginess of her mind, she could see that his look of wonder at her had changed to one of sadness - remorse.</p><p>\u201cWait here,\u201d he said, turning and heading towards the house.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she called out, now standing alone in the shaft of blue moonlight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to get my camera,\u201d he called out as he fumbled for his door keys in his coat pocket. \u201cI want to take a photo of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s raining!\u201d she gasped, not knowing whether she should be flattered by his behaviour or not. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time anyone had ever wanted to take a picture of her. \u201cCan\u2019t it wait until tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>But Thaddeus had gone, disappearing inside the house.</p><p>Winnie stood alone in the moonlight and rain. Although she was kind of pleased that Thaddeus wanted to take a picture of her, she hoped he would hurry up. She felt cold and wet through. Not only that, she felt ridiculous standing alone, with her hood up, her hair all bedraggled and plastered to the sides of her face. Winnie doubted that she looked very beautiful at all. With her self-esteem at its usual low, she wondered if perhaps he wasn\u2019t taking the piss - having a laugh at her expense.</p><p>So wanting to make sure that she looked her best, she positioned herself so she could see her reflection in one of the tall bay windows set into the front of the house.</p> <p>With her fingers almost numb with cold, she combed them through the wispy lengths of hair that hung limply against her cheeks. She turned quickly sideways, then front again, checking out her profile. The wind suddenly picked up, blowing a flurry of leaves from beneath the trees behind her. There was a snapping noise, like feet treading over fallen twigs. Winnie spun around and peered into the slices of darkness between the black and knotted tree trunks. The sound came again.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d she gasped. \u201cIs there anyone there?\u201d</p><p>The noise stopped, or was it drowned out by another sudden gust of wind? A shower of sodden leaves scattered into the air again, and then settled as the wind dropped. Winnie peered into the darkness once more, then turned back to face the window, and then screamed.</p><p>Reflected back in the window, she could see three pale faces looming out of the darkness behind her. With her heart in her throat, she turned again, but the faces were now gone. Her heart raced so fast and loud, she could hear it beating in her ears. The wind suddenly howled all around her, blowing her hair out from beneath her hood and covering her face. She closed her eyes against the wind, her hair, and the driving rain, and in that moment of darkness, she heard voices.</p><p>Snapping open her eyes again, and clawing her hair from her face, the wind wrapped itself around Winnie like a cold, wet blanket and almost seemed to whisper in her ears.</p><p>Come home...the wind cried as it circled her.</p><p>Come home...he will kill you...just like the others...the wind whispered.</p><p>Winnie threw her hands over her ears, closing her eyes against the leaves that now whipped violently around her as if she were trapped in a raging storm. Then, she felt her hands being pulled free from over her ears.</p><p>\u201cWinnie!\u201d a voice shouted.</p><p>This time it wasn\u2019t a voice carried on the wind that she heard. Opening her eyes, Winnie stared into Thaddeus\u2019s pale face.</p><p>\u201cWinnie!\u201d he shouted, taking her by the shoulders and gently shaking her as if waking her from a dream.</p><p>\u201cThere were faces,\u201d she breathed, then glanced back over her shoulder at the treeline.</p><p>\u201cFaces?\u201d Thaddeus asked. \u201cWhat faces? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were staring out of the woods at me,\u201d she murmured, feeling confused and disorientated. \u201cThere were voices, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoices?\u201d Thaddeus said, sounding evermore confused.</p><p>\u201cIt was like they were talking to me,\u201d she said, and her lower lip trembled as she stared into the darkness that separated the trees.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear anything,\u201d Thaddeus said, and seeing that she was trembling, he pulled her close.</p><p>\u201cYou were inside,\u201d she tried to explain. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have heard them because of the wind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were these faces?\u201d Thaddeus quizzed her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she said, a deep frown forming across her brow. \u201cI saw them reflected in the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReflected in the window,\u201d he frowned back at her. Then a half-smile tugged at the corners of his mouth. \u201cAre you sure it wasn\u2019t just the moonlight distorting your own reflection back at you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Winnie whispered, now starting to feel confused, a sense of self-doubt taking hold of her. \u201cWhat about the voices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe wind perhaps?\u201d he said, looking at her. \u201cWe\u2019re high up here. The wind can sound like a million different things as it cuts across the fields and rages against the cliff faces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Winnie asked him, a part of her hoping that what he said was true.</p><p>\u201cSure it does,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, when the wind blows really hard, you couldn\u2019t be blamed for mistaking it for a giant pack of wolves racing up the hillside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they sounded so real,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>Then, leading her gently out of the shaft of moonlight, the wind and the rain, they headed towards the house. \u201cI think you had a little too much to drink tonight,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ll laugh about this in the morning.\u201d</p><p>They reached the open front door, and looking back at the pool of moonlight, Winnie whispered, \u201cYou never took that picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t find my camera,\u201d he smiled back at her, and closed the door.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Thaddeus took their wet coats and hung them up to dry in the kitchen. He made them both a cup of sweet black coffee and Winnie sat at the kitchen table. Her head still felt a little groggy as she tried to make sense of what she had really seen outside in the storm. Her cheeks glowed scarlet from where she had been left waiting outside in the cold. Winnie sat and shivered before him, as Thaddeus pushed a mug of coffee towards her.</p><p>\"Here, drink this. It\u2019ll warm you up.\"</p><p>Thaddeus knew that Winnie was still a little tipsy from the wine, but he wanted to give her a list of instructions for tomorrow so that there wouldn\u2019t be any more mistakes and embarrassments.</p><p>He sat opposite her and said, \"Winnie, tomorrow morning, a bundle of foreign newspapers will be delivered. They arrive once a week on a Thursday morning.\"</p><p>She took a sip of her coffee, and then said, \"Why do you have foreign newspapers delivered? What's wrong with the English ones?\"</p><p>Thaddeus smiled. \u201cI have English newspapers delivered as well, but I like to keep abreast of what's happening all over the world.\"</p><p>Winnie started to relax a little now that she was in the warmth beneath the glow of the kitchen lighting, the feelings of fear she had felt outside were now slowly ebbing away, like the broken pieces of a nightmare at dawn. With the mug of coffee warming her hands, Winnie looked with surprise across the table at Thaddeus and said, \"You mean you can read and understand loads of different languages? What countries do these newspapers come from?\"</p><p>Thaddeus found her disbelief and wonderment a little amusing. \"Yes, I can speak many different languages. The papers I have delivered are mainly European, but I also have papers from America, Australia, Japan, China, and a few more besides.\"</p><p>Winnie sat up in her seat, eyes wide with interest. \"You can speak and read in Japanese?\"</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\"I don't believe it!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Winnie, would I lie to you?\u201d and his eyes twinkled.</p><p>\u201cGo on then, prove it. Say something in Japanese,\u201d she egged him on.</p><p>He laughed a little again and met her gaze. \"You embarrass me, Winnie; not now, maybe another time. Let us master the English language first, and then I will teach you another.\"</p> <p>Winnie frowned, but she didn't want to press the issue. She would have loved to have heard him say just a few words in another language, to hear his soft voice in another tongue. Then looking at him, she said, \u201cSo what\u2019s wrong with my English?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I remember you telling me while you ate pasta the other night, that your reading and writing wasn\u2019t great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hardly at school,\u201d she said, trying to excuse herself.</p><p>\u201cNo matter,\u201d Thaddeus said. \u201cThat was in the past. This is a new beginning. I have plenty of books. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be able to find one that you\u2019ll enjoy reading.\u201d Then, changing the subject, he said, \"When the papers come, just take them in for me and leave them in the hallway. Could you also give the place a bit of a clean? I haven't touched it in over a week.\"</p><p>Winnie nodded and said, \"Sure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs for shopping, buy meats: pork, lamb, steak, and liver. Get some fresh vegetables, bread, milk, fruit, and whatever else you fancy.\"</p><p>\"But what do you want me to cook?\"</p><p>\"Nothing,\u201d he said with a shake of his head. \u201cI'm going to teach you to cook, remember? When I wake tomorrow evening, we shall cook together. You just get the food.\"</p><p>Winnie finished her coffee, and now just wanting to get some sleep, she said, \"Okay, anything else?\"</p><p>\"Yes, the clothes in your bedroom \u2013 treat them as your own. Wear whatever you want, when you want. They used to be my wife\u2019s.\"</p><p>\"Oh, I couldn't. I wouldn't feel....\" Winnie started to protest.</p> <p>\"She wouldn't have minded. I know she would have wanted you to have them.\"</p><p>\"But...\u201d Winnie started up again.</p><p>Before she had the chance to finish what it was she had wanted to say, Thaddeus got up from his seat and said, \"She really wouldn't have minded.\"</p><p>He crossed to the kitchen door, paused, and turned to face her, \"Thank you for a wonderful evening, Winnie, your company has been enchanting. I shall see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He turned to go through the door as Winnie called after him, \"What was her name?\"</p><p>Thaddeus stopped in midstride. He paused for what seemed an eternity, and then turned to face her.</p><p>\"Frances,\" he said, looking down at the floor.</p><p>\"What did she look like?\" Winnie dared to ask, remembering how he had avoided the subject earlier that evening.</p> <p>Slowly, Thaddeus raised his head and fixed her sleepy eyes with his own cool, dark stare, then answered her question. \"Strangely enough, Frances looked a lot like you,\u201d he said.</p><p>He turned on his heels and left the kitchen for his room high above, where, as far as Winnie knew, he stayed until the following evening.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cYou are truly beautiful,\u201d he whispered in her ear, using one hand to unzip her dress.</p><p>\u201cI bet you always say that,\u201d the girl giggled at the touch of his breath against her neck.</p><p>He made no reply as he slowly pulled the dress down over her shoulders, releasing her ample breasts. Swaying slightly, she helped him pull her dress and panties down over her hips and thighs, where they made a whispering sound against her flesh. He guided her away from the discarded clothing, and looked at her in the moonlight; it seemed to slice her living room in two.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful,\u201d he said, looking at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to be quiet, or you\u2019ll wake the baby,\u201d she giggled again, pointing upwards.</p><p>Ignoring her, he looked at how her white skin glimmered like marble in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cSo much flesh,\u201d he mused.</p><p>\u201cHey, you cheeky bastard,\u201d she half-smiled, the strong smell of wine on her breath. \u201cWhat are you saying, that I\u2019m fat?\u201d And she crossed her arms over her breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he smiled at her, gently pulling her arms away again. From the moment he had seen her sitting in the corner of the pub, with the wind and the rain roaring outside and the crash of the waves against the quay, he knew she would be the one. Again, it had all been far too easy for him. A few drinks, the right words, and a little harmless flirting. That was all it took. He was beautiful too, he knew that and so did they. Most women and even a few men turned their heads and looked twice when they first saw him. He wasn\u2019t interested in them. He liked the girls who wouldn\u2019t look at him, who wouldn\u2019t match his stare because they believed they weren\u2019t worthy. If he were to be honest - they weren\u2019t. Not many were.</p><p>But they went with him easily, without a fight, because they were needy, lonely, or both. The girl who stood before him was an ideal candidate. As she had knocked back the drinks he had placed before her, she had groaned on and on about how the father of her child had left her, how lonely she was, how unattractive she felt, and on and on and on. He wasn\u2019t interested in any of that shit. He was only interested in satisfying the hunger that burnt inside of him. As he sat and drank, the more she talked. Christ, she made her life sound so fucking depressing, he honestly began to wonder if she wouldn\u2019t be better off dead after all. She talked about how she only earnt minimum wage at the local store, and it wasn\u2019t even enough to pay for childcare. How since she was the only one of her friends who had become a mum, they didn\u2019t understand. They didn\u2019t want to sit in of a night - they wanted to be out having fun and not wiping a baby\u2019s arse. Even the friend she had planned to meet tonight had failed to show up. On and on and on she went. He just sat and smiled, pretending to listen intently, telling her that he couldn\u2019t understand why such an attractive young woman was being so hard on herself, though all the while his innards seethed, and his blood felt like it was boiling in his veins as the hunger gnawed away at him.</p><p>Then when he thought he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, and that he might just rip her fucking throat out in the bar and be done with it, she staggered to her feet, giggling that she hadn\u2019t meant to be out so long as she had left her baby asleep in his cot. Then, just like he knew she would, the girl looked down at him and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got a bottle of wine in the fridge at home, if you fancy another?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he had smiled at her.</p><p>She pushed open the front door and stumbled into the hallway, kicking her heels off as she went. He closed the front door behind her, but not tight. He always left the door open just an inch so the others could join him.</p><p>Now he took her in his arms and steadied her.</p><p>\u201cWe can do it on the sofa if you like,\u201d she said, as he leant in close and kissed her neck.</p><p>He could smell her skin and cheap perfume. Beneath it, he could smell what he had really come for and it pulsed through her veins in a rush. He gripped her left breast with his hand, and she gasped. He could feel her heart thumping just beneath his fist, and his, matched its frantic pace.</p><p>\u201cHow about on the floor?\u201d she slurred in his ear, taking his hand that still cupped her breast and guided him downwards.</p><p>\u201cThe floor would be good,\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>She kicked aside kiddie toys, which cluttered the floor of the living room, and lay on her back. Then kneeling over her, he gripped her wrists and pinned her to the floor.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be like that, is it?\u201d she squirmed with a rush of excitement beneath him. Then she froze and peered over his shoulder as she heard a sound in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think there is someone else in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t worry about them,\u201d he grinned into her face. \u201cThey are just my friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d she said, looking back up into his face. It wasn\u2019t the beautifully good-looking face that had turned her on so much before. Those wonderful brown eyes were now deep black holes, and his full lips were now stretched open across his face, disappearing behind his ears. In the moonlight, which sliced through the window, the girl at first thought he had somehow managed to put on one of those freaky-looking clown masks. As he spoke, his lips rolled back, revealing a set of long, jagged teeth.</p><p>\u201cGet off me!\u201d she screeched, bucking her hips in an attempt to throw him clear of her. He was too strong and pinned her effortlessly to the floor. Then, with her eyes bulging, she glanced over his shoulder to see two others enter the living room \u2013 one male, the other female. At first glance, the girl thought them both to be as beautiful as the man had once been, but as they stepped into the moonlight, she screamed at the sight of their ragged mouths, which looked as if they had split their faces in two.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she begged softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they all say,\u201d the man pinning her to the floor whispered, his lips spreading too wide across his face.</p><p>She kicked wildly out with her legs, but just like her arms, her legs became pinned to the floor by the female and male.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d she struggled against them, as the female holding her leg drew her tongue along the outside of the girl\u2019s thigh, as if tasting her.</p><p>Then, from above, a different kind of cry cut through the night \u2013 the sound of a baby. The girl glanced up at the ceiling and so did the others.</p><p>She saw the delight in their sunken black eyes and sobbed, \u201cPlease don\u2019t hurt my baby. Please...I won\u2019t tell...\u201d but the last of her sentence became nothing more than a series of undecipherable gurgles and spluttering\u2019s, as the vampire lunged forward and greedily ripped out her throat.</p><p>The sound of their ravenous feeding drowned out the sound of the baby\u2019s cries for a while, but not for long.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Winnie lay on her bed, arms stretched out on either side of her. She was cold, wearing only a pair of panties and a bra. Her eyes were closed and she didn\u2019t need to open them to know that her room was in complete darkness. Her heart raced behind her narrow chest and her mind swam sickly from side to side. She wished again that she hadn\u2019t drunk so much. She reached for the covers, then stopped. There was a noise - she was sure of it, like someone moving in her room. She wanted to open her eyes but couldn\u2019t. It was like they were being held shut by two invisible thumbs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then she felt the cool touch of a hand on her ankle. A man\u2019s hand. Strong. Moving like the legs of a giant spider, she could feel fingers slowly traveling up her leg. They worked slowly, caressing her calf muscle, stroking and pressing her inner thigh. She reached out with her hand, to brush it away but there was no one there.</p><p>Open your eyes, she cursed herself. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>The room fell silent again. The only sound she could hear was her own heart thumping in her ears. She felt scared but didn't want to yell out, in case she disturbed Thaddeus.</p> <p>Then, she felt those fingers again as they passed over her stomach and worked their way up between her breasts. Winnie reached out again but still couldn't find anybody there.</p><p>Open your eyes, the voice inside urged her. She couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t. She was no longer sure. Then she felt the warm wetness of lips covering her own.</p><p>She felt scared now, but kind of excited, too. How was that possible? She wondered behind her closed eyelids. The mouth worked its way up her throat and nicked at her fair skin. She moaned in pain, and then the mouth covered hers again. A tongue darted into her mouth and she kissed back. Then for the first time, she could feel the whole of his body pressing down over hers. Winnie reached out with her hands for him, wanting him now, yet hating him. She could feel no one there.</p><p>The mouth broke away from hers and she threw open her eyes and although the room was in complete darkness, his face shone palely down into hers. She looked up at Thaddeus. His eyes bore right into hers and he smiled...</p><p>...Winnie sat bolt upright in bed, her whole body covered in a sticky sweat. She sucked frantic mouthfuls of air into her lungs as she fought to breathe. With her heart racing, she peered about her room as the early morning sun streamed through the windows in thin ribbons of light. Her head ached from the alcohol she had drunk the night before. Winnie sat and shivered as the last fragments of her dream ebbed away. She felt troubled by her dream. Not because it had scared her - but it had felt so real. Not just the feel of his touch, but the feelings she had felt while kissing him.</p> <p>Swinging her legs over the side of the bed, Winnie tried to push the last remaining shards of the dream away, which still lingered on in the furthest corners of her mind. Why had she dreamt of them together like that? She thought, as she padded over to the bathroom. Sure, Thaddeus was hot, with his messy hair, stubble, and dark brown eyes, but to have had such a vivid dream...what did that mean? As she turned on the taps and watched the hot water slosh into the bath, Winnie feared that just like she had tried to push him away in her dream, where she had secretly wanted him, she didn\u2019t want those feelings to become a reality.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t allow that to happen,\u201d she whispered to herself. \u201cI won\u2019t let it happen.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t come to Cornwall to settle down, to fall in love and live happily ever after. She didn\u2019t believe in fairy tales. Winnie only wanted to stay long enough to earn the money to pay rent on a place of her own. She wanted her own life \u2013 not somebody else\u2019s.</p><p>Winnie turned off the taps, stripped, and climbed into the bath. As she sunk beneath the water, she warned herself not to become too comfortable at the mansion, form any attachments, or grow roots. Roots kept you in one place. They stopped you from running away if you wanted or needed to. She closed her eyes and let the water wash over her.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Winnie stood in fresh panties and a bra, and worked her way through the clothes in the closets. All of the clothes were beautifully made. She went through each dress, skirt, top, trousers, and jeans, admiring their expensive quality. Although most of the clothes varied in style and fashion, most of them were coloured black, scarlet, violet, cream, or pale green. She paused over a couple of the garments and held them up to herself; they seemed to fit perfectly. Winnie pulled open the drawers in the base of the closet and found neat rows of shoes, trainers, and boots. She let her fingers dance over their suede and leather forms and as she did, Winnie noticed something which struck her as being very strange.</p> <p>None of the shoes had ever been worn. She turned a couple of pairs over in her hands and studied each sole. They were in perfect condition. There wasn't one with a worn-down heel or scuffed toe in the whole collection. Winnie stood for a moment, hands on hips, and then turned back to the clothes. She pulled out different garments at random and searched their linings. To her amazement, all the clothing had the price tags still firmly fixed in place. Winnie found it a little curious but was also slightly relieved that none of the clothes had been worn. She hadn't relished the idea of wearing the clothes of a dead woman.</p><p>Shrugging to herself, she removed a sweater and a pair of jeans and pulled off the price tags. Dressed, she picked out a pair of trainers and slipped them on her feet. They fitted perfectly. Winnie closed the closet door and made her way downstairs. The kitchen clock read a quarter past nine as she filled the kettle and set about making herself some breakfast. The kettle bubbled away in the corner as she crossed to the window and peered out at the day before her. It was overcast again, but dry. She looked out across the patchwork of fields that spread away from the rear of the house and down to the sea. The house was so quiet, that if she listened really carefully, the faint sound of the waves crashing against the cliffs could be heard. Winnie had never known such silence before, and she thought back to the sounds she had heard in the wind as she had stood in the moonlight.</p><p>The kettle clicked off behind her, breaking the silence. She jumped at the sudden sound. Not wanting to dwell on what she thought she had seen and heard in the moonlight for fear of freaking herself out again, Winnie spied an iPod on the side and switched it on. Thumbing through the tracks, she noted that Thaddeus liked to listen to anything from Debussy to Maroon Five. Eventually, Winnie selected from the tracks, Dance Again by Jennifer Lopez. She kept the music low for fear of disturbing Thaddeus.</p><p>Swishing her butt from side to side to the music, Winnie fixed herself a steaming mug of coffee and a couple of slices of heavily buttered toast. When given the chance, she only ever toasted her bread on one side beneath a grill, because she loved the way the butter melted on its warm, golden surface and dripped through, making the bread all soft and doughy.</p><p>She finished her breakfast, placed her plate and mug in the sink, plucked the iPod from its dock, and put on the hooded coat Thaddeus had told her to wear the night before. With the money that Thaddeus had left on the table for her, she went into the hall. Just as she reached up on tiptoe to release the bolt that fastened the wide front doors shut, she noticed that the door to the lounge was open. Stepping away from the front door, Winnie peered into the lounge. Perhaps Thaddeus had risen early or had yet to go to bed.</p><p>\u201cThaddeus?\u201d she called out.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then, as she stood in the open doorway, Winnie noticed that one of the comfy-looking armchairs had been moved, so it sat side on before one of the giant bay windows. Hanging over the back of the chair was a pretty violet top and a long, black skirt. Winnie stepped into the room and approached the chair. As she drew nearer, she could see that a book had been left perched on the arm of the chair. Picking it up, she turned it over in her hands and read the title.</p> <p>\u201cThe Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe,\u201d she read aloud.</p><p>Then, as she was about to place the book back on the arm of the chair, a folded piece of paper slipped from between the pages of the book and fluttered to the floor. Winnie picked it up, unfolded it, and read what was scrawled across it.</p><p>Winnie,</p><p>I hope you don\u2019t think my choice of book is a little too young for you. I know you said that you aren\u2019t the best reader in the world, and I appreciate that you are eighteen years old, but this book is enjoyed by young and old alike. It truly is a magical story.</p><p>If you could kindly read from the book at dusk, while sitting in this chair by the window and wearing the clothes that I have left out for you, I would be very grateful.</p><p>I know that this may seem like a rather odd request, but I did warn you I had some little eccentricities.</p><p>Thank You,</p><p>Thad</p><p>Winnie read the note twice over, just in case her reading abilities were worse than she first thought and had misread the note left by Thaddeus.</p><p>After the second read, she folded the piece of paper in half again, and slid it back between the pages of the book.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to be kidding me,\u201d she sighed aloud. \u201cWhat a freaking weirdo!\u201d</p><p>She picked up the violet top and held it against her. Just like all the other clothing she had found, it looked like it would fit perfectly. Sighing, and not knowing what reason Thaddeus could have for wanting her to wear the clothes while sitting and reading the book, she laid the top over the back of the chair and left the room. She released the bolt and swung open the heavy front door. A pile of newspapers, as Thaddeus had mentioned, sat on the front step. They had been bound together with a length of white string. She hoisted them up, leaning to one side due to their sheer weight, and placed them in the hall as Thaddeus had requested. She swung the door shut behind her and made her way down into town.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Although the sun hung high in the sky like a copper disc, the air was fresh and it pinched her face. Winnie thrust her hands into her coat pockets, and plumes of wispy breath escaped through her mouth. She teetered every now and then on the rough ground, and she wished silently to herself for a little bit of tarmac. She wasn\u2019t used to the country life \u2013 not yet. Grey stone walls constructed crudely out of old rock and slate stood on either side of her. The land was broken up by these walls, and cut the fields up into uneven squares. The fields were a patchwork of different colours. Some green with rich, unkempt grass, others yellow-filled with wild gorse and several, a deep mauve with flowering heather. Winnie consumed all its rugged beauty and felt truly free at last.</p><p>Part of Winnie was glad that she had come to Cornwall with Thaddeus, but there was another part of her that told her she had made a mistake. It was like a little voice inside of her that just wouldn\u2019t stop whispering. The note which Thaddeus had left for her inside the book hadn\u2019t done anything to gag that voice. Why did he want her to sit in that particular chair, wearing those clothes, and reading that book? But the little voice was telling her it had something to do with Frances - Thaddeus\u2019s dead wife. Winnie knew that Thaddeus didn\u2019t want to speak about Frances, for every time she had raised the subject, he carefully steered her in another direction. She remembered Thaddeus telling her that she looked like his wife in some way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That\u2019s it! Winnie thought to herself, as if tiny pieces of a puzzle had been slotted into place. Gooseflesh prickled her back. The clothes! His dead wife\u2019s clothes! Her coat, shoes, everything. He had coaxed her up to his house because she resembled Frances in some way, and by making her wear her clothes, Thaddeus was pretending that she was still alive \u2013 still with him.</p><p>That was kind of sick, right? Winnie thought. If not sick - creepy. She knew then why Thaddeus had left instructions for her to sit in that chair, wearing those clothes, and reading that book, because that\u2019s where Frances probably would have sat and read. He wanted to relive that moment of coming down the stairs and seeing his beloved Frances sitting quietly in the lounge, reading. But Winnie didn\u2019t want to be Frances and the whole idea of playing the role of a dead woman so Thaddeus didn\u2019t have to let go of his past, made her feel angry. She felt tricked by him. Housekeeper, my arse! She thought. The whole cooking thing, cleaning, washing and ironing his clothes - he didn\u2019t want a housekeeper \u2013 Thaddeus wanted a wife! He wanted Frances back. What would he expect her to do next for him? Sleep with him? And the thought made Winnie feel scared. Not of him, but what he might be expecting from her next.</p><p>Winnie didn\u2019t feel that Thaddeus was a bad man \u2013 she had been around plenty of those in the past to know what they were all about. She was beginning to wonder if Thaddeus wasn\u2019t a little crazy. Not dangerous crazy, but messed-up crazy, over the death of his wife. Shouldn\u2019t Thaddeus be coming to terms in some small way with his loss? After all, Thaddeus had told Winnie she had died about a year ago. Winnie understood loss, and she thought of her friend, Ruby Little. She had dealt with her death by trying not to think about Ruby; she had run away from that. Thaddeus hadn\u2019t, he seemed to be trapped, whereas Winnie had escaped. Either way, she guessed that neither Thaddeus nor she had dealt with their loss. So she couldn\u2019t really blame him for what he was trying to do. Winnie decided that she would do as he had requested, just this once, and take the opportunity to talk to him about Frances.</p> <p>She made her way slowly through the town, pausing to look through the windows of the tiny shops which laid huddled together down the narrow streets. She discovered poky jewellery shops where earrings and necklaces had been fashioned out of shells washed up by the sea. Winnie passed tea shops and a little bakery where the intoxicating smell of fresh bread wafted on the cold sea air. A few knickknack shops were open, selling postcards and sweet rock. There was also the tiniest music shop she had ever seen, and she browsed around the small CD collection. Leaving the music shop, Winnie walked down onto the harbour where she discovered arcades which had been boarded up until the summer. She passed fish and chip shops and restaurants. She came across a row of shop fronts that had been turned into galleries, and she wandered amongst them, watching the artists at work as they lovingly painted pictures of the sea, boats, and fishermen hauling in their nets. One of the artists asked if Winnie wanted her portrait done in pastels while she waited. With a red flush on her cheeks, she declined and left the artist to his work. Seagulls swooped around her, calling out as they made their way out to sea. Fishermen worked on their boats down on the harbour, fixing, rigging, or preparing to set sail. She passed shops that sold fishing equipment, and she stopped for a while and watched live bait squirm and wriggle about in glass containers. After a time, Winnie came across the restaurant where she and Thaddeus had eaten the night before. Next to it was a small bookshop. Thinking of Thaddeus, Winnie pushed open the door and stepped inside.</p><p>A bell jingled above her head, and an old woman with a curved spine appeared from the back of the shop and shuffled to the front counter. Winnie noticed that her white hair was thinning and her pink scalp shone through in places. Nets of wrinkles had etched themselves around her crisp blue eyes and her puckered mouth. The old woman held a shawl tightly about her frame, and Winnie noticed that her hands were liver-spotted, and her fingers were gnarled and pinched together like chicken\u2019s feet. Gold-rimmed glasses hung about the woman\u2019s sagging neck on a chain. As she reached the counter, the old woman smiled sweetly at Winnie and said, \"Good morning, my dear, how can I help you?\"</p><p>Winnie returned the old lady\u2019s smile. \"I just wondered if you sold any books of poetry.\"</p><p>The old woman nodded. \"Yes, my dear, I do have a small selection. Mostly classics, really.\" She stepped from behind the counter and began to make her way through the shop. \"Come this way and I\u2019ll show you what I have.\"</p><p>\"Thank you,\u201d Winnie smiled, and followed the old lady to the rear of the shop. They stopped before a row of shelves which adorned the wall before them. The old woman popped her spectacles onto the bridge of her nose and peered at the spines of the books. She ran a shaking hand along the row.</p> <p>\"Were you looking for any poet in particular, or perhaps a collection of love sonnets for such a beautiful young lady as yourself?\"</p><p>Winnie blushed and said, \"I'm looking for some poetry by a poet named Thaddeus Blake.\"</p><p>The old woman looked thoughtfully for a moment and then began to shake her head. \"There\u2019s William Blake, but I can't say I've ever heard of a poet called Thaddeus Blake, my sweet. You did say Thaddeus Blake, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes,\u201d Winnie nodded.</p><p>The old woman continued to shake her head thoughtfully, \"Now that's a new name to me. Does he write modern verse?\"</p><p>Winnie began to get a little confused now. She knew she didn\u2019t know enough about poetry to discuss the differing styles that seemed to exist. To her, a poem was a bunch of words that rhymed.</p> <p>\"I'm not sure,\" Winnie said.</p><p>The old woman smiled again, \"Not to worry, my dear. I\u2019ll check on the Internet for you.\u201d She turned and made her way back to the front counter.</p><p>\"There really isn't any need to go to any trouble,\u201d Winnie called after her.</p><p>\"Hush, hush now, my dear. It really isn't any trouble,\u201d the old woman smiled, reaching the counter where there was a computer.</p><p>While Winnie waited for the old woman to check her database, she looked at all the rows of books. She wondered about all the words printed in the shop and the stories they told. As she stood and thought about all the different stories created by all the different writers in the world, she knew she would love to have a look at one of Thaddeus\u2019s books of poetry. She would find it a curious thing to hold it in her hands and look over all the neatly printed words. She thought it must be a very precious thing indeed to have written a book, to which people you had never met, would read and share your words and ideas. Winnie wanted a copy of Thaddeus\u2019s poems so she could see what words and ideas he had wanted to share with others.</p><p>The old woman looked up from the computer and said, \"I'm sorry, dear, but there doesn't seem to be a record of any such poet. You did say Thaddeus Blake, didn't you?\"</p><p>Winnie just nodded, disappointed and confused.</p><p>\"Well he just doesn't exist. There isn't any such poet, my dear,\u201d the old woman smiled.</p> <p>She thanked the woman for her help, and with a frown, Winnie left the bookshop.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Winnie spent the next hour or so buying the groceries which Thaddeus had asked for. She went about this chore systematically as her mind puzzled over what the old woman in the bookshop had told her.</p><p>Again, Winnie had become suspicious of Thaddeus, but she wondered if there wasn\u2019t an explanation, how crazy or weird, why he didn\u2019t come up on the shopkeeper\u2019s database. Okay, so Thaddeus had told her he was a poet and that's what he spent his nights alone writing. As he had explained himself the very first night that they had met, he liked the peace and quiet of the night and the solitude it provided. So maybe his writing was no more than a hobby? Then again, hadn\u2019t he said his reason for being in London was to meet with his publisher? She wondered. Perhaps he wasn\u2019t yet published? But this just only filled Winnie\u2019s head with more questions about her eccentric employer. Like she planned to ask him about Frances, she decided to also tell Thaddeus about her uneventful visit to the bookshop. Winnie paid for the groceries in the supermarket, and left. Her mind was so muddled with her own thoughts, that she missed the newspaper stand outside with its bold black headline, which read: Local woman and baby found butchered.</p><p>As Winnie made her way back up the hill with the heavy bags of groceries swinging from her fists, she knew she would have to be careful how she raised the issues of his dead wife and the bookshop visit. Thaddeus was her employer after all, and he might not be too happy if he thought she had been snooping on him. Although Winnie\u2019s suspicions had been raised, she still needed the job until she had raised enough money to run again.</p><p>As she stood and unpacked the shopping in the kitchen and stored it away in the cupboards, Winnie pushed her doubts and fears to the back of her mind. She would deal with them later - when Thaddeus woke. Winnie fixed herself a ham sandwich for lunch and relaxed at the kitchen table with a cup of coffee and a packet of Cadbury\u2019s chocolate fingers she had added to the groceries.</p><p>An hour later she set about cleaning the house. Winnie found a duster and a can of polish in a cupboard beneath the kitchen sink and moved through the dining room. She dusted and polished the long table until its surface was gleaming. Wiping away the dust which had built up around the window frames, she decided that if the weather was warmer tomorrow, she would venture outside and clean the windows. The window by the chair she was going to sit and read in was particularly grubby she noticed, and you could barely see out of it. Winnie walked around the room, dusting the bookshelves and knocking away the beginnings of cobwebs that had crept between the books. She figured that dust and cobwebs must be a continuing problem in a house this size, and once she had finished cleaning all of the rooms, she would have to start right back at the beginning again.</p><p>Winnie spent an hour or more just dusting the dining room and by the time she had finished, her arms and back ached. The pain clawed its way across her shoulder blades and dug at the small of her back. She hung her arms loosely by her sides, rolling her shoulders and stretching her spine as she left the dining room and crossed the hall. Winnie reached the door which led into the lounge and paused. She backtracked a few paces and stood before the oil painting in the hall which hung opposite the picture of Thaddeus. She stared up at the picture, letting her eyes travel over the painted face before her. The woman\u2019s face was a little longer and narrower than her own, but the colour of her hair and eyes matched Winnie\u2019s. The women in the painting did look a lot like her. With her flesh breaking out in goose bumps, Winnie knew that she was looking at a painting of Frances. Then, as she slowly passed the paintings of the other women, she thought with a strange disquiet, that in an uncanny way, she looked a little like all of them. Not knowing if her imagination was working overtime and that she was now becoming suspicious of everything and anything connected to Thaddeus, Winnie told herself not to be so dumb and turned her back on the paintings of Frances and the other women. To try and clear her mind of her nagging doubts and ever-growing paranoia, Winnie took the iPod, put in the earphones, and spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning the lounge and kitchen while listening to Alone Again By Alyssa Reid as loud as she could bear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At about five p.m., Winnie noticed that the house had begun to grow dim as the winter sunlight began to fade over the hill. She passed through the house, switching on lights. In the lounge, she switched on the lamp next to the chair where she had been asked to sit and read. Taking the clothes from the back of the chair, she made her way upstairs to get changed into them. In her room, Winnie discarded the clothes she had been wearing that day, placing them in the laundry basket along with the rest of her dirty clothes. It was then Winnie noticed the blouse with Thaddeus\u2019s bloody handprint on it and she wondered if the cut had now healed.</p><p>Winnie put on the violet top and black skirt Thaddeus had left out for her. She found a black pair of shoes with a small heel amongst the many other pairs in the closet. Setting her hair and her makeup, she stood before the mirror and wondered if this was really how Frances had looked when she was living and breathing. Desperate not to spook herself out, Winnie left her room and made her way down the landing.</p><p>As she moved along the wide corridor with its many doors, she noticed that one of them was slightly ajar. She stopped outside. No light came from within. Winnie tapped lightly on the door with her knuckles. There was no response from inside. Glancing quickly back over her shoulder, she gently pushed open the door and ventured inside.</p> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The room was in complete darkness. Winnie fumbled with her hand along the wall and flipped on the light switch. A single bulb overhead cast a glow of pale light into the room. Winnie went to the windows to draw back the thick, heavy curtains which hung over them. She pulled them back and a shower of dust fell from them. The curtains smelt musty and old, as if they hadn\u2019t been aired for some time. Then, much to her dismay, Winnie discovered that the windows behind the curtain had been boarded over with planks of wood. Each piece has been fastened to the window frame with several nails. With a frown across her brow, she turned and looked at the room. It was poky. Probably one of the smallest rooms in the house, she thought. The air in the room smelt stale and rancid, and she screwed up her nose. A narrow bed lay against the far wall. Beside it there was an ancient-looking rocking chair. A small wooden table sat opposite the chair with an old-fashioned Singer sewing machine. Winnie went over to the table. Looking closely at the sewing machine, she discovered it worked manually by turning a small wheel which protruded from one end, and with the aid of a wooden pedal that lay on the floor beneath the table. A velvet-covered needlework box lay beside the ancient machine and very delicately, Winnie lifted its lid. Reels of fine cotton and lace lay neatly in the box and she ran her fingers gingerly over them. Needles, threads, old buttons, and china thimbles were also neatly placed inside. Winnie lowered the lid and turned around. Across from her was a dressing table, which looked like some kind of antique. There was a hairbrush with coarse yellow bristles and a marble back which had been decorated with gold, along with a powder puff and silver hairgrips. A china statue of a ballerina stood gracefully to one side. Winnie picked it up and felt its cool surface. She held it close in the dim lighting so she could marvel at its fine beauty. Holding it close to her face, she could see it was covered with tiny blue cracks. After a few moments of study, she placed it back in its original position. A row of drawers were carved into the dressing table, and curling her fingers around one of the gold handles, she eased one of them open. Winnie reached inside and pulled out some photographs.</p><p>Holding them up in the light, Winnie studied the pictures. The first was a recent colour photograph of a frail old woman. By the look of her sallow, paper-thin skin, Winnie guessed her age to be at least ninety, maybe even older than that. Her hair was white and wispy, and it stood out from her narrow skull like springs. Dark smudges of age and ill health coloured the weighty bags of flesh which hung beneath her watery eyes. Deep lines of age ravaged her face, giving her a drawn and pointed look. Studying the picture, Winnie wondered if it wasn\u2019t a picture of Thaddeus's grandmother. There was another picture, again of the old woman, taken in the room which Winnie now found herself in. The old woman was stooped forward in the rocking chair and she was staring up out of the photo. Winnie turned to the next photograph. Again, this was of the old woman. She was seated in a wheelchair, outside the house. It was dark and if it hadn\u2019t have been for the shaft of moonlight, Thaddeus, who stood beside the woman in this picture, would have been hidden in shadow. His right hand was rested on her left shoulder. A smile danced across both of their lips.</p><p>\"What are you doing in here?\" Thaddeus suddenly asked from behind her.</p><p>Winnie jumped, sending the photographs spilling to the floor. She spun around to face him as he stood in the doorway. \"Hey, Thaddeus, you made me jump,\" she breathed.</p> <p>Thaddeus crossed the room, his dark eyes fixed firmly upon hers. As he drew near, Winnie saw that tonight the colour of his eyes were almost black. He stopped before her, and stooping, he bent down and gathered up the photographs. Thaddeus placed them back in the drawer and shut it.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing in here?\u201d he asked again, his eyes never leaving hers.</p><p>\u201cI saw that the door was ajar and thought maybe you were in here,\u201d she mumbled, feeling like a thief who had been caught stealing.</p><p>\u201cWell as you can now see, I wasn't,\u201d he said, searching her eyes. Winnie looked past him and gesturing towards the dressing table drawer, she said, \"Those photographs, Thaddeus, were they of your grandmother?\"</p><p>\"Yes,\" he replied, his voice flat.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she now?\u201d Winnie pushed.</p> <p>\"Look, Winnie, I am not discussing this any further with you,\u201d he said, his voice not angry but firm. \u201cI've warned you I have my eccentric ways and requests, and one of them is that you\u2019re never to enter this room again. It is private. You have no business in here.\u201d</p><p>Winnie tried to ease her way out of the uncomfortable situation she was now faced with and said, \"Thaddeus, I wasn't snooping around. Like I said, the door was open, and I didn\u2019t know I wasn't meant to come in here. I'm sorry.\"</p><p>Thaddeus's eyes began to defreeze and warm slowly. \u201cWell now you do know, so please don\u2019t come in here again.\u201d</p><p>Winnie gave him a half-smile and Thaddeus gestured her back towards the open door. On the landing again, Thaddeus closed the door behind them. Then looking her up and down, he said, \u201cThank you for wearing the clothes I left out for you.\u201d</p><p>Feeling self-conscious as Thaddeus eyed her, Winnie ran the flat of her hands down the side of the skirt, straightening any creases that might be there. \u201cI hope I look okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look more than okay,\u201d he said thoughtfully, his eyes never leaving her. \u201cYou look perfect. Now, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I\u2019d be grateful if you would go and sit by the window and read just like I asked you to.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Thaddeus followed Winnie into the lounge where she took her seat in the chair positioned by the window, and picked up the book. It was now pitch dark outside and Winnie caught a glimpse of her reflection in the grimy window. The wind howled outside and the panes of glass rattled in their frames. She looked down at the first page of the book and the rows and rows of words. So many at once seemed rather daunting to her, and she felt uncomfortable dressed like she was. It was hard to concentrate. She read the first few lines slowly, and then sneaked a glance up at Thaddeus. He had taken one of the newspapers which had been delivered, and was now sitting on the sofa opposite her and reading.</p> <p>Over the top of the book, she spied on him as he sat cross-legged, in faded blue denims and a shirt. His hair stood up as if he had been caught in a storm, but as ever, his dark eyes were bright and keen as he read the paper. Although he looked no older than twenty-five years old, Thaddeus had an air about him - an arrogance, Winnie thought - that made him appear older. For someone so young, he brimmed with confidence.</p><p>\u201cAre you enjoying the book?\u201d he suddenly asked without looking up.</p><p>\u201cErm, yeah, it\u2019s great,\u201d she said, looking back down at the book.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be surprised if you had even read one page,\u201d he smiled behind his newspaper so she couldn\u2019t see.</p><p>\u201cAnd what makes you think that?\u201d she asked, peering once again over the top of the book at him.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019ve been too preoccupied with looking at me,\u201d he said from behind his newspaper.</p><p>Closing the book, Winnie scowled and said, \u201cWhy do you have to be so...so...\u201d she trailed off, unable to think of the word she wanted.</p><p>\u201cGood looking?\u201d And now his smile turned to a grin, hidden by the paper.</p><p>\u201cWeird, was the word I was actually thinking of,\u201d she said slamming the book shut.</p><p>\u201cWeird?\u201d he said, now peering at her over the top of his newspaper. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, opening the book again and staring down at the words.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just make a statement like that and not explain yourself,\u201d he said, closing his newspaper and placing it to one side.</p><p>Winnie sensed that he was more curious than pissed off, so placing the book in her lap, she looked straight at him and said, \u201cThaddeus, why have you got me dressed in these clothes and reading this book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>Winnie thought she noticed just a glimmer of his self-belief and confidence melt away at her question. \u201cBecause it\u2019s weird, that\u2019s why,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it so weird?\u201d he frowned. \u201cYou are very pretty. Am I not allowed to ask you to wear pretty clothes, so that I may admire you? You bring a certain radiance to this sometimes glum and gloomy place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not admiring me,\u201d she said sounding exasperated. \u201cYou\u2019re reading the freaking newspaper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want me to sit and stare at you?\u201d he said, folding his arms and looking straight at her, a broad grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cPlease just tell me the real reason,\u201d she breathed. \u201cIf I am to stay and carry on working for you, then I need to understand some of these strange ways that you have, or I\u2019m just gonna get freaked out and run again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWould you really run?\u201d he asked her, his smile faltering just a fraction. \u201cWhere would you run to? Back to London? Would you really walk out on a job, money, a place to live...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I was scared enough,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDo I scare you?\u201d he asked, the smile almost gone now.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said thoughtfully. \u201cBut this dressing up thing is, like, really weird and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m comfortable with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat could be uncomfortable about wearing expensive clothes...\u201d he started.</p><p>\u201cBecause they\u2019re your dead wife\u2019s clothes,\u201d Winnie blurted out. Part of her immediately wanted to clap her hand over her mouth and swallow those words, but that little part of her - the one that whispered sometimes - was glad she had said what she had.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll buy replacements,\u201d Thaddeus said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I bet they\u2019ll be exact copies of what I\u2019m wearing now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d he shrugged.</p><p>Then taking a deep breath and swallowing hard, Winnie said, \u201cThaddeus, I\u2019m not Frances. I\u2019m not your dead wife. My name is Winter McCall, I was born in the back of an ambulance during the middle of a snowstorm, I ran away from home and became homeless. I didn\u2019t move here with you so I could pretend to be someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith a backstory like that, I thought you\u2019d be grateful of the chance to be someone else,\u201d he shot back.</p><p>Hardly able to believe what he had just said, Winnie\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cYou fucking nob!\u201d she hissed, throwing the book on the floor and jumping up. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this bullshit!\u201d</p><p>Winnie ran from the room and went to the front door. She reached for the handle, but before she had the chance to pull the door open, Thaddeus slammed his hand against it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he said.</p> <p>And just like she had seen the night before, Winnie saw that desperation in his eyes again.</p><p>\u201cWhat, stay here and let you take the piss out of me?\u201d she sneered. This time she was too angry to cry. \u201cNo thanks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that my whole life,\u201d she snapped back. \u201cIt means shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease just let me explain,\u201d Thaddeus implored her. He reached for her hands, and she jerked them away.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d she barked.</p><p>Then raising his hands in the air as if in surrender, he said, \u201cOkay, but please just let me explain before you go. I think I owe you that at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain what, exactly?\u201d she glared at him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy I really invited you to come and stay with me,\u201d he said.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Winnie followed Thaddeus back into the lounge. He gestured for her to sit back in the chair by the window again. Winnie sat on the edge of the seat, not eagerly awaiting him to tell his story, but just in case she needed to jump up and leave quickly. Thaddeus sat opposite her on the sofa, pulling up his legs and crossing them. He sat forward, his wrists hanging over his knees, his head slightly forward. The wind howled outside and the windows rattled in their frames again. Thaddeus looked up as if glancing out of the window, then looked at Winnie.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou were right about me and I\u2019m so very sorry. If you feel that you still want to leave after I have explained why I brought you here, you will receive no quarrel from me and you can leave when you wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d Winnie asked, her temper fading slightly.</p><p>Thaddeus stared at her through the glow of the lamp and said, \u201cI watched you for seven nights. I saw you by chance one evening. After having dinner with my publisher, we went our separate ways. I had one night left in London and it wasn\u2019t a particularly cold evening, so I decided to take a walk along the Embankment and watch the boats pass along the river. I sat for a while to smoke a cigarette or two, and it was then I saw you. You were sitting on the steps outside the Embankment Tube Station, and my heart almost stopped at once as I peered through the passing traffic at you. At first I thought I was seeing a ghost. I thought you were Frances.\u201d</p><p>To hear him say this, Winnie shuddered inside and felt cold all over.</p><p>Thaddeus took a cigarette from the silver case in his pocket and lit one. Smoke curled up from the corner of his mouth, and he watched Winnie through the coils of blue smoke.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t move from that seat, Winnie,\u201d he started to explain again. \u201cIt was like I was frozen in time somehow. This time last year, I had watched Frances be eaten away by cancer, only to see her again before my very eyes, sitting across the road from me. Was it some cruel trick, or my imagination? But as I sat and watched you, I realised that you were, in fact, not her. Your resemblance is uncanny \u2013 but there are subtle differences. With my heart heavy in my chest, and old feelings reawakened within me, I hurried back to my hotel. It was like my brain had a fever. I was almost delirious with madness. My brain had become haunted by memories of Frances. When I closed my eyes, all I could see was you, Winnie, sitting in the dark and cold, holding your hands out, begging strangers for money.</p><p>\u201cYou seemed to be so alike in looks that I even began to wonder if Frances had had some secret sister, a relative that she had failed to tell me about. In my heart, I knew that not to be true. I telephoned the hotel lobby and told them that I would be staying several more nights,\u201d he said, drawing deeply on his cigarette.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Winnie asked him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know at the time,\u201d he said, glancing back at the window as rain now beat against it. \u201cI spent the day beneath the covers of the hotel bed, fearing to shut my eyes in case you were there again. Then, whether through tiredness or madness, I decided to take another walk along the Embankment again that night. I didn\u2019t know why, I had no plan, other than I needed to see you again. I had to make sure that you weren\u2019t really Frances, however insane that seemed. After a very light evening meal, as I felt too sick to eat, I made my way back to the Embankment. I sat on the bench on the opposite side of the road and watched the entrance of the station. After the time it took for me to smoke almost half a pack of cigarettes, you appeared. Again, I spied on you as you begged those people in their expensive suits for money. It almost broke my heart to see you doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Winnie cut in. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know me. I meant nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Frances I could see begging,\u201d he said, crushing out his cigarette and lighting another. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you I could see in that scruffy sweater, filthy jeans, and trainers. It was like I was watching my Frances shuffling back and forth, starving, cold, and hungry. It almost tore my heart in two to watch you night after night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you came back every night?\u201d Winnie asked, not feeling creeped out, but kind of sad for him. She pitied him.</p><p>\u201cEvery night,\u201d he said, and then looked away as if in shame. \u201cBut what was I to do? I knew in my heart that you weren\u2019t Frances \u2013 I had accepted that by night three, I think. I didn\u2019t want to leave you there. It was like I owed it to Frances in some way not to leave you behind. To return to my home and its fineries would have driven me half mad. How could I have rested or settled knowing that someone, who so reminded me of the person I loved more than anything, was living such a pitiful existence? Was I to snatch you off the street? I was not prepared to commit a crime. Approach you, explain everything, and then ask you to come and live with me? You would have thought me mad. As I watched you rebuke those men who approached you, I knew how I could get you to leave London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Winnie asked him, sensing that she had now been manipulated in some way and feeling uncomfortable about it.</p><p>\u201cI could see that you had your dignity \u2013 your pride,\u201d he explained. \u201cPeople like that don\u2019t accept charity, and it was then the idea struck me. I would offer you a job. A job brings pride, a sense of worth \u2013 it has honesty about it. It was a deal that we could both benefit from.\u201d</p><p>Staring at him wide-eyed, Winnie said, \u201cThe job, the wage, and a roof over my head is how I would benefit, but how would you?\u201d she asked, suspecting she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cI got to be reminded everyday of Frances,\u201d he said, looking away again in shame as his true motives were revealed. Then, with his head still turned from her, he added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t blame you for thinking me mad, even sinister perhaps, but there you have it \u2013 you have the truth.\u201d</p><p>Winnie drew a deep breath, and although her suspicions had been proved right, it did nothing to silence the growing disquiet she felt inside her. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are mad or sinister,\u201d she finally said. \u201cBut you are grieving, and perhaps you should go and talk to someone about it. What you\u2019ve done, and what you are doing, by asking me to dress like your dead wife so you can remember her, isn\u2019t exactly normal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve read many stories where those who have lost loved ones have never been able to throw away their clothes, possessions,\u201d he said, as if trying to justify his actions. \u201cSome people have even left their loved ones\u2019 rooms exactly as they were on the day they died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd those people, I guess, lead incredibly sad lives,\u201d she said, the anger and frustration in her voice now gone. She found it hard to muster any anger towards Thaddeus as he sat opposite her with sadness in his eyes that she knew she had seen before. Ruby Little had often had such a haunted look when she returned from the alleyways \u2013 from being with those men. It was like a piece of her soul was missing. Just as those men had taken a little piece of Ruby\u2019s soul, Frances had taken a piece of Thaddeus\u2019s the day she died. \u201cThe people you describe, Thaddeus, never move on with their lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun away, you mean?\u201d he said looking up at her. \u201cBecause that\u2019s what you do, Winnie. You don\u2019t confront your problems, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d she said thoughtfully. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe are more alike than you think,\u201d he said, putting out the cigarette which had now burnt down to the butt. \u201cMaybe in a way I didn\u2019t first consider, we could help each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think by parading around the house in your dead wife\u2019s clothes are going to help either of us very much,\u201d she said back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll buy you some new clothes,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the point,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to buy me new clothes. I want to be able to buy my own. Be my own person for once in my life, and not what everyone else expects me to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you will be able to buy your own clothes with the wage I pay you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not charity, Winnie, it\u2019s a job. You will work for your money. You will earn every penny.\u201d</p><p>Winnie thought of the eight hundred pounds he had offered to pay her each month, and with no rent to pay, nor bills, she knew that it wouldn\u2019t take her very long to be able to save enough money to be able to pay the deposit and the first month\u2019s rent on a place of her own. Then she really would be free and would never have to run again. With her own address, she would be able to get a proper job and finally live like everyone else did.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d he half-smiled at her, but again she could see that desperation in his eyes. \u201cI promise. No more dressing up, no more pretending you are Frances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why do you want me to stay, if the reason you brought me here was that I reminded you of...\u201d Winnie stared.</p><p>\u201cYou will still remind me of her,\u201d he confessed. \u201cThere is no denying that. Over the last few days since you came to stay here, I have realised grief isn\u2019t the only thing eating a hole in me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Winnie asked.</p><p>\u201cLoneliness,\u201d he said. \u201cI have enjoyed your company very much. You might look like Frances, but your personalities are very different. You have a feistiness about you, and although you have lead a difficult life, you have retained a naivety which I like very much. You are great company and I would hate to go back to wandering this vast house on my own. I have found a great comfort in knowing that you are around.\u201d</p><p>Winnie listened to his gentle voice, and again she found herself being captivated by it, just like she had the night he had approached her on the Embankment. Then, thinking back to their first meeting, she thought of the life she had once led. It already seemed like a lifetime ago, and she didn\u2019t want to go back to that any more than Thaddeus wanted to go back to being lonely.</p><p>Thaddeus watched her thoughtfully.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay then?\u201d he asked her. \u201cGive me another chance now that I have been honest with you.\u201d</p><p>Winnie drew a deep breath and said, \u201cOkay, I will stay \u2013 for now. Although, I won\u2019t be Frances\u2019s ghost.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d he half-smiled at her. \u201cWe have a deal then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he smiled. Then standing up, he looked at her and added, \u201cIf I remember rightly, I thought I said I was going to cook tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you were going to teach me how to cook,\u201d she reminded him as she stood up. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the fish fingers, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get started then,\u201d he smiled at her.</p><p>Then, before leaving the lounge, he went to the window where Winnie had been sitting. He closed the curtains and switched out the lamp, throwing the room into darkness.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>In the kitchen, Winnie filled the kettle with water and switched it on, then started to prepare two mugs of coffee.</p> <p>\u201cI think tonight calls for something a little stronger than coffee,\u201d Thaddeus said, switching off the kettle. He went to the fridge and took out a bottle of white wine. There was silence between them as he poured them both a glass. He handed one to her, and smiling he said, \u201cA new beginning for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Winnie smiled then took a sip from her glass. She watched Thaddeus go back to the fridge and sort through the groceries she had bought earlier that day. As the light from the fridge fell upon his face, Winnie couldn\u2019t help but think, that, while he looked no older than twenty-five, he had a way about him \u2013 a maturity \u2013 which gave her the impression he was older. She continued to sip her wine and watch him as he took out some chicken breasts and a tub of plain yogurt and placed them on the table. Her eyes never left him as he crossed to one of the cupboards above the worktop and retrieved a cooking apple, an onion, and a clove of garlic, then placed them alongside the chicken and yogurt. He then turned to the spice rack and plucked four little bottles from it. He placed these on the table along with a cube of chicken stock and a bottle of cooking oil.</p><p>As Winnie stood and slowly drank the wine, she wondered how Thaddeus knew how to cook so well. She guessed that most guys his age would struggle to cook a pizza without burning it, yet here he was, busying himself in the kitchen and putting together all the ingredients for what she knew would be something far grander than the fish fingers she had served up.</p><p>With a smile tugging at the corner of his full lips, and with what looked like a flicker of excitement in his eyes, he said, \"Winnie, tonight I\u2019m going to teach you to cook one of my favourite dishes, Bramley Turkey Korma.\"</p><p>\"I didn't buy any turkey,\u201d she said.</p><p>\"Not to worry,\" he assured her. \"Chicken is just as good.\"</p><p>He turned, drew a large slender knife from a rack on the work surface. He unwrapped the chicken breasts, and like a surgeon, he quickly sliced the meat into thin slivers. He spoke to her as he worked and said, \"Get a pan from the cupboard over there and heat some oil\"</p><p>Winnie did as he asked, placing a pan on the stove and pouring in some of the cooking oil. She found herself beginning to enjoy working alongside Thaddeus. She had never done anything like this with anyone before. He stood close to her, and placing the slivers of chicken into the hot pan, he said, \"We have to saut\u00e9 the chicken first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaut\u00e9?\u201d she frowned, enjoying being taught by him.</p><p>He smiled at her and she could tell he was enjoying himself, too, and she now hoped the misunderstandings between them could be put behind them.</p><p>\"We need to seal all the juices and flavour of the chicken into the meat,\u201d he explained.</p><p>Thaddeus took a plate out of a cupboard and placed it on the work surface beside the oven. \"Can you get me a fork out of the drawer, please, Winnie?\"</p><p>She found one and handed it to him. Thaddeus plucked the meat from the pan with the fork and placed it on the plate. Winnie watched him carefully. He crossed back to the table, and tossing her the onion, he said, \"Peel and slice that.\" Winnie set about the task, cutting the onion in half.</p><p>With a sideways glance, he looked at her, and with a smile, he said, \u201cAre you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s this onion,\u201d she smiled and sniffed.</p><p>Then standing before her, Thaddeus wiped the tears from her face with his thumb. Winnie felt awkward and turned her face away. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I can do it,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Thaddeus smiled, looking embarrassed. \u201cI could just see that you had your hands full so I thought I would...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay, honest,\u201d Winnie blushed and went back to slicing the onion.</p><p>When Winnie was done, Thaddeus added the onion to the pan, leaving it to simmer. Winnie sat at the table and sipped her wine as Thaddeus began to boil some rice. As he worked, Winnie told him about her trip into town and her visit to the bookshop. With his back to her, Thaddeus listened to her story. After she had finished, he picked up his glass of wine, drank a mouthful and said, \u201cYou wouldn't find any poetry books by a poet named Thaddeus Blake. The old woman in the shop was right. He doesn't exist.\u201d</p><p>With a frown, Winnie said, \"But you told me you were a poet and that's what you did as a job.\"</p><p>Thaddeus plucked the bottled spices from the table and tipped a little of each into the simmering pan. He then began to cut the clove of garlic into paper-thin slices.</p><p>\"It\u2019s not how I make a living,\u201d he said. Then just as Winnie had suspected, he added, \u201cThe money that I have has all been inherited. It\u2019s more of a hobby, really, but I write under a pseudonym.\"</p><p>\"A pseudonym?\"</p><p>\"Yes. It\u2019s a fancy word for a pen name.\"</p><p>\"Why would you want to do that?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\"For two reasons,\u201d he said, adding the garlic to the pan. \u201cFirstly, there is a far better poet than myself named Blake, albeit his first name was William, and secondly, I\u2019d like to keep my identity a secret. I don't write for the money, I have inherited enough. I don't write to collect adoring fans, and I definitely don't write for fame.\"</p><p>\"Why do it then?\" Winnie asked, and then drank the last of the wine in her glass.</p><p>Leaving the pan to simmer, Thaddeus refilled Winnie\u2019s glass and sat at the table.</p><p>\"I write because I love words. The pictures, the images you can create with them. Poetry gives me a chance to play with words, sculpt them into something beautiful,\u201d he tried to explain to her.</p><p>\"But I don't understand. If you have something to say, why not say it instead of using posh, fancy words?\" she asked.</p><p>A touch of a smile played out across his lips. \"Winnie, stand up,\u201d he said.</p><p>She continued to sit for a moment, a little unsure of herself as he watched her.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d he said.</p><p>Slowly she got up and stood before him. She felt uncomfortable, as if she was on show somehow.</p><p>\"Now, Winnie, what are you wearing?\" he asked her.</p><p>She frowned, and then said, \"Clothes?\"</p><p>He smiled as he sat back in his seat, his eyes never leaving hers. \"What is their purpose?\"</p><p>\"To cover my body? To keep me warm?\" she said, feeling kind of dumb.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Thaddeus beamed. \u201cSo if those clothes are made to cover your body and keep you warm, why do they have such beautiful colours, designs, and fastenings? Wouldn't they serve their purpose just as well without all of the added extras?\" </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Yeah, but they look prettier like this. They'd be boring and dull otherwise,\u201d she said.</p><p>Thaddeus clapped his hands together. \"And it would be the same with words, Winnie.\u201d Then standing up, and looking at her, he said, \u201cWhy just write, \u2018the woman was beautiful.\u2019 Why was she beautiful? Is it the colour of her hair, her eyes? Is it her complexion?\u201d he asked, as if studying her. \u201cI use words to create pictures in another\u2019s mind. I want words to work magic.\u201d</p><p>\"I never thought about words like that before,\u201d she said, looking back at him.</p> <p>Then turning his back on her, Thaddeus picked up the yogurt pot and poured its contents into the pan. He mixed it in with a wooden spoon. While stirring, he turned to face her as she sat back down at the table.</p><p>Winnie took another sip of the wine, then said, \"Thaddeus, can you show me one of your books? I'd love to see one.\"</p><p>Thaddeus knew he had caught her imagination, and she was relaxing with the aid of the wine. He didn\u2019t want Winnie to put up her guard again. So smiling at her, he said, \u201cIf you serve up dinner, I\u2019ll go and see if I can\u2019t find a copy of one of my books.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus left the kitchen, and Winnie placed the plates of steaming food on the table with a set of knives and forks for the both of them. She looked up to see Thaddeus standing in the doorway. In his hand he was holding a book. He passed it to her and sat down at the table.</p><p>Winnie turned the book over in her hands and read the front: Frances by Jonathan Whitby. She opened the book and thumbed delicately through the pages. She gazed over the neat rows of printed text. She looked across at Thaddeus, who was eating the food they had cooked together.</p> <p>\"Read me one of your poems,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he smiled, and now he looked a little embarrassed.</p><p>Winnie didn\u2019t feel comfortable telling him that he had a voice like silk, so she simply said, \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Laying his knife and fork beside his plate, Thaddeus reached across and took the book of poems from her hands. He flicked through the pages with his long fingers, stopped, cleared his throat, and began to read to her.</p><p>The heart beats like Indian calls and castanets</p><p>Upon the first time our touch first met</p> <p>Strange creatures danced with costumes fair</p><p>As we shook the dreams from our hair</p><p>Our laughter cast ripples into the dawn</p><p>As we smiled away our final yawn</p><p>Floating on a breeze of bliss</p><p>We stole just one last kiss</p><p>Come into these arms again</p><p>And cry a gentle sigh</p> <p>Eyelashes of pure lace</p><p>Pulling cobwebs from the eye</p><p>Peeling off skins from the past</p><p>Glorifying a new self</p><p>Saddened creases about my smiles</p><p>Trying to hide myself</p><p>With the sound of Thaddeus\u2019s voice almost seeming to float about the room, and the wine she had drank, Winnie's head began to swim.</p><p>She sat captivated by him as he continued.</p><p>Angels know your secrets</p><p>In which you trust in me</p><p>You know from where I came</p><p>As they fly from you to me</p><p>Playing with impassioned words</p><p>On a bed of rust</p><p>Swathed in your dying blankets</p><p>I've found a love to trust</p><p>Listen to the words</p><p>I write, plant, and sew</p><p>With eyes of wonder we sit and watch</p><p>As they flower so</p><p>At night we cower beneath the ancient moon</p><p>And you fear what will happen</p><p>If they come to soon</p><p>Such peace I have found inside your love</p><p>This time seems too insane</p><p>But love is like sweet mistletoe</p><p>With its beauty and its pain</p><p>Thaddeus slowly closed the book and set it down beside him. Without looking at Winnie, he picked up his knife and fork and started to eat.</p><p>Winnie felt as if she had been put under a spell. After some time, she didn\u2019t how long, she said, \u201cThaddeus, that was the most beautiful poem. I\u2019m not sure exactly what it all meant, but you were writing about how much you loved Frances.\u201d</p><p>He looked up from his meal and met her gaze. Although he was smiling, Winnie could see his eyes had grown dull and were full of sadness.</p><p>\"You must have loved Frances so much,\u201d she whispered, and wondered if anyone would ever write a poem about her.</p><p>\"Yes, I did. I was captivated by her from the very first moment I saw her. It was like I had loved her always, since time began.\u201d</p><p>\"The oil painting hanging in the hall, the one facing you, is that Frances?\" she asked.</p><p>\"Yes,\" he said, just above a whisper.</p><p>\"And the others?\"</p><p>Thaddeus straightened in his seat a little, his eyes growing brighter now. \"The paintings of the men are my forefathers, and the women are their wives.\"</p><p>\"The women all look very much the same. Auburn hair, green eyes, and pale skin,\u201d she said.</p><p>A smile lingered across his lips, and he said, \"All of the men in my family have been able to recognise a beautiful woman when they saw one. Besides, we are all related. It\u2019s common for men from the same bloodline to find similar looking women attractive.\u201d</p><p>They sat in silence. The only sound was the clacking of their knives and forks as they ate. Once she was full, Winnie pushed her plate to one side and picked up the glass of wine. She sipped from it, and then broke the silence. \u201cYou are the strangest man I have ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I take that as compliment?\u201d he asked, pushing his own plate aside.</p><p>\u201cTake it any way you like,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so strange,\u201d he said.</p><p>As Winnie sat and tried to understand the man sitting before her, she knew there was a little part of her which envied the love that Frances and Thaddeus must have shared. She had never known anything like that. However strange she thought of him, Winnie accepted his reasons. Perhaps if she had ever known love like he had, she might have had the same difficulty coming to terms with their death. He had explained about how he afforded to live, the paintings in the hallway, and the reason why the old woman in the bookshop had never heard of him. Winnie looked at him, and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little guilty at the distrust she had felt. She had never met anyone she could trust before. Even her friend, Ruby Little, used to steal from her. Was her lack of trust in people, Thaddeus\u2019s fault? No, she thought. It was hers.</p><p>Thaddeus caught her staring at him and said, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might be strange, Thaddeus, but you\u2019re a nice guy,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you, for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should be the one thanking you,\u201d he said back.</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>\u201cFor agreeing to stay,\u201d he said, standing up. He took their empty plates and placed them in the sink.</p><p>Winnie turned to look at him, and she noticed that he seemed to be staring intently out of the window. She could see his reflection in the pane of glass. Winnie couldn\u2019t be sure if it was just the way his face was reflecting back in the window, which like the others she had noticed, were covered in dirt, but he looked scared. He looked as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d she asked, getting up from the table, curious to know what it was he was staring at through the dirty windowpane.</p><p>Before she had joined him, Thaddeus had drawn the curtains over the window. He turned to face her and said, \u201cThe rain looks like it is easing and the moon is up. I think I might go outside and get some air.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Winnie alone, Thaddeus left the kitchen.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Winnie took the grey coat with the hood from the hook on the back of the kitchen door and left the room. She crossed the hallway to find the front door open. A chill breeze blew into the hall, bringing with it a flurry of sodden leaves. Winnie peered out into the darkness and could see that it was still raining slightly. Thaddeus was standing in front of the house, his hands by his sides. His head was tilted back and he was looking up into the half-moon that peered behind a wisp of grey cloud. The moonbeams splashed his face, as did the fine rain.</p><p>Pulling the coat tight about herself, Winnie stepped out of the house and stood next to Thaddeus. He looked at her, and seeing that she was getting wet, he gently pulled the hood up over her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to get a cold,\u201d he said over the sound of the wind that blew around the eaves of the house and between the branches of the trees. Winnie peered into the thick slices of black between their twisted trunks, and she remembered the three pale, white faces she feared she had seen before.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Thaddeus breathed.</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Winnie asked, looking away from the tree line and sideways at Thaddeus.</p><p>\u201cThe moonlight,\u201d he said again, staring up into the thin stream of blue light that shone from above.</p><p>\u201cI guess,\u201d she whispered. She looked up at the half-moon, its rays of light making her eyes sparkle. Rain ran down the length of her pale face as she wiped it away with her cold fingers.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go back inside?\u201d Thaddeus asked her, fearing that she did.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he smiled. Then taking a step sideways, he inched closer towards her, their hands brushing together by their sides.</p><p>Winnie felt his touch, and she wasn\u2019t sure if it were deliberate or by chance. Either way, she didn\u2019t move and let the back of his hand brush against hers. Then looking at him, she said, \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it be?\u201d he asked, not looking at her but up at the moon.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you seemed...rattled back in the house,\u201d she said, trying to find the right words, when really she thought he had looked scared.</p><p>\u201cI just needed some air,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wine went straight to my head and I\u2019ve got some work to do tonight. I just need to be able to think straight, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>They stood quietly together, the sound of the rain thrumming off the leaves in the trees was all she could hear. There were no voices in the wind tonight, and she laughed at herself for being so stupid. Then, glancing at Thaddeus, she could see that sadness had come over his face again. Even though she stood next to him, their hands brushing together, she couldn\u2019t help but see how lonely he really was. What must it have been like for him, up here all alone? He\u2019d told her that he had become a virtual recluse and she didn\u2019t want to become the same. So tugging at his hand, she said, \u201cHey, how about you show me around tomorrow?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, the house you mean?\u201d he said, turning away from the moon.</p><p>\u201cNo, not the house,\u201d Winnie sighed. \u201cShow me around St. Ives. There must be some really beautiful spots. I\u2019d really love to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be sleeping.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell can\u2019t you drag yourself out of bed for just a few hours...\u201d she started.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cI need my rest. Anyway \u2013 like I\u2019ve already told you, I much prefer the moonlight to the daylight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s why you feel so lonely all the time,\u201d Winnie told him. \u201cYou spend all night locked away in this place, and during the day, you sleep. Perhaps if you got out some more, things wouldn\u2019t seem so bad. You might meet some new people, make some friends and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d she persisted. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to show me around...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot tomorrow,\u201d he said, looking at her. \u201cBut I will \u2013 someday soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she gave in. \u201cBut you know, if you really want a new beginning, you need to find one. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll find a new start hidden away, wherever it is you hide during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d he said thoughtfully, and he seemed to be staring into the black slithers of darkness, which separated the trees.</p><p>Feeling disappointed, Winnie shrugged and said, \u201cI\u2019m going back inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go,\u201d he said, grabbing her hand again. Unlike the gentle tug Winnie had given his hand, Thaddeus entwined his fingers with hers, locking them together. \u201cStay a little longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>\u201cBecause you look beautiful in the moonlight,\u201d he said.</p><p>Winnie stared at him, and however much she liked to hear him say she was beautiful, she couldn\u2019t help but fear he was thinking of Frances again. So trying to pull her hand free of his, she said, \u201cPlease let go of my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he asked, still holding on.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re pretending I\u2019m her again,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where she used to come and stand, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Frances never came out here and stood in the moonlight,\u201d he said, whispering Frances\u2019s name. \u201cBy the time we moved here, she was very sick. She could hardly sit upright, let alone stand. I promise you, that\u2019s not the reason you are standing here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy then?\u201d she asked, searching his eyes, desperate to see if he was lying to her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look beautiful,\u201d he said again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d she whispered, and pulled her hand free.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe it because you don\u2019t want to believe it,\u201d he told her. \u201cYou\u2019ve spent too many years of your life listening to people telling you that you are no good, that you are worthless and ugly. Why do you believe them and not me? You keep telling me to start over. Perhaps you should try practicing what you preach.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t Winnie who finally walked away, but Thaddeus. He turned away and headed back towards the house. At the front door, he looked back, but Winnie couldn\u2019t be sure if he were looking at her, or having one last look into the shadows amongst the trees behind her.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>By the time they had finished eating the girl, she was nothing more than a bunch of bones. Since the murder of the girl and her baby, the fact that there was now a massive police hunt for the killers didn\u2019t even bother them. They had just killed again, and what little flesh remained covered the blood-drenched mattress in stringy lumps. The female armed away the blood from her lips, while the two males licked their hands clean. The poky house on the outskirts of St. Ives held nothing else of interest. They had taken what they\u2019d come for. Again, it had all been so very easy, and the male wondered if the humans would ever learn. If only he could meet one that resisted him, a girl who would offer a challenge. He knew the feeding would be so much sweeter for it.</p><p>\u201cSatisfied?\u201d he asked the others as he turned to leave the room, glancing down one last time at the bed, just in case there was any flesh he might have missed on the stripped carcass.</p><p>\u201cNo, Claude,\u201d the female said, crossing the room to him.</p><p>He could tell her hunger had been sedated as the fire in her eyes had faded \u2013 a little. She ran a slender set of fingers down his cheek. Claude spied a small spot of flesh in the corner of her mouth, and he slowly licked it away with the tip of his tongue. She kissed him back.</p><p>\u201cWe should be gone already,\u201d the other male said, brushing past them and heading for the front door.</p><p>Claude pushed the female away, and she smiled at him. \u201cWhy is he so tense tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know why,\u201d Claude said, heading out of the room.</p><p>And Michelle did know why. It was Frances. Everything was always about Frances. Without looking back, Michelle left the room and the bony remains of the girl, which glistened in the moonlight that poured through the window.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>Winnie woke with a start. She sat up in bed, her heart racing. Had she dreamt about Thaddeus again? She couldn\u2019t be sure. The dream seemed just out of reach inside her head. Winnie closed her eyes in an attempt to claw it back. She wanted to recapture whatever had caused her heart to race; not out of fear, but an excitement you might feel when being close to someone you were attracted to. However much she screwed her eyes shut, she couldn\u2019t quite see who it was that lingered in the fog of her mind.</p><p>Thinking of Thaddeus, she showered and dressed, not in one of those violet tops or black skirts, but the denims and sweater she felt more comfortable wearing. As she made her way downstairs, she wondered what she would do to fill her day until Thaddeus woke that evening. She knew the windows needed cleaning for sure, and seeing as he was paying her to keep the house tidy, she thought she would make a start on the window where she had sat at Thaddeus\u2019s request. Winnie reached the bottom of the stairs and turned towards the kitchen, needing a slice of toast and coffee before she started to do anything. Pushing open the kitchen door and wishing that Thaddeus had agreed to show her around St. Ives that day, she stopped short when she saw him standing at the kitchen table. Sunlight poured in through the dirty windows, causing what appeared to be a halo around his head and shoulders. He glanced up at her in the open doorway.</p><p>\u201cThaddeus?\u201d Winnie gasped, not expecting to see him standing there. After he had walked away from her the night before, he\u2019d disappeared upstairs and she hadn\u2019t expected to see him until dusk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Winnie,\u201d he smiled back at her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be awake.\u201d Then glancing up at the clock above the cooker, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s only eight-thirty in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful day,\u201d he smiled at her, as he placed a flask and some croissants into a small wicker basket that sat on the kitchen table. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s my way of saying sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d she frowned.</p><p>\u201cFor being such a grouch last night,\u201d he started to explain. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to walk off. I thought about what you said, and you were right. I should get out more. Hiding away all day and not facing the world isn\u2019t going to help me.\u201d Then closing the lid on the basket, he picked it up and added, \u201cAnd I would love to show you around. I thought we could have breakfast on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d Winnie wanted to squeal with excitement, but she held it back.</p><p>He winked at her and said, \u201cC\u2019mon. I know this really pretty spot. You\u2019ll love it.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus led Winnie through the crop of trees in front of the house and towards the narrow coastal path which led down to the shore. As they walked together, Winnie looked up at the pale winter sun, and Thaddeus had been right, for February it was a beautiful day. Too nice to be cleaning windows, she thought. More than that, Winnie was so happy that Thaddeus had decided not to spend the day locked in his room, but with her.</p><p>The path led down towards the cliff\u2019s edge, and as they neared it, the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks below boomed in their ears. A fresh breeze blew Winnie\u2019s auburn hair around her shoulders and face. She dragged her hair from her eyes with her free hand. With St. Ives behind them, Thaddeus steered Winnie along the path which now sloped downwards. Throwing Thaddeus a sideways glance, she realised she hadn\u2019t actually seen him in daylight, and his skin was pale, the light brown stubble that covered the lower half of his face looking like a shadow. Like her own, his messy hair waved to and fro in the salty breeze. Again, she couldn\u2019t help but think of how good-looking he was, and what a shame that he kept himself locked away. He was still so young and would have a lot to give. As she threw him the occasional glance, Winnie knew, if she were being honest with herself, that she was growing to like him, despite his odd ways. The little voice buried deep inside of her didn\u2019t want Winnie to admit that. The little voice didn\u2019t want Winnie having feelings for such a complex man. Men like that could be dangerous, the voice tried to warn her. As if twisting the dial on a radio, Winnie turned down the volume on that little voice.</p><p>The path led to a small, sandy shore which was shaped like a golden horseshoe and lay at the foot of the cliffs. The beach was desolate and seagulls squawked overhead. There was a small, grassy bank which was covered in long shoots of purple heather. The sea rushed up the shoreline in long, foamy waves. Thaddeus had been right; this place was beautiful, Winnie thought. Then, just on the other side of the cove, she noticed what appeared to be a cave in the side of the cliff face. The mouth of it looked dark and the rocks all around it were black and slick, worn smooth by years of waves crashing against them.</p><p>\u201cIs that a cave?\u201d she asked, pointing into the distance.</p><p>\u201cYes, but you can only reach it when the tide is out,\u201d he said. \u201cBut even then I wouldn\u2019t risk it. Could be dangerous.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDangerous?\u201d Winnie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe tide can come in quicker than you think,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou could get trapped. That cave fills up pretty good with water and you could drown.\u201d Then changing the subject, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s take our shoes off or they\u2019ll get wet.\u201d</p><p>They took off their socks and trainers, and snatching them up with the basket, Thaddeus placed them out of the reach of the waves and on the grassy bank. Winnie watched as he pulled the black turtleneck top he was wearing from over his head and threw it down next to their shoes. Then rolling up the bottoms of his jeans, he ran into the sea.</p> <p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Winnie!\u201d he called out to her, splashing water with his hands.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cold,\u201d she yelped, as the waves crashed over her toes.</p><p>\u201cAww, don\u2019t be such a baby!\u201d he laughed.</p><p>So pulling the sweater from over her head to reveal a little black vest, and rolling up her jeans, she tiptoed into the water. \u201cIt\u2019s freezing!\u201d she cried, wading towards him, arms wrapped around herself to keep warm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not cold,\u201d he grinned, spraying her with water.</p> <p>\u201cThaddeus!\u201d she shrieked, the water covering her. \u201cRight! So that\u2019s how you want to play it!\u201d</p><p>With her hands trailing in the sea, she splashed him with a wave of water. It covered him completely and he stood looking at her with water running through his hair, down his face, and over his naked chest.</p><p>\u201cLook what you\u2019ve done!\u201d he laughed, running his long fingers through his hair. \u201cI\u2019m soaked. Right \u2013 now you\u2019re in for it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Winnie squealed as she waded away from him as fast as she could, back towards the shore. She wasn\u2019t quick enough, and she felt icy cold droplets of water soak her back. Winnie reached the shore, and with the sand seeping through her toes, she snatched up her sweater and ran towards the grass.</p><p>Thaddeus was right behind her, his hands cupped together, brimming with seawater. She turned, and doing so, she tripped over the wicker basket and fell into the grass. Rolling onto her back, she looked up to find Thaddeus towering over her, seawater dripping from between his fingers.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d she warned him, a smile on her lips.</p> <p>\u201cYou should never dare me,\u201d he laughed, and splashed her with the water.</p><p>Winnie waved her hands out in an attempt to bat away as much of the freezing cold water as possible, but just as Thaddeus had intended, she got soaked. Sitting up in the grass, with her vest clinging to her and her hair wet and bedraggled-looking, Winnie stared up at Thaddeus and said, \u201cAre you happy now? I\u2019m freezing cold and wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, dropping to his knees. \u201cI\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d she smiled, putting on her sweater. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want you to catch a cold. After all, it was me who covered you in water,\u201d Thaddeus said.</p><p>\u201cThanks, but I know how to look after myself,\u201d she smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so defensive,\u201d Thaddeus said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to get it on with you or anything like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being defensive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the way I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich is defensive,\u201d he smiled.</p><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to get too close to anyone.\u201d And she looked away.</p><p>Sitting down beside her in the sand, Thaddeus said, \u201cIs being friends too close for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, friendship is just fine,\u201d she said, turning to face him again.</p><p>A length of her hair blew across her face, and Thaddeus reached out with his hand to brush it away, then stopped himself.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she smiled, as if giving him permission.</p><p>Slowly, Thaddeus brushed the length of hair from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered, gingerly taking his hand in hers.</p><p>Thaddeus looked down at her hand, which was now holding his. He then looked back at her and said, \u201cFriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we both need a friend,\u201d she smiled. In her heart, she knew she had to stop being so defensive. Winnie knew that in a different time or place, she would have perhaps wanted more than just friendship from Thaddeus.</p><p>\u201cBeing friends seems like a good place to start,\u201d he said, looking at her. Like Winnie, he knew if given a different set of circumstances, he would have wanted more than just friendship from her, too.</p><p>Slowly, letting his hand slide from hers, Thaddeus unpacked the picnic basket. Together they ate breakfast as they sat and watched the waves crash against the shore.</p><p>As Winnie helped Thaddeus pack the flask and their empty plates into the wicker basket, she said, \u201cWhat shall we do together this afternoon?\u201d</p><p>With a look of regret on his face, Thaddeus said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Winnie, but I need to go home and pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPack?\u201d Winnie asked, standing up. \u201cAre you going somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy publisher called this morning,\u201d he explained, without turning to look at her. \u201cThey need me to go back to London and sign a contract.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tonight,\u201d Thaddeus said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow evening.\u201d</p><p>Winnie looked at him as he wedged his feet into his trainers. \u201cCan I come with you?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>Then, picking up the wicker basket, he looked at her and said, \u201cSorry, Winnie, but I need to go alone; perhaps next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Winnie said with a shrug of her shoulders, as if it didn\u2019t matter to her either way.</p><p>Thaddeus walked up the beach towards the path, and Winnie followed. They walked in silence, both lost to their own thoughts. As they reached the house, Thaddeus paused at the front door and looked at Winnie. \u201cCan you do just one thing for me tonight when I\u2019m gone?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome out here and stand in the moonlight,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it will be a full moon tonight,\u201d he half-smiled. \u201cAnd you will look so beautiful in its light.\u201d</p><p>Not saying another word, Thaddeus stepped inside the house, where he packed for London.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Alone in the giant house, Winnie stood at the dirty window and watched Thaddeus make his way through the crop of trees and disappear from view. She turned away and moved from the lounge, to the kitchen, to the dining room, and back to the lounge again. She had taken Thaddeus\u2019s iPod from the dock in the kitchen, and trying to drown out the feelings of loneliness she now felt being in the giant house all alone, she listened to The One That Got Away by Katy Perry, over and over again.</p><p>Winnie thought back to the beach that morning, and she knew in her heart she had enjoyed being with Thaddeus. As she now wandered aimlessly about his huge home, there was a small part of her that wished he hadn\u2019t had to go to London. She would have really liked them to have spent the rest of the day together. Winnie wondered if Thaddeus had felt the same. The little voice inside her was telling her yes \u2013 Thaddeus had felt the same but only because Winnie reminded him of Frances. So Winnie turned up the volume on the iPod to drown that little voice out.</p><p>Perhaps Thaddeus was telling the truth when he said he just wanted to be friends? But would he ever want more than that? Maybe if she dropped her guard a little, she might find out. Feeling like she wanted to scream, and knowing she had to stop thinking about him or go insane, Winnie went to the kitchen. From the cupboard beneath the sink, she took a bucket and cloth, and filled it with warm, soapy water and went outside. It was late afternoon and the temperature had dropped. Placing the bucket on the ground, she went back into the house and took the coat with the grey hood from the hook. With it buttoned up the front and the hood on, she went back outside. She went around the side of the house to the kitchen window. Here she scrubbed away the dirt and the grime which was smeared over the windows. How had they gotten so dirty? Trying desperately not to think of Thaddeus, she scrubbed until the water was a muddy brown in colour and was cold. With her hands looking like two lumps of raw meat, she went back into the kitchen where she refilled the bucket.</p><p>Outside again, she noticed that the sunlight had almost faded away for the day, and it had grown almost dark. Not wanting to go back into the house and listen to those voices of doubt inside her head, she went to the window where she had sat the night before, wearing Frances\u2019s clothes, and reading the book that Thaddeus had left out for her. She would rather carry on working in the dark; she had all night to listen to her own self-doubts. She would rather keep busy.</p><p>With the light fading fast, she placed the bucket on the ground and took the cloth from the water. It was then that Winnie noticed something she thought to be strange. With the sodden cloth turning cold in her hands, she knelt down and inspected the flowerbed beneath the window. The heads of the flowers looked as if they had been trampled flat. Winnie brushed some of them aside, and frowned at the footprints she could clearly see in the earth. Who would have been standing in the flowerbed, and why? What could be the reason? Then, looking down at the footprints again, then back at the window, her skin turned cold. Somebody had been standing in the flowerbed so they could spy through the window and into the room. The window was so filthy that whoever had been spying through it would have had to stand in the flowerbeds to get a half-decent view of what lay on the other side. Winnie stepped into the footprints and looked through the window. Peering through the dirt smeared across it, she could just make out the chair where she had sat reading the night before, dressed as Frances.</p><p>With her heart starting to pound in her chest, she remembered how Thaddeus had been talking, and she had caught him glancing up at the window. Had he seen someone there? Her heart sped up.</p><p>\u201cThe kitchen window,\u201d she whispered aloud, remembering how she had thought Thaddeus had been looking at someone or something the night before. Picking up the bucket of water, she stepped away from the window, her heart and mind racing. Then, with gooseflesh crawling up her back, she remembered how in the Light House Restaurant, Thaddeus had insisted that she sat with her back to the window. There, too, she had caught him glancing over her shoulder and out of the window, as if someone had been there. Had someone been watching Thaddeus? Had someone been watching her, she suddenly thought, and dropped the bucket. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>While Winnie had been trying to figure out what the footprints meant, and if either she or Thaddeus had been spied on, the moon had gradually risen in the night sky behind her. She looked up into the star-shot sky. Thaddeus had been right; the moon was full and round and shining brightly down at her.</p><p>Stand in the moonlight, she heard him ask her, as if he was breathing in her ear. Winnie spun around at the sound of rustling beneath the trees. She peered into the darkness, but could see nothing. Guessing she was just spooking herself, she turned back to face the window and screamed. Reflected in it, and staring out of the dark from beneath the trees, were those three pale faces.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p> <p>Winnie stumbled out of the pool of moonlight and back towards the house. The bucket she had dropped rolled behind her, and she fell backwards and onto the ground. Air exploded from her lungs, and she felt as if she had been punched. Without taking her eyes off the three faces staring back at her from the darkness, she dragged herself to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be scared,\u201d one of the faces whispered, its voice seeming to float on the air towards her.</p><p>On her feet again, Winnie screwed up her eyes and peered into the darkness. The face spoke again and said, \u201cYou know you don\u2019t have to fear us. It\u2019s Thaddeus you should be scared of.\u201d</p><p>The voice sounded male as it floated towards Winnie.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d she called out, her heart in her throat.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d the voice said back.</p><p>\u201cAnd what\u2019s that?\u201d Winnie trembled, inching her way backwards towards the open front door, not daring to take her eyes away from the faces for one moment.</p><p>\u201cFor you to come with us,\u201d the voice said again. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to be a matter of time before he kills you, Frances. You know it to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d Winnie whispered, reaching the open front door and stepping backwards through it.</p><p>\u201cFrances, stop these games,\u201d the voice said again, the face as bright and as white as the moon.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Frances.\u201d Winnie shook, her fingers curling around the frame of the front door, readying herself to close it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d the voice asked, and it sounded as if it were growing angry.</p><p>\u201cFrances is dead,\u201d Winnie shivered, pulling back her hood.</p><p>As if what she had said had caused the face beneath the tree great anguish, it released a gut-wrenching scream, so loud that the windows rattled in their frames. Winnie threw her hands over her ears, and screwed her eyes shut. Within an instant, the screaming had stopped, and she snapped open her eyes to see the three faces were standing before her at the door. They weren\u2019t just faces. They had bodies, too, which were clad in black clothing. Two of them were male, the other female. The first was thin and tall, with black hair that was swept back off his brow. The second male was just as tall, but thicker set, with short, cropped, black hair. The female had hair which was dark blue, and blustered about her shoulders in the wind. Just like the other two, she wore a long, black coat, tight black denims, and boots. Although Winnie was scared of them, she couldn\u2019t help but be momentarily stunned by their striking beauty. The three of them, as they stood motionless before the door, looked immaculate. Their pale skin seemed almost translucent in the moonlight, and their crystal-clear blue eyes shone from their faces.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Winnie breathed.</p><p>\u201cFrances,\u201d the thin one hissed, just inches from her face.</p><p>\u201cFrances died,\u201d Winnie mumbled.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d he roared, his face now cast into an agonising grimace. \u201cTell me it\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>The other two drew closer to the male who wailed as if in pain. They looked at Winnie.</p> <p>\u201cInvite us in so we can see for ourselves\u201d the female said, her beautiful mouth curling upwards into a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Winnie snapped, closing the door.</p><p>Before it had locked, the door was forced open again, sending Winnie sprawling backwards onto her arse. She looked up and the three strangers, with their deathly white faces, crowded together just outside the doorway.</p><p>\u201cJust invite us in so we can see if you are lying about Frances,\u201d the female smiled. \u201cWe won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>From her position on the hallway floor, it looked to Winnie as if the beautiful woman\u2019s legs went on forever. However much the female smiled down at her, Winnie could see a cruelty in her eyes. She looked at the male, whose face was contorted with grief.</p><p>\u201cFrances!\u201d he screeched over and over again, tearing at his clothes as if trying to free himself from them. The other male tried to restrain him in his fit of madness. \u201cLeave me, Claude!\u201d the male screamed as if in agony.</p><p>\u201cNate, we don\u2019t know that Frances is dead,\u201d the female said.</p><p>\u201cShe is dead,\u201d he screamed. \u201cI feel it in my blood. I know it to be true. He has murdered her.\u201d Again, he tore at his clothes with his hands, as if he were burning alive beneath them.</p><p>The female went to him, and lashing out at her, he pushed her away. \u201cLeave me, Michelle. Don\u2019t touch me. I am in agony!\u201d Then he stared down into the hallway, where Winnie looked on, her heart racing inside of her. The male called Nate then screamed at her, beating his chest with his fists in anguish. \u201cIs this how I am repaid for letting him live? Her father was a fool to have put his faith in him!\u201d</p><p>Winnie trembled uncontrollably. She couldn\u2019t remember feeling so scared. Her legs felt like rubber as she tried to stand, the male screeching, hissing, and spitting at her from the doorway. Holding onto the wall for support, she hobbled towards the open door. However much the male cast out his threats, she sensed that unless she invited them into the house, they could not enter, although she couldn\u2019t figure out why. Praying she was right, she inched towards them.</p><p>\u201cMy beloved Frances is burning in Hell, and so shall he!\u201d he screamed at her, spit flying from his lips, and his eyes bulging with tears. \u201cYou, too, will die for what has happened here. I will avenge her death. I will not stop until I have drained both of you of your blood!\u201d</p><p>Unable to bear his threats and the screeching of his voice any longer, Winnie threw herself at the door and forced it shut. With her back against it, she slid to the floor as quickly as the tears now spilt down her face. With the sound of the male\u2019s screams of grief burning in her ears, Winnie crawled away from the door on her hands and knees. Her body shuddered as she desperately fought to control her sobbing. The front door rattled in its frame, as the strangers outside threw themselves against it. The banging and thudding was so loud, Winnie feared it was going to explode off its hinges and into the hallway. Scrambling to her feet, and the sounds of her petrified sobs almost as loud as the door crashing in its frame, Winnie made her way into the lounge and then screamed.</p><p>The female was at the window, the one Winnie had recently cleaned. The tip of her nose was pressed against it as she screamed through the glass at Winnie. \u201cLet us in! You must let us in!\u201d</p><p>With her hands over her ears, Winnie made her way to the window. She quickly made sure it was locked, then pulled the curtains shut over the beautiful white face that glared in at her.</p><p>\u201cThaddeus!\u201d Winnie screamed until her throat felt raw. The sound of her cries seemed to excite those outside, as they began banging on the windows.</p><p>\u201cLet us in!\u201d they screeched.</p><p>The lounge was now in darkness as Winnie tripped and stumbled towards the hallway. The little voice inside of her was screaming for her to get help. From where? Winnie knew she was miles from anywhere, and the only person who did know she was in the house was Thaddeus.</p><p>Do you have any family? She heard Thaddeus whisper in her ear, as she thought of their first meeting and how he had questioned her. The sudden realisation that perhaps he had somehow deceived her, made Winnie want to vomit. Doubting that she could rely on Thaddeus to come and save her, she desperately tried to think of how she was going to get away from those who screeched and banged on the windows outside. Even if Thaddeus could somehow know the danger she was now in, he was hundreds of miles away in London.</p><p>My publisher telephoned this morning...Winnie heard him say.</p><p>\u201cTelephone!\u201d Winnie cried out. She couldn\u2019t remember seeing one anywhere since arriving at the house. There must be one, Winnie\u2019s frantic mind tried to reason. She hadn\u2019t noticed Thaddeus in possession of a mobile phone, either. There must be a phone somewhere \u2013 how did he take the call from his publisher?</p><p>In the dark, and with the sound of the strangers outside banging against the door and the windows, Winnie raced into the dining room. With her hands outstretched before her, she searched for a telephone in the dark. With her heart slamming in her chest, and fighting hard to draw breath, she went back to the hall and climbed the stairs, passing the pictures that sat silently staring at each other. Winnie staggered along the landing, trying the handle of each door that she passed. All of them were locked. Then from above she heard a scratching noise, as if those people had somehow managed to climb up the side of the house and were now scrambling across the roof. Winnie shoulder-barged into each of the locked doors until the pain in her arm became too much too bear.</p><p>With the sound of scratching and clawing from above, Winnie raced along the landing to her room. Pushing open the door, she fell onto the floor in a heap. She cried out. Then the banging came again, and she looked up to see the female, Michelle, perched on the window ledge just outside her room. With her thick, blue hair billowing out behind her like a fan, Michelle tapped on the window with a set of long, black fingernails.</p><p>\u201cInvite me in,\u201d she whispered against the window. \u201cGo on, you know you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d Winnie cried out, dragging herself to her feet and pulling the curtains shut.</p><p>Even though Winnie could no longer see her, she knew the woman was still there. Winnie knew they were all out there by the sounds of their tapping against the window, and the noise of them scrambling overhead. On her hands and knees, Winnie crawled over to her bed, where she pulled herself up onto it. As if to make herself as small as possible, Winnie drew her knees up to her chest. She pulled the hood of the coat over her head, and shut her eyes. Rocking slowly back and forth, she tried to block out the sounds of those strangers with the pale faces knocking at the window, screaming to be invited in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Winnie had no idea how long she lay in the dark, trying to block out the sounds of those strangers outside. With her eyes shut tight, and cradling herself in the foetal position on the bed, Winnie prayed for them to go away. How had they got up to her bedroom window? How could they possibly be scampering over the roof? Perhaps they had climbed up the wild ivy that covered the front of the house? She tried to reason with herself, but the little voice inside of her doubted that. Just like everything else in life that seemed inexplicable, people always tried to find an explanation.</p><p>And when would Thaddeus be back? She wanted him to return. In her head, fused with the screeching and banging coming from outside in the dark, Winnie could hear Nate\u2019s voice. She remembered him screeching that \u2018HE\u2019 had murdered Frances. Was \u2018HE\u2019 Thaddeus? She feared it to be true. Thaddeus had told her Frances had died almost a year ago of cancer. If Frances truly had died that way, why, then, had Nate been screaming that he would not rest until he had avenged her death? As she rocked back and forth in fear, it was only then, as she fought to try and make sense of everything she had seen and heard, that she realised the tapping at the windows and scrambling sounds from above had stopped.</p> <p>Winnie lay dead still. She dared not to even blink. Perhaps they had gone away \u2013 given up, realising that she would never let them in. With her eyes still closed, she listened for the slightest sound, the smallest of movements, but all she could hear was the sound of her heart racing and the wind blowing about the eaves. Again, she did not know how long she stayed there like that, focusing on the slightest creak, on the whispering of the leaves of the trees outside as they rustled in the wind. Eventually, believing that perhaps they had indeed gone \u2013 for now at least \u2013 Winnie pulled the hood from over her head, opened her eyes, and peered into the darkness of her room. Slices of moonlight shone from around the edges of the curtains covering her window, and she could just make out the shape of the dressing table and closets in the corner. Taking small, shallow breaths, Winnie climbed from her bed. She stood like a statue in the middle of her room, again listening for the slightest of sounds. When she was satisfied that she couldn\u2019t hear the strangers, she crept slowly towards the window.</p><p>With her body shaking and trembling, Winnie slowly reached out and gripped the edge of the curtain. She waited, making sure that she couldn\u2019t hear them, but the only noise came from the groaning wind outside. Then, very slowly, Winnie peeled back the edge of the curtain, like a nurse carefully removing the dressing from an infected wound. With her eye pressed close to the gap she had made, she peered out into the night. The moon shone high above her, casting its milky-blue rays over everything in its sight. Winnie dared to glance down, and then left and right, but she couldn\u2019t see any sign of the strangers. She let the curtain fall slowly back into place.</p><p>Standing alone in the middle of her room, the temptation to bolt down the stairs, throw open the door, and run for her life was overwhelming. Dare she risk it? Her scrambled mind tried to reason this. What if they were still out there? Winnie knew she was miles from town, from the nearest house \u2013 from anyone who might be able to help her. Wouldn\u2019t it be safer to stay locked in the house? They couldn\u2019t get in or they already would have, she told herself. Was she really going to wait for Thaddeus to arrive home? The little voice in her spoke up. What if he was a part of all of this somehow? What if he really had murdered Frances? Then she thought of the bedroom Thaddeus had discovered her in, the room with the sewing machine, the narrow bed, and the boarded-up windows. Why had he boarded them over? Was Frances\u2019s body hidden in there somewhere, perhaps beneath the bed, bloated, and being eaten by maggots?</p><p>With that terrifying image seesawing before her, Winnie raced across her room and yanked open the door, just wanting to be free of the house \u2013 of Thaddeus. Almost blind with fear and the darkness on the landing outside her room, Winnie ran towards the top of the wide staircase. Her legs felt like she was wading through the sea again. Each step slow and sluggish. Winnie stumbled past the room with the boarded-up windows, and the sight of those photographs of the ancient lady flashed before her mind.</p><p>\u201c...was she your grandmother?\u201d she heard herself ask Thaddeus.</p> <p>\u201c...yes,\u201d he had smiled at her.</p><p>And as Winnie stared at the door, the sound of her breathing now more like a shallow rasp as her chest rose up and down, she remembered the night she had first met Thaddeus. He had said he didn\u2019t have any family. Thaddeus had told her he was all alone.</p><p>But not anymore, the little voice inside Winnie was now screaming.</p><p>\u201cThaddeus isn\u2019t alone anymore, Winnie, because he has you,\u201d the little voice said. This time the little voice didn\u2019t sound as if it had come from within her...but behind her.</p><p>With her eyes wide open with fear, Winnie slowly turned her head and looked back into the darkness behind her. She had left her door open and a stream of moonlight poured out onto the landing. With arms and legs shaking beyond control, and streams of tears running the length of her face, Winnie looked at the little girl standing in the moonlight. Her red coat almost glistened as much as the stream of vomit, which snaked from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cRuby?\u201d Winnie sobbed.</p> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been listening to me?\u201d Ruby whispered. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you that you are in danger. Why haven\u2019t you been listening to that little voice inside of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you died...\u201d Winnie choked on her tears, feeling as if she were going to suffocate. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here...\u201d</p><p>\u201cRun! Run! RUN!\u201d the little girl standing in the moonlight screamed at Winnie.</p><p>Spinning around, Winnie did what she had always done, and ran. At the top of the stairs, Winnie looked back over her shoulder, but there was no sign of the pool of moonlight, or her friend, Ruby Little. Feeling as if she were somehow going insane, Winnie turned and raced down the stairs and into the hallway. In her fear and desperation to get away, she threw open the front door and screamed.</p><p>\u201cPlease invite us in,\u201d Nate grinned, his mouth stretching across his face.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>Winnie slammed the door shut with such force, it rattled in its frame. She pressed her back against it. At once, the strangers outside began to pound against the door with their fists. There was another sound, too, which Winnie could now hear. It sounded like claws being dragged down the windowpane in the lounge. It was ear-splitting and Winnie threw her hands over her ears.</p><p>\u201cLeave me alone!\u201d she screamed, hot tears blinding her.</p> <p>The desperation and sheer terror in her voice excited the strangers outside, and they threw themselves against the door. Winnie rocked forward under the weight of them crashing against it.</p><p>\u201cThis could all be over,\u201d one of them hissed, \u201cYou know what you have to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever!\u201d Winnie sobbed, crawling away from the door on her stomach, sliding like a snake into the lounge. Looking up, she could see the silhouette of one them dragging their fingernails down the length of the window.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d the silhouette hissed.</p><p>Winnie recognised the voice to be that of the woman, Michelle.</p><p>When Michelle got no answer from Winnie, she began to tap lightly on the glass, as if teasing her somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s not you we want,\u201d Michelle said from outside, her voice sounding softer now. \u201cWe just want Thaddeus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here,\u201d Winnie cried out.</p><p>\u201cYou lie!\u201d came the voice of Nate from behind the front door. \u201cAnd I will burn you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not here!\u201d Winnie screamed.</p><p>\u201cLet us take a look for ourselves.\u201d This time it was the voice of Claude she could hear, as if coming from above her \u2013 the roof, perhaps.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Winnie sobbed into the balls of her hands. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t let you in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Michelle said, her voice soothing now, like an older sister trying to offer some understanding and comfort. \u201cWe won\u2019t hurt you. It\u2019s Thaddeus we want.\u201d</p><p>With the sound of Michelle\u2019s fingernails tapping against the window quickening, and the banging on the door growing louder again, Winnie felt as if she were being mentally tortured. She felt as if her mind was being chipped away at, and bit by bit, her resolve, her strength to defy the strangers outside was being broken down.</p><p>\u201cJust ask us to come in,\u201d Michelle whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to stay. You could take the chance to run. To get far away from Thaddeus. He is the one who will kill you, not us.\u201d</p><p>With Michelle\u2019s words floating around in her mind, and knowing that she just wanted to run and run until her heart burst, Winnie pulled herself to her feet and walked slowly towards the front door.</p><p>\u201cYou promise you won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d she sobbed, her arm shaking uncontrollably as she reached out for the door handle. \u201cYou promise you will let me run far away from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe promise,\u201d Nate said, his voice now sounding as smooth as silk, like Michelle\u2019s.</p><p>With her heart beating at a deafening level in her ears, Winnie curled her fingers around the door handle. Then, in between the beats of her heart, she heard another sound. A voice \u2013 a little voice.</p><p>No, it whispered.</p><p>Winnie snapped her head around, half expecting to see her friend, Ruby Little, standing at the foot of the stairs, bathed in moonlight, her bright red coat shining, like the drool of vomit encrusted around her mouth. There was no moonlight, and no Ruby Little. Winnie looked down at her fingers curled around the door handle, then let them slowly slip away.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t invite you in,\u201d she whispered, closing her eyes.</p><p>No sooner had the words passed over her lips, the strangers outside erupted in a frenzy of anger.</p><p>\u201cI will burn you,\u201d Nate hissed around the edges of the doorframe. \u201cI will burn both of you.\u201d</p><p>With her back against the wall in the hallway, Winnie slid slowly to the floor. She sat in the dark, listening to the strangers\u2019 threats, then promises, and pleas. With her eyes shut tight, and hands pressed flat against her ears, she thought of her friend, Ruby Little, as if waiting to hear her tiny voice again. It didn\u2019t come. Just before dawn, the banging and the screeching from the other side of the front door finally stopped. Winnie was unaware that it had, as she had finally given in to her tiredness, and fell asleep on the hallway floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Why did you clean the windows? the voice asked.</p><p>The voice came again, but Winnie just thought it was coming from somewhere way off in her dream. She felt cold. The surface beneath her was too hard to be the wild heather and grass she was lying on in her dream.</p> <p>Why did you clean the dirt from the windows? the voice came again, and Winnie recognised it to be Thaddeus\u2019s.</p><p>She rolled over to find him lying next to her. Winnie could hear the sound of the sea rushing up the shore. The sun was high above her, and its bright rays of light blurred her view of him. She could see his chest was bare. She feared that he was still in love with Frances, the woman he had once loved...the woman he had murdered.</p><p>Why did you clean the windows? she heard him ask yet again behind the dazzling sunlight.</p><p>Because it\u2019s my job, she whispered, suddenly feeling scared. Because if I didn\u2019t clean the windows, you would be angry with me. You would murder me just like you murdered...</p><p>\u201c...Frances,\u201d Winnie murmured, opening her eyes. She looked up to see Thaddeus standing over her.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, a deep frown across his brow.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d she mumbled, rubbing sleep from her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you clean the dirt off the windows?\u201d he repeated, reaching down and pulling Winnie to her feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Winnie flustered, feeling disorientated and thick-headed. She slowly glanced about as if getting her bearings, and she could see by the pale light that was streaming through the open front door, that it was dusk. How long had she slept? She wondered. Then focusing on the front door again, she pulled herself free of Thaddeus\u2019s grasp, ran across the hall and slammed it shut.</p><p>With a perplexed look on his face, and seeing the sudden look of fear in her eyes, Thaddeus said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Winnie turned to face him, and as the memories of what had happened the night before flooded her mind, she turned around and yanked open the front door again. Before she had even stepped over the threshold, Thaddeus had taken hold of her arm again.</p> <p>\u201cGet the fuck off me!\u201d she screamed at him, punching and kicking out wildly at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he said, soaking up her punches.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a freaking murderer, that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong!\u201d she yelled at him.</p><p>Looking as if he had been suddenly struck across his face, Thaddeus said, \u201cWhat are you talking about? Who has said this about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe faces I saw in the moonlight!\u201d she shouted, trying to pull free of him. \u201cThe faces you said I had imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they speak to you?\u201d he snapped. Then shaking her like a ragdoll, he roared, \u201cWhat did you tell them? What did they say?\u201d</p><p>Winnie looked into his eyes and screamed, \u201cApart from wanting to rip your fucking heart out, and drain you of all your blood, they said you murdered Frances.\u201d</p><p>Hearing this, Thaddeus glanced back at the tree line, and then slamming the door shut, he paced up and down the hallway. Thaddeus ran his long fingers through his hair. He looked anxious and drawn. Then turning, he stared at Winnie and said, \u201cOh my God, what have I done? I\u2019ve failed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you kill Frances?\u201d Winnie yelled, screwing her hands into fists by her sides.</p><p>Then, taking a step closer to her, he whispered, \u201cYes, I killed her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Winnie reached for the door handle again, but Thaddeus was too quick and gripped her wrist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think,\u201d he shouted at her, his eyes dark and desperate-looking. \u201cYes I killed her, but it was an accident. I never meant to kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said she died of cancer,\u201d Winnie spat at him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t murderer her!\u201d he shouted, the veins bulging beneath the flesh that covered his neck. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy should I believe a word you say?\u201d she yelled back. \u201cYou\u2019ve done nothing but lie to me since I arrived here! I should never have accepted your offer. I should\u2019ve stayed in London. By the sounds of it, I would have been safer living and sleeping on the streets.\u201d</p><p>Winnie turned her back on him and opened the front door.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cBack where I came from,\u201d she said. \u201cBack to what I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d he whispered over her shoulder.</p><p>Winnie could feel him behind her, his breath cold against the nape of her neck. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she breathed, too scared to turn around.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s almost dark outside and they will be back before you reach the end of the coastal path,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? These people you\u2019ve pissed off only come out at night, do they?\u201d she asked with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t people,\u201d Thaddeus whispered in her ear. \u201cThey are vampires.\u201d</p><p>With the sound of disbelief in her voice, Winnie said, \u201cBullshit. There isn\u2019t any such thing as vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNor werewolves?\u201d he said, pulling her around to face him.</p><p>With her eyes wide open, and a scream trying to escape from her throat, Winnie collapsed in shock against the door. Dropping to her knees, she fought desperately to suck air into her lungs as she looked up at him. Thaddeus stood before her, his eyes bright and yellow, like two burning suns. The shape of his face hadn\u2019t changed. He still looked like Thaddeus, other than the bushy-looking sideburns which now covered his cheeks. His hands had changed, Winnie noticed, as she stared in horror at him. Where he had once had those long, slender fingers, were now a huge set of claws. They looked strong and powerful \u2013 deadly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on here?\u201d Winnie finally gasped. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a Lycanthrope,\u201d he said, baring a set of razor-sharp-looking teeth. \u201cBut you would probably know me better by the more common term, werewolf, or wolf man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not real,\u201d Winnie gasped. \u201cNone of this is real. Things like you are just stuff off stories and nightmares.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus took one of her hands in his claws. She immediately tried to pull away, but he held firm. His claws felt warm. The skin covering them was coarse and tough. Then, taking her hand, he placed it against his chest. Beneath his fine cotton shirt, she could feel his heart racing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very real and so are the vampires you say came here last night,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me like you killed Frances?\u201d Winnie breathed.</p><p>\u201cIf my reasons for bringing you here were to simply kill you, I would have done so already,\u201d he said, letting go of her hand.</p><p>\u201cSo why did you bring me here?\u201d Winnie asked, pressing herself against the door, desperate to keep as much distance between her and Thaddeus as possible.</p><p>He saw her flinch away, and desperate to show Winnie she had nothing to fear from him, he walked over to the staircase and sat on the bottom stair. Then, looking over at her as she cowered in the darkening shadows, he said, \u201cAs you can see, vampires and werewolves are very real. We don\u2019t make the habit of revealing ourselves. The reaction that you\u2019ve just had is proof enough that we are better off living in secret, keeping ourselves away from humans as much as possible. They would only hunt us down and kill us. We have done that to our own species well enough without the help of humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d Winnie asked, drawing her knees up beneath her chin.</p><p>\u201cI am the last of my race,\u201d he started to explain. \u201cHundreds of years ago, our two races inhabited the Carpathian Mountains, which bordered the countries of Bukovina and Moldavia. For as long as we lived in those mountains, the vampires and Lycanthrope fought for dominance of the region. The vampires were far greater in number, and they hunted down and killed my race. They drove us to the very brink of extinction. With only a small pack of us left, we fled the mountains, but this wasn\u2019t enough for the vampires, they wanted all of us dead. They pursued us across the remote regions of Eastern Europe. One by one, they killed the Lycanthrope until there was only the one left \u2013 me,\u201d he said, patting his chest with his claw.</p><p>\u201cI managed to outwit them and stay alive, which enraged Nicodemus, the pale king of the vampire race. So desperate to hang my dead body from the walls which surrounded his castle high up in Carpathian Mountains, he sent his most cunning and ruthless warrior to hunt me down and kill me. For months, this feared warrior tracked me down, until at last, I was ensnared. But Nicodemus\u2019s plan went wrong, because instead of killing me, Nicodemus\u2019s most deadly warrior fell in love with me. Not only had he lost a great warrior, but he had lost his daughter, Frances, as it was she who he sent to kill me. Nicodemus had promised his daughter\u2019s heart to his second most trusted. A vampire by the name of Nate Varna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was one of those staring at me from beneath the trees,\u201d Winnie said.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Thaddeus said, looking at her with his yellow eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou knew all along,\u201d Winnie said, feeling betrayed by Thaddeus.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said with a nod of his head. \u201cWhen Nate Varna discovered that the woman he loved \u2013 the woman who had been promised to him \u2013 had given her heart to a werewolf, he became lost in a fit of rage and despair. He vowed to Nicodemus that he would hunt me down and not only bring my carcass back, but his daughter, too, where she rightfully belonged. Frances heard of Nate\u2019s plan, so in secret, she visited her father and told him that if I were ever to be killed, she would take her own life, too. Loving his daughter with all his heart, and not wanting to be responsible for Frances taking her own life, he forbid Nate from pursuing us. However much Nicodemus detested and loathed the thought of his daughter being in love with a Lycanthrope, he hated the thought of her killing herself even more.</p><p>\u201cBut Nate was restless, believing I would one day kill Frances, murder her as she slept, to avenge the death of my race. Knowing what Nate feared could happen to his daughter, a deal was struck. It was agreed that once every year, Frances would stand beneath the light of a full moon, so Nate could look upon the woman that he had lost to a werewolf. The night of a full moon was chosen, as on that night I would be safely locked away during my change, so that I couldn\u2019t hurt Frances. Although the agreement stated that Nate was never to approach or speak to Frances, but only to look at her from afar, he could take comfort in the fact, that those precious moments were just his and not shared by me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cFor hundreds of years the agreement was kept and Frances and I shared a wonderful life together. However, some fifty years ago, Frances became distressed by the thought of having to parade herself beneath the moonlight. It had become like a millstone around her neck, and she feared she would never be free of Nate Varna. So we would move around from one country to the next, as there was nothing in the agreement stating we couldn\u2019t do so. More often than not, Nate and those he travelled with would track us down. Some years they were unable to find us, but mostly they did. I would read the foreign newspapers searching for any articles about the brutal deaths of young women, as everywhere they went, they left death behind them. In that way, I could keep a track of them, like they kept a track of me and Frances.</p><p>\u201cAlthough she couldn\u2019t see Nate, as he was never to reveal himself to her; Frances felt he was somehow inching closer to her as the years passed by \u2013 closer than the agreement allowed. On the very last occasion that Frances stood beneath the moonlight, she was convinced that she could hear him calling to her on the wind, begging her to leave me and go with him. So we packed up our possessions and moved again. This time, to France. Both of us were fluent in speaking French, so we hired a maid, and before long, we had set up a new home and started yet another new life for ourselves. Being a vampire, Frances had to sleep during the day and live by night. I didn\u2019t have to, but I chose to so we could be together. Frances needed to drink blood to survive, but not necessarily the blood of humans, she could survive just as well on the blood from deer and other such animals. Only vampires who enjoy the thrill of killing humans need their blood. I, however, change every full moon into a wolf,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d Winnie murmured looking across the darkening hallway at him.</p> <p>\u201cNo, this is not me as a full wolf,\u201d he smiled, showing his pointed teeth. \u201cI can choose to look like this anytime I want to, full moon or not. During the night of a full moon, I change into my true form, that of a giant wolf - hound - whatever people choose to call me. It\u2019s while in that form I am unable to have rational thoughts. I become nothing more than a wild animal, unable to think or reason. I act purely on instinct and the desire to hunt and kill. Therefore, Frances would lock me away on the night of a full moon, and release me the following day. As a wolf I do not discriminate between victims. I would\u2019ve happily ripped her throat out as that of another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you did end up killing her though, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Winnie asked him.</p><p>Thaddeus lowered his head and looked at the floor, as if it brought him too much shame to say what happened next. \u201cIn France, there was a stone coalbunker at the far reaches of our land. The walls were thick and solid, made from giant slabs of stone. There was an iron door with a lock. It was an ideal place to contain me during my change,\u201d he explained. \u201cSo on the day of each full moon, I went out to the coalbunker where Frances would lock me inside. She kept the key with her always, never letting it out of her sight. It hung from a chain around her neck. While walking away from the coalbunker that day, she noticed the chain had broken, and placed the key into the pocket of her dress.</p><p>\u201cSometimes, as our maid served dinner, she would casually ask what it was we kept in the coalbunker and where could she find the key should she need it. Frances politely assured the maid that she would never need the key, and steered the conversation onto other matters. Frances forgot about the key in her pocket. That evening as the maid gathered together the dirty laundry, she discovered the key. So just before dawn the following morning, before waking Frances for her breakfast, the maid crept out to the coalbunker, and using the key she had found, she opened the door. I can\u2019t say I remember killing her, but hours later, I discovered her disembowelled remains strewn across the fields at the back of the house. I gathered together what was left of her half-eaten body and burnt her remains. She wasn\u2019t the only person I had given a death sentence to,\u201d he said, looking slowly up at Winnie.</p><p>\u201cIn my bloodthirsty rage, I had gone back to the house and crept up to the room I shared with Frances. I only recall brief fragments of what happened next, but Frances told me that she awakened to find me snarling at the foot of the bed. Not knowing how I had been set free, and fearing I would surely kill her, Frances desperately tried to shoo me away. As a wolf I would have smelt the fear reeking from her. I must have, as Frances later told me I lunged at her. She kicked out with her foot and I sunk my jaws into her ankle, snapping the bones as if they were nothing more than twigs. Dawn had just broken and the moon was fading, taking with it its power over me. So before I could attack Frances again, I began to change back into a man. I woke to discover Frances sobbing in pain upon the bed, and although she wasn\u2019t dead, we knew it was only a matter of time.</p> <p>\u201cA Lycanthrope bite to a vampire is fatal, even if it doesn\u2019t kill them outright,\u201d Thaddeus explained. \u201cIt is a slow and painful death, tearing away the hundreds of years they have lived. It is like age catches up with them, and they grow older in a matter of months, decaying away until they are nothing more than dust. So once bitten by me, both Frances and I knew she was going to die, fade away before my eyes. Frances didn\u2019t fear her own death, she feared mine. We knew that it was only a month or two before Nate would come again, expecting to see Frances standing in the moonlight, so he could satisfy himself that the woman he loved was still alive and well, and I hadn\u2019t killed her as he believed I would do. If Frances wasn\u2019t standing in the moonlight where we lived, he would know there was something wrong and come looking for me \u2013 to kill me.</p><p>\u201cSo we fled here, to England, just days before his arrival in France. With a full moon only days away, and Frances too sick and frail to lock me away, I had to find someplace where I could be kept from harming her or anyone else. It was then I discovered the cave which you pointed out on the beach yesterday morning,\u201d he said, staring at Winnie. \u201cI would walk around the cove while the tide was out. At night it comes in, pulled by the force of the full moon. Here I could change, unable to get back to shore. The rocks surrounding it are far too smooth for me to scramble up. So I am trapped there until the moon fades at dawn and I change back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you were last night, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Winnie asked him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to go there so as not to harm you \u2013 just like I harmed Frances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was her in those pictures I found in that room upstairs,\u201d Winnie breathed, as some of what Thaddeus was explaining slotted into place. \u201cShe was the old woman in the photographs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thaddeus said, the light behind his eyes fading. \u201cShe turned to dust in that room a year ago. Her remains looked just like ashes, so I took them down to the shore and set her free at last. I boarded the windows over as Frances became too weak to leave the room in the end, and she was in there day and night. I couldn\u2019t risk any daylight creeping in. So as you can see, Winnie, I did kill Frances, but not as you have been led to believe.\u201d</p> <p>Winnie sat by the door, her knees still tucked beneath her chin as she tried to make sense of everything he had told her. She glanced up at the pictures hanging opposite each other on the walls. \u201cSo are those paintings of you and Frances?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, glancing up at them. \u201cThey span the three hundred years we spent together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how old are you then, because you don\u2019t look a day over twenty-five,\u201d Winnie said.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Thaddeus half-smiled.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a compliment, dickhead,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cFour-hundred and twenty-three, give or take a year or two,\u201d he said back.</p><p>They sat quietly, neither of them knowing what to say. Then when the silence became almost unbearable, Winnie looked at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve used me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I have,\u201d he said, unable to bring himself to meet her stare. \u201cIt had been almost a year since Frances had died. I\u2019d been searching those foreign newspapers for news stories about brutal deaths. I knew by the horrific stories I found that Nate and the other two, who sometimes travelled with him, were closing in. If they found me here, and Frances wasn\u2019t standing in the moonlight, they would suspect something had happened to her. If they discovered that she was dead, then my stay of execution would be over and the last of my race would be dead. I was called to London to meet with my publisher, that is true, but by chance I happened to see you one evening outside the tube station, as I\u2019ve already explained. To look at you was like looking at Frances \u2013 it was uncanny. Those nights I sat looking at you, it wasn\u2019t because I wanted you to take Frances\u2019s place in my heart. I wanted you to take her place in the moonlight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d Winnie said, now truly understanding the level of Thaddeus\u2019s deceit.</p><p>\u201cI was scared and desperate,\u201d Thaddeus tried to explain. \u201cI thought that perhaps if you dressed in Frances\u2019s clothes and stood in the moonlight with the hood up, Nate would believe that he had seen Frances, and go away. That would have given me another year or perhaps more to escape, truly hide my tracks from the vampires forever. I remembered what Frances had told me, how she suspected Nate was watching her on more than just the night of the full moon. So I needed to be seen out with you. I needed him to see us together, happy, holding hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you took me out to that restaurant,\u201d Winnie suddenly gasped, feeling as if she had been punched in the stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s why you kept looking over my shoulder and out of the window. You were checking to see if he was out there, watching. So you made me sit with my back to the window just in case he was, so he believed he was looking at Frances, because we had the same colour hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Thaddeus whispered, ashamed by what he had done. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really mad about the fish fingers \u2013 in fact, I quite like them. I needed a reason to get you out and about at night, as Frances and I would have so often done. Then as we made our way back to the house, I noticed the moonlight. I wanted to see if you really did look like Frances beneath it. I wanted to know if I could fool Nate. So I decided to take a photograph of you. I wanted to study this later to see if you truly resembled her. However, I couldn\u2019t find my camera, and when I returned outside, you were shaken and spoke of seeing three pale faces reflected back in the windowpane. You said also that you heard voices, and I knew then that Frances had been right in her suspicions. Nate had been trying to speak to her and had been watching her more than just the one night agreed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut you mentioned the windows and that gave me an idea. So when you were in bed asleep that night, I crept outside and smeared the windows with mud. Should Nate dare to creep close enough to the house and peer in at you, he might see that you weren\u2019t really Frances. So I needed to restrict the view of you. I hoped that with the windows covered in dirt and grime, that I could risk sitting you by the window one night, dressed in her clothes. Should he chance peering in, he would believe that he had seen Frances looking happy and contented as she sat with her husband, reading a book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou had it all figured out, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Winnie sneered with contempt at him.</p><p>\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Thaddeus said, his voice soft as he looked at her. \u201cThere were a couple of things which happened that I didn\u2019t plan for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd what were they?\u201d she hissed.</p><p>\u201cYou started to suspect something was wrong sooner than I imagined you would,\u201d he said. \u201cI admit in my arrogance, I thought you would be so relieved to be taken from the streets and thrown into a world of luxuries, that you would have been blinded by what was really happening around you. I didn\u2019t think you would be as bright and resourceful as you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks,\u201d she said with a fake smile. \u201cI\u2019m truly touched. So what was the other thing you didn\u2019t figure in your grand scheme?</p><p>Thaddeus sat without saying anything at first, then looking straight at her, he said, \u201cI never thought I would grow as fond for you as I have. I never thought we would be come friends...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your friend,\u201d Winnie suddenly scoffed.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI admit that when I first asked you to come here I was only thinking of myself and own survival. Now I feel differently. You\u2019ve made me feel different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you really think I\u2019m stupid enough to believe that crap?\u201d she snapped back at him.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make,\u201d Thaddeus said, his voice still low, still soft. \u201cYou\u2019re not stupid. You showed me that living locked away in my room isn\u2019t the answer. You showed me I can have a new start \u2013 you\u2019ve made me believe that, Winnie.\u201d</p><p>Looking straight back at him, she said, \u201cAnd the only way you\u2019ve made me feel, is scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve put me in danger,\u201d she said, tears starting to burn in the corners of her eyes. \u201cYou are no better than those men who wanted to use me on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cNo, listen to me,\u201d Thaddeus begged her. \u201cYou were never in any danger. Never. Nate wouldn\u2019t hurt you. That\u2019s the last thing he would do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean, he would never hurt Frances,\u201d she said, a thin line of tears rolling silently down her face. \u201cBut I\u2019m not Frances, and he knows that now.\u201d</p><p>A heavy silence fell over them, which was only broken by the sound of fingernails tapping against the window.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re back!\u201d Winnie hissed, springing away from the door. She looked at Thaddeus, and his yellow eyes blazed as he instinctively raised his claws. A low snarling sound came from deep within the back of his throat, making him sound like a wolf waiting to strike.</p><p>\u201cLycanthrope!\u201d someone suddenly screeched, and Winnie recognised it to be Nate\u2019s voice that she could hear. \u201cCome out, Wolf\u2019s- Head. Come out and let us settle the agreement you have broken.\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus said nothing. He stood back, stooped slightly forward, legs bent at the knees, and snarled. Winnie saw his lips roll back, and his long, pointed teeth glistened. Even though Thaddeus was with her, she felt just as petrified as she had been the night before at the sound of the vampires outside in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d Nate roared, and the front door bowed inwards under the weight of him crashing against it.</p> <p>Thaddeus saw Winnie flinch backwards and throw her hands to her face in fear. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; you\u2019re quite safe in here. They\u2019re vampires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what scares me,\u201d she whispered back at him, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t come in unless we invite them,\u201d he snarled back at the door.</p><p>As if hearing what he had said, Michelle cooed from beyond the lounge window and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t hide in there forever, wolf.\u201d</p><p>Winnie glanced at Thaddeus as Michelle slowly began to drag her long fingernails down the length of the windowpane again. Howling, Thaddeus covered his ears with his claws. Then sinking to his knees, he howled again, his booming cries seeming to make the very foundations of the house shudder. It was as if the sound of Michelle\u2019s fingernails being dragged down the windowpane was agonising for him. Hearing his howls of pain, the vampires became excited. Again, Winnie could hear the sound of them scampering up the walls and over the roof. The front door shook in its frame, as all of them began to screech, \u201cCome out! Come out! Come out!\u201d</p><p>Using the banister, Thaddeus pulled himself to his feet. Then taking Winnie by the shoulders, he looked into her eyes and said, \u201cYou are never going to be free of them unless I\u2019m dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re vampires, right?\u201d Winnie said back, her mind scrambling. She didn\u2019t know much about the whole vampire thing, but she had once seen a film called Near Dark with some of the older kids at one of the many care homes she had been passed around. She hadn\u2019t seen much from behind the pillow she\u2019d been hiding behind. Winnie saw enough to know that vampires didn\u2019t like sunlight. \u201cThey\u2019ll go away in the morning, won\u2019t they? We can escape then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t die now, we will both be dead by the morning,\u201d he barked at her.</p><p>\u201cBut how, if they can\u2019t come in unless we invite them?\u201d she said. Then, as if in answer to her own question, Winnie suddenly caught the smell of burning. She turned to look at Thaddeus and said, \u201cThey\u2019re going to burn the house down, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Pulling her close so their faces were just an inch apart, he stared at her and snarled, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not killing you,\u201d she snapped, pulling away.</p><p>\u201cListen to me!\u201d he barked, pulling her close again. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to survive this. If you kill me, then they will see you had no feelings for me \u2013 that you played no part in Frances\u2019s death...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t,\u201d Winnie cut in.</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you kill me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to die, why don\u2019t you just let them in,\u201d Winnie cut in again.</p><p>\u201cIf I die from a vampire bite, I burn in Hell for eternity,\u201d he said, his yellow eyes seething. \u201cBut if you kill me, I pass over peacefully, and there may be a chance I could be with Frances again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d she breathed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolves can\u2019t kill themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the curse we have to live with.\u201d Thaddeus then grabbed her hand, and raced into the lounge.</p><p>He went to the fireplace, where he removed one of the large granite stones away, revealing a deep hole. He reached inside with one of his claws. The smell of burning was stronger now. Winnie looked back over her shoulder and could see wisps of black smoke filling the hall, the glow of flames reflecting in the lounge windows.</p><p>She looked back at Thaddeus, who was now standing before her with a pistol in his claws.</p><p>\u201cWhat the...\u201d Winnie stared, but before she\u2019d had a chance to finish, Thaddeus had shoved the gun into her hands.</p><p>\u201cYou must shoot me,\u201d he snarled at her. Then, leaping over to the windows, he threw the curtains back and barked, \u201cAnd they must see you do it if you are going to live.\u201d</p><p>The gun felt heavy in Winnie\u2019s trembling hands. She looked at Thaddeus as he kneeled before her. There was a sound at the windows, and Winnie glanced up to see the three vampires leering excitedly through at them, looking different than they had the night before. Whereas then she had thought they had all looked quite beautiful, now they looked hideous, and she recoiled backwards. With their faces pressed against the windowpane, Winnie thought at first that they had put on those creepy clown masks. In the moonlight and the glow of red and orange flames that now licked the side of the house, she realised that it was, in fact, their own faces she could see. She stared in horror at their eyes, which now looked as if they had sunken into black pits. Their mouths were huge and red. They spread right across their faces, from ear to ear, like a jagged gash. Behind the wide smiles were swollen, black gums and rows of jagged yellow teeth.</p><p>Snapping Winnie out of her petrified trance, Thaddeus gripped her wrists and pointed the gun at his own head.</p><p>\u201cShoot me!\u201d he screamed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Winnie shouted back.</p><p>Then, staring up at her, Thaddeus said, \u201cSee those faces out there with those giant mouths? Well, if you don\u2019t kill me \u2013 if they believe you are a part of all of this \u2013 they will rip you to pieces with those mouths. They will suck the flesh from your body. They will rip your heart out and share it between them.\u201d</p><p>Even though Thaddeus had hold of her wrists, her hands shook so much, the end of the barrel kept sliding across his forehead where he had placed it. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you get Frances to kill you?\u201d Winnie whispered, her lips trembling. \u201cIf you loved each other so much, why didn\u2019t she kill you so you could be together?\u201d</p><p>Then opening his eyes, Thaddeus stared up into hers and said, \u201cI can\u2019t be killed by someone who loves me.\u201d</p><p>Winnie looked back over her shoulder and could see the hallway was now a wall of thick, dense, black smoke. It smelt acrid and was choking. She glanced at the window where the vampires, with their hideous faces, stared excitedly in at her. She could hear the sound of the eaves above her snapping and hissing as flames took hold of them. She looked down at Thaddeus. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for making you a part of this,\u201d he whispered, then closed his eyes. \u201cShoot me.\u201d</p><p>With tears streaming from her eyes, Winnie closed them and placed her finger on the trigger.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to kill you,\u201d she whispered down at Thaddeus, and pulled her hands free of the gun.</p> <p>\u201cYou must...\u201d Thaddeus started.</p><p>But Winnie had turned and fled, disappearing into the bank of black smoke that filled the hallway and was now wafting up the stairs. With her hand over her mouth and nose, Winnie raced through the hall. The air felt burning hot as it touched her face, hair, and hands. Coughing and choking, she made her way into the kitchen. Orange flames danced up the walls and across the ceiling. Peering through her fingers, Winnie tried to see through the intoxicating smoke and flames. Crouched low, she stumbled across the kitchen, striking the corner of the table with her thigh. She cried out in pain, sucking in a throat full of black air. The smoke hit the back of her throat, and it felt scorching hot. Winnie tried to cough the smoke up out of her lungs, tears streaming from her eyes, and drool hanging from her mouth and nose. She dropped to her hands and knees, and feeling as if she were going lose consciousness, she crawled across the kitchen floor. On the other side of the room, she reached up and gripped the edge of the sink. She pulled herself up, and trying desperately not to breathe in, she climbed onto the counter. Through the window she had cleaned, she could see the fields stretching away at the back of the house towards the sea.</p><p>With the window seeming to soar before her burning eyes, she hoisted it open. Sucking in a mouthful of cold night air like a drowning fish, she forced her way through the open window. Winnie hung upside down momentarily, her jeans snagging on the window lock. Crying out, she wriggled her leg left and right, desperate to free herself before the smoke and fire took her, or the vampires realised that she was making her escape.</p><p>At the front of the house, Michelle heard Winnie cry out. With her long blue hair fanning out behind her, and her jagged teeth gleaming in the light from the flames, she raced towards the back of the house. Nate stared through the window at Thaddeus, who still knelt on the floor. He wasn\u2019t interested in the girl, the Frances imposter; Claude and Michelle could fuck with her. Nate wanted Thaddeus. The hatred he felt inside for the wolf burnt as greedily and as hot as the flames which now clawed their way up the front of the house. He would avenge Frances\u2019s death. He owed it to her, to Nicodemus, but more importantly, to himself.</p><p>No one could have known the torment he had lived through for the last three hundred years. Each day and night, every second had been consumed with the thought of his beloved Frances sharing her bed, her life, her soul, with a Lycanthrope. Had anyone known the pain he had felt as he watched Frances from afar, once a year, as she stood alone for him in the moonlight? Did they know that the anguish he felt at being forbidden to talk to her, to hold her? It had driven him half-mad with jealously and rage. However, it was more than that \u2013 it was the fear he felt in his heart for her. He knew that Thaddeus would one day kill her. Nate knew in his heart that Thaddeus was only keeping her alive to torture him. How could any man live a happy life, knowing that the person they loved, the person they would give their life for, was with another?</p> <p>As Nate stood amongst the smoke and flames and stared in at Thaddeus on his knees, he remembered the terrible nights he watched Frances in the moonlight, knowing that she would soon be returning to the Lycanthrope\u2019s bed, where it would make love to her. Nate would sit with his head in his hands as he pictured the wolf\u2019s claws caressing her beautiful body. He could hear Frances crying out with pleasure. Some nights, Nate hated Frances as much as the wolf. How could she have fallen in love with him? But the wolf had tricked her, bewitched her. Nate had heard that some Lycanthrope could do that. So his hatred for Frances would melt away, and only grow stronger for the wolf. It had become like a poison inside of him, which seethed through his veins and blackened his heart. Tonight, at last, Nate would unleash that fury eating away inside of him, and kill the wolf. At last he would be able to take the wolf\u2019s head back to his home, hidden deep within the Carpathian Mountains, and hand it to Nicodemus. The last of the Lycanthrope would be dead. Their species snuffed out of existence, like a candle flame.</p><p>Thaddeus looked at the thick, black smoke rapidly coming towards him, then at the window. He saw Nate staring back at him, his eyes blood-red with fury. He would have to wait, Thaddeus thought. Nate could have him, but first he had to get Winnie to safety. He had done terrible things to get Winnie into this, and she had been right \u2013 he had put her life in danger. Before he died, before he was sent back to Hell where he knew perhaps he deserved to be, he wanted to help Winnie escape. Thaddeus wanted to do that one last thing. Not because he felt he had to, not because he thought he might be looked more favourable upon in the next life \u2013 he had done enough to know that would never happen \u2013 but because he did have feelings for her. However unexpected those feelings had been, however sudden they had grown inside him, he did hope that somewhere inside of her, she felt the same. Winnie hadn\u2019t been able to kill him, no more than Frances would have been able to.</p><p>He looked back through the window at Nate, and flashing his teeth and snarling, Thaddeus leapt into the smoke in search of Winnie.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>Winnie pulled her leg free from the lock and collapsed in a heap in the grass beneath the window. Gasping for air, she knew she didn\u2019t have long to put as much distance between her and the house. With mud and grass seeping beneath her fingernails, Winnie clawed forward, her chest heaving up and down as she tried desperately to catch her breath. With her head and lungs beginning to clear, Winnie got to her feet. Stumbling forward like a drunk, she made her way into the dark and towards the sea. She could hear the waves crashing against the cliffs in the distance, hoping that she might be able to find someplace to hide amongst the rocks.</p><p>Winnie glanced back over her shoulder in panic, just to make sure she wasn\u2019t being followed. The huge house looked awash with flames. They twisted and ravaged their way across the roof and up the walls. Thick plumes of smoke twisted up into the night, blocking out the moon like a black cloud. Then she saw the vampire, Claude leap from the burning roof. Even without the light of the moon, his razor-sharp teeth glistened in his huge, twisted mouth. He landed in the long grass and came towards her. Winnie spun around, and with her lungs screaming for more clean air, she raced away. With arms pumping up and down by her sides, and her heart slamming in her chest, Winnie frantically pushed herself forward. She could hear the sound of racing footsteps behind her. How had he covered the distance between them so quickly? Her mind screamed. Again she looked back and saw Claude\u2019s grotesque face looming out of the darkness at her. With a scream tearing its way up her throat, Winnie stumbled backwards and onto the ground with a thump. What little good air was in her lungs was forced out of her. Eyes wide with terror, Winnie kicked out at him.</p> <p>\u201cGet away from me!\u201d she screamed, but her voice came out sounding like an out of breath gasp.</p><p>Claude looked down at her. Watching Winnie try and defend herself excited him. He had longed for one of the females to fight back. The feeding would be so sweet. Her heart would still be racing fast as he plucked it from her chest. The thought of her hot blood pumping into his mouth made him shudder with expectant pleasure.</p><p>Suddenly he lunged at her, and then pulled back again, like he was teasing Winnie. She scrambled backwards, thrashing out with her arms and legs. He lunged again, and then pulled back. He was enjoying watching her panic. Claude loved seeing the terror in her eyes. It was beautiful.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hurt me!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>He loved hearing her say that, because it was so dumb. Of course he was going to hurt her. He was going to teach her what pain was.</p><p>Winnie dug the heels of her trainers into the ground and pushed herself away from him. He lunged at her again, his ragged claws just inches from her eyes. Then he was joined by another. Michelle suddenly appeared beside Claude like a flickering shadow. Her long, blue hair flowed out behind her, like a streak of lightning. This close, Winnie could see that Michelle\u2019s mouth looked as if someone had slit her face open. Her lips looked like two slices of raw meat. Her dead, black eyes stared down at Winnie.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for, Claude?\u201d she whispered. \u201cTake her.\u201d</p><p>Claude couldn\u2019t bear the sense of excitement and urgency he felt inside of him any longer. So with his long, white claws clacking together like a set of knives, he lowered himself over Winnie.</p> <p>Seeing this, Winnie scrambled backwards and both vampires laughed. Suddenly, she heard another sound behind their shrieks of joy. It was the sound of howling. A black shadow streaked before her eyes. Then both Claude and Michelle flew backwards off their feet and into the air. The black shadow seemed to pause \u2013 take form \u2013 before her. It was Thaddeus. He looked back at her, his eyes bright yellow, messy hair blowing in the wind, and claws swinging by his sides.</p><p>\u201cOkay?\u201d he asked Winnie.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Before she could say anything else, he was leaping through the air and swiping at Michelle and Claude with his claws. His long, curled fingernails shone like silver as they sliced through the air. He howled so loud that the ground shook beneath Winnie. Pulling herself up onto her elbows, she watched in horror as Thaddeus clattered into Claude, sending them both sprawling to the ground. With his muscular arms just a blur in the moonlight, Thaddeus slashed, tore, and ripped at the vampire screeching in agony beneath him. Within seconds Thaddeus had opened up Claude\u2019s stomach, throwing lengths of oily black entrails into the air. Claude made a gargling noise as if being strangled. Winnie turned away as Thaddeus drove his claws into the vampire\u2019s throat. Something heavy thudded into the ground next to Winnie. Peeking through her fingers, she looked with revulsion at a long pointed-looking slab of meat, which had landed just inches from her. It twitched like a giant worm, and Winnie got up and ran as she realised it was Claude\u2019s tongue she could see wriggling about in the grass. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With the sound of Claude\u2019s agonising shrieks, and Thaddeus\u2019s booming howls in her ears, Winnie failed to hear Michelle racing up behind her. It wasn\u2019t until the vampire had leapt onto her back that Winnie realised that Michelle had been charging after her. Winnie spun around as Michelle dug her claws into her shoulders. Winnie screamed out in pain. The vampire\u2019s claws felt like ten burning daggers slicing into her flesh.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me, bitch!\u201d Winnie screamed, bucking like a donkey, desperate to throw Michelle free.</p><p>But the vampire\u2019s grip was unbreakable. Winnie threw herself backwards, crushing Michelle beneath her. The vampire shrieked, withdrawing her claws from Winnie as she tried to free herself from beneath. The pain of the claws being withdrawn from her flesh was just as painful as them going in, and a blinding bolt of pain shot through her shoulders and into Winnie\u2019s brain. In agony, she rolled off Michelle onto her hands and knees, and tried to get to her feet. The vampire had only been momentarily stunned, and pouncing to her feet, she kicked out at Winnie and sent her sprawling into the ground. Winnie\u2019s chin struck a rock jutting out of the grass, and a jet of blood burst from the gash it had made in her face. With the air now full of the sweet smell of blood, Michelle ran her tongue over her raw-looking lips and threw herself at Winnie.</p> <p>She rolled over just in time to see the vampire\u2019s fangs come rushing out of the darkness at her. Winnie threw her hands in front of her face, and she felt Michelle\u2019s fangs sink into her forearm. The pain, like before was excruciating, and Winnie thought she might just puke. With bile burning in the back of her throat, Winnie screamed in pain as she pulled her arm free of Michelle\u2019s jaws. Blood sprayed into the air, covering Winnie\u2019s face with her own blood. With her arm spurting a constant stream of thick, black blood, she tried to beat off Michelle, who lunged at her over and over again.</p><p>Screaming, she tried to fight the vampire off, but Winnie knew it was only a matter of seconds before she became too consumed with pain to fight on. Then, with Michelle\u2019s hideous face swimming before her, Winnie thought she saw a flash of red cloth go racing past. If Michelle hadn\u2019t seen it, she must have felt something, as she momentarily looked in the direction that the red streak had gone. With the vampire\u2019s head turned away, Winnie seized the moment and drove both sets of her fingernails into the creature\u2019s eyes. Michelle\u2019s eyeballs felt soft and wet beneath Winnie\u2019s fingernails. Knowing that this was her last chance, she drove her fingers as far and as deep as she could into the vampire\u2019s eyes. One of them squirted onto Michelle\u2019s cheek in a thick, gloopy white-coloured mess. It felt hot as it ran over the back of Winnie\u2019s hand and down the length of her wrist.</p><p>Twisting her back like a corkscrew, the vampire screeched in agony as Winnie pulled her fingernails from her eye sockets. \u201cI\u2019m blind!\u201d she screamed. \u201cI\u2019m fucking blind!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m bleeding!\u201d Winnie roared back scrambling to her feet. Holding her arm tightly to her chest, to try and slow the blood gushing from the rips in her flesh, she watched Michelle stagger blindly about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m blind!\u201d she screamed again, her long, blue hair blowing in the wind.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re dead,\u201d somebody howled from the darkness.</p><p>Before Winnie truly knew what was happening, Thaddeus had bounded like a giant hound from the dark. With one fleeting swipe of his claw, Michelle\u2019s head was spinning away through the air. Her torso stood where it was, twitched, and then toppled over. Thaddeus glanced at Winnie. His shirt had been torn free, and bloody streaks covered his chest. His arms looked taut, and he flexed his claws open and closed.</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he snarled at Winnie.</p><p>She looked back at him and nodded.</p><p>\u201cThen do it, Winnie,\u201d he barked at her. \u201cRun! Run! Run! And never look back!\u201d</p><p>Looking at him one last time, dripping with blood in the moonlight, Winnie turned and ran.</p> <p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>With the vampire\u2019s blood hot beneath his long fingernails, Thaddeus stood and looked at his burning house in the distance. It had been consumed by flames and it burnt like a torch on the horizon. Clouds of black smoke billowed up into the night sky. He knew whether it burnt to the ground or not, he would never be able to return there. His life in Cornwall was over. His life was over. He waited, drenched by moonlight. He wanted Nate to find him. He wanted it to be over at last.</p><p>Then, silhouetted by the red of the flames in the distance, he saw Nate coming across the fields towards him. With his claws hanging low by his sides, he breathed deeply and waited for the inevitable. He couldn\u2019t kill himself. Winnie, just like Frances, hadn\u2019t been able to do so either, but for the same reasons, he couldn\u2019t be sure. That didn\u2019t matter now. He watched Nate approach him, each step slow and deliberate, as if he were savouring every moment.</p><p>The thought of dying now didn\u2019t matter. He could kill Nate as easily as he had killed the others. What was the point? There would only be others. Word would soon get back to Nicodemus that his daughter was dead, killed by the wolf. Enraged with grief, and feeling betrayed, he would only send more, who would hunt him down. Thaddeus knew that it was over. He couldn\u2019t go on moving from one place to another, living a life where he was constantly looking back over his shoulder, reading mountains of foreign newspapers, trying to work out where his enemies would come from next. That wasn\u2019t a life \u2013 that was a living hell. He had tried to trick them and what had he achieved? For his own selfish gain, he had deceived a young girl, he had brought a young girl to his home, placed her in mortal danger and what for? So he could put off the inevitable for another year \u2013 another three or four perhaps? They would have caught up with him soon enough, and even if he had managed to trick Winnie into staying with him all that time, they would have killed her, too.</p><p>He knew he had felt something for her, however small, but to let those feelings grow and mature would have been another selfish act on his part. She would have exchanged one life of constant running for another. Winnie was free now, not of her own ghosts, but of his.</p><p>As Thaddeus watched Nate take his last few steps towards him, and as they stood eye to eye at last, Thaddeus, dropped to his knees and lowered his head.</p><p>\u201cIf you truly felt anything for Frances, make this quick for me,\u201d Thaddeus said. \u201cAs I sat and watched her fade away, we both knew this moment would eventually come. She wouldn\u2019t have wanted me to suffer.\u201d He then reached into the back of his waistband and removed the gun he had earlier tried to get Winnie to kill him with. Looking up into Nate\u2019s dead black eyes, he offered him the gun.</p><p>Nate slowly took the gun and turned it over in his hands. \u201cA murderer and coward,\u201d he sneered. \u201cA true Lycanthrope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m neither,\u201d Thaddeus whispered to himself more than to his executioner.</p><p>Nate heard him all the same, and whipped him across the side of the face with the butt of the gun. Thaddeus howled in pain, as his head rocked to the left.</p><p>Throwing the gun into the grass, Nate towered over Thaddeus and said, \u201cI\u2019ve waited three hundred years for this moment. Three hundred years!\u201d he screeched, spit flying from his lips and spraying Thaddeus\u2019s naked chest. \u201cAnd for every one of those days, I\u2019ve tormented myself \u2013 driven myself half-mad - thinking of how when I sink my fangs into your putrid heart, I want to feel it still beating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever you think happened to Frances, I\u2019m not going to spend my last few moments trying to convince you otherwise,\u201d Thaddeus said calmly, \u201cwe loved each other more than you\u2019ll ever know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the faintest idea what true love is, wolf!\u201d Nate screeched at him. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but an animal. It was I who truly loved Frances.\u201d</p><p>Then, slowly lifting his head, Thaddeus looked into Nate\u2019s eyes. \u201cIf you truly had loved Frances, you wouldn\u2019t have asked her to stand in the moonlight. You would have set her free.\u201d</p><p>With a rage which paled anything he had felt before, Nate raised his claws in the air and brought them slicing down. Thaddeus threw back his head, exposing his neck, waiting for the vampire\u2019s claws to slice open his throat and at last set him free. Thaddeus didn\u2019t know what came first, the warm splatter of blood across his upturned face, or the sound of the gun firing.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Thaddeus opened one eye to see Nate slump face first into the ground. He then opened the other, and saw Winnie standing with the gun wavering in her trembling hands. Blood and lumps of Nate\u2019s brain slid done the length of Thaddeus\u2019s face like giant black tears. He armed them away, unable to take his eyes off Winnie.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d he howled.</p><p>\u201cSaved your life,\u201d Winnie breathed, dropping the gun as if it now carried some disease she might catch.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d he barked. \u201cAfter everything I have put you through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you saved my life,\u201d Winnie whispered, holding her bleeding arm against her chest.</p><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t saved my life, Winnie,\u201d he snarled at her.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she asked, unable to figure out why he seemed so angry. Then, looking at the scattered remains of the vampires, she added, \u201cThey\u2019re dead, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re dead,\u201d Thaddeus growled. \u201cBut there will be others. It won\u2019t take long for Nicodemus to figure out what went on here. Just like Nate, he will come after me to avenge the death of Frances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Winnie said, looking back at the house which was now nothing more than just a raging inferno.</p><p>\u201cI had set you free. Why did you come back for me?\u201d Thaddeus barked at her.</p><p>\u201cBecause you said we were friends,\u201d she breathed, looking back at him. \u201cThat\u2019s what friends do, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Thaddeus looked back at her, not knowing what to say or do. With his temper calming, and seeing the blood funnelling from the cut in Winnie\u2019s face and leaking down her arm, he went to her and took her in his arms. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>Slowly, Winnie folded her arms around him and held onto Thaddeus. Resting her tired head against his shoulder, Winnie looked into the distance. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, she saw a little figure wearing a blood-red coat standing atop a grassy knoll in the distance.</p><p>Ruby Little raised one pale hand into the air and slowly beckoned Winnie with it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what we do now,\u201d Thaddeus whispered into Winnie\u2019s ear as he held her.</p> <p>\u201cWe do what I do best,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cWe run.\u201d</p><p>Winnie glanced up at the grassy knoll again, but Ruby Little had gone.
