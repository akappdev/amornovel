Her son was already there, awaiting her arrival. With that odd, almost preternatural sense of calm that had been his to command even as a babe, he stood on the beach staring with quiet intensity at the distant, watery horizon. He had not yet noticed her, so she took the opportunity to study him carefully.</p><p>Though he had barely lived sixteen summers he more closely resembled the man and warrior he would become than the child she\u2019d held at her bosom what seemed but a moment ago. He was magnificent\u2014her golden eaglet, her pride, her heart\u2014her Achilles. And today her soul wept for what Zeus\u2019s oracle had revealed to her. Thetis wished she could deny the truth of it or even simply run from the choices the great god had revealed. But she, too, was a deity, born of the water, daughter of Nereus, an ancient sea god, and she knew all too well that the prophecies of the gods could not be avoided\u2014that to run from them left only chaos and heartbreak and ruined lives in the wake of consequences. Fate could not be avoided, so it must be endured.</p><p>At least Achilles had been given a choice.</p><p>The small splinter of hope that thought gave Thetis was short-lived. It worked itself free of her heart as she continued to gaze at the wondrous man her son was becoming.</p> <p>Before his conception the oracle had foretold that her son would be greater than his father\u2014thus freeing her of the tiresome courtships of Zeus and Apollo. Neither god would ever have suffered a son to outshine him. She had eventually married Peleus, King of the Myrmidons. A slight smile touched her shapely pink lips. Peleus had desired her so desperately that compared to her smooth, white thighs the oracle\u2019s predictions were inconsequential. Thetis tossed back her silver-blond hair. She hadn\u2019t, of course, been able to settle permanently with a mortal, king or not, but she did think of him fondly and often. Perhaps she would visit him later that night. He always welcomed her joyously into his bed and she would need the distraction of passion after hearing Achilles\u2019 choice. Sadly she knew her son too well; what the oracle at Dodona had prophesied for him would, indeed, come to pass. Thetis drew in a deep breath and readied herself.</p><p>\u201cAchilles!\u201d she called to him.</p><p>His response was instantaneous. He turned toward her with a dazzling smile and a formal bow so deep and respectful that Hera herself would have been pleased.</p><p>\u201cMother, what news from Dodona and Zeus\u2019s oracle?\u201d</p><p>Thetis glided to him, extending her soft hand. \u201cNot even a hello for your mother? Are oracles and prophecies all you care about, my son?\u201d</p> <p>Achilles\u2019 blue eyes, which were the exact color of the turquoise depths in which his mother had been born, sparkled with mischievous humor. \u201cForgive me great goddess of the sea!\u201d He took her hand, kissed it fondly, then tucked it around his already well-muscled arm as he led her from the warm Aegean waters. \u201cAnd how is your health, Mother? Has it changed in the two days since last I saw you?\u201d</p><p>She pushed at his shoulder, which felt even more rocklike than it had two days before when they\u2019d taken lunch together in this very cove. \u201cMy health is perfect, as you very well know. And I am but a lowly sea goddess, not one of the Divine Twelve, so there\u2019s no need to flatter me as such. As you also know very well.\u201d</p><p>Achilles bent and kissed her quickly on her cheek. \u201cYou are my goddess, Mother, and more divine to me than any of the Twelve.\u201d</p><p>Instead of replying with her usual good-natured banter Thetis met her son\u2019s sparkling eyes and said sharply, \u201cDo not jest about the gods. Were I to usurp one of the Twelve Olympians, even just in your mind, it would be a grave insult and my hubris could be punished severely.\u201d</p><p>Achilles frowned. \u201cWhat has happened, Mother?\u201d</p><p>Thetis sighed and unwound herself from her son\u2019s arm. Silently she walked to a chair-sized rock and sat. Then she looked up at her son. Where he was standing, with the sea at his back and the sun caressing his youthful body with its golden rays, he seemed for an instant like a gilded statue of himself, like something a great people\u2014perhaps in the distant future\u2014would erect of him to memorialize the remembered exploits of a warrior whose life had blazed like a comet and then burned out much too soon.</p> <p>A shiver passed through Thetis\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cMother?\u201d Achilles repeated. He began to walk toward her, but her upraised hand stayed him.</p><p>\u201cThis will be easier if you remain there.\u201d Then she wouldn\u2019t be tempted to clutch him to her as if he were still a babe, and beg him to be wise... to consider... Thetis drew another deep breath. When she finally spoke, her voice was emotionless, as if she were an oracle herself. \u201cZeus\u2019s oracle presented two choices for you, Achilles.\u201d She closed her eyes and recited: \u201cOne path to the future will lead to a long, prosperous life. The Myrmidons will flourish under your rule. You will have a fruitful wife who will bear you many sons and daughters. You will know peace and tranquility and love. Your long life will be full and rich and you will die quietly in your bed when your beard is white, surrounded by those who love you. You will be deeply mourned, but eventually your name will be forgotten as just a speck in the countless sands of history.\u201d Thetis drew another deep breath and continued, still not opening her eyes.</p><p>\u201cAnother path to the future will lead to acclaim that will outshine all other kings and warriors. You will lead the Myrmidons in battle with a red ferocity that will burn everything before you. Your fire will rage hot and high so that your name will be remembered for thousands of years in lands past the edge of the world. But like a fire that burns too hot too quickly, you will be consumed, and never see the close of thirty summers. Rage will destroy your life. You will only glimpse peace and love and tranquility\u2014you will never know them.\u201d Thetis paused long enough to ready herself for what she knew she would see, and then she opened her eyes.</p><p>Achilles was already blazing. She\u2019d known it when the oracle had spoken her son\u2019s choices, but she couldn\u2019t help the small hope she\u2019d nurtured. Now, like a snuffed candle, hope was extinguished.</p><p>\u201cYou must choose, my son, but take your time. Reason carefully. Remember, once your choice is made, Zeus had decreed your fate and your path will be set.\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 grin was young and untamed. \u201cI already know my choice, Mother!\u201d He lifted his arms to the sky, threw back his head, and shouted his decision to Olympus as a fierce prayer to the gods. \u201cDivine Zeus, I honor you for the choices you have given me. I choose the life of a warrior and eternal fame!\u201d At that instant the heavens above him were split by a deafening crack of thunder and a massive lightning bolt, jagged and glowing, shot from the sky into Achilles\u2019 body, driving the boy to his knees and filling him with a red, raw power that literally changed his visage, hardening the smooth cheeks. It seemed he actually grew, becoming taller and broader, becoming more of what he had once been. His eyes glowed with the rust color of old blood and his lips pulled back from his teeth in a feral snarl as, once again, he shouted his decision in a voice unrecognizable as his own, \u201cI choose the life of a warrior and eternal fame!\u201d</p><p>Tears spilled silently down Thetis\u2019s cheeks as she watched her son choose to end his life too soon. He looked like a shining golden godling, her wonderful eaglet. Proud, beautiful, fierce and immortal.</p> <p>But he wasn\u2019t immortal. He would die in barely a breath of time. And she would watch as he blazed and burned out.</p><p>Bowing her head, Thetis sent up her own prayer to Olympus\u2014not shouted with words, but spoken with the power of a mother\u2019s broken heart.</p><p>\u201cHera, Goddess of All Mothers, take pity on me. If it is possible, let my beloved son know love and peace before he dies. Athena, Goddess of War and Wisdom, I ask with my immortal soul that though he has chosen a warrior\u2019s life, you give Achilles the wisdom to outlive his own youthful foolishness...\u201d</p><p>Thunder clapped through the clear Greek sky and Achilles laughed with fierce joy, not noticing the lovely peacock who suddenly appeared beside his mother. The bird stretched out its royal neck to lay its sapphire head against the sea goddess\u2019s thigh. Then, on the other side of her, a magnificent owl appeared, ethereal in its white feathers. The owl\u2019s wise gaze met hers, and it regally bowed its head to Thetis. Then both divine birds disappeared in a glittering of diamond dust.</p><p>THIRTEEN YEARS LATER</p><p>MOUNT OLYMPUS</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you darlings, the Trojan War is making my ass hurt,\u201d Venus said, glancing at Athena with one perfectly raised brow.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re looking at me like that,\u201d Athena bristled.</p><p>\u201cAthena, my friend, it could have something to do with the fact that you are Goddess of War,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cAdd to that your obsession with Odysseus and his safety, which doesn\u2019t help matters over there in Troy,\u201d Venus said. Then she lifted her empty goblet and called, \u201cI\u2019m out of ambrosia!\u201d Instantly a satyr galloped in with a glistening pitcher of the golden wine of the gods. Venus blew two kisses at the very male, very enthusiastic beast who wriggled appreciatively at the goddess\u2019s attention, bowed low, nuzzled her feet and then trotted reluctantly from the room.</p><p>\u201cYou spoil those creatures,\u201d Athena said, frowning after the satyr. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the one who instigated Odysseus\u2019s affection for me, remember?\u201d The gray-eyed goddess tossed her golden hair. \u201cSo our relationship is really your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you weren\u2019t so uptight maybe you would have a relationship instead of decades of sexual frustration and obsession,\u201d Venus mumbled.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Athena asked, narrowing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat the Trojan War has become entirely too tiresome,\u201d Hera interrupted neatly. \u201cI\u2019m especially disgusted by the new rumors. It was bad enough that Agamemnon and Menelaus blamed poor Helen for starting the war when it was their greed for the riches of Troy and their overblown male pride that was really responsible.\u201d</p><p>Athena gave Venus a considering look. \u201cDidn\u2019t you have something to do with Paris\u2019s infatuation with Helen?\u201d</p><p>The Goddess of Love sniffed delicately. \u201cMenelaus didn\u2019t appreciate Helen\u2019s beauty. The man was boorish and inconsiderate. All I did was create a little love spell to make the dolt jealous. I had no idea Paris would be so susceptible and Helen would be so needy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever the cause,\u201d Hera said, \u201cit is silly that the Greeks are blaming an entire war on one straying wife and the man who stole her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan? Paris is little more than a lust-filled boy, which is exactly why I didn\u2019t think my tiny, inconsequential spell would create such a problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs ridiculous as one woman causing an entire war, that rumor is nothing compared to what they\u2019re saying now. Have you heard that the Trojans have proclaimed that the three of us instigated the entire Helen/Paris debacle? And I don\u2019t mean a simple jealousy spell that got out of hand,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNot that apple thing again? I heard that outlandish story months ago. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s caught on and is being repeated,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cAs if the three of us would actually participate in a beauty contest!\u201d Hera scoffed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Discord\u2019s fault, you know. She was angry at not being invited to Peleus and Thetis\u2019s wedding, so she started the rumor,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI know it was her because in all the gossip I\u2019m called Aphrodite. Discord knows I prefer my Roman name. It\u2019s just like her to start rumors about me using the name I like least just to irritate me. I wasn\u2019t even at that silly party!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscord does know how to annoy,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder she doesn\u2019t get invited to many parties,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cThe rumor is that Venus, or rather Aphrodite\u201d\u2014Hera paused and smiled apologetically at Venus\u2014\u201cgave Helen to Paris as reward for his choosing you as the fairest of the three of us,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that nonsense, too. Which is the main reason the war is making my ass hurt. I\u2019m so done with the Greeks and Trojans blaming everything on women\u2014goddesses in particular. Darlings, we really must do something to encourage this little war to end. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost ten years. As far as I\u2019m concerned that is nine years too long,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do about it?\u201d Venus sighed. \u201cThey blame it on the women, but it\u2019s the damnable men of the ancient world with their archaic attitudes that actually keep everything stirred up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s really not Odysseus\u2019s fault.\u201d Athena spoke up quickly, as always, defending her favorite.</p><p>Venus snorted.</p><p>\u201cI believe you\u2019re right, Athena,\u201d Hera said, nodding slowly. \u201cAchilles and his rage is at the heart of the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Athena said. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely the problem. Take him and his Myrmidons out of the equation and the Greeks would probably lose heart and not be able to keep up the siege on Troy.\u201d Clearly annoyed, the goddess tapped one slim finger against the glass of her wine goblet. \u201cWe should have known he would come to no good all those years ago when Thetis evoked our aid. Had we acted then it would have saved us a lot of irritation.\u201d</p><p>Hera sighed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t act then because of the problems it would have caused between Zeus and me. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please explain what you two are talking about?\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYou know Thetis went to Zeus\u2019s oracle at Dodona asking about her son\u2019s future, don\u2019t you?\u201d Hera asked the Goddess of Love.</p><p>\u201cVaguely. Wasn\u2019t it something about Achilles having a choice between fame and a long life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the impetuous boy chose fame, of course,\u201d Athena said. \u201cAnd when he did, Thetis begged our aid. We heard her, and I know I for one meant to act.\u201d The goddess shrugged her lovely rounded shoulders. \u201cIt just never seemed the right time. And I will admit that it simply slipped my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, too, meant to act. I suppose I allowed the trouble it would cause with Zeus to dissuade me. And then there is that terrible berserker rage Zeus gifted Achilles with. The moment his emotions are overly aroused\u2014be they good or bad\u2014it possesses him and then there is no reasoning with him.\u201d Hera lowered her voice conspiratorially. \u201cI hear that women are so terrified of him that he hasn\u2019t even taken a lover in years.\u201d</p><p>Venus snorted again. \u201cAchilles needs a good dose of a strong, independent woman from the modern world. That would fix him right up and cure him of that berserker nonsense. Then he could be reasoned with. I\u2019m sure now that he\u2019s not a ridiculous adolescent he has some kind of sense and doesn\u2019t particularly want to die before his hair even begins to gray.\u201d She paused to sip her ambrosia and noticed that Hera and Athena were staring at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do believe the Goddess of Love may just have our solution,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and if she brings the modern woman to Troy, Zeus certainly won\u2019t hold me responsible for anything that happens because of it,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cSo glad to help with your marital issues,\u201d Venus said sarcastically.</p><p>\u201cWill you do it or not?\u201d Athena asked, being her usual blunt self.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll help. I\u2019m as sick as you two of the whole Trojan War issue\u2014rumors and all.\u201d Venus brushed back her hair and sipped her ambrosia as she considered her next move. \u201cI am very familiar with the city of Tulsa in the modern world. It would be a simple thing for me to point my oracle in that direction. Perhaps through some judicious eavesdropping I can discover the perfect woman for Achilles.\u201d She smiled and shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cOnce I find her I could simply zap her here. We can have a little chat with her about helping us reason with Achilles before I send her to the Greek camp. I suppose...\u201d Venus paused and sipped her wine while the other two goddesses waited impatiently for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cYou suppose?\u201d Hera prompted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose we should offer the woman a lovely reward or whatnot for her services.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReward? Should it not be reward enough that she was chosen by a goddess?\u201d Athena said, frowning.</p><p>Venus rolled her eyes. \u201cAthena, darling, you need to get out more. Modern mortals, especially modern mortal women, don\u2019t bow down and simper and worship us like sycophants. It\u2019s actually very refreshing to walk amongst them.\u201d Venus smiled, remembering her adventures in Tulsa and the eternal love she had won. \u201cJust trust me on this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA reward for the mortal sounds fine to me,\u201d Hera said while Athena glowered at Venus. \u201cWhy not grant her one boon? A favor from the Goddess of Love should satisfy any mortal, modern or otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea, Hera.\u201d Venus smiled impishly at Athena.</p><p>\u201cI think it sounds like a good plan,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cYes, we are all in agreement,\u201d Athena said, although a little reluctantly.</p><p>Hera raised her glass. \u201cTo the modernizing of Achilles and the end of the wretched Trojan War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Venus added with a smile, \u201cto modern women.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The Iliad? Did I hear you right? You\u2019re reading that misogynistic mess?\u201d Jacqueline said as she searched through the pantry\u2019s colorful collection of red wine for another Shiraz to open.</p><p>\u201cAre you having trouble sleeping? When I was in college Homer was a surefire remedy for insomnia,\u201d Kat said. \u201cJacky, if you\u2019re looking for another bottle of the Coppola Shiraz, it\u2019s still in the bag I left by the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs usual you read my mind, Kat,\u201d Jacqueline called over her shoulder as she headed for the foyer of the chic home, doing a little impromptu shimmy in the full-length vintage beveled mirror that hung by the front door.</p><p>Laughing, Kat called after her. \u201cShake that thang, baby!\u201d</p> <p>Jacqueline snagged the bottle of Shiraz and shimmied back to the group.</p><p>\u201cI do wish I could move like that,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cKat, honey, I love you, but y\u2019all white girls do not have enough junk in your trunk to move like me. I am luscious.\u201d Jacqueline dragged the word out with a sexy purr as she ran her hands down her voluptuous body and made kissing noises at her best friend. Grinning, she disappeared into the kitchen to open the bottle and called, \u201cSo what were we saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were talking about poor dead Susie having to read the wretched Iliad.\u201d Kat winked at \u201cpoor dead Susie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind us, just exactly why are you suffering through reading that thing?\u201d</p> <p>Susie, who owned the fabulous 1920\u2019s era home the group of friends met at twice a month for their girls\u2019 night in, gave a long-suffering sigh and threw her hands up in frustration. \u201cFirst, Katrina,\u201d she used Kat\u2019s full name in a very you\u2019ve-been-bad-young-lady tone, \u201cI\u2019m not dead; I\u2019m in college, so I only feel dead. Second, I\u2019m reading the fucking Iliad because it is required reading by the asshole chauvinist professor in the third to last fucking class I have to finish before I am able to graduate and, finally, at the totally ridiculous age of forty-eight, get my damnable BA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, tell us all again why a woman who is so incredibly successful that the utterly fab boutique that she started as a tiny women\u2019s accessory store in a not-so-good part of Tulsa and is now located smack in the middle of totally posh Utica Square, as well as the Galleria in Dallas, the Magnificent Mile in Chicago, and delicious downtown Denver, feels like she has to get a piece of paper that says she\u2019s smart?\u201d Kat said between sips from her tall, frosty champagne-filled flute.</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d Christy raised her red wine balloon glass. \u201cI second that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll third it.\u201d Heather raised her glass, then frowned at it. \u201cAnd may I just say one more time that I will be so incredibly, amazingly, inexorably glad when I can get off this bubbly grape juice stuff and back to an excellent chardonnay that I may just pee myself with pleasure\u2014or, perhaps, treat all of us to a boozy party. Heavy on the boozy part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThe party part, not the peeing part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just one more month. And you don\u2019t want to pickle that baby,\u201d Christy said, reaching over and patting Heather\u2019s very pregnant belly.</p> <p>\u201cI know, but I\u2019m dying for a glass of wine!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFocus guys! We were sympathizing with Susie about the horrid essay she has to write over the wretched Iliad,\u201d Jacqueline reminded them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I was saying that I don\u2019t think she needs a piece of paper to show she\u2019s \u2018smart\u2019 when she\u2019s already amazingly successful,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cEasily said by a woman with a masters in psych,\u201d Susie said and then hurried on before Kat could interrupt her. \u201cActually, every last one of you has that meaningless piece of paper\u2014or a couple of them. Right?\u201d She pointed first at Jacqueline, \u201cMs. ER Nurse, you have a bachelor of science.\u201d Then at Heather, \u201cYou have a masters in education, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuilty,\u201d Heather said.</p><p>\u201cChristy, you have a BS in physical fitness, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, but if you want honesty I\u2019ll tell you that I kick ass as a personal trainer because of my gym experience and not because my parents insisted I go to college way back when.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I get that, but can you guys not see the common theme here? College is part of your success. Christy could probably still be a trainer without her degree, but Kat and Jacqueline could definitely not do their jobs without those pieces of paper and the knowledge they gained getting them. Right?\u201d</p> <p>Kat and Jacky nodded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cAnd Heather, you couldn\u2019t teach without the BS that came before getting your masters. Right?\u201d</p><p>Heather sighed and patted her pregnant belly. \u201cRight, but today not having to teach and not being on my swollen feet while I scream at high school students as my ankles continue to balloon would be a lovely thing.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline shuddered. \u201cGod, teenagers. They\u2019re so nasty. I don\u2019t know how you stand all of their hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get no argument from me. They\u2019re disgusting creatures,\u201d Heather said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just grumpy because your ankles look like tree trunks. You used to like teaching, remember? Way back in Prepregnancy Land,\u201d Susie said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember back to a time when I wasn\u2019t pregnant. I\u2019ve always been this big and hideous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, have a chocolate.\u201d Jacqueline passed the tray of truffles to her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be better in a month or so,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Heather gave Kat a tired smile and popped the truffle in her mouth. Around the orb of dissolving chocolate she said, \u201cYou know, Kat, it always amazes me how optimistic you are. What with all of those abusive asshole men you have to deal with in that clinic you run. I know if I had to deal with the jerks you\u2019ve met I\u2019d be a man-hating shrew, but you\u2019re not.\u201d Heather peered at her like she was a science experiment. \u201cYou actually like men, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s laughter was uninhibited and contagious. \u201cYes, I definitely like men. And not all of the assholes I counsel are men\u2014there are women jerks, too. Plus, they\u2019re not all abusive assholes. Many of them actually come to me before they\u2019ve graduated to full abusive asshole status.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like me,\u201d Susie proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m going to graduate some day.\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline frowned. \u201cUh, Susie. I don\u2019t think graduating to an abusive asshole is something to which you want to aspire.\u201d</p><p>The older woman rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m talking about my BA and not about their asshole-ish-ness. When I get out of this awful lit class in a couple months it\u2019ll be way better. My final two classes are going to be a breeze. This is the last really horrid one I have to take. As soon as I get this stupid paper on The Iliad written I\u2019ll feel lots better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Kat said through the truffle melting on her tongue. \u201cHow about you write your paper on how ridiculous it is that women got blamed for every damn thing in the Trojan War? I mean, I haven\u2019t read the thing in a zillion years.\u201d She wrinkled her brow. \u201cWait, I might never have actually read it and just faked my way through with the CliffsNotes, but what I do recall is that Helen took the fall for causing the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I remember that,\u201d Jacqueline said. \u201cAnd wasn\u2019t there something about three goddesses starting the whole thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah\u2014Hera, Athena and Aphrodite,\u201d Susie said. \u201cThe goddess Discord was pissed about not getting invited to a wedding, so she threw a golden apple that read \u2018for the fairest\u2019 into the group. None of the gods were stupid enough to judge that beauty contest, so a guy named Paris, who was the son of Priam, king of Troy, got stuck with the job. But he didn\u2019t actually choose which goddess was the prettiest. He chose which bribe he liked best. Aphrodite offered him the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as his own. He took that bribe. Helen was the most beautiful mortal woman, but she was already married to the Greek king, Menelaus. Paris stole her from Menelaus, with Aphrodite\u2019s blessing, and the Trojan War started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Jacqueline snorted. \u201cSounds like bullshit to me. I mean, please. Why would goddesses give a shit about what some mortal guy thought?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Jacky,\u201d Kat chimed in. \u201cYou\u2019re not a goddess, but you rarely give a shit about men\u2014mortal or otherwise!\u201d</p><p>Jacqueline\u2019s perfectly shaped brows went up almost far enough to reach the hairline of her short, curly, Halle Berry-like hair. \u201cI\u2019m not a goddess? Did you just say I\u2019m not a goddess, Kat?\u201d</p><p>Kat put her hands up in mock surrender. \u201cIt must be this bottle of champagne talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about that little \u2018don\u2019t give a shit about men\u2019 comment?\u201d Christy asked.</p><p>Jacky shrugged. \u201cWhatever. I like men okay. In theory.\u201d</p><p>\"See, that\u2019s why Jacky and I are such perfect BFFs,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI am an eternal optimist and she\u2019s Ms. Pessimist. She reels me in when I get too far out there, and I remind her to give folks a chance\u2014they\u2019re not all bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFolks aren\u2019t all bad\u2014men are another matter,\u201d Jacky grumbled.</p><p>\u201cDown, killer!\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Jacqueline fixed her dark chocolate eyes on her best friend. \u201cI do believe I\u2019m going to cut you off from your second bottle of champagne.\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned at her. \u201cNo you\u2019re not! Remember our deal\u2014I pay for our cab and I get to drink entirely too much champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, ladies, before you talk about calling cabs and such, could we please talk a little more about this paper I\u2019m going to write for my jerk of a professor?\u201d From somewhere Susie had produced a thick, college-ruled notebook and a well-sharpened number two pencil, which she held at the ready.</p><p>\u201cYour jerk of a professor is not going to like a feminist paper,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHey, I said I wanted the BA. I didn\u2019t say I wanted straight As.\u201d She grinned mischievously at her friends. \u201cTo misquote the fabulous Bonnie Raitt, \u2018Let\u2019s give him something to talk about.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Venus laughed aloud. \u201cDarlings! This is exactly why my oracle found you.\u201d She cooed and clapped her hands even though the group of modern mortal women could not hear the goddess and were oblivious that she observed them through her shining oracle, which acted like an infinitely long telescope from Olympus to Tulsa. Venus focused her vision on the woman with the infectious laugh, sparkling blue eyes and the adorable nickname of Kat.</p><p>\u201cBy Hermes\u2019s flamingly gay buttocks, she is absolutely perfect!\u201d The goddess held up a manicured finger for each point she ticked off. \u201cShe counsels men, so she should be able to handle Achilles and that silly berserker rage issue of his. She\u2019s optimistic and likes men.\u201d The goddess\u2019s smile was sultry. \u201cLiking men is always a plus when seducing them. And she\u2019s astute enough to know intuitively the falseness of the ridiculous fiction about the Trojan War that has been repeated for...\u201d\u2014Venus paused and grimaced in annoyance\u2014\u201clonger than I would have believed possible.\u201d Venus focused her attention back on the little group of girlfriends and laughed along with them as she listened to them composing a very funny, very literate, very feminist essay for the professor they were calling Mr. Anus.</p><p>Venus liked all five of the women, which made her even surer that Kat was a suitable choice for the goddesses\u2019 mission. A woman\u2019s friends reflected who she was\u2014and Venus definitely liked the reflection she was seeing from Tulsa. She especially liked the exotic-looking Jacqueline, who was obviously Kat\u2019s closest friend among the group. Jacky, as they called her, was sassy and saucy and compelling with her quick wit and her lovely caramel-colored skin. Venus considered for a moment whether she may be a better choice than Kat\u2014and decided no, Jacqueline was wonderful, but Kat had more of the much-needed skills to conquer Achilles. Besides, Jacqueline\u2019s lovely dark skin would be too hard to explain among the golden Greeks. \u201cMores the pity for them,\u201d Venus mumbled.</p><p>Venus narrowed her study down to Kat, concentrating with all of her vast powers. The Goddess of Love smiled in relief. No, Kat was not in love with any mortal man. Had she been, Venus, who was Love personified, would have sensed it. Actually, now that she was thinking about it, the goddess realized that out of the five of them, only the very pregnant Heather was committed to and in love with a man. \u201cWell...\u201d Venus drummed her fingers on the side of the marble oracle. \u201cPerhaps when I\u2019ve finished with this little Trojan War issue I\u2019ll return for some lovely matchmaking.\u201d The thought made Venus hum happily. Finding a lover for the fabulous Jacqueline would be her first order of business.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Venus reined in her enthusiasm. \u201cFirst Achilles. Then I can dabble with matchmaking in the modern mortal world.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>But first things first. She needed to bring Kat from the modern world to Olympus, which would not be particularly difficult. The goddess raised her hands and began summoning the power that as one of the Twelve Olympians would eternally be hers to command. The air between her palms started to shimmer with tiny specks of energy brilliant as miniature diamonds. As soon as Kat was alone, Venus could reach through the oracle and transport her to the portal from the modern world to Olympus that stood open, but invisible, in Tulsa. Then Venus would simply zap herself there and speak with Kat briefly. The goddess tapped her chin as she considered. She\u2019d probably have to work some kind of obvious magic to prove to the mortal that she was truly Venus, Goddess of Love. But that shouldn\u2019t take long. She\u2019d get that over with, and then return to Olympus with the mortal and call Hera and Athena here to her temple so that they could all explain in detail to the girl what was needed from her.</p><p>As her mortal friend, Pea Chamberlain, would say, easy-peasy.</p><p>Still building the power between her hands, Venus looked down through the oracle to see a giggling Kat and Jacqueline making their way more than a little unsteadily down the front steps of Susie\u2019s pretty home to a waiting car. Venus laughed. \u201cGood thing they aren\u2019t driving. Neither of them appears to be sober enough to handle one of those metal machines.\u201d Nor were either of them\u2014specifically Kat\u2014sober enough to bring to Olympus that night. Well, that was probably for the best. She needed to get with Hera and Athena again and decide the best way to move Kat into Achilles\u2019 camp. Kat would need to have some kind of royal status... or perhaps one of them could appear to Achilles and foretell the coming of a priestess who would need his protection...</p><p>Venus sighed. This might be more complicated than she\u2019d originally thought it would be. But no matter. She\u2019d just use the oracle to follow Kat home\u2014make note of where the mortal woman lived\u2014and then pay her a little divine visit on the morrow.</p><p>Smiling, Venus turned her attention back to the oracle in time to see the huge Suburban run through the stop sign and crash into the little yellow car that held Kat and Jacqueline.</p><p>\u201cNo! Stop!\u201d Venus screamed, instantly throwing the power she\u2019d been generating through her oracle to protect and surround the car, freezing time temporarily so that the scene looked like a gruesome painting. But even as she gave the command she knew it was already too late. Venus drew a deep breath and waved her hands over the oracle. \u201cLet me see Katrina and Jacqueline,\u201d she said solemnly.</p><p>The oracle\u2019s vision telescoped inside the crushed car. Venus\u2019s breath caught in a sob of sympathy. The women must have seen the accident coming. They\u2019d thrown their arms around each other so that now they looked like broken dolls clinging to one another. Kat had a horrid gash on her head and her neck was turned in an unnatural angle. Jacqueline was closest to the spot of impact. Her chest had been completely crushed.</p><p>The two women were dead.</p><p>Venus felt a terrible sense of loss out of all proportion with how briefly she\u2019d known the mortals. \u201cI should have been paying closer attention. I should have been able to stop it from happening,\u201d she whispered in a tired, broken voice. \u201cThey were so young\u2014so vibrant. Their lives were cut off too soon.\u201d As the goddess watched, two glowing golden orbs lifted from the broken bodies of the mortal women. Venus\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMaybe there is something I can do!\u201d Focusing her power she spoke the command through her oracle.</p><p>\u201cAlight with life and love these spirits are\u2014free to begin anew, to travel far. So Love herself commands of you\u2014spirits, come to me to complete the task I would have you do!\u201d Venus threw more power into the oracle and, like a flame drawing the mortals fluttering spirits, the souls of Katrina and Jacqueline lifted immediately to enter the stream of energy the goddess created until, with a sound like a champagne bottle being uncorked, they popped through the marble basin to hover in the air in front of the goddess.</p><p>When she glanced back through her portal she saw the yellow car burst into fierce flame.</p><p>Venus sighed. \u201cWell, darlings, now what are we going to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You did what!\u201d Athena sputtered (unattractively, Venus noted) as she stared wide-eyed at the glowing orbs that held the two mortal spirits.</p><p>\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t just let them die!\u201d Venus said defensively, patting the orb that floated closest to her. \u201cIt was just too awful and too soon. They\u2019re both so young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMortals die. Period. You shouldn\u2019t have interfered with what Fate decreed for them,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOh, please! These are modern mortals. They don\u2019t believe in Fate.\u201d</p> <p>Hera rushed into Venus\u2019s oracle chamber. \u201cWhat has happened? I came as soon as the satyr gave me the emergency message and I\u2014\u201d The goddess broke off as she caught sight of the floating orbs. Her smooth brow wrinkled. \u201cAre those mortal spirits?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are indeed,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cWell, what ever are they doing here? Are they lost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They are not lost. They are the spirits of two modern mortal women and Venus brought them here.\u201d</p><p>Venus frowned at Athena. \u201cAre you having regular orgasms, Athena? If not, that could be why you\u2019re always so grumpy and judgmental.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVenus!\u201d Hera\u2019s voice was sharp, reminding the Goddess of Love that she was in the presence of the Queen of Olympus. \u201cWhy are the spirits of modern mortals in this chamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of them\u201d\u2014Venus paused, studied the orbs and finally pointed at the one closest to her\u2014\u201cthis one, I think, is the spirit of the mortal woman I have chosen to help us out with our Achilles problem. The other is her best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich still doesn\u2019t explain why their souls are here in Olympus instead of in their bodies back in the modern mortal world where they belong,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be in their bodies because their bodies are dead,\u201d Athena said. \u201cActually, burned to nothing but ash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurned? Dead? But how could you choose a burned-up dead mortal for Achilles?\u201d Hera rubbed her temple with one hand; the other she waved gracefully before her, plucking the goblet of ambrosia out of the air when it appeared and taking a long drink of it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all really very easy to explain,\u201d Venus said, sending Athena a dark look.</p> <p>\u201cThen explain. Please,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI chose the mortal woman for Achilles when she was alive. Then there was an accident while she and her friend were leaving a party and, well, they were killed. I simply could not stand it. They were so young and happy. And,\u201d she added pointedly, \u201cKat was so completely perfect for Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you brought their bodiless spirits here?\u201d Hera paused and sighed. \u201cVenus, I understand how easy it is to get attached to mortals, but you didn\u2019t do these women a favor. They should be on their way to the Afterlife that awaits them. There is nothing we can\u2014\u201d Abruptly Hera\u2019s voice broke off. A look of shock passed over her lovely face and the goblet of ambrosia slid through her hand to shatter on the marble floor.</p><p>\u201cHera! What is it?\u201d Venus cried as she and Athena rushed to her side.</p><p>The goddess\u2019s face had gone horribly white. \u201cMy priestesses! They are sobbing for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere, sit. Breathe deeply and tell us what has happened.\u201d Venus guided Hera over to a soft chaise as Athena conjured a fresh goblet of ambrosia, which she held to Hera\u2019s lips, but the goddess waved the drink away.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Greeks. They are sacking my temple that rests just outside the westernmost wall of Troy.\u201d She passed a shaky hand over her eyes as if to wipe the image from her mind. Hera looked up at the two goddesses. \u201cI don\u2019t understand this. My temples do not get sacked. I am Goddess of the Home and Hearth, Goddess of Marriage and Family, Queen of Olympians. There is no reason to defile me.\u201d Hera weaved a little like she was going to faint. \u201cI have to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are sitting down,\u201d Athena said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Sweat broke out over the goddess\u2019s too white face. \u201cMy priestesses are beseeching me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d Venus sat heavily on the bench next to Hera, took the ambrosia goblet from Athena and drained it in one gulp. \u201cI\u2019m Goddess of Love. People fornicate in my temples, which I don\u2019t consider defilement. Once in a while a bereft lover\u2014a slightly crazy one at that\u2014will hurl himself on his sword, but that really can\u2019t be helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what to do.\u201d</p><p>Venus and Hera looked up to see Athena putting on the war helmet that had just materialized.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to remind you that I am Goddess of War?\u201d</p><p>Venus and Hera shook their heads in tandem.</p><p>\u201cThen let us go. No one defiles one of our temples and gets away with it.\u201d Athena\u2019s hard gray eyes narrowed. \u201cOr you two could stay here. Zeus will probably be angry that I\u2019ve become involved.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Hera stood. Her knees were clearly unsteady, but her voice was sharp as flint. \u201cZeus and his orders to stay out of it be damned! No one who attacks my priestesses will go unpunished.\u201d</p><p>Venus and Hera exchanged a glance. \u201cWe\u2019re going with you,\u201d said the Goddess of Love. \u201cIf Zeus is going to be angry, let him be angry at all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it,\u201d Athena said. \u201cStay close to me.\u201d</p><p>Before the three goddesses disappeared Venus waved her hand in the direction of her oracle and a shimmering circle appeared around it, holding the two spirit orbs safely within its shell.</p><p>They materialized in the aftermath of destruction.</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Hera sobbed. Then she straightened her spine and pressed her lips tightly together. \u201cThese are my women. I cannot fail them,\u201d the goddess said grimly before beginning to move toward the first of the crumpled bodies.</p><p>\u201cStay with her. I\u2019ll deal with the butchers who are still here,\u201d Athena told Venus before striding swiftly from the room toward the distant shrieks and muffled cries that were coming from the exterior of the temple.</p><p>Feeling sick to her stomach, Venus joined Hera as she bent over a woman\u2019s broken body. As were the rest of the women in this interior room of the temple, the dead mortal was wearing the sky blue linen robes of those who swear to the service of the Queen of Olympus. Venus thought that the fresh scarlet of her blood looked grotesque and a supreme defilement in this temple of Hera\u2019s that was usually filled with the soothing colors of pastels, the lovely scent of sweet incense and the music of women\u2019s laughing voices.</p><p>\u201cShe was one of my most elderly priestesses.\u201d Hera\u2019s voice was thick with tears. \u201cShe tended this temple for more than forty years.\u201d The goddess touched the dead woman\u2019s head. \u201cLet your journey to the Elysian Fields be swift and peaceful,\u201d she murmured, and the air around them stirred with the power of Hera\u2019s prayer. Hera looked at Venus. \u201cWe must bless all of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Venus squeezed her friend and queen\u2019s hand, and then the two of them began to make their way from body to body, bestowing on each fallen priestess an eternal blessing for peace and happiness.</p><p>It was at the base of Hera\u2019s statue in the innermost sanctum that they found them\u2014two young women who had died with their arms wrapped protectively around each other. The dark-haired woman had a ghastly head wound. The blonde who had joined her in death had been skewered through the chest by a sword.</p><p>\u201cSacrilege! Blasphemy!\u201d Hera hissed the words, her sorrow and horror at last being replaced by righteous anger. \u201cThese two aren\u2019t even my priestesses. Clearly they were here beseeching my blessing.\u201d The goddess pointed to the spilled goblet of wine and the broken jar of honey that lay discarded and ruined beside their bodies.</p><p>\u201cShe looks familiar.\u201d Venus pointed to the dark-haired woman. \u201cIsn\u2019t that lovely purple and gold trim on her stola worn only by those of the royal house of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHera!\u201d Athena\u2019s shout interrupted them. The gray-eyed goddess burst into the inner room. She was spattered with blood and carrying a young, blue-robed woman in her arms. The woman groaned and, with a strangled cry, Hera rushed to her, helping Athena to lay her gently on the marble floor. The Queen of Olympus used her lap to pillow the fallen woman\u2019s head.</p><p>Venus peered down at the woman\u2014and realized she was really only a girl, barely out of puberty. She had a terrible sword slash in her upper arm, which was flooding her and Hera in bright rivulets of fresh blood. Her eyes were closed, but she moaned again, proving she was definitely alive.</p><p>\u201cWho did this?\u201d Hera\u2019s voice was cold and hard.</p><p>\u201cThey were Agamemnon\u2019s men. This girl told me that most of them had already taken the priestesses of their choice and returned to the Greek camp. I made sure that the few who lingered will be camping in the darkened regions of the Underworld tonight,\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>\u201cWe must heal her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHeal her?\u201d Athena frowned.</p><p>\u201cYes, the three of us. We must heal her,\u201d the Queen of Olympus repeated, looking beseechingly at her two friends.</p><p>\u201cDid you want us to turn her into a graceful tree or perhaps an ever-flowing fountain to symbolize your weeping?\u201d Athena asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, I want you to help me heal her. She stays as she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery unusual,\u201d Athena said. \u201cWe usually save mortals by changing them into something else.\u201d</p><p>Venus rolled her eyes. \u201cYou really need to loosen up.\u201d Resolutely she grasped Hera\u2019s hand, then held her other hand out for Athena. \u201cYes, healing the child is exactly what we will do,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>The Goddess of War frowned and muttered, \u201cThis isn\u2019t usually how it\u2019s done,\u201d but took the goddess\u2019s offered hand in hers, and then completed the divine circle by holding Hera\u2019s hand, too.</p><p>Venus was just composing a lovely healing rhyme in her mind when Hera\u2019s angry voice shot out.</p><p>\u201cHear me, Fate. With the power of this goddess circle I do erase this mortal child\u2019s wound and command that she survive this brutal attack!\u201d</p><p>Venus and Athena gasped as they felt the immediate electric drain of divine power course through their palms and slam into the girl priestess who still lay with her eyes closed in Hera\u2019s lap. The girl\u2019s back bowed as her body glowed, and then, just as suddenly as it had happened, the light and power were gone, and with a small cry, the girl sat up. Automatically her hand lifted to feel the ugly wound on her arm\u2014then her eyes widened as she found nothing but healthy, newly healed skin there. Her gaze went immediately to Hera.</p><p>\u201cMy Goddess!\u201d she cried in a soft, musical voice. \u201cIt is you. I thought I was being granted a beautiful dream before my death.\u201d</p><p>Hera smiled and touched the girl\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou shall not die today, child. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleithyia,\u201d she said, bowing her head down so that it touched the floor beside Hera. \u201cForgive me for not protecting your temple, Great Goddess!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet daughter Eleithyia, this desecration is not your fault. I do not expect my priestesses to battle warriors! Arise, child, and have no fear that you have displeased me. I only wish I had known about this defilement sooner so that I could have saved the other priestesses.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, the girl raised her head to stare with wide, adoring eyes at Hera. \u201cWe had no warning. For all these years the Greeks have left the temples outside the city walls in peace. There was no reason to believe that they would attack so suddenly.\u201d Eleithyia bit her lip to keep from crying.</p><p>\u201cEleithyia, you said Agamemnon\u2019s men stole Hera\u2019s priestesses?\u201d Athena said.</p><p>The girl bowed her head respectfully to Athena before answering. \u201cThat is what they said, Athena. First they came pretending to be nonviolent. Their leader, Talthybios, said that Agamemnon was angry. His war bride, Khryseis, had been returned to her father, and Achilles refused to part with his own war bride, Briseis, so they were looking for a fair young maiden to take her place and appease their king.\u201d</p><p>Athena nodded her head. \u201cI heard Artemis speaking of this. Khryseis is daughter to one of Apollo\u2019s favorite priests. Artemis was so angered by this that she rained darkness and death over the Greek camp until they returned the girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cArtemis and Apollo do get very upset when either has been insulted,\u201d Venus said. \u201cIt\u2019s that whole twin mentality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, we all know how touchy the two of them can be,\u201d Hera said impatiently. \u201cBut did you note that the trouble always harkens back to Achilles?\u201d The other two goddesses nodded, in complete agreement once again with their queen. \u201cGo on, Eleithyia. You were saying that the Greeks came to the temple after Khryseis had been returned to her father,\u201d Hera prompted.</p><p>Eleithyia ran a shaky hand over her brow. \u201cYes, they were so charming and handsome that, at first, we thought they only jested about coming to take us away, and we laughed with them. Of course we explained to them that those of us sworn to the service of the Great Goddess could not become war-prize brides. They seemed to understand. Then they saw Leis.\u201d She paused. Shuddering she drew a deep breath before she could continue. \u201cLeis is a great beauty and only recently sworn to your service, Goddess.\u201d</p><p>Hera nodded. \u201cI do, indeed, remember the fair Leis taking her vows.\u201d A shadow crossed the goddess\u2019s lovely face. \u201cBut I do not remember seeing her body amongst the dead. Is she here?\u201d</p><p>Eleithyia shook her head, tears leaking down her cheeks. \u201cNo. The Greeks took her. We tried to stop them, and the men became outraged that we would reject them. They cut down any of us who got in their way.\u201d The girl\u2019s shoulders shook but she forced herself to talk through her sobs. \u201cThey even defiled your innermost sanctuary, Great Goddess. They found the princess there, and murdered her at the base of your statue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why she looked familiar to me. They\u2019ve killed King Priam\u2019s youngest daughter, Polyxena!\u201d Venus said.</p><p>Eleithyia nodded. \u201cThe princess\u2019s handmaiden, Melia, comes here often to pray for your aid in ending the war so that her mistress\u2019s marriage with the young king of Sardis can finally take place. Today Polyxena accompanied Melia to pour libations and burn incense.\u201d Tears flooding her face, Eleithyia looked up at her goddess. \u201cThe Greeks struck the princess with less remorse than they would have cut down one of their horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a terrible waste,\u201d Hera said. \u201cShe was so young\u2014had so much of her life yet to live. It couldn\u2019t have been Fate\u2019s plan to have her leave the mortal realm so soon.\u201d</p><p>Venus\u2019s sudden gasp had Hera looking questioningly up at her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s our answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat ever are you babbling about?\u201d Athena snapped.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perfect, really.\u201d Venus pointed to the inner sanctum. \u201cThere are two bodies right in there. Two lovely, young, soulless bodies. And in my temple I just happen to be the proud possessor of two bodiless souls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not implying we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m not implying,\u201d Venus interrupted Athena. \u201cI\u2019m saying outright. We just fixed up Eleithyia\u2019s body with no problem. The three of us can certainly do the same to Polyxena and Melia. Then I retrieve the modern mortal souls, place them in the new bodies, and Polyxena becomes Achilles\u2019 new war bride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Goddess, Achilles already has Briseis for a war-prize bride,\u201d Eleithyia said in her sweet, shy voice.</p><p>Venus smiled down at her. \u201cNot after your goddess pays a little visit to Agamemnon, he won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cCertainly. You\u2019re Goddess of Marriage. You\u2019ll simply appear to Agamemnon and tell him that his worries would be so much less if he had his war bride replaced, and you happen to know that Briseis would make the perfect little bride for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know the girl. And I certainly cannot stand that wretched Agamemnon and his overbearing arrogance,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cIt may just work,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOf course it will work.\u201d Venus smiled approval at Athena. \u201cWhile Hera is appearing to Agamemnon you\u2019ll be paying the lovely Thetis a visit. Have her tell her son that she wants him to withdraw from the battle because of the disrespect Agamemnon has shown him in stealing his bride. Then mention as a little aside that she has arranged for a new war bride for him\u2014a royal maiden who meets with her approval because she\u2019s not like the typical silly women he\u2019s used to. That should intrigue him.\u201d</p><p>Athena narrowed her shrewd gray eyes at the Goddess of Love. \u201cIn the meantime you will be readying our Polyxena for the role she will play in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. She needs to keep Achilles busy\u2014too busy to consider rejoining the battle. She can also work on that nasty temper of his and perhaps love, or an earthy, lusty version of love, can reach the man inside the beast.\u201d Venus grinned mischievously. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Zeus prophesized Achilles\u2019 early end years ago, then he probably forgot all about it. You know how busy the King of Olympus is. If Achilles himself were to turn from his fated future, Zeus would, more than likely, allow his destiny to change.\u201d Venus grinned at Hera. \u201cEspecially if Zeus\u2019s wife were to exert some of her influence\u201d\u2014the Goddess of Love purred the word\u2014\u201con her husband.\u201d</p><p>Hera sighed. \u201cYour plan sounds convoluted, complex and open to errors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly why it is so perfect, darling,\u201d Venus said. \u201cLove is never simplistic, and Love is running this show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay all the gods and goddesses help us,\u201d Athena muttered.</p><p>Venus ignored her. \u201cSo, do we fix up those bodies for the two souls, or do we just stand here looking beautiful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get to work. I\u2019ve had more than enough of the Trojan War,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cAt least that is something with which all three of us agree,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>The three goddesses strode into Hera\u2019s inner sanctum with the utterly confused Eleithyia trailing after them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I don\u2019t know why we have to heal both bodies. The mortal woman you\u2019ve chosen for Achilles is going to take Polyxena\u2019s body. Shouldn\u2019t we just send the other on her way to wherever it is dead modern mortals go?\u201d Athena said.</p><p>Venus shook her head in disgust. \u201cAthena, you need more girlfriends. We\u2019re going to zap a modern mortal into an ancient princess\u2019s body and ask her to do our bidding. Oh, and, by the way, that little memory she has of an accident where she and her best friend are killed? Well, yes, that\u2019s unfortunate, but whatever. We needed her, so her best friend is toast. She should just go about our business and forget about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe problem with that is?\u201d Athena said. \u201cAnd what does toast have to do with it?\u201d</p><p>Venus rolled her lovely eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just an expression. A modern mortal expression that means done, over with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the problem with asking one mortal do so something for us without including her friend is that modern mortal women are different than ancient women,\u201d Hera explained patiently. \u201cThey\u2019re independent and smart and not used to bowing down and taking orders. Actually, now that I think about it, they\u2019re a lot like goddesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly what I\u2019ve been trying to tell her,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like that.\u201d Athena frowned.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like the lines that will start appearing on your face if you don\u2019t stop frowning so much,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to like what happens if you rouse the anger of the Goddess of War,\u201d Athena said.</p> <p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Hera\u2019s voice shot out, ringing powerfully against the walls of her temple. Then she closed her eyes briefly and drew a deep breath. \u201cYour bickering is getting in the way of what we must do here. More importantly, it\u2019s giving me a headache.\u201d The Queen of the Gods glanced at little Eleithyia, who was cowering in a corner. \u201cAnd you\u2019re scaring my priestess, who has already had enough stress for one day.\u201d</p><p>Venus and Athena muttered apologies.</p><p>\u201cNow, let us get this done.\u201d Hera gave the two goddesses one more severe look before turning to Eleithyia. \u201cWe\u2019ll need a ceremonial goblet filled with the temple\u2019s very best wine. Can you get that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Goddess!\u201d Recovering quickly now that she was given a familiar task, the young priestess scampered off, returning only moments later with a golden goblet filled with rich red wine.</p><p>\u201cVery good.\u201d Hera nodded her approval. Then she approached the bodies of Polyxena and her maidservant, motioning for Venus and Athena to join her. \u201cBring the goblet here, Eleithyia, and stand before the bodies. When I begin the healing spell, raise the goblet so that the wine can be filled with our power. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Goddess.\u201d The young priestess moved into place.</p> <p>\u201cLet us join in a circle of divine power.\u201d The three goddesses solemnly clasped hands around the fallen princess of Troy and her servant. \u201cConcentrate on the wine in the goblet,\u201d Hera told them. Then she cleared her throat and recited the spell:</p><p>\u201cJoined together with a single mind,</p><p>goddesses three our powers we do bind.\u201d</p><p>Eleithyia gasped as the wine in the goblet she had lifted above her head began to glow with such a brilliant light that it shined in reflection off the distant domed ceiling of the temple.</p><p>\u201cStanding here bathed in conjured light,</p><p>empower this wine with our combined might.</p><p>The gift of healing is what we ask,</p><p>fruit of the vine, accept this as your task.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is hot!\u201d Eleithyia cried, but she didn\u2019t let loose her grip on the glowing goblet.</p><p>\u201cIt is the heat of the breath of life. Quickly, child, pour the wine within the lips of the princess and her servant,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Eleithyia immediately did as her goddess commanded. She bent and carefully poured half of the wine into Polyxena\u2019s slack and bloody lips, and the other half into the young maidservant\u2019s still mouth.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if this is going to work.\u201d Venus frowned as most of the wine ran down the pale cheeks of dead women. \u201cMaybe we should\u2014\u201d</p><p>Polyxena gasped and then drew a deep, almost painful sounding breath. Shortly after, Melia\u2019s chest began to rise and fall, too.</p><p>\u201cKeep focused,\u201d Hera reminded them before completing the spell.</p><p>\u201cWounds mend\u2014health return</p><p>the spark of mortal life within them burn!\u201d</p><p>As the goddesses and the priestess watched, the terrible gash on Polyxena\u2019s head faded, and then disappeared at the same time Melia\u2019s gaping chest wound shimmered and closed so that the two women lay perfectly healed, though the only movement in their eerily still bodies was their slow, steady breathing.</p><p>Eleithyia fell to her knees and bowed her head. \u201cIt worked! You have healed them.\u201d</p><p>Hera touched her priestess\u2019s cheeks softly. \u201cOnly their bodies, child. Their souls are journeying to the Elysian Fields. They are but empty shells.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it just so happens that I have two mortal souls in desperate need of shells,\u201d Venus said. \u201cShall I get them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but Athena and I need to make our visits to Agamemnon and Thetis first.\u201d</p><p>Athena frowned at the newly healed bodies. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you do something about all that blood and such before you put the mortal souls in there? I\u2019m no expert on modern mortals, but I do believe that any woman would be quite upset awakening to this mess.\u201d The goddess made a general gesture at the blood-spattered temple.</p><p>\u201cUgh. As much as I hate to admit it, you\u2019re right.\u201d Venus sighed. Then she fluttered her fingers absently at Athena and Hera. \u201cGo on, don\u2019t worry about this. I\u2019ll conjure some satyrs to take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSatyrs?\u201d Hera said. \u201cAren\u2019t they rather messy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course\u2014nothing makes a mess like a rutting satyr, which is why they\u2019re so good at clean-ups. They\u2019re used to it.\u201d</p><p>Hera and Athena gave Venus twin looks of confusion.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I clean up after all those orgies, do you?\u201d Venus shook her head in disgust. \u201cI\u2019m their goddess, not their mother.\u201d</p><p>Athena snorted.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave this to Love, shall we?\u201d Hera guided Athena from the room before the goddesses could start bickering again. \u201cHave the little beasts clean quickly\u2014this shouldn\u2019t take long,\u201d she called back over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhy is it that Love always gets stuck with the mess?\u201d Venus muttered.</p><p>\u201cCould it be because love can be so messy?\u201d Eleithyia asked with a sweet, innocent smile.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re obviously new to this whole priestess thing, so I won\u2019t blast you into nonexistence for calling me messy.\u201d</p><p>Eleithyia gasped and looked like she was going to burst into tears.</p><p>Venus sighed. \u201cNot to worry. That was just a little divine humor. Let\u2019s get the satyrs to work, shall we?\u201d The goddess glanced down at the two bodies that awaited souls. \u201cAnd while I\u2019m thinking about it I better come up with some new clothes for these two. All that blood will never come out...\u201d She continued to mutter to herself as she conjured an entire herd of industrious satyrs and began putting the temple to order.</p><p>Hera materialized within the innermost chamber of Agamemnon\u2019s voluminous tents. Except for the young, hairless boy who was oiling the king\u2019s dark, perfectly curled hair, they were alone.</p><p>\u201cThe Goddess Hera!\u201d The boy shrieked and dropped instantly to the ground, pressing his face to the richly carpeted floor. Agamemnon merely bowed\u2014and not low enough for Hera\u2019s taste. She pointedly ignored the king and touched the back of the boy\u2019s blond head.</p><p>\u201cArise, child. I wish to speak with your king alone, but know that you go with my blessing.\u201d Hera waited until the boy left the room before turning her attention to Agamemnon. She took her time studying him, knowing that it annoyed him to keep his head bowed before her. She noted how he\u2019d swathed himself in gold and had to force herself not to grimace with distaste. Did the man think he was a god?</p><p>If so, he was vastly mistaken.</p><p>\u201cArise, Agamemnon. I come with glad news,\u201d Hera finally said.</p><p>\u201cGreat Goddess, do you bring a message from the mighty Zeus?\u201d</p><p>Hera\u2019s eyes flashed with anger and her voice sizzled with power so tangible it brushed, crackling, against the arrogant mortal\u2019s skin. \u201cI am not a messenger for my husband!\u201d</p><p>This time Agamemnon\u2019s bow was low and obsequious and much more appropriate. \u201cForgive me! I did not mean to offend the Queen of the Gods.\u201d</p><p>Hera curled one lip delicately. \u201cMores the pity you don\u2019t mean offense because it comes so naturally to you. Heed my warning, Greek king, your arrogance will be your doom.\u201d Happily, she saw him pale. \u201cBut, no matter.\u201d She waved her hand graciously, motioning for him to rise. \u201cThe news I bring has to do with your empty bed.\u201d Although Hera remembered the slender, hairless boy and wondered just how empty the king\u2019s bed had been.</p><p>\u201cIndeed, Goddess, my war prize was returned to appease the golden twins. Though I meant no disrespect by claiming Khryseis, it seems her father disapproved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKhryseis was no good for you. A king should have a worthy prize. Only Briseis is beautiful enough for one such as you.\u201d Silently Hera promised herself that she would look up poor Briseis after this whole debacle was finished and grant the girl a boon to make up for sharing this blustering fool\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cBriseis! She is lovely, but she belongs to Achilles.\u201d The king\u2019s expression turned sly. \u201cAlthough I hear all that beauty is wasted on him. Achilles frightens maidens.\u201d</p><p>Ah, Hera thought, then the rumors about Achilles are true. \u201cExactly why Briseis would do better with you.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon stroked his thick beard contemplatively. \u201cTrue... true... but still, Achilles\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Achilles or Agamemnon rule here?\u201d Hera interrupted.</p><p>\u201cI rule the Greeks!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen claim the war prize that most suits you,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Agamemnon met the goddess\u2019s gaze. \u201cMay I do so with your blessing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. And to help soothe Achilles\u2019 well-known rage, I shall arrange for a bedmate to be sent to him. This new war bride will be unlike other women. You should know that she has my very special blessing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bow to your will, Great Goddess,\u201d Agamemnon said.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Then send your men for Briseis immediately.\u201d While Agamemnon bowed, Hera clapped her hands and disappeared in a rush of glittering blue smoke.</p><p>Thetis curtseyed respectfully to Athena. Then, hastily conjuring ambrosia and cushioned chairs made of mother of pearl, she motioned for the gray-eyed goddess to sit.</p><p>\u201cRest yourself, Athena. To what do I owe this\u2014\u201d Her words broke when she realized that the goddess was blood-spattered and hard-eyed. \u201cBy Poseidon\u2019s trident! What has happened?\u201d</p><p>Athena waved a dismissive hand at the bloodstains, which instantly disappeared. \u201cIt is all because of the tedium of the Trojan War. We have decided it must end.\u201d</p><p>Thetis\u2019s beautiful face drained of its alluring peach color. \u201cMy son is fated to die in the Trojan War. If it is coming to an end, then so is his life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what I\u2019m here to speak with you about. We have an idea that may prove mutually beneficial to all of us. We believe the Trojan War can be ended without your son\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, Goddess. I will do anything to save my son,\u201d Thetis said, recovering some of her color. Then she added, \u201cWho is we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHera, Venus and me.\u201d</p><p>Thetis\u2019s blue eyes widened. \u201cThree such powerful goddesses joined with one purpose!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t always an easy alliance, but we three do have one thing very much in common\u2014we are well and truly sick of this war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Thetis said firmly. \u201cWe four are allied by this purpose, if there is some way my son can be spared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me, Thetis, is your son still pleased with the choice he made to end his life too soon?\u201d Athena asked.</p><p>Thetis chewed her full bottom lip while she considered. \u201cAchilles won\u2019t speak of it directly, but I know him well. Over the past years he has become increasingly unhappy. Did you know he hasn\u2019t taken a lover in almost a decade?\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>Thetis nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s the berserker rage that overtakes him\u2014women are frightened of him because of it. My son would never force himself on a woman, so he lives out the short time that remains to him alone except for his Myrmidons, and even they are becoming leery of him. I can feel my son\u2019s sorrow and I believe he keeps moving toward his fate only because the life he\u2019s living brings him nothing but loneliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this war-prize bride who lives in his tent, she is not his lover?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBriseis is a beautiful young woman who is as frightened of my son as all of the rest of them have been, even though he has only treated her with kindness,\u201d Thetis said.</p><p>Athena\u2019s smooth brow wrinkled in thought. \u201cBut if he\u2019s kind to her, you would think that she would eventually accept him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never seen the berserker rage possess him, have you?\u201d Thetis asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thetis shuddered. \u201cIt is a thing terrible to behold. He is no longer my Achilles when it comes upon him. He becomes a monster, a beast, a physical manifestation of pure rage set only on violence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the bedroom is not the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny strong emotion can bring on the berserker,\u201d Thetis said. She shook her head sadly. \u201cThere is no mortal woman who would be willing to look beyond the rage and see the man, especially now that he has become so battle scarred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle scarred?\u201d Athena tried to think when was the last time she had actually seen Achilles, and decided it hadn\u2019t been since he was a boy on this very beach. \u201cBut he was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe used to be, but his victories in battle after battle have come with a price. He is not invulnerable, you know,\u201d Thetis said defensively. \u201cHe is mortal. It is only when his rage is awakened that the berserker claims him.\u201d The sea goddess wiped away a tear that had slipped down her cheek. \u201cSometimes it takes a lot for his rage to be awakened, and his body shows the remnants of a young life filled with blood and death.\u201d Thetis dropped to her knees before Athena. \u201cI beseech you, Athena, as I did the day this horror was placed upon him, help my son break free of his terrible fate.\u201d</p><p>Athena took Thetis\u2019s hand, pulling her gently to her feet. \u201cI may be able to finally answer that prayer. Can you get Achilles to withdraw from the fighting, even for just a little while?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout a reason?\u201d</p><p>Athena considered for a moment, then asked, \u201cAchilles is less impetuous than he was as a boy, but is he still as proud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, I believe he is.\u201d</p><p>Athena smiled one of her rare smiles. \u201cThen I can give you a reason for Achilles to withdraw. Listen carefully...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I like the lovely wine color of these robes, don\u2019t you?

That\u2019s why I wasn\u2019t asking you. Now run along and finish wiping the last of that blood off the floor.\u201d Venus patted the creature\u2019s cheek to take the sting from her words. \u201cEleithyia, I was asking you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, Goddess.

Then she frowned at the little priestess. \u201cChild, it is true that this is a servant\u2019s body, but the soul that is going to reside there is definitely not a servant. It\u2019s going to be a big enough shock for poor Jacqueline to wake up in a strange body and find out she has to play the part of maid to her best friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are, of course, the Goddess. I bow to your intelligence and wisdom and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Venus waved away her compliments. \u201cBow later. Right now just tell me that the fabric is perfect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe fabric is perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Venus, the satyrs have done a wonderful job setting my temple aright!\u201d Hera bustled in beaming at the randy woodland creatures and making them wriggle with glee.</p><p>\u201cI told you they were marvelous,\u201d Venus said, blowing kisses at the beasts closest to her.</p><p>\u201cI am surprised that they did such a good job getting out all the blood and gore,\u201d Athena said, materializing not far from Hera.</p><p>\u201cAnd them.\u201d Venus gestured grandly in the direction of the two newly cleaned and clothed bodies. \u201cDon\u2019t you think they look lovely, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mortals look beautiful, as does my temple. Thank you, Venus, for a job well done,\u201d Hera said.</p> <p>\u201cThey are beautiful, though little but empty shells without souls,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>Venus ignored the Goddess of War. \u201cAll went well with Agamemnon?\u201d she asked Hera.</p><p>The Queen of the Gods curled her lip in distaste. \u201cMy opinion of that insufferable man hasn\u2019t changed one bit. I do feel terribly sorry for poor Briseis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means he\u2019s going to take her from Achilles?\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thetis will take care of nudging her son into withdrawing from the battle. She\u2019ll make it a point of pride. Apparently Achilles has matured from the impulsive teenager who chose glory and battle and he is not thrilled with the fate he chose for himself, but he\u2019s still typically prideful. Thetis assured me there will be no problem getting him to withdraw, at least for a short time,\u201d Athena said. \u201cNow all that\u2019s left is for your mortal to work her magic and continue to keep Achilles out of the fray long enough for the Trojans to claim victory and then this whole mess will be ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about my mortal. She\u2019ll do just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Does she speak ancient Greek?\u201d Athena asked pointedly.</p> <p>Venus hesitated only briefly and said, \u201cShe will after I do a little...\u201d The Goddess of Love waggled her fingers, causing glitter to form in the air.</p><p>Athena snorted.</p><p>\u201cVenus, perhaps you could put the souls into the bodies and we could get this business underway?\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes! Of course. Satyrs.\u201d Venus clapped her hands commandingly together. \u201cReturn to Olympus. I\u2019ll send some Nyseideian nymphs to thank you for aiding me.\u201d The hoofed creatures cheered as they disappeared. \u201cAll right. Stand back. Give me room to work.\u201d The Goddess of Love smoothed her long blond hair and then raised her hands, palms up. \u201cI call the mortal spirits I recently made free\u2014Katrina and Jacqueline, I command you come to me!\u201d</p><p>Two glowing orbs popped into the air and floated to rest on Venus\u2019s open palms.</p><p>\u201cFirst I gift you with the language you must know,</p><p>so that as soon as you\u2019re here you\u2019ll be ready to go.</p><p>So now is the time to begin the task I ask of you\u2014</p><p>ensoul these bodies that you may complete the job</p><p>Love would have you do!\u201d</p><p>Venus threw the glowing orbs at the bodies like she was a major league pitcher.</p><p>Kat gasped and choked. She sat up coughing and rubbing a hand across her forehead. Jacky moaned and pressed her hands to her chest in the exact place her wound had been.</p><p>\u201cOh, god, I feel like utter crap,\u201d Kat said. \u201cHow much champagne did I drink, anyway?\u201d She cleared her throat and blinked her eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with my voice and where the hell\u2014\u201d Her words broke off as her vision cleared. She stared, wide-eyed, at three gorgeous women who where watching her like she was a new species of flower that had just bloomed.</p><p>\u201cKat, I think I\u2019m having a heart attack.\u201d Jacky moaned again. \u201cSince when do hangovers feel like heart attacks?\u201d</p><p>Kat pulled her vision from the three ridiculously attractive women and turned to look at the person who lay beside her and who was talking like Jacky, but didn\u2019t sound anything like her and...</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit! Jacqueline? Is that you?\u201d</p><p>The beautiful blonde blinked several times, trying to clear her vision, and continued to rub her chest. \u201cWho else would it be, the goddamn Easter Bunny? Why do you sound wrong? God, am I going deaf, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave no fear, Jacqueline and Katrina. You are safe and well and under our protection,\u201d said the woman who was standing closest to them, and was probably the most stunning of the three.</p><p>Kat closed her eyes and took several deep breaths. \u201cDrunken hysterical dream. I\u2019ll never drink that much champagne again. Promise. Time to wake up now and deal with my horrendous hangover.\u201d She opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are not dreaming, mortal woman,\u201d said the regal looking woman in flowing white robes trimmed in sky blue.</p><p>Then the statuesque woman with the unusual gray eyes stepped forward and spoke. \u201cWe have altered your fate. Instead of allowing you to perish in the modern world we have plucked your souls from your shattered bodies and brought you to the ancient world. You may thank us.\u201d</p><p>The woman who had spoken first frowned severely at the gray-eyed woman. \u201cGive it a rest, Athena. They don\u2019t need to thank us. It\u2019s not like they asked for this. And besides that, the whole abasing yourself before the gods thing doesn\u2019t work in the modern mortal world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t the modern mortal world,\u201d snapped the gray-eyed woman.</p><p>\u201cReally? I hadn\u2019t noticed. I thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what the fuck?\u201d Jacqueline said, sitting up.</p><p>\u201cJacky?\u201d Kat ignored the bickering women and turned to face her friend.</p><p>\u201cKat? Is that you in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not you. I mean, you\u2019re nothing like you. And what the hell are you wearing?\u201d Jacky reached out to touch a drape of the burgundy-colored robe and her eyes became riveted on her hand. \u201cKatrina Marie Campbell, what is going on? Why. Is. This. My. Hand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can explain everything,\u201d said the regal woman. She nodded to the most gorgeous one. \u201cGo ahead, Venus; explain everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s really quite simple. You two got in a horrid accident after you left your girlfriend party. I\u2019d been watching you through my oracle.\u201d She paused and smiled. \u201cI am Venus, Goddess of Sensual Love, Beauty and the Erotic Arts.\u201d She pointed to the gray-eyed woman. \u201cThis is Athena, Goddess of War, blah, blah.\u201d Then she gestured to the regal woman. \u201cAnd this is Hera, Queen of Olympus. Anyway, as I was saying, I\u2019d been watching you through my oracle and I witnessed your accident. I just couldn\u2019t let you die like that, so I snatched up your souls. Not long after that, Hera\u2019s temple was defiled and Polyxena, Princess of Troy, and her, uh, maidservant, Melia, were killed. So we did some quick thinking, quick healing, and quick re-ensouling. And here you are\u2014yourselves, but in different bodies. See, I told you it was really quite simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I\u2014I\u2014\u201d Kat sputtered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m white!\u201d Jacqueline sprang to her feet, staring down at her new body. \u201cOh, Jesus god-fucking-bless America! Jesus! Jesus! I feel faint. My heart! Kat! I\u2019m dying!\u201d She reached out blindly and Kat hurried to her side, gripping her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dying. We\u2019re dreaming. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy in the goddamn hell would I dream I\u2019m white?\u201d Jacky cried as she clutched Kat with one hand and fanned herself with the other. \u201cMy heart, lord, my heart. The pain!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarlings, I told you that you\u2019re not dreaming,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with being white?\u201d Athena asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a drunken nightmare,\u201d Kat said, trying to stay calm and use her best counselor\u2019s voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll wake up in a second and find out that we passed out in your living room, again. Remember last New Year\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>Venus stepped up to Kat and Jacky. She sighed heavily. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do this, but you need to accept what has happened.\u201d She waggled her slender fingers until the air began to glow with diamond dust and then she flicked the dust at them saying, \u201cRemember...\u201d</p><p>Kat breathed in the sparkling dust with Jacky, sneezed, and was suddenly taken back to the aftermath of Susie\u2019s party. As if watching a macabre play, she saw the two of them stumble, laugh, and hold onto each other as she and Jacky got into the cab. The cab drove down Reservoir Hill to the four-way stop. Horrified, Kat saw an SUV run the stop sign and smash into them. There was a soundless pause, then with an awful whooshing the cab burst into flames.</p><p>\u201cOh, god! We\u2019re dead!\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re dead and I\u2019m white!\u201d Jacky said. \u201cThis just can\u2019t be right. I was sure I was going to heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, me, too. I\u2019m supposed to be going to heaven, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno \u2019bout that, Kat. Remember your sorority girl days? The TU quarterback on the fifty-yard line? That kind of behavior adds up. That\u2019s all I\u2019m sayin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cTake that back! I cannot believe you think I\u2019m going to hell because of a few college indiscreetnesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndiscreetnesses? Is that even a word? And you\u2019re not just goin\u2019 to hell\u2014you sucked me down here with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, did it ever occur to you that you may have gotten me sucked down to hell? What about all those times you returned shoes? You said you never wore them but you really paid way more than you could afford and then wore them a few times and then returned them. Huh? How about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. You know shoes are never a sin. And besides, I haven\u2019t done that in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, months.\u201d</p><p>Kat snorted and put her hands on her hips. \u201cAnd what about your cursing?\u201d she said decisively.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t curse. I use expletives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou use what? That is such a load of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLadies!\u201d Venus stepped between them. \u201cNo one is in hell. You\u2019re dead, but you\u2019re not dead.\u201d The goddess frowned and shook her head as if she needed to clear it. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not as confusing as that. Your bodies are dead. Your souls live on. They\u2019re eternal. They\u2019re the essence that is really you. All I did was to zap them into bodies that are now working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow working? Where are the eternal souls that were in these bodies?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Venus looked uncomfortable and in the silence Hera stepped in. \u201cYou, Katrina, are now dwelling in the body that did belong to Princess Polyxena of Troy. You, Jacqueline, are now dwelling in the body that did belong to Melia, her maidservant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a fucking maid! A white maid! Jesus lord, it just keeps getting worse and worse.\u201d She looked blearily at Kat. \u201cI really did get sucked into hell with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not in hell,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNeither of you are in hell,\u201d Venus said quickly.</p><p>\u201cWhere are the souls that were in these bodies?\u201d Kat asked her again.</p><p>Hera answered before Venus could. \u201cThey are enjoying eternal happiness in the Elysian Fields of the ancient Greek Underworld.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lord, let me sit down. I\u2019m in a dead white servant girl\u2019s body.\u201d Jacky sat heavily on the steps of the altar, fanning herself again.</p><p>Kat was staring down at her body in horror. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see any wounds. What did she die of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lord! An awful plague? Kat, we\u2019re plague-some.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Venus hastily reassured them. \u201cThey didn\u2019t die of any illness. They were killed by Greek warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen where are the wounds?\u201d Kat looked inside her robes, turning this way and that trying to see all of her body.</p><p>\u201cWe healed them before we re-ensouled the bodies with you,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s the first good news I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Jacky said, recovering enough to stop fanning herself. \u201cSo just heal our old bodies and send us back. We\u2019ll forget any of this ever happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do that. Your bodies were completely burned. I took your souls only because I\u2019d already decided to ask you, Kat, to do a small favor for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s see if I have this right,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou were somehow spying on me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd me,\u201d Jacky inserted.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jacky,\u201d Kat continued, \u201cbecause you wanted me to do something for you, but then we died and you grabbed us? This makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course it does darling,\u201d Venus said. \u201cAlthough I certainly don\u2019t think of my oracle as spying. Hera, Athena and I decided we needed the aid of a modern mortal woman. I was given the task of finding her. You seemed perfect. Then the tragic accident happened, but you still seemed perfect. At the same time Hera\u2019s temple was being sacked\u2014two bodies became available\u2014a little zapping here, a little healing there, and here you are, decidedly not dead and still perfect for the little task I need you to perform. And darlings\u201d\u2014Venus included the scowling Jacky in her brilliant smile\u2014\u201cI\u2019m going to grant you each a boon for aiding me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only boon we\u2019re interested in is being put back into our old bodies,\u201d Jacky said firmly. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t mean nasty old burned-up dead bodies. We want to be put back into cleaned-up healed bodies.\u201d She glanced down. \u201cLike these, only ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIt is simply not possible,\u201d Venus said. \u201cYour bodies are beyond even our powers to heal. I\u2019m sorry, but\u2014\u201d Venus began but Hera interrupted her.</p><p>\u201cYou may not have your old bodies back, but between the three of us we can find comparable vessels in your old world,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cCan comparable mean younger and better looking?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cAnd we want final approval,\u201d Jacky added.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish. If you perform the little task we ask of you, and it is your wish, we will return you to the modern world in mortal bodies of your choice.\u201d</p><p>Jacky and Kat exchanged glances, turned their backs on the goddesses and put their heads together. \u201cWonder how Queen Latifah\u2019s feelin\u2019? Maybe she has some kinda terrible wasting disease the goddesses could hurry up,\u201d Jacky whispered hopefully.</p><p>\u201cI was just wondering the same thing about Catherine Zeta-Jones,\u201d Kat said, keeping her voice low. \u201cSo we\u2019ll go for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>They faced the goddesses again. \u201cOkay, fine. All we need to do is this thing for you guys, and you\u2019ll put us back where we belong in the bodies of our choice. Right?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d the three goddesses said.</p><p>\u201cSo what is this thing you need us to do?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cSimple. We want you to end the Trojan War,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cJesus lord! You did take me with you to hell, Kat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Jacky, I think you may be right,\u201d Kat said, plopping down next to her on the altar step. \u201cYou know, we were just talking about The Iliadat Susie\u2019s house. Clearly our tragic deaths have happened and we\u2019ve been thrown into some kind of literary hell. The next thing you know we\u2019ll be sucked into a fucking Thomas Hardy book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThomas Hardy? My god! The pain!\u201d Jacky fanned herself furiously.</p><p>\u201cShit, I\u2019m sorry I got you into this. Shtuping the TU quarterback definitely wasn\u2019t worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I knew having a white best friend would cause me some shit eventually.\u201d Jacky held her very slender, very white arm out despondently. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it would be this bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAgain I would like to ask, what is so terrible about being white?\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cNothing, if you are white,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not.\u201d She sighed. \u201cOr at least I wasn\u2019t before I went to hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Zeus\u2019s beard they are exceedingly stubborn,\u201d Athena said to Venus. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you they\u2019re different than ancient mortals. This is just part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello! Right here\u2014in hell\u2014with you,\u201d Kat said. Then she turned to Jacky. \u201cI wonder what they did to get sent to hell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re gorgeous. Women that gorgeous are always pissing someone off,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, you\u2019re right. Forgot about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they saying that we\u2019ve angered people? We\u2019re goddesses. We don\u2019t anger people; they anger us,\u201d Athena said. She gave Venus a severe look. \u201cTell them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, we can hear you,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cJacqueline! Katrina! You are not in hell. Stop this nonsense at once. And ending the Trojan War won\u2019t be that difficult. We already have a plan of action figured out for you,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cHey, aren\u2019t these the three goddesses who caused the whole Helen/Paris thing?\u201d Jacky said. \u201cYou know, the wedding, the apple, the giving already-married Helen to Paris and whatnot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh. I think you\u2019re right,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDo you see how long that ridiculous rumor has lasted?\u201d Venus told Hera. Then she turned back to the two mortals. \u201cThat is exactly why we\u2019ve had enough of the Trojan War. We\u201d\u2014she gestured at Athena and Hera\u2014\u201cdid not start this war, and we\u2019re sick and tired of being blamed for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo typical for that wretched Agamemnon to blame others,\u201d Hera muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat Venus, Hera and I have decided is that this war has gone on far too long. We want it stopped. Now,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cAnd why do ya think Kat and I could help you with that?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah, sounds like you need to zap some scientists here so they could whip up a lovely weapon or two of mass destruction\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if those can actually ever be found,\u201d Jacky input.</p><p>\u201cAs if,\u201d Kat agreed. \u201cBut if you\u2019re thinking we can do something like that you\u2019ve definitely got us mixed up with someone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, and bringing modern weapons to the ancient world sounds like it\u2019d be messin\u2019 with the Prime Directive or somethin\u2019,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cGod, you are such a dork,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThis is hell, not Star Trek. Although the two do have some odd similarities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, it\u2019s blasphemy like that that got you in this situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles!\u201d Venus blurted. Both mortals turned questioning looks on her. \u201cAchilles is the key to the war going on and on. If he and his Myrmidons withdraw from the battlefield the Greeks won\u2019t be able to sustain the siege of Troy. They\u2019ll lose heart and go home where they belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, not understanding what this has to do with us,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cActually, it has to do with you, Katrina,\u201d Hera said, though she gave Jacky an apologetic look. \u201cYour friend is here because Venus didn\u2019t think the two of you would want to be separated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you so!\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent idea.\u201d Venus looked around the chamber until she spied Eleithyia where she was sitting wide-eyed in a dark alcove. \u201cDarling, would you get us all some wine. It is a rather long story.\u201d The little priestess darted from the room and Venus drew a deep breath. \u201cNow, let me explain everything to you...\u201d</p><p>\"No way is that plan gonna work,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cOf course it will work,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cCome on, get serious. Who ever heard of a therapist saving the world? That didn\u2019t even happen in Buffy,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a buffy?\u201d Athena asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to believe this might not be hell,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou know they know who Buffy is in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a point,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cBy the by, may I just mention that your Buffy comment is every bit as dorky as my love for Star Trek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you up dork me because you\u2019re into both of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t until Spike got all delicious with that nasty sex. God, I\u2019d really like to make him pop like a champagne cork,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a buffy?\u201d Athena asked Venus again.</p><p>Venus shrugged. \u201cYou can\u2019t expect me to know everything about modern mortals.\u201d The goddess took a long, fortifying drink of wine before continuing. \u201cKat, will you help us with our plan?\u201d</p><p>Katrina chewed her bottom lip. \u201cBasically you want me to do a super-duper counseling session with Achilles to help him control his rage while I keep him from fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like they want you to do a super-duper shtuping session with him, too,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Venus ignored her. \u201cAs I explained, Thetis, the mother of Achilles, has already put into motion his withdrawal from the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause his woman, uh Briseis, was taken away from him. And you want me to take her place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cWhose place am I taking?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s, darling,\u201d Venus said. \u201cYou are simply Polyxena\u2019s maidservant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus fucking everlasting god. I almost forgot. Where is that little wine girl? I definitely need a refill.\u201d</p><p>Eleithyia hurried to top off Jacky\u2019s goblet.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me this, Goddess of Love,\u201d Kat said while Jacky drank. \u201cAchilles\u2019 woman just got taken away from him. If that pissed him off enough that he was willing to stop fighting why in the world would you believe that he\u2019d be interested in moving on to another woman? I mean, it sounds like he had a thing for the old one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a love relationship,\u201d Venus said. \u201cAchilles\u2019 pride was hurt by Briseis being taken, not his heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon told me that Briseis\u2019s beauty was wasted on Achilles,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cGreat. Kat, he\u2019s gay,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cGay?\u201d Athena looked utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cAchilles is not gay,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cGay?\u201d Athena repeated, tapping her foot in annoyance.</p><p>\u201cIt means he only shtups other men,\u201d Jacky explained.</p><p>\u201cShtups means fu\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand what that means,\u201d Athena said. \u201cAnd I agree with Venus. Achilles is not gay. But he hasn\u2019t taken a lover in many years, so Briseis was definitely not his lover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cHis mother told me,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cWhy no lover?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s easy to explain,\u201d Athena said. \u201cHe frightens maidens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jacky asked, looking more than a little alarmed.</p><p>\u201cThe berserker rage scares them. Apparently it comes upon him when a passionate emotion is aroused\u2014be it lust or anger,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cYes, and maidens from the ancient world are not equipped to handle such a man, but I know that modern mortal women are different\u2014stronger, smarter, more independent. Also, I heard you say that you counsel men as part of your living. That\u2019s why I chose you.\u201d Venus finished with a big smile for Kat.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not just men I counsel. Actually it\u2019s mostly couples whose marriages are in trouble.\u201d</p><p>Venus waved her hands dismissively. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same. I also heard you described as very optimistic. And you said that you like men. See, you\u2019re perfect for this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she says she wasn\u2019t spying on you,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Athena suddenly added, \u201cThetis mentioned something about Achilles\u2019 horribly scarred visage frightening maidens, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know Achilles was scarred,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Athena shrugged. \u201cApparently they\u2019re battle scars. Thetis said the berserker rage hasn\u2019t always come upon him easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that could be a good thing. It shows that he needs a trigger to make it happen. If I can get him to identify the trigger, then maybe he can disarm it,\u201d Kat said. \u201cSounds like Anger Management 101.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting... You do not seem troubled by the fact that he is scarred,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>Jacky answered before Kat could. \u201cAs Venus keeps tellin\u2019 you, modern women are different. It takes more than a few scars to put us off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think that I have the ability to see beyond the physical,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Jacky said. Then she pointed down at her body. \u201cPresent company excepted. God, do I have to be wearing pink? I hate pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks good on you, though. You really are very pretty, Jacky,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cPretty white,\u201d Jacky muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, really. Is there a mirror around here?\u201d she asked Venus.</p><p>\u201cEleithyia, darling, could you bring us a lovely looking glass?\u201d</p><p>The priestess hurried off and returned quickly with a medium-sized round mirror, framed in bronze. Kat took it from her and held it so Jacky could look at herself.</p><p>\u201cSee?\u201d</p><p>Jacky\u2019s eyes got huge. Her hands went up to her hair. \u201cMy dear sweet baby Jesus, I have tresses. Long, flowing, curling, blond tresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re pretty,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re fucking overwhelming. You know I have not one clue how to take care of white girl hair. Especially not this much white girl hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, darling, don\u2019t worry yourself about that. I can help you. I\u2019m an expert.\u201d Venus shook back her head, causing her own amazing tresses to bounce and shimmer.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in hell. I\u2019m trapped in a romance novel,\u201d Jacky said. Then she leaned closer to the mirror. \u201cAnd my eyes are absolutely sky blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, look at it like this,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIf we\u2019re trapped in a romance novel that means we\u2019re going to be having sex. Probably lots of sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink so?\u201d Jacky said hopefully. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if it was an erotica novel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne can only hope,\u201d Kat said. Then she took a deep breath and turned the mirror so she could look at herself. \u201cOh!\u201d Slowly, she touched her face. \u201cHoly shit, how old am I? I look like a teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you, too, have some tresses,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re black, and not as stunning as mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought black was good,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never understand them,\u201d Hera whispered.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, how old was Polyxena?\u201d Kat asked, still staring at herself.</p><p>\u201cI believe she was approaching eighteen summers,\u201d Hera said. \u201cPrime marrying age, which is why she was here petitioning my aid. She wanted to be betrothed to the King of Sardis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood god, eighteen! That\u2019s way too young,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou are unmarried, are you not, Katrina?\u201d Hera asked politely.</p><p>\u201cTotally unmarried,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cAnd how old were the two of you?\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thirty-six,\u201d Kat said. \u201cOr at least I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a baby, Kat. I\u2019m thirty-eight,\u201d Jacky told Hera. Then she frowned and stuck her face close to Kat\u2019s so she could look at her reflection again. \u201cHuh. I look young, too. No way are we even twenty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpinsters?\u201d Hera said, clearly appalled. \u201cYou chose spinsters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I have said more times than I should have had to: Modern mortal women are different,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>Reflected in the mirror, Jacky\u2019s and Kat\u2019s gazes met.</p><p>\u201cUnattractive old spinster,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDried up old hag,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>And both women burst into gales of laughter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Oh, god, we are funny,\u201d Kat said, leaning against Jacky, who was still giggling and wiping her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWill you help us?\u201d Venus asked.</p><p>Kat looked up at the goddess. \u201cWhat if I do my best, it doesn\u2019t work with Achilles, and he goes back to fighting? My mythology is shaky, but everyone knows he was a famous warrior who was killed because an arrow pierced his heel, the only place he wasn\u2019t invulnerable. He lived to fight and he died fighting.\u201d</p><p>Venus rolled her eyes. \u201cHis heel is the only place he\u2019s vulnerable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRumors,\u201d Hera said, shaking her head. \u201cMore incredibly annoying rumors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the heel thing isn\u2019t true?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cIt makes no sense whatsoever,\u201d Athena said. \u201cHow could piercing his heel kill him, or anyone? Modern mortals will believe anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello! It was written by people back in your day\u2014not by us. The tendon that runs behind the heel was even named after him. A long time ago,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHey, what about that Trojan horse thing?\u201d Jacky asked. The goddesses turned blank looks to her. \u201cThe stupid war was won when, uh...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen the Greeks snuck inside the walls of Troy hiding inside a humongous hollow horse,\u201d Kat finished for her. \u201cOr something like that.\u201d</p><p>Venus shook her head. \u201cFirst we started the war. Then Achilles can only be killed though his ankle. Now there\u2019s a huge horse that wins the war? It just gets more and more ridiculous. No,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cNone of that is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so basically even the meager details Jacky and I can remember from our waste-of-time humanities classes are bullshit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like it,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cAll right. So what is the truth? Achilles is not invulnerable, but he is a warrior. That part is right. Right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles isn\u2019t immortal, but the berserker rage makes him extraordinarily difficult to kill. And, yes, he has been a warrior his entire short life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, god, tell me he isn\u2019t a teenager, too,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t quite thirty. It was prophesied by Zeus that if Achilles chose a life of glory and battle he would not live to see thirty summers, but he would be remembered for thousands of years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Achilles chose this? Then I don\u2019t know what you expect me to do,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHe made the choice when he was a boy. He has grown and changed since then. Thetis says Achilles tires of his childish decision and longs for peace, but his fate seems set and he has lost hope of changing the path he is on,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kat said slowly. \u201cI\u2019ll try to help Achilles. But only on the condition that, win or lose, help or not, Jacky and I are sent back to our world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the kick ass bodies of our choice,\u201d Jacky added.</p><p>\u201cIf you succeed in ending the Trojan War, you will each be granted one boon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHera.\u201d Kat faced the Queen of Olympus. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t fair of you to expect me to swoop in and fix a guy I\u2019ve never met before in a situation that is more than a little outside my normal realm of expertise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNevertheless, that is the deal we offer,\u201d Hera said. \u201cAnd keep this in mind\u2014the more days that pass since your unfortunate accident, the more difficult it will be for us to seamlessly weave you back into your old lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t even guarantee what you say you\u2019re guaranteeing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can guarantee that we will use all of our vast powers to attempt to do so,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Kat looked from the Queen of Gods to Venus. The Goddess of Love was decidedly unhappy about Hera\u2019s \u201cdeal,\u201d but she shrugged and shook her head sadly, making it obvious she couldn\u2019t do anything about changing her queen\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d Jacky spoke up. \u201cKat will take care of business, and she\u2019ll do it quickly, no problem. You, Miss High and Mighty, just keep your end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always keep my word,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re set,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNot entirely,\u201d Venus said. \u201cI think it needs to be made clear that they are under divine protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI, too, agree,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cGood. It\u2019s your protection they\u2019re going to be under,\u201d Venus said to Athena.</p><p>\u201cWhy mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it can\u2019t be me because, according to Greek rumors, I caused the whole Paris/Helen problem. It can\u2019t be Hera because she just told Agamemnon to take Briseis from Achilles. You\u2019re the only one left. Plus, you have a history with Odysseus, as well as Thetis, who will have told her son that you assured her his war-prize bride would be replaced. So Polyxena has to be under your protection,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYes, well, I suppose you\u2019re correct,\u201d Athena said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sure that I like the sound of \u2018war-prize bride.\u2019 I\u2019m no prude, but I choose who I sleep with. And besides that, I\u2019m no one\u2019s property,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDitto,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cThetis assured me that her son will not force himself on a woman,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, that still leaves the issue of me being his property.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s smooth brow furrowed in confusion. \u201cYou are a woman and a war prize. You are his property.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s hands went to her hips. \u201cI am no one\u2019s property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing Achilles\u2019 property will help to keep you safe, and keep you with Achilles,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cHey, whose property am I?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cPolyxena\u2019s,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cThere will have to be an explanation to cover their oddness,\u201d Hera said, giving Jacky a stern look.</p><p>\u201cYou are right, of course,\u201d Athena said, studying Jacky and Kat as she spoke. \u201cTheir strange ways will be noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that Kat is your instrument, that you have imbued her with sacred knowledge,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it! Imply that she\u2019s an oracle; they\u2019re always behaving oddly,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cThat explains Katrina, but what about her?\u201d Hera pointed her chin at Jacky.</p><p>\u201cSweet baby Jesus I\u2019m right here! God, it\u2019s annoying when you talk about me like I\u2019ve gone all deaf and dumb,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cBesides, I do not behave oddly.\u201d</p><p>No one said anything for several breaths, then Kat sighed. \u201cHow about this\u2014I\u2019m a bizarre oracle, so it\u2019s really not a stretch that my serv\u2014\u201d She caught the killer look in Jacky\u2019s eyes and corrected hastily, \u201cThat my circle of friends would be bizarre, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not entirely believable,\u201d Athena said slowly.</p><p>\u201cBut all we have,\u201d Venus said. \u201cAll right,\u201d she told Kat, \u201cjust make it work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on. I thought we were going to be under Athena\u2019s protection. So why do we have to explain anything?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYou will be under my protection, but I cannot stay with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how the hell will you protect us?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYou will beseech my aid,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOr mine,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cOr mine,\u201d Hera said, even though she was still frowning at Jacky.</p><p>\u201cSounds weak to me,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s all you have,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>Jacky snorted and opened her mouth to comment, but men\u2019s voices coming from outside the temple interrupted her. Athena waved one hand quickly in the air and it was as if a secret view screen opened, showing half a dozen warriors entering the temple.</p><p>Kat only caught a brief glimpse of a golden man who walked in the lead before Athena closed the view.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Achilles.\u201d Eleithyia sounded a little short of breath. \u201cI\u2019ve only seen him from a distance, but his golden armor is unmistakable.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s stomach instantly knotted. Jacky took her hand and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be okay. You\u2019re one hell of a therapist. And, might I add, currently one very hot young chippie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVersus the very hot old chippie I used to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly, but you still got the old chippie up there.\u201d Jacky pointed to Kat\u2019s head. \u201cAnd there.\u201d She pointed from her head to her heart. \u201cBerserker boy doesn\u2019t stand a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this,\u201d Kat told Venus.</p><p>Venus smiled warmly at her. \u201cRemember, the Goddess of Love believes you are perfect. You and your delightful friend.\u201d Then she turned to Hera. \u201cWe must leave. Athena should face the warriors and establish her protection. Our presence would only confuse things.\u201d</p><p>Athena nodded. \u201cI shall meet with you in Venus\u2019s temple momentarily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo with my blessing, odd modern mortals,\u201d Hera told Kat and Jacky, then she kissed Eleithyia gently on her forehead. \u201cYou, my little priestess, have pleased me greatly today.\u201d</p><p>As Eleithyia curtseyed deeply, Hera and Venus disappeared in a shower of glitter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really kinda cool that they can do that,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cAnd you know what? I\u2019m starting to believe them. We might not be in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like your erotica novel theory better anyway,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cGird yourselves, mortals, and follow me,\u201d Athena commanded before striding regally from the chamber.</p><p>Kat and Jacky rolled their eyes at each other and then, waving their good-byes to Eleithyia, they followed the goddess.</p><p>The warriors had just reached the center of the outer chamber of Hera\u2019s temple, which had no real walls but was ringed by graceful marble columns and open to the sky. Kat was distracted from the men by the world that surrounded them. It was an amazingly beautiful day\u2014clear and warm. The air smelled of the sea and sweet incense.</p><p>\u201cIf this is hell, it\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Jacky whispered, gripping Kat\u2019s hand even tighter.</p><p>The men caught sight of them, or more specifically, Athena, and Kat didn\u2019t have any more time for the scenery.</p><p>\u201cThe Goddess! It is the Goddess, Hera!\u201d One warrior cried and the half dozen or so men all fell to their knees.</p><p>Actually, Kat noted that all of the men, except two, were kneeling. The taller of the two had his back to the sun and the slant of the afternoon rays made it difficult for Kat to see him well. She just got an impression of lots of hair and muscles and height. The other man was closer to the goddess and Kat was able to get a good look at him. The guy was fairly ordinary looking\u2014average height, brown hair, nice body (which could be easily seen in the short leather tunic thing he was wearing). There was nothing remarkable about him at all until he spoke, and then Kat was instantly attracted to his cultured, intelligent voice and his eyes that sparkled with wit. He walked to within just a couple feet of the goddess before he sank to one knee, but he didn\u2019t bow his head in supplication as were the rest of the kneeling men. Instead he pressed his right fist over his heart and smiled with obvious affection up at Athena. His first words were spoken so softly that had Kat not been standing beside the goddess she would not have heard him.</p><p>\u201cHail Athena, my Goddess. It has been long since you have appeared to me and I have missed you dearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is right that you miss me, Odysseus. The price of being beloved of a goddess is that you are subject to her whims, not she to yours as with a mortal woman.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s voice was sharp, but Kat was shocked to see how amazingly tender the goddess\u2019s expression had become as she gazed down at him.</p><p>\u201cFoolish Myrmidons!\u201d The tall man barked in a deep, gruff voice at the other warriors. \u201cHow could you mistake Athena, Goddess of War, for Hera?\u201d He stepped forward to kneel beside Odysseus and bowed his head respectfully. \u201cHail Athena! Forgive my men. Their brains have been addled by Trojan sea and sun. They meant no disrespect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive them, Achilles. You and Odysseus may rise.\u201d</p><p>Achilles! His name shivered against Kat\u2019s skin. Then he stood and lifted his face.</p><p>Her first thought was that she understood why he scared maidens. Her second was that she wondered how, in this ancient world without penicillin and blood transfusions, he had ever lived through so many wounds. Kat kept her expression carefully neutral. She heard Jacky\u2019s muffled \u201chuh\u201d from beside her, but knew the ER nurse\u2019s reaction wasn\u2019t shock or fear, but that she also had to be wondering how the hell he\u2019d survived such horrible injuries.</p><p>Kat needn\u2019t have worried about fixing the expression on her face. Achilles didn\u2019t have so much as a glance for anyone except Athena.</p><p>\u201cBy your presence here I assume Thetis has spoken to you,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cShe has, Goddess,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon has taken your war prize.\u201d</p><p>Even though Athena didn\u2019t frame the words as a question Achilles gave a tight nod and said a clipped, \u201cHe has.\u201d</p><p>Kat noticed that the men behind him scowled at this and stirred restlessly.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall replace that which you lost. I bring to you Polyxena, Princess of Troy, Daughter of Priam!\u201d</p><p>Athena made a grand gesture and stepped aside. Achilles\u2019 gaze turned to her and Kat thought her feet had grown roots and sunk into the marble floor of the temple. He had the most incredibly blue eyes!</p><p>Jacky coughed, and as she covered her mouth managed to push Kat forward.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Polyxena, greet Achilles, Leader of the Myrmidons,\u201d Athena prompted.</p><p>Thankfully, Kat managed to put on her therapist face. She smiled politely and, in a perfectly modulated, perfectly calm, perfectly fake voice said, \u201cHello, Achilles. It\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d Then she walked purposefully forward and, still smiling, held her hand out to him.</p><p>Achilles hesitated. He looked from her hand to her face and then back down at her hand again. Kat kept the smile plastered on and the hand hanging out there in the breeze. Finally he took it, gingerly, and bowed quickly over it as if he would kiss her, but stopped well before his lips touched her skin. Then he dropped her hand and took a quick half step back.</p><p>\u201cI greet you, Princess,\u201d he said, but his gaze had already shifted back to Athena.</p><p>\u201cI must return to Olympus. Achilles and Odysseus, let me make it clear that Polyxena is unique. She will never be a normal war prize\u2014she is much more. I have decided to imbue her with sacred knowledge. Think of her as you would my beloved oracle. She and her maidservant are under my protection. Anyone who would dare harm them shall evoke my eternal wrath.\u201d Athena raised her voice so that the power in it brushed physically against the kneeling men.</p><p>\u201cWe understand, Goddess,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cBe sure you keep her safe,\u201d Athena said. \u201cOdysseus, a word.\u201d The goddess motioned for Odysseus to follow her out of hearing range, leaving Kat and Achilles standing awkwardly together. Kat wanted to stare at him. Of course staring was what all women probably did when they first met him. Or they wouldn\u2019t look at him at all. Just like she wasn\u2019t looking at him at all. God, she was acting like an idiot. Resolutely Kat looked at Achilles to find him staring over her shoulder at nothing with his jaw clenched.</p><p>He must hate first meetings like this, she thought.</p><p>Kat cleared her throat and, almost reluctantly it seemed, Achilles\u2019 gaze met hers.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, I\u2019d like to introduce you to my servant,\u201d Kat stumbled just a little over the word. \u201cThis is, uh, Melia,\u201d she blurted, almost forgetting her best friend\u2019s new name.</p><p>Jacky stuck her chin in the air and made a weird little half-curtsey, half-bow. \u201cPleased,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ignoring Jacky completely, Achilles said, \u201cYou would introduce me to your slave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cJesus god, it\u2019s like I\u2019m not here again,\u201d Jacky muttered.</p><p>\u201cHighborn!\u201d Athena\u2019s commanding voice made all of them jump. The goddess walked briskly back to them. \u201cMelia was highborn\u2014a princess in her own land before she was abducted and sold to Troy. Polyxena has chosen not to break her spirit. As I told you, the princess is unique.\u201d Athena turned her back to the warriors so that she could give Kat and Jacky severe looks. \u201cI depart now.\u201d She faced the men again and raised her arm majestically. \u201cBe forewarned that I will be watching, and one never knows when I shall return.\u201d The goddess disappeared in a glittering cloud of gray smoke.</p><p>\u201cSuch a drama queen...\u201d Jacky whispered to Kat.</p><p>\u201cCome, Princess. I will show you to your new home.\u201d Without waiting to see if she followed him, Achilles marched away, leaving his soldiers to form a column around the women and follow behind him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Sweet Jesus on a cracker, will you look at that,\u201d Jacky whispered to Kat.</p><p>They stood on the edge of an enormous trench, dug between the grassy plain that sloped down from the plateau on which Troy had been built, and a wide, white sand beach kissed by a turquoise sea so clear and blue it almost hurt Kat\u2019s eyes. But it wasn\u2019t the bizarre trench or the beauty of the sea that had made Jacky whisper and stare. To their left, as far as they could see, the beach was crowded with brightly colored tents and men. Just offshore the sweetly rounded harbor was filled with ancient wooden ships.</p><p>\u201cThis way, Princess,\u201d Odysseus said, breaking the spell the sight had cast.</p><p>Blinking, Kat looked up at him. They had fallen behind the warriors, who had turned to the right and followed the shoreline after they had climbed down and then out of the trench.</p> <p>\u201cAchilles and his Myrmidons do not camp with the rest of us,\u201d Odysseus said, with a rueful twitch of his lips.</p><p>\u201cEven before Agamemnon took Briseis?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>Odysseus nodded. \u201cEven before.\u201d He motioned for the two women to walk with him. \u201cThe dislike Achilles and King Agamemnon feel for one another is common knowledge. Though it is only recently that the dislike has turned to outright hatred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound smart to hate your king outright,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Odysseus glanced with mild surprise at Jacky before answering her, and Kat breathed a silent sigh of relief. Maybe their oracle-and-her-weird-highborn-servant masquerade would actually work.</p> <p>\u201cAchilles is Greece\u2019s greatest warrior. Perhaps the question should be why a king would alienate himself from his champion.\u201d</p><p>Kat laughed sarcastically. \u201cHow about because of arrogance, vanity and lust? Aren\u2019t kings prone to those things?\u201d She was silently singing a rousing chorus of \u201cGod Bless America\u201d when she thought about current American politics and the song skidded to a metaphoric halt.</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s gaze was shrewd. \u201cAnd yet they say your father has none of those characteristics. Instead it is rumored that he is wise and honorable and much beloved by his people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not the only king I know,\u201d Kat said quickly, hoping that she wasn\u2019t putting her foot directly in her flapping mouth, and wishing desperately college hadn\u2019t been so many years ago and that she\u2019d actually paid attention during world lit class.</p><p>\u201cThey say you were to be betrothed to the son of the King of Sardis,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>Holy shit! She was almost engaged? And to a king, no less. Huh. Kat swallowed hard. Venus should have given them a damn briefing. \u201cUh, I\u2019d really rather not talk about, you know, my life before.\u201d</p> <p>Odysseus bowed his head in silent acknowledgement of what Kat guessed must be her ruined life.</p><p>\u201cSo, what kind of a girl was Briseis?\u201d Kat asked, neatly changing the subject.</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s brows went up at the question. \u201cShe was a war prize\u2014beautiful and compliant.\u201d</p><p>Jacky snorted, which made the famous hero smile.</p><p>\u201cHow did she get along with Achilles?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s tone turned enigmatic. \u201cAs all women get along with him.\u201d He hesitated and added, \u201cAchilles is a great warrior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to life than war,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNot since Paris took Helen, there hasn\u2019t been,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my world or in yours.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s time that changed,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s gaze speared her. \u201cHas Athena sent you here to grant us victory over Troy?\u201d</p><p>No, actually, I\u2019m here so that Achilles stays out of the war and, as quickly as possible, the Trojans win, she thought, but when Kat spoke she only said, \u201cAs Athena said, I\u2019m here for Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Odysseus said, making it clear that was the last thing he believed.</p><p>The seashore had gone from being flat and sandy to dune filled and grassy, and Kat was glad that she and Jacky had to fall back, scrambling single file behind Odysseus around the mini-hills, and making it impossible to talk. Then the dune gave way abruptly to a cove that was impressive in size, though smaller than the harbor where the Greek fleet docked. It was protected on either side by huge jutting teeth of dark coral. Between the teeth were more ships\u2014all black sailed. Kat stopped counting at thirty something. The beach in front of the cove was filled with tents.</p><p>\u201cAchilles is there, closest to the shore.\u201d Odysseus slowed so that the two of them could walk around the sea side of the encampment with him as he made his way toward a huge tent that sat apart from the others. Its canvas had been dyed a yellow so bright it almost appeared gold, and on each side of it was painted a majestic eagle.</p><p>Kat could see that Achilles was outside the tent and had joined a little circle of men standing around someone seated in the middle of them.</p><p>\u201cNice of him to wait for us,\u201d Jacky muttered. \u201cMr. All That needs some etiquette lessons...\u201d</p><p>Kat sighed, silently agreeing with Jacky.</p><p>They had just caught up with Achilles, who paid them no attention. Clearly he was totally involved with whatever was going on with the guy in the middle of the circle, and Kat was wondering if she should ask him where she was staying, or if she should just go on inside the tent and check things out, when she realized what everyone was staring at. A guy was sitting on a bench, and he was bleeding pretty badly from a nasty cut down the outside of his left bicep. An old, short guy was rummaging around in a raggedy straw basket. With a grunt of victory, he pulled from the basket a large needle that looked almost as sharp as it was dirty. It was already threaded with a long length of something that reminded Kat of black fishing line. The old man looked at the bleeding guy on the bench and, with a wicked smile, said, \u201cWell, my boy, this will hurt.\u201d He bent over the arm, and started pressing the edges of the flapping flesh together, clearly getting ready to sew.</p><p>\u201cOh, no you do not!\u201d Jacky exploded from Kat\u2019s side, snatching the needle from the old man who stood openmouthed staring at her. \u201cThis\u201d\u2014she held up the needle\u2014\u201cis disgusting. If you stick it in that\u201d\u2014she pointed at the gaping wound\u2014\u201chis arm is gonna fester and rot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow dare this woman\u2014\u201d the old guy began and Kat shoved herself to Achilles\u2019 side.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a healer,\u201d Kat told Achilles.</p><p>\u201cI am a healer!\u201d the old man sputtered in outrage.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re a quack. And one with dirty hands,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Kat ignored both of them and focused on Achilles. \u201cShe\u2019s been given special knowledge by Athena.\u201d</p><p>The old man rounded on Kat. \u201cAnd who are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena\u2019s oracle and Achilles\u2019 war-prize bride,\u201d Kat said smoothly.</p><p>\u201cAthena\u2019s oracle is a war prize! Bah! What game is this? Do you think Kalchas, soothsayer and prophet of the Achaians, would not know of the arrival of a divine oracle?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus cleared his throat. \u201cKalchas, my old friend, we\u2019ve just returned from the Goddess\u2019s presence. Athena did, indeed, gift Achilles with Polyxena, who she has proclaimed her oracle.\u201d</p><p>Kalchas narrowed his rheumy eyes. \u201cYou say you saw Athena yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is what I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I say you have always been a better prophet than healer, Kalchas,\u201d Achilles\u2019 deep voice silenced everyone. \u201cPolyxena\u2019s servant will heal Patroklos. That is if my cousin has no argument with it.\u201d</p><p>The bleeding guy\u2019s voice was good humored. The sound of it made Kat glance over at Patroklos and she saw that he was cute, young and very, very blond. \u201cI bow to your will, cousin,\u201d he said, and then he flashed white teeth at Jacky, adding, \u201cAnd, of course, to the will of the gods and my beautiful healer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll need this mess\u201d\u2014Jacky held up the filthy needle\u2014</p><p>\u201cboiled. I\u2019ll also need\u2014\u201d She paused and Kat was sure she was discarding words like \u201cdisinfectant\u201d and \u201cpenicillin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need the strongest alcohol you have.\u201d</p><p>The men blinked at Jacky, faces question marks.</p><p>Kat turned to Achilles and touched his arm, noting but not reacting to the fact that his body twitched under her hand like a skittish horse. \u201cShe means the strongest drink you have. Something that gets men drunk easily.\u201d</p><p>Achilles looked at Odysseus. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that vile drink Idomeneus brought with him from Crete would take the hair off a hound?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus smiled. \u201cI did indeed. Idomeneus owes me a favor.\u201d He turned his smile on Jacky. \u201cRest assured, I\u2019ll get you your strong drink, little Melia.\u201d He jogged off in the direction of the rest of the Greek camp.</p><p>\u201cWhat else does she need?\u201d Achilles asked Kat.</p><p>\u201cI need thin, clean linen strips,\u201d Jacky said as if he had been speaking to her. Kat noticed that Achilles\u2019 wide mouth twitched up at one edge in just the hint of a smile, and he addressed his next question directly to Jacky.</p><p>\u201cAnything else, little Melia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething to numb the pain,\u201d Jacky said, barely glancing over her shoulder at Achilles as she continued her examination of the nasty wound. \u201cLike, uh, the juice of the poppy, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was what the strong drink was for,\u201d Patroklos said through gritted teeth, clearly trying to pretend like her poking and prodding wasn\u2019t causing him excruciating pain.</p><p>\u201cNo, and hold still. The drink is to clean this out. By the by, what cut you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cut me is the better question. Ajax did,\u201d Patroklos said, and then couldn\u2019t help wincing as she prodded the wound too deeply.</p><p>Achilles snorted. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get your arm and your fool head cut off sparring with Ajax.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos started to shrug, caught Jacky\u2019s severe look, and obviously thought better of it. \u201cHe\u2019s bigger than me, but he\u2019s not as fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like he was fast enough,\u201d Jacky said. Then she glanced over her shoulder at Achilles again. \u201cIs someone going to get me that stuff, or are we just going to let him bleed to death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet the healer everything she asks for,\u201d Achilles commanded, and several men took off.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take but a few minutes for everything to be assembled. Soon, much too soon for Kat\u2019s stomach, the needle and thread had been boiled, and Patroklos had been dosed with something that looked and smelled like cough syrup. He\u2019d also taken several gulps of the \u201cvile drink\u201d Odysseus had fetched, so he was bleary eyed and happy, and Jacky was currently giving her the look\u2014the one Kat had dreaded\u2014and motioning her to \u201ccome here.\u201d</p><p>Kat sighed and walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cYes, you have to help me,\u201d Jacky told her.</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m crappy at this blood stuff. Can\u2019t you get the old guy to help you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he scuttled off when I started boiling the needle. I think he\u2019s allergic to clean. You\u2019re it.\u201d Jacky handed her a wad of clean linen. \u201cJust blot the blood while I sew. It\u2019s easy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s disgusting, and I may puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a shrink. That\u2019s kinda like a doctor. I don\u2019t know how you can get queasy at the sight of blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello\u2014I treat people with emotional wounds. The only blood a shrink deals with is metaphoric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two have an odd type of speech,\u201d Patroklos slurred at them.</p><p>\u201cBlondie, my patients don\u2019t talk unless I ask them somethin\u2019,\u201d Jacky told him sternly, giving him a little smack on the head to punctuate her words, which made him chuckle drunkenly. She looked back at the growing circle of men who were watching them and raised her voice commandingly. \u201cSomeone should hold him. It\u2019ll mess up the tasteful yet manly scar I\u2019m plannin\u2019 for him if he jerks around.\u201d</p><p>Achilles strode over to them. He sat on the bench facing his cousin and grabbed him firmly by the forearms. \u201cGo on,\u201d he told Jacky. \u201cHe won\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>Kat decided that there was no sound grosser than that of a needle skewering human flesh, and was reminded all over again why she had opted for shrink school versus standard medical school (thereby never fulfilling her mother\u2019s dreams of having a \u201creal doctor\u201d as a daughter). So instead of focusing on the seeping blood that she was dabbing for Jacky, and then puking up her guts, Kat kept stealing glances at Achilles, who was talking in low tones to Patroklos about some kind of race he\u2019d won back in Greece, which was making the guy laugh, even though Jacky kept telling him to hold still and be quiet. Both men ignored her, which gave Kat the perfect opportunity to gawk at Achilles.</p><p>He was definitely a big guy. He had to top six-four with broad shoulders and a deep chest to match. He had excellent hair\u2014long and thick and tawny. It was pulled back in a low ponytail with a leather thong, but a bunch of it had escaped and it reminded her of a lion\u2019s mane. His hair was his second most striking feature after his incredible blue eyes. Well, actually, no. If she was going to be honest with herself the most striking thing about Achilles were the scars that crisscrossed his body. The longest one on his face ran from just above his left eye, through his brow, somehow missing the eye it continued down his left cheek. His nose was crooked, obviously having been broken multiple times. His strong right cheek-bone was zigzagged with a puckered scar that looked like it had been made by a rusty butter knife. Another scar wrapped around his neck like his throat had literally been slit, and she wondered, again, how the hell he\u2019d lived through such horrible injuries.</p><p>His bare arms were heavily muscled and burnished a pretty golden brown. Back in the real world Kat knew women who would have killed for that shade of spray-on tan. But there, too, the perfection of his skin was marred by thick scars that ranged in color from old, white lines to one or two that were still angry and pink. From her vantage point she couldn\u2019t see his legs very well, but Kat was sure they\u2019d be the same as the rest of him\u2014riddled with lines and welts.</p><p>Her eyes snuck back to his face. He had an excellent mouth. That was for sure. None of those too-thin lips and weak chins for Achilles. Actually the truth was that if you ignored his scars he was a damn handsome man. If you didn\u2019t ignore his scars he was a damn scary looking man.</p><p>\u201cUh, do you mind not gawking and really assisting me?\u201d Jacky said, loud enough to have Achilles glancing up in surprise at them.</p><p>\u201cYou know if I stare at the blood I\u2019m going to puke. Or pass out. Or both,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cFine. Then just dab the blood occasionally and hold these god-damned fucking tresses back out of my way. I do not believe what a pain in the ass Barbie locks are.\u201d Between stitches Jacky glanced at her and smiled sweetly. \u201cThat is unless you\u2019re too busy gazing at those blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s cheeks burned and she could feel said \u201cblue eyes\u201d boring into her. She looked down at him and, sure enough, he was staring at her with an obviously guarded expression on his face. Their eyes met. He thinks I keep looking at him because of his scars, Kat realized. So, still meeting his gaze Kat said clearly and deliberately, \u201cCan I help it if the man has gorgeous blue eyes?\u201d</p><p>Patroklos chuckled drunkenly. \u201cThe princess thinks you have pretty eyes, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also thinks she needs to borrow this,\u201d Kat said, and reached out to pull the leather tie from Achilles\u2019 hair.</p><p>Achilles jerked back as if she had a hot iron in her hand and she was trying to press it against his cheek.</p><p>\u201cHey! Hold. Him. Still.\u201d Jacky glared at Achilles.</p><p>\u201cSorry, that was my fault,\u201d Kat said. Then to Achilles, \u201cI just wanted to use your leather tie to get her hair out of her face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Of course. Go ahead,\u201d Achilles said in clipped words.</p><p>Kat pulled the leather tie from his hair, liking the feel of its thickness for the short time it brushed against her fingers. Then she pulled back Kat\u2019s blond waves and knotted the tie securely. \u201cHere, that should help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Keep blotting the blood. Just don\u2019t look at it too long \u2019cause I am not in the mood to be picking you up off the sand, and I sure don\u2019t want to clean up puke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to inconvenience you,\u201d Kat muttered, and went back to sneaking peeks at Achilles. Only now more often than not the warrior caught her looking at him because he was not looking at her, too.</p><p>\u201cAll right. That\u2019ll do,\u201d Jacky said. Kat yanked her attention from Achilles back to the now less bloody and newly sewed up ungaping wound. \u201cHand me that strip of linen.\u201d Kat handed her the bandage and watched as Jacky expertly tied it around the guy\u2019s arm. \u201cKeep this clean and dry. I\u2019ll check on you tomorrow,\u201d Jacky said to Patroklos. \u201cHe should rest now,\u201d she told Achilles.</p><p>Achilles nodded and helped the decidedly groggy Patroklos to his feet. Patroklos promptly pulled away from his cousin to address Jacky, who was fastidiously reboiling the needle and what was left of the suturing material.</p><p>\u201cThank you for saving my life,\u201d he slurred and swayed. Kat bit her lip to keep from giggling at him. He looked like a drunken frat boy. Actually a tall, cute, drunken frat boy.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t going to die of that scratch, idiot,\u201d Achilles growled at him, though Kat could see that he, too, was stifling a smile.</p><p>\u201cNo. No.\u201d Patroklos lifted his finger in the air like a great statesman making a point. \u201cI insist that little Melia saved me, and I owe her a life. Mine. So I announce from here on she is under my protection.\u201d Then he paused, frowned and blinked blearily at Kat. \u201cThat is if her princess will allow it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Whatever,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cJust sober up and get well.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos looked confused by Jacky\u2019s strange words, but seemed undaunted. \u201cMy pledge is honorable. Princess, if you deem it so, the lovely Melia shall be formally under my protection.\u201d He hiccupped and swayed again, this time precariously close to losing his balance, but kept his expression drunkenly serious.</p><p>Kat thought he was absolutely adorable. It would probably do Jacky good to have blondie following her around like a lab puppy, licking her lily white ankles. Kat giggled at the visual image she\u2019d just conjured. \u201cHey, it\u2019s all right by me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s official. Melia is servant no more, but is now war-prize bride to me. Patroklos.\u201d He thumped his well-muscled chest and then cringed at the pain he\u2019d caused himself.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Jacky sputtered.</p><p>Patroklos grinned at her as if she was a big, red-bowed present and it was Christmas morning. \u201cAnd I proclaim your skill for healing, my lady, is almost as great as your beauty.\u201d Then he bowed, and promptly fell flat on his face in the sand at Jacky\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet weeping baby Jesus,\u201d Jacky said, completely disgusted. \u201cGrab him. He\u2019s gonna mess up my stitches.\u201d</p><p>The three of them were pulling Patroklos to his feet (again) when old Kalchas hobbled up to them.</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon commands the presence of Achilles in his tent, and orders him to bring Princess Polyxena, the so-called oracle, with him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat felt like a fish riding a bicycle as she trudged through the sand behind the silent and glowering Achilles and wished for about the kazillionth time that she had realized what the hell cute and totally messed-up Patroklos had been asking when she\u2019d, stupidly, been all \u201call right by me\u201d to his protecting Jacky. Who knew that meant Jacky would be whisked away to his tent and she\u2019d be left best friendless to flounder along after Tall, Blond and Grumpy?</p><p>It was seriously a pain in the ass. They were almost to the Greek camp. The sun had set a little while ago and the scene on the beach in front of her was amazing, what with all the tents and torches and campfires. But the soft leather slippers on her feet were full of sand. The long dress/robe/toga thing she was wearing, while a great color and very flattering to her new young body, was also annoying as hell to keep lifted up so that she didn\u2019t stomp on the bottom of it and fall on her face. Her hair was long and thick and, yes, quite lovely she was sure, but the breeze from the ocean had picked up and, as Jacky would say, was blowing her goddamn tresses across her face. Plus, she was hungry. And tired. All she wanted was some carry-out, a bottle of wine and a Top Chef marathon on Bravo TV.</p><p>When a bur worked its way inside her slipper, Kat decided that she\u2019d had it. She stopped and cleared her throat. Achilles didn\u2019t even pause in his trudge.</p><p>\u201cHey! You left me way behind,\u201d she yelled after him.</p> <p>He did stop then. She was pretty sure she saw his shoulders heave with what was probably a monstrous sigh before he turned around to look back at her.</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>He looked at her.</p><p>\u201cThere is a bur in my shoe,\u201d she called across the stretch of sand that separated them. \u201cAnd I am tired of scrambling around back here trying to keep up with you.\u201d When he made no response she rolled her eyes. \u201cYour legs are longer than mine.\u201d He still didn\u2019t say anything. \u201cWhat? Are you a caveman? A little help here would be nice.\u201d She threw up her hands, completely exasperated.</p><p>Achilles walked slowly back to her. \u201cYou talk a lot,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, well, you don\u2019t talk enough,\u201d she told him, and when he was close enough, she reached out and grabbed his arm so she could balance to take off her slipper and dump out about a gallon of sand.</p><p>Kat could feel his eyes on her as she peered into her shoe trying to find the bur, and she let him look. Finally she found it, plucked it carefully out of her shoe and then matter-of-factly grabbed him with her other hand so she could repeat the procedure on her other shoe.</p><p>\u201cYou do not fear me?\u201d His voice was deep and somber, though he sounded absolutely perplexed.</p><p>Still using him as a balance, Kat slid on her other shoe as she looked up at Achilles. \u201cShould I be afraid of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen are afraid of me, whether or not they should be,\u201d he said.</p><p>Shoes free of sand and burs, Kat stood up straight and breathed a relieved sigh before brushing her hair out of her face and saying, \u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question.\u201d</p> <p>His lips twitched. \u201cAs you did not answer mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t given me any reason to, so no, I don\u2019t fear you. I mean, I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d slow down, lend me an arm and help me wade through this sand, but slight rudeness doesn\u2019t translate into fear in my mind.\u201d</p><p>He stared silently down at her and she recognized an internal struggle reflected in the depths of his sea-colored eyes. Finally he offered her his arm.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Kat smiled and slid her hand around his bicep and they resumed their trek to the Greek camp, this time with Achilles not acting like he was leading a death march.</p><p>\u201cMelia seems to be a remarkable healer,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Kat said, not sure what else to say. Yeah, she\u2019s a great ER nurse was definitely inappropriate. Then a thought struck her and she decided to go with it. \u201cWhat kind of man is Patroklos? What I mean is, will he be good to her? And, uh, is he a patient guy, because Melia is a rather unusual woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I have already discovered,\u201d Achilles said. \u201cAnd, yes, Patroklos is a man of honor.\u201d He glanced down at her and added, \u201cHe is also kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not married already or anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, how about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you married? Or anything?\u201d Kat asked, even though she already knew the answer.</p><p>\u201cNo. I have no wife. Or anything.\u201d</p><p>The silence stretched between them. Before it could become any more uncomfortable, Kat said, \u201cI\u2019m hungry. Do you think Agamemnon will feed us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will not break bread with Agamemnon. He and I are not comrades. He commands my presence only to show he believes he has control over me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have control over you? He is your king.\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 look hardened. \u201cHe is not my king.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well, then I guess I won\u2019t worry about my stomach growling so loudly it embarrasses you in front of him.\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 laugh seemed to surprise him as much as it did Kat, and he looked down at her shaking his head and smiling. \u201cPrincess, we won\u2019t be in Agamemnon\u2019s tent long enough for your stomach to complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it. I\u2019m starved. Oh, and you should smile more. It looks good on you.\u201d</p><p>By their joined skin Kat could feel the little jolt that passed through Achilles at her words and she wondered how long it\u2019d been since the guy had been complimented by a woman. Then she remembered what the goddesses had said about him\u2014that he\u2019d taken no lover in years because women feared him, and she felt an unexpected little jolt of her own sizzle through her. This ancient hero and warrior\u2014the man whose physical prowess people knew about thousands of years after his death\u2014hadn\u2019t had sex in years. Talk about starving...</p><p>\u201cRest assured, Princess, I will see that you are well fed when we return to my tent.\u201d</p><p>Kat met Achilles\u2019 gaze and the little jolt that had sizzled through her crackled and flared until she felt a lovely rush of heat begin deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll count on it,\u201d Kat told him softly.</p><p>Then they were both jolted out of their moment of intimacy by a shout of \u201cHail Achilles!\u201d as a warrior in full armor saluted formally and then pulled aside the flap of an enormous tent for them.</p><p>Holding tight to Achilles\u2019 arm, Kat stepped into a cacophony of exotic sights and sounds and scents. Right away Kat decided gold must be Agamemnon\u2019s thing. The walls of the tent were scarlet, but practically everything else was gold gold gold. The thick woven carpets were gold. The chairs, most of which were filled with gray-bearded men wearing flowing robes and a bizarre amount of jewelry, were gold. The columns that held up the tent were gold. The goblets people were slurping wine from\u2014gold. The three-tiered dais that was placed majestically at the rear of the tent, as if it were at the end of a catwalk\u2014gold. And the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance wasn\u2019t the huge gilded throne that sat on top of that dais, but the old guy that perched on top of the throne.</p><p>He was big, Kat had to give him that, and he was wearing an enormous gold tunic-toga thing that looked like the mutant love child that would have been born if an Elizabeth Taylor Cleopatra costume and a classic Liberace cape had been allowed to mate. Plus, he was wearing enough jewelry to make the other grandpas clustered around him look like cheap relations. Not to mention his (gold, of course) crown, which glistened in the torchlight.</p><p>But what Kat kept staring at wasn\u2019t the gold or the jewels. What freaked her out more than any of the opulence was his hair. It was long\u2014as in down to his chest. And it was obviously dyed a dark, very fake-looking brown. It was also curled into Shirley Temple ringlets that somehow joined his long, totally dyed beard that was also ringletted. His eyes were lined in black, setting off his drag queen appearance perfectly. Actually she was finding it difficult not to giggle at the ridiculous pomp and circumstance until he spoke and she felt Achilles\u2019 arm turn from warm man to hard-edged steel under her hand.</p><p>\u201cSo good of you to answer our summons, Achilles. Though you are, as usual, late.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon\u2019s voice was powerful and contemptuous, as if he were addressing an annoying child. Its effect on the gathering was instantaneous. The talking stopped as everyone\u2019s attention shifted to Achilles. Kat couldn\u2019t help but notice how many of the men\u2019s eyes widened in shock as they took in the fact that her arm was wrapped through his. Automatically she lifted her chin and glared back at them. Hell, no, she wasn\u2019t like other women, those shrinking violets who peed themselves over a few scars and some grumpiness. She\u2019d be grumpy, too, if she hadn\u2019t had sex in years. Crap. Now that she thought about it, she hadn\u2019t had sex in years. At least not decent sex. And not with someone besides the Magic Tickler.</p><p>Then Kat realized that as she\u2019d been babbling to herself no one else had been talking. At all. Achilles just stood there like a statue of himself. Agamemnon\u2019s look was darkening and Kat braced herself for a kingly storm, when his expression suddenly relaxed and turned bizarrely jovial.</p><p>\u201cAh, we see why you\u2019ve been struck dumb. You\u2019re unused to escorting beautiful women. Imagine that the Trojans have been battling the mighty Achilles for nine years. Luckily for us they didn\u2019t know it only took the touch of a woman to slay him.\u201d Agamemnon chuckled cruelly and reached a hand out to stroke the young girl who sat in a scantily clad pool of gold silk on the floor beside his throne. The girl, who Kat assumed must be Briseis, was glaring at her hostilely, but she didn\u2019t so much as glance at Achilles.</p><p>Kat could not believe what an asshole this guy was. And he was their king? Jerk. Bully. She seriously hated bullies. Well, as she knew from years of experience, when one was dealing with a bully it was best for one to show no weakness and to confront the asshole directly. Kat glanced around the room until she found the face she was looking for, and was relieved that he was one of the few men present who wasn\u2019t laughing like a good little sycophant along with Agamemnon.</p><p>\u201cOdysseus,\u201d Kat said, raising her voice so that it carried over the laughter. \u201cI was confused earlier today when you remarked on my father\u2019s reputation for being wise and honorable and beloved by his people, as if that was unusual. Now I understand. They are traits that appear to be in short supply in your Greek rulers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpudent harlot!\u201d Old Kalchas screeched as he popped out from behind the king\u2019s throne. \u201cShe should be beaten for her disrespect!\u201d</p><p>Several of the other men started shouting for her blood, too, but Odysseus\u2019s raised hand stilled them.</p><p>\u201cHave a care, Kalchas. Athena has proclaimed Polyxena not just under her protection, but her oracle,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember, I witnessed Athena gifting her to Achilles, and there was no mistaking the Goddess\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe princess is also under my protection.\u201d Achilles\u2019 voice cut through the angry muttering that had begun in response to Odysseus\u2019s proclamation. \u201cI have no wish to quarrel with any of you,\u201d he continued, but Kat saw that it was obvious that he didn\u2019t look at the king, purposefully excluding him in the \u201cno wish to quarrel statement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cbut if you so much as touch her, I will kill you.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s eyes went to Achilles\u2019 face. He said it so calmly, so matter-of-factly, but his expression was implacable, and Kat had no doubt that he meant exactly what he said.</p><p>Agamemnon\u2019s patronizing laughter cut through the silence Achilles\u2019 words had caused.</p><p>\u201cOh, come now, Achilles. Save your death threats for the Trojans. Well, all the Trojans except this small, soft-looking one. After all, we\u2019re not threatening your new war prize. It is good that you found a replacement so quickly, and such a lovely one at that.\u201d Agamemnon smiled at her and Kat\u2019s smarm meter went to high. \u201cYou\u2019ll need your strength on the morrow. I was visited by Hera today, and I believe that was a sign that our victory is close at hand. Tomorrow will be a great day for Greece!\u201d</p><p>Kat had to work not to have her mouth flop open in surprise. Hera\u2019s visit was a sign that the Greeks were going to win the war? She could only imagine the goddess\u2019s reaction to that news. Kat had never heard such utter bullshit. No wonder this place had given birth to the mother of all rumors.</p><p>But the men bought every word of it and shouted in testosterone-filled response. Achilles waited until the tumult had died down and then he said a single word that appeared to shock the gold-loving king to his marrow.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon recovered his fa\u00e7ade of patronizing indifference quickly. \u201cNo?\u201d He said with a sarcastic smile. \u201cIs there a problem with the Myrmidons, Achilles? Some new sickness? I returned Khryseis, as you insisted. That stopped the darkness that had settled over our camp. Now what sacrifice do you ask of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ask no sacrifice of you, Agamemnon. I simply ask you to fight your own battles.\u201d Achilles pulled his arm gently from her hand and walked forward, addressing not the richly dressed old men in gilded chairs, but the young warriors who stood behind them. \u201cWhy is it that wars are talked about by old men, but fought only by young men? If I want a woman, I fight for her. If I want riches, I fight for them. If I want glory, I fight for it. I have never taken something for which others have fought and died.\u201d</p><p>Along with everyone else in the room, Kat was mesmerized by Achilles. He wasn\u2019t just a mindless killing machine bent on glory and fortune. Achilles was a leader of men, a king in his own right. He moved through the room until finally he was standing before Agamemnon\u2019s dais.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps it is time you fought for that which you would claim as yours, great king.\u201d Unlike Agamemnon, Achilles\u2019 voice wasn\u2019t thick with sarcasm. It was firm and deep and honest. He held the king\u2019s gaze easily using the truth, not demeaning tricks. \u201cAnd perhaps it is time I rested. There is more to life than war.\u201d He turned and looked back at Kat. \u201cToday I have been reminded that Athena is Goddess of Wisdom as well as Goddess of War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou cannot withdraw from battle!\u201d Agamemnon exploded to his feet, all pretense of control gone. \u201cI am your king and I command you to fight!\u201d</p><p>Achilles turned slowly so that he was, once more, facing Agamemnon. \u201cYou are not my king. I have never sworn loyalty to you. I am the son of a king and I lead my own men. I am only here because of a youthful mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really believe you can run from your fate?\u201d Agamemnon sneered.</p><p>\u201cI have no intention of running, but I can tell you that I will fight again only when there is something worth dying for,\u201d Achilles answered and then strode back to Kat.</p><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d Agamemnon shrieked.</p><p>Achilles reacted instantly. He pushed Kat toward the tent flap, backing protectively in front of her while he unsheathed his sword and held it ready before him. Kat saw the warriors hesitate. That they didn\u2019t want to fight Achilles was abundantly clear.</p><p>Suddenly there was a wild flapping of wings and a huge owl, white as untouched snow, burst into the tent. The men gasped as it landed in front of Achilles and stared at them, as if daring anyone to move.</p><p>Odysseus was the first person to break the silence. He took two strides forward and kneeled before the owl. \u201cAs you wish, my Goddess,\u201d he said. Then he stood and confronted the room. \u201cAthena\u2019s will is clear. Achilles and the princess are not to be harmed. Should any of you wish to go against the will of my Goddess, you shall also have to go against me.\u201d</p><p>That was the last Kat heard, because Achilles had backed their way out of the tent. Grasping her arm firmly, he steered her through the Greek camp, heading across the beach to Myrmidon territory.</p><p>She didn\u2019t see the warrior, Talthybios, whisper into Agamemnon\u2019s ear a story about a temple he had sacked earlier that day, and a princess who should have been very, very dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat didn\u2019t take Achilles\u2019 arm on the return trip\u2014he took hers, practically keeping her feet from touching the sand as he propelled her through the Greek camp and then across the stretch of beach and dunes that separated them from his Myrmidons. Even had she not needed all of her breath to stay upright, Kat wouldn\u2019t have bar-raged him with the zillions of questions she had. In just a few minutes, Achilles had turned from a scarred, almost shy man to an imposing warrior king, and Kat needed a little time to process the change in him.</p><p>For the first time she began to wonder about this berserker rage that overtook him. Kat thought he was still himself. He wasn\u2019t foaming at the mouth or violently out of control as he would be with what the historians called a berserker rage. She glanced sideways at his stony face. His entire body seemed to be alert. No damn way could anything or anyone sneak up on him. His sword was unsheathed and it glittered dangerously in the moonlight reflected off the sea. But Achilles\u2019 sword wasn\u2019t the most deadly thing about him. It was Achilles himself that was a weapon\u2014and the scars on his body now truly made sense. He\u2019d used himself as a tool\u2014as a machine. A killing machine.</p><p>Finally they reached the Myrmidon camp and Achilles slowed, and then released her arm.</p><p>\u201cAutomedon!\u201d he shouted. \u201cTo me!\u201d</p> <p>A short, muscular man whose leather chest plate had the image of a chariot carved into it ran up to Achilles.</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon has deluded himself into believing he can command me. He may try to press the point. Double the watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord!\u201d Automedon saluted and jogged off.</p><p>Achilles continued walking through his camp and with each step he took Kat could see the tension release from him. By the time they reached his tent, the stony look that had overtaken his face had relaxed and he had sheathed his sword.</p><p>\u201cAre you still hungry?\u201d he asked, speaking to her for the first time since they\u2019d left Agamemnon\u2019s tent.</p> <p>\"I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dinner meal is served there.\u201d Achilles pointed to a campfire situated between his tent and the rest of the camp. \u201cCome, the food is simpler here than in Agamemnon\u2019s tent, but much less bitter.\u201d</p><p>They walked over to the campfire where delicious scents wafted from a huge iron caldron that was simmering over it. About a dozen men were seated on large rocks and driftwood that had been pulled in a circle around the fire. They were being served by a couple women who were pretty enough, but wearing plain linen robes. Jacky was, unfortunately, nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The men greeted Achilles familiarly, speaking to him with obvious respect, though there was no bowing or scraping. Immediately a woman handed him a bowl filled with aromatic stew and a hunk of fresh bread. Kat noticed she avoided looking directly at Achilles. He motioned to Kat, and the same woman hurriedly filled another bowl and brought it and bread to her. As her eyes met Kat\u2019s there was an obvious shock of recognition. Almost imperceptibly she bowed her head and murmured, \u201cPrincess.\u201d</p><p>Kat was eating the excellent fish stew and thinking that it would probably be best if she avoided the other women as much as possible for the short while she\u2019d be here. It only made sense that many of the war prizes were Trojan and they would know her, or at the very least recognize her as their princess. Or, more accurately, recognize the young body she now temporarily inhabited as their princess.</p><p>\u201cHow goes it with Agamemnon?\u201d an older warrior asked Achilles.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s much the same\u2014arrogant and rude and under the mistaken impression that he can rule me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou set him aright, didn\u2019t you my lord?\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 lip twitched in what Kat was beginning to recognize as his version of a smile. \u201cI did, which is why the guard will be doubled tonight, and every night hereafter.\u201d</p><p>The men grunted wordless agreement.</p><p>\u201cI have formally withdrawn from the battle against the Trojans.\u201d Achilles dropped that bomb nonchalantly between bites of his stew. Kat watched the men\u2019s faces carefully, and saw expressions that ranged from shock to disbelief and even to anger, though it was only the older warrior who spoke.</p><p>\u201cFor how long, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Achilles shrugged. \u201cUntil I feel the need to fight for another man\u2019s glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, my lord, we have been fighting for the glory of Achilles,\u201d blurted one of the younger men. \u201cSo that your name will be sung for centuries.\u201d</p> <p>Achilles nodded and looked from man to man. \u201cAnd you have all fought bravely in this war for almost ten years because of a fate not of your own choosing. It may be time for each of us to reevaluate our fates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you ask that we fight on without you, my lord?\u201d the younger man said.</p><p>\u201cI ask only that each of you follow his own conscience, as I will follow mine.\u201d</p><p>No one spoke for several minutes, and then the old warrior yawned and stretched and said, \u201cI believe these old bones deserve a rest from battle. I will stand down with Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I,\u201d said the younger man.</p><p>\u201cI as well.\u201d</p><p>\"I.\u201d</p><p>All of the Myrmidons present chimed in, siding with their leader. Kat studied Achilles as his men chose him over battle and glory. He stared sightlessly into his bowl of unfinished stew and made little response to any of them.</p><p>When he finally spoke again, it was to her and not to the men who had resumed their casual conversation around him.</p><p>\u201cMy tent is now your home. Anything Briseis left within is yours. If you lack anything, these women will bring you whatever you need.\u201d Then he tossed his bowl down by the fire, grabbed a wineskin that lay nearby, and without another word strode off toward the shore.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t have a clue what she should do. The men ignored her. The women, who were sitting a little way off from the men, kept shooting her furtive, yet curious looks. The only thing she knew for certain was that Achilles had just annoyed the crap out of her. Hadn\u2019t they been getting along okay? It had seemed like it. Then that business with Agamemnon had screwed up everything. With a sigh she got up and approached the woman who had given her the stew.</p><p>\u201cHi. Uh, I was wondering if you knew where my, um, servant, Melia, is,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Princess. We have not seen your maidservant.\u201d The woman fidgeted nervously. \u201cHow may I serve you? Are you well, Princess? You have not been harmed, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Perfectly fine,\u201d Kat assured her.</p><p>The woman stepped closer to Kat and whispered, \u201cPrincess, I am Aetnia, a kitchen maid from your father\u2019s palace. I was captured with a group of servants who were buying fish outside the city more than two years ago. It will be difficult, but we can help you escape. Once you are within sight of the walls, Hector will surely come to rescue you.\u201d</p><p>Kat blinked in surprise, taken aback by the earnestness of this woman who wanted to help her. \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t need anything else tonight,\u201d she answered loudly enough for the men to hear. Then she lowered her voice and whispered, \u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t want to escape. At least not right now.\u201d Raising her voice again, she continued, \u201cI think I\u2019ll turn in. It\u2019s been an exhausting day.\u201d And she retreated quickly to Achilles\u2019 empty tent.</p><p>Okay, it wasn\u2019t exactly empty. It was just Achilles-less. The tent itself was filled with beautiful things. Kat gave a low, appreciative whistle. No way was the man who had collected all of these treasures a mindless killing machine bent only on war and destruction. The tent was huge, though not as large as Agamemnon\u2019s. It was softly lit by scented oil lamps suspended from ceiling supports. Under her feet was a thick crimson carpet with birds and wild flowers woven throughout it. Hanging on the tent walls were tapestries of exquisite detail. Most of them showed sea scenes, though a few depicted a lovely temple-filled city on a hill that overlooked the sea. Except for his helmet, a few spears, and a golden shield that bore the figure of an eagle on it, there was no evidence that the tent belonged to a soldier at all. In the rear of the tent Kat could see a bed, thick with linens and canopied with gauzy curtains. She was studying it nervously and thinking that it might seem big at the moment\u2014minus Achilles laying on it\u2014but she was sure that with him present there was no way she could sleep all chastely without brushing against his skin and touching him and his battle-hardened muscles and...</p><p>Then she noticed the thick pallet of comforters and pillows that made an opulent nest situated way on the other side of the tent\u2014literally as far away from the bed as was physically possible for it to be and still be inside the tent.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the war prize must sleep,\u201d she said aloud to herself. And, hell yes, regardless of how stank and trifling it made her, Kat was disappointed. \u201cYep. I\u2019ll admit it. Out loud. It would have been interesting to sleep next to him and try to keep my hands off him. Ur, I mean try to keep his hands off me.\u201d She laughed at herself. \u201cKatrina, honey, it has been too damn long since you\u2019ve had sex. With a partner.\u201d</p><p>She continued looking around the room and, with a happy little cry, found a pitcher filled with red wine sitting alluringly next to a couple empty goblets. \u201cWell,\u201d she said as she poured herself a generous cup full. \u201cHe did say the stuff in here is my stuff, so I\u2019m definitely commandeering the wine.\u201d</p><p>There was a chair beside the table she\u2019d found the wine on, and Kat sat while she sipped.</p><p>Okay, well, today hadn\u2019t really gone so terribly. Besides the whole she-and-Jacky-dying part, that is. Plus, that was just temporary. Hera was definitely going to owe them, and soon. It almost didn\u2019t seem fair. Achilles was doing her work for her. It was obvious that he was sick of fighting and pissed at Agamemnon, which Kat could totally understand. So the little tiff about Briseis was the proverbial straw on the camel\u2019s back. All that was left for Kat to do was just encourage him in the direction he was already going. She could actually relax and pretend like this was an unexpected vacation. She looked down at her new body, stuck her leg out, letting the drapey, togalike robe fall to the side to reveal the young, tight, well-formed limb.</p><p>\u201cSo does what happens in the ancient world stay in the ancient world?\u201d she said absently, peeking inside her outfit to check out her perky young boobs.</p><p>Kat wondered where Jacky was and what she was up to. \u201cProbably nursemaiding that blond cutie.\u201d And she should take a lesson from Jacky. She should learn to loosen up and have a good time\u2014make the best of this situation. \u201cIn other words, if I want to shtup Achilles, I shtup him. Hell, it\u2019d be good for both of us. I\u2019m always telling my clients to be sexually empowered. Okay. Shrink, heal thyself.\u201d Kat refilled the wine goblet and left the tent, walking purposefully toward the shore.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t hard to find Achilles. The moon was high and full in the sky. Reflecting off the calm sea it was like a giant nightlight. Plus, Achilles was a big guy who was making no attempt to hide. He was sitting on a rock facing the water. He\u2019d taken off the breastplate of his armor, as well as the metal things that covered his shins and he was wearing a loose thin tunic that opened at the chest and left his arms and legs bare. Kat thought he looked like a Greek statue sitting there, illuminated by the night and bathed in ancient mysticism.</p><p>\u201cIt is dangerous to walk alone at night.\u201d He spoke without looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not alone\u2014I\u2019m with you.\u201d</p><p>Achilles turned his head and looked at her. \u201cIs there something you require, Princess?\u201d The question was cordial, but his tone was remote, almost cold.</p><p>\u201cYes, company,\u201d Kat said honestly, and was pleased by the surprise she saw in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s my first night here. It\u2019s not what I\u2019m used to and I\u2019m a little homesick,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>\u201cYou must hate me for stealing you away from your family\u2014your kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t steal me; Athena did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you hate the goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Kat shook her head. \u201cShe was just doing what she felt like she had to do. Plus, you\u2019re not so bad.\u201d</p><p>He made a sound that seemed part laugh, part snort. \u201cYou are so odd, Polyxena of Troy. Are all the princesses of your city like you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d she said with complete certainty.</p><p>Then he did laugh\u2014really laugh, and Kat thought what a great sound his laughter made echoing musically with the lapping of the surf.</p><p>\u201cGot any more wine in that floppy thing?\u201d she asked, moving closer to him and holding out her empty goblet. He filled it up and the two of them sipped wine and gazed out at the sea. The silence between them was companionable, and Kat thought how weird it was that a man who supposedly scared the crap out of women could be so easy to be around. Which reminded her...</p><p>\u201cThat was a good thing you did today in Agamemnon\u2019s tent,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He glanced at her and raised his brows. \u201cSo says a Princess of Troy. Of course you would believe my being absent from the battle against your people a good thing.\u201d He said it as a simple statement without sounding angry or resentful.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right, but I wasn\u2019t thinking about that just now. I was thinking that I wouldn\u2019t want to fight for a man like Agamemnon, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt probably wasn\u2019t wise for you to insult him,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s not like he and I weren\u2019t enemies already.\u201d Achilles turned on his seat so that he could look directly into her face. \u201cAnd what about you and I? Are we not enemies, too?\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s mouth went dry. He was looking piercingly into her eyes and she could feel desire for him start to burn deep within her. She opened her mouth to remind him that she was his war-prize bride\u2014his property, but she couldn\u2019t make herself say that bullshit. She didn\u2019t care if she was in a strange body playing the part of a princess in an ancient world; Kat was still Kat. Even the goddesses agreed that it was the soul that carried the essence of a person, and not the body. There was no way she could consider herself someone\u2019s property, and no damn way she would act like it, either. Kat held his gaze and said, \u201cRight now you and I are a man and a woman who are alone under a full moon by the shore of a beautiful sea, and that\u2019s all we are.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Achilles lifted his hand and touched her cheek with just the tips of his fingers. Kat could feel their roughness against her soft skin. She could also feel that he was trembling.</p><p>\u201cI wish that were true,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt is true,\u201d Kat said. \u201cAt this moment in time\u2014this instant\u2014that is all we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you don\u2019t fear me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t frame the words as a question, but Kat answered him anyway. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t fear you.\u201d She stepped close to him so that she stood between his legs. Slowly, deliberately, she slid her hands up his arms to rest on his shoulders. Achilles didn\u2019t move. Kat thought he was barely breathing. Sitting on the rock he was still tall enough that she had to go up on her toes to reach his mouth. She kissed him softly, questioningly, mixing her breath with his and learning the taste and texture of him. He was salty like the sea beside them and he tasted of sweet wine. His lips were soft, but everything else about him was unbelievably hard. His shoulders under her hands were like iron, and the hands that he had automatically placed on her waist were rough and callused from decades of swordfights. The difference in textures\u2014his hardness and her softness\u2014was exquisitely erotic and she leaned into him, craving more of that difference.</p><p>The tips of her breasts pressed against his chest. Her body gave, molding into his. There was so little separating their skin, just her silky robes and his thin tunic. The tips of her sensitive nipples tingled and hardened. Kat moaned into his mouth and deepened the kiss, demanding more of him, and suddenly Achilles\u2019 hands were cupping her buttocks and his legendary strength was holding her as his mouth possessed her and the hard length of his cock throbbed hot and insistent against her stomach. She rubbed herself against him, wishing they were lying down... wishing they didn\u2019t have these damn clothes between their bodies... wishing she could\u2014</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d With a strangled cry Achilles pushed her away from him as he practically vaulted off the rock, stumbling several paces away from her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is\u2014\u201d she began, moving toward him.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><p>The word was an icy command Kat automatically obeyed. His voice had deepened, gone rough and harsh and unfamiliar. She froze where she stood and stared at him. Achilles had one hand up and held it palm out toward her, as if he expected to have to push her away again. The other was wrapped across his waist, and he was bent over a little. He seemed to be in pain as he gasped for breath.</p><p>Kat thought she understood at least some of what was happening to him. She\u2019d tripped some kind of trigger, and Achilles was fighting to control what the goddesses had described as his berserker rage. Okay. Fine. This she could handle.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, you should get in the water,\u201d she said in a calm, clinical voice.</p><p>He looked up at her then and Kat had to quell a surge of fear within her as she saw that his face, his entire body, literally seemed to be changing, growing bigger, stronger. His eyes flashed in the darkness with an eerie scarlet fire that reminded her of old blood.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying\u2014\u201d He struggled to speak between heaving breaths.</p><p>Kat forced herself to continue sounding calm. \u201cYou have to break the cycle of what\u2019s happening inside you\u2014confuse the reaction that\u2019s trying to take place in your body. Get in the water,\u201d she repeated. \u201cThat might do it.\u201d</p><p>He started backing toward the waves with lurching, almost painful-looking steps. Just before he threw himself into the sea he yelled a single word to Kat.</p><p>\u201cRun!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Even though it was decidedly unprofessional, Kat ran. What in the hell had started to happen to Achilles? She\u2019d seen men struggle with fits of rage before\u2014she\u2019d even seen men literally mad with out-of-control anger. None of those men had changed physically, yet she was sure Achilles\u2019 body had become bigger, stronger, scarier and\u2014</p><p>\u201cOof!\u201d Kat ran directly into Odysseus.</p><p>\u201cEasy, Princess, easy,\u201d he said, grabbing her elbow to keep her from falling on her butt. Then his eyes narrowed as he took in her white face and generally disheveled appearance. \u201cAchilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kat said, gasping for breath.</p> <p>Odysseus moved her defensively behind him as he peered back toward the shore. \u201cI don\u2019t hear him coming. Was it one of Agamemnon\u2019s men who attacked him?\u201d He spoke while he continued to keep watch behind them.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men attacked you?\u201d He took her elbow again and began leading her to the campfire. \u201cThe Myrmidons will never stand for this. I must tell them of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdysseus, wait. No one attacked me. Ur, well, I mean no one sent by Agamemnon attacked me.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus slowed and gave her a considering look. Then his eyes widened in understanding. \u201cAh, I see. The berserker took him while he was alone with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus looked seaward again. \u201cIt seems he has controlled it. He did not follow you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him to get into the sea,\u201d Kat blurted. \u201cHe did, and told me to run.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ordered the great warrior Achilles to get into the sea as his rage was coming upon him!\u201d Odysseus laughed. \u201cI would have given much to have seen that.\u201d</p><p>Kat frowned at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. He... he changes.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s look sobered. \u201cHe does. It is the price he pays for the choice he made long ago. Or rather, one of the prices he pays.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I thought\u2014well, I thought when I heard the, uh, rumors about him that he just had an anger problem. But what was starting to happen to him was way more than that.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d come to Achilles\u2019 tent and Odysseus motioned for her to sit on the bench just outside it. The warriors who had been eating were gone\u2014the fire was neatly banked. Kat could feel that the camp was still awake and watchful, but there was no one within hearing range of their conversation. She met Odysseus\u2019s intelligent gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to ask you to explain to me what happens to Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I am not certain if I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena wants me to help him,\u201d Kat broke into his denial. As she expected, evoking the name of the famous warrior\u2019s patron goddess had an instant effect on him.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you wish to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him start to change. Physically. What happens to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve witnessed it many times, and each time it is newly terrifying and awe inspiring,\u201d Odysseus said. \u201cWhen Achilles is roused enough\u2014whether by pain or fear or even passion\u2014the berserker rage Zeus gifted him with comes upon him. It is as if Achilles becomes possessed by a rage-filled god.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs it still him? I mean, does he know what he is doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles remembers his actions when the berserker leaves him, but when it is upon him he is fully under the control of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does it go away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rage eventually burns itself out, leaving Achilles drained, but himself once more,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why women fear him. Because it\u2019s not really him. I mean, he literally changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now will you fear him, too?\u201d Odysseus asked her.</p><p>Kat met his eyes. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not like the other women around here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike other women or not, under the possession of the berserker Achilles is dangerous. I would advise you to have care when you\u2019re alone with him.\u201d Odysseus seemed about to say more, but instead, jaw set and face unusually sober, he stared back in the direction of the sea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful. Plus,\u201d she added with a grim smile, \u201cI\u2019m under the protection of a goddess, remember?\u201d</p><p>His expression softened and he smiled at her. \u201cI would not forget my goddess, Princess.\u201d Odysseus hesitated, then added. \u201cYet even under Athena\u2019s protection, you ran from him.\u201d</p><p>Kat sighed. \u201cYeah, well, it seemed like the smartest thing to do. What was happening to him surprised me. I was caught off guard, which won\u2019t happen again. So you say that strong emotions trigger the change.\u201d</p><p>\"They do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t he change in Agamemnon\u2019s tent? Achilles hates the king, right?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHatred is a strong emotion, and I know he was mightily pissed by what happened in there.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus gave her a puzzled look.</p><p>\u201cPissed equates to angry,\u201d she explained quickly.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes. Agamemnon usually makes Achilles very angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, again, then why didn\u2019t he change?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus shrugged. \u201cAchilles was calm, his anger was controlled and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Answer me this,\u201d Kat interrupted. \u201cAchilles has to train to maintain his fighting edge, right? So he practices with the sword, or whatever, and he probably runs or works out or both. Right?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cAchilles trains often. He is also an excellent runner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes the berserker come on him when he\u2019s training?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I have never seen the berserker claim him as he trains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he gets all hot and sweaty and worn out?\u201d Kat asked, getting visibly excited.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Kat said. \u201cIf he stays physically calm it doesn\u2019t matter how mad he gets. The change doesn\u2019t happen. And it works the other way, too. As long as he keeps his emotional response under control, it doesn\u2019t matter how intense he works physically, he\u2019ll stay himself. That\u2019s why he has so many scars. I\u2019ll bet his heart rate and his breathing have to elevate along with a major emotional spike for the change to begin. So he has to let someone beat the shit out of him to get his heart rate up, and get pissed about it.\u201d A little thrill went through her as she realized what that meant about the kisses they\u2019d been sharing. \u201cI suppose that makes sense, if any of this does,\u201d she said more to herself than to Odysseus. \u201cThe change is physiological as well as emotional, so it must take a trigger that is based on both.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus was studying her intently. \u201cYou are a most unusual woman, Princess.\u201d</p><p>Kat opened her mouth to make a quip about \u201cthat\u2019s all a part of being an oracle and whatnot\u201d when Achilles\u2019 deep voice sounded from somewhere close behind them.</p><p>\u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure of your company, Odysseus?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus smiled smoothly and stood, grasping Achilles\u2019 forearm in greeting as he joined them. \u201cCan an old friend not visit for no particular reason?\u201d</p><p>Kat saw that Achilles\u2019 hair and tunic were soaking wet and he was carrying his breastplate, as well as the empty goblet she didn\u2019t remember dropping. There were dark circles under his eyes she would have sworn hadn\u2019t been there before they\u2019d had their interrupted make-out session, but other than that he looked perfectly normal again.</p><p>\u201cSo Agamemnon sent you,\u201d Achilles was saying.</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s smile widened. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 lip twitched. \u201cAnd you will have to report to him that I was, indeed, serious, that I will not join the battle tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your Myrmidons?\u201d</p><p>Achilles shrugged his broad shoulders. \u201cMy men are my companions, not my slaves. They shall do as they wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means they stand down with you,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cApparently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bid you good night then, and return to my tent. After reporting this sad news to our king,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cHe is your king, not mine,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>Odysseus lifted one shoulder. \u201cAs you have said many times before. Good night, my friend.\u201d He bowed his head to Kat. \u201cI wish you good night, too, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, Odysseus,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Just before he walked away, Achilles said, \u201cOdysseus, I thank you for seeing that the princess returned to my tent unharmed.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s smile turned sad. \u201cOld friend, I do not believe the princess was in any real danger. I simply kept her entertained while we awaited your return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night, my friend,\u201d Achilles called after him.</p><p>It was only after Odysseus was gone that Achilles looked at her. Kat met his gaze and forced herself not to fidget nervously. She wished he would say something, but he just continued to look at her, his expression inscrutable.</p><p>Finally she decided to say the most neutral thing that came to her mind. \u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slight nod. \u201cAs do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I am.\u201d</p><p>Achilles cleared his throat. \u201cYou have no reason to trust my word, but I swear that you need not fear sleeping in my tent. I will not touch you. I will not harm you. What happened on the beach will not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d Kat interrupted him, realizing suddenly that she didn\u2019t want to hear him tell her that what happened between them on the beach was a mistake he wouldn\u2019t repeat. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>The disbelief on his face was easy to read.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m not afraid of who you are right now,\u201d Kat corrected. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not afraid that you\u2019re going to spontaneously change into something else without, well, let\u2019s just say extreme provocation.\u201d</p><p>Achilles grunted, though he didn\u2019t look convinced by her little speech, and gestured to the tent flap. \u201cThen you should go to your bed. You do look tired.\u201d</p><p>Kat stood and walked the short distance to the opening of Achilles\u2019 tent. When she saw that he wasn\u2019t following her she said, \u201cAren\u2019t you coming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d give you time to...\u201d He hunched his shoulders and his words trailed off.</p><p>\u201cHow long are we going to be sharing a tent?\u201d</p><p>He blinked in surprise at her question. \u201cI do not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably more than a night or two, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Probably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we might as well get over being all awkward around each other,\u201d Kat said matter-of-factly, neatly avoiding mentioning that the reason they were behaving so awkwardly around one another was because they\u2019d just made out causing him to almost turn into a raging monster. \u201cSo come on in here with me, okay?\u201d</p><p>He grunted again, but this time he nodded and when she ducked under the flap he followed her.</p><p>Once inside, Achilles ignored her completely. He went directly over to the huge bed, stepped inside the gauzy curtain, and with his back to her, proceeded to strip off his tunic and dry himself with a linen robe.</p><p>Kat sat on her nest of a bed, took off her shoes and wiped sand from her feet. Then she unwrapped herself from the silky, ruby-colored robe that was the top layer off what she was wearing, leaving her dressed only in a thin cream-colored tunic that somehow fit loosely while still being flattering to her young body. And the entire time Kat busied herself semiundressing she tried unsuccessfully not to sneak glances at Achilles.</p><p>When he emerged from behind his bed curtain to dim the lanterns, she saw he was naked except for a short linen towel-like thing that was wrapped low around his hips. Kat stared, disbelieving at the scars that riddled his muscular chest. As if feeling her gaze, his eyes flicked to hers.</p><p>\u201cYou have more scars than I\u2019ve ever seen on one person,\u201d Kat blurted.</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cI know I look like a monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t,\u201d she said quickly, relieved that they were talking again. \u201cYou just look like a man who has used his body as a weapon.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her and then he gave a brusque nod. \u201cExactly.\u201d He turned down the last of the lanterns, leaving the tent lit only in a dreamlike light. Then he went back through the gauzy curtain and got into bed.</p><p>Kat wanted to give up for the night\u2014to roll over and close her eyes and pretend that she was really passed out on Jacky\u2019s couch and would wake up with nothing more than a wicked hangover. But she couldn\u2019t\u2014not if she wanted to get back to her body and her life. Hera had said she had to work fast, so she didn\u2019t have time for self-delusion and procrastination. And there was more to it than that. Achilles\u2019 touch had sealed the attraction she\u2019d already felt for him. Kat wanted to help him. She also was self-aware enough to admit that she wanted him to touch her again. Yes, what had started to happen to him had scared her. It had also excited her. He excited her, as did the knowledge that Achilles had not been with a woman in a very long time.</p><p>\u201cAchilles,\u201d she spoke softly, not wanting to wake him if he had fallen asleep.</p><p>\u201cYou have nothing to fear, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not asleep,\u201d she said, then rolled her eyes at herself. She was an educated, intelligent woman and that was the best she could come up with?</p><p>\u201cI do not sleep,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cEver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRarely.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, even though he couldn\u2019t see her. \u201cNow that I know I can help you with.\u201d</p><p>There was a pause and then he said, \u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I have to come closer to you. If that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\"You may come,\u201d he said, but Kat thought his tone was decidedly unthrilled.</p><p>She parted the bed curtains to find him sitting stiffly up, his back leaning against the carved oak headboard. Kat gestured at the edge of the bed. \u201cMind if I sit there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>She sat down\u2014actually, she perched on the edge of the bed. Still he changed position so that there was no way his legs were in any danger of touching any part of her body. His blue eyes were watching her warily.</p><p>\u201cYou said you can help me sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d But before she could answer he added, \u201cI won\u2019t drink a potion or smoke a vile-tasting weed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how?\u201d</p><p>Kat thought for a moment, trying to figure out the best way to describe hypnotism to a warrior from the ancient world. Finally she settled for, \u201cIt\u2019s a spell I can do with Athena\u2019s power. An oracle thing.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and looked serious. \u201cThe goddess does have vast powers. What must you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it\u2019s more something that you do and I help you with. Hang on.\u201d Kat went through the curtains and lifted a dimmed lantern from its hook, bringing it back to sit on Achilles\u2019 bedside table. She turned the wick down even lower, so that there was only a small flickering flame. Satisfied, she returned to her precarious perch on the bed. \u201cTo start with, you have to relax,\u201d Kat told him.</p><p>He looked skeptical.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cJust trust me. I\u2019m the oracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, oracle, were I able to relax I would be able to sleep. So there, you see, is the problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, let\u2019s just talk. Maybe I can sneak the spell in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, a lot like we\u2019re doing right now. And a lot like we were doing earlier tonight.\u201d</p><p>He looked away from her. \u201cI owe you an apology, Princess. I should not have touched you as I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, I touched you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should not have allowed it. It was dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdysseus told me about the rage that overtakes you,\u201d Kat said slowly.</p><p>\u201cThat is why I shouldn\u2019t have allowed it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDoes it happen every time you, uh, kiss a woman?\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers again. \u201cIt happens when I become aroused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery time?\u201d Kat asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I do not know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? How can\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>His blue eyes met hers. \u201cSimple.\u201d Achilles moved so fast she had no warning. One moment he was sitting there. The next he\u2019d lunged forward and grabbed her wrists, pulling her forward so that her face was just inches from his.</p><p>\u201cI cannot know because I do not usually allow myself to desire a woman. To touch a woman. Not as I am desiring and touching you now.\u201d</p><p>Oh, shit, Kat thought. It would have been easier if I\u2019d been sent to hell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Really?\u201d Kat kept her voice carefully neutral. \u201cSo you didn\u2019t manhandle and then proceed to scare the living shit out of Briseis?\u201d</p><p>Her words had the desired effect on him. The rusty light that was beginning to tinge his eyes faded and he let loose her wrists as if she\u2019d burned him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said shortly. \u201cI never touched the maiden Briseis.\u201d</p><p>Kat quelled the urge to rub at the marks he was sure to have left on her wrists. \u201cYou didn\u2019t touch her, but she was scared of you anyway, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, this is something you need to understand once and for all. I. Am. Not. Like. Briseis. Actually I\u2019m not like any of the women you\u2019ve ever known. If you and I are going to get along\u2014and I think we are\u2014you\u2019re just going to have to accept that and quit judging me like you would other women.\u201d She looked around and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw another goblet sitting on the bedside table. \u201cGod, I need a drink.\u201d Kat got up, grabbed the goblet and headed for the pitcher of wine she\u2019d already started to empty. She glanced through the gauze curtain back at Achilles. \u201cMind if I have a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>He looked perplexed. Again. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She poured a full goblet and then, carrying the pitcher with her, went back to his bed. She set the pitcher on the bedside table next to the lantern, then this time Kat didn\u2019t perch nervously on the edge of the bed like she was a demented pigeon scared of a statue (a.k.a. Achilles) who had suddenly come alive. She plopped down on the bed, curling her legs under her comfortably, sitting closer to Achilles, and took a long drink of the excellent red wine before she spoke. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the deal. I think I can help you. Not just with your nonsleeping issue, but also with your, well, nontouching-of-a-woman-you\u2019re-attracted-to issue, too.\u201d She gave him a nervous little smile. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming that you really are attracted to me.\u201d</p><p>His mouth twitched in his little almost-smile. \u201cI am.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut if you touch me too much, which, and again I\u2019m assuming, includes stuff like the make-out session we had on the beach earlier, you\u2019re going to have a problem with turning from you\u201d\u2014Kat pointed to him and then off into the distance, kind of like he was part of a PowerPoint presentation\u2014\u201cto that other you I almost met this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you don\u2019t see me as him.\u201d</p><p>The tension in Achilles\u2019 voice was beyond obvious, and Kat reached out slowly to rest her fingers lightly against a puckered scar that ran the length of his left bicep.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. How could I? Odysseus explained what happens to you, and I witnessed the beginnings of it. What you were turning into is definitely not what you are now.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Achilles bowed his head, as if such an enormous weight had just been lifted from him that he had to bend to bear the absence of it. Then slowly, meticulously, his shoulders straightened and his head lifted. Achilles met her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou are the only woman I have ever known who has understood that. It is not me. It is something that possesses me. I cannot control it. I can rarely stop it. I cannot even summon it at will.\u201d He made a derisive sound deep in his throat. \u201cIf I could I would not have had to make myself hideous with these scars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t make you hideous,\u201d Kat said. Her fingers still rested on the ridge of the old scar on his bicep. \u201cThey\u2019re a part of you. In my mind they\u2019re just the physical evidence of how hard you\u2019ve had to work.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cThere\u2019s bound to be a price for everyone knowing your name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve said it correctly. It is my price. My penalty. My burden and, ironically, my choice.\u201d He looked down at where her fingers lay gently against his arm. \u201cWhen I was a boy I was given the choice of my fate. I was asked to choose happiness and love and a life that would be full, but forgotten, or a warrior\u2019s life of battle and death too soon, but eternal glory. I chose glory. I wanted my name to be sung for untold generations.\u201d Achilles\u2019 deep voice was bitter with self-loathing. \u201cDo you know that I will meet my death here, before the walls of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve, uh, heard the rumor that you would.\u201d Of course Kat had heard about it. She remembered that much mythology. Achilles, the warrior who was invulnerable except for his heel, was killed by an arrow through said heel, near the end of the Trojan War. Kat felt a jolt of panic. Why the hell hadn\u2019t she thought more about that?</p><p>\u201cHow long have you been here fighting the Trojans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost a full decade,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit!\u201d Kat grabbed his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to fight anymore.\u201d</p><p>His brow lifted. \u201cDid I not just proclaim to Agamemnon that I have withdrawn from the fighting?\u201d</p><p>Kat felt a ridiculous surge of relief that was extraordinarily short lived. Wait... in Homer\u2019s incredibly boring Iliad hadn\u2019t Achilles withdrawn from the battle, too? But then he\u2019d rejoined it and ended up being speared through the heel. But why? What had made him fight again?</p> <p>\u201cGoddamnit!\u201d Kat cursed, turning to refill the goblet again. \u201cI so should have paid better attention in school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSchool?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, brushing off his question while her mind raced. Okay, it was logical to believe the reason he rejoined the war, and was eventually killed, had something to do with his berserker rage. Fine. So she\u2019d work on helping him break the triggers for the rage and then, voila! He wouldn\u2019t be uncontrollable. He\u2019d actually stay out of the fighting and wouldn\u2019t be killed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re supposed to die in the Trojan War. But I\u2019ve been sent here by Athena to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d she said boldly, shrugging internally. Athena and the other two goddesses didn\u2019t want him fighting. Him not fighting and him not dying were practically the same thing.</p><p>He was watching her with an intent expression in his compelling blue eyes that she thought might be the beginnings of hope.</p><p>\u201cI am fated to die before the gates of Troy after the death of your brother, Hector.\u201d</p><p>Kat felt a terrible clutching in her stomach. That\u2019s right\u2014she remembered something about Achilles killing the King of Troy\u2019s son, who just happened to be the brother of the body she was temporarily inhabiting.</p><p>\u201cWell, then we will just have to be sure you don\u2019t kill Hector, won\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe a god-ordained fate can be changed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a goddess who believes it. Actually I know several goddesses who believe it, and I\u2019ve found that women are usually more reasonable about subjects like war and violent death than men. So let\u2019s go with the goddesses\u2019 version on changing fate, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 expression was absolutely serious. \u201cThere is little I wouldn\u2019t give to change my fate, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s get started.\u201d Kat smiled and held the goblet out to him. \u201cHave a drink with me. I\u2019m going to talk to you about relaxation.\u201d</p><p>An hour and two goblets of wine (mostly drank by Achilles) later Kat had the urge to grab his wide shoulders and give him a massive shake. And she would have, if she thought it would have done any good. Achilles was lying flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling. His body was rigid and he was definitely not relaxed.</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re never going to relax if you don\u2019t believe you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t allow myself to relax,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re going to have to learn how. All right. Try this. Think about each area of your muscles like they\u2019re parts of you that need to be trained\u2014individually. The training you\u2019re giving them is to relax completely. So you\u2019re really just ordering parts of your body to do something. It\u2019s no different than ordering your arms to pick up a sword and then swing it to protect yourself.\u201d</p><p>He turned disbelieving blue eyes on her. Kat sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhen you sleep do you lay flat on your back like that?\u201d</p><p>He thought for a moment, then said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you lay? What position makes you comfortable?\u201d He hesitated, then lifted his left arm over his head and cocked his left knee up. His right arm he rested loosely over his waist. Achilles tilted his head a little, looking marginally more comfortable.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d she said, thinking how utterly sexy he looked lying there with no shirt on, his thick mane hanging around his shoulders, his gorgeous blue eyes trained on her and all of that lovely, toned muscle with those dangerous scars muted by the flickering lantern light.</p><p>\u201cIt is difficult to relax while you stare at me like that.\u201d</p><p>Shit! She jumped guiltily. \u201cTry harder. Ignore me.\u201d Then she remembered that the wife of one of the couples she\u2019d counseled used to hold her husband\u2019s hand all during their sessions. No, she hadn\u2019t just held his hand. The woman used to rub it gently and her husband, who was ridiculously nervous about going to a counselor, always relaxed under her ministrations (they had actually stayed married\u2014they\u2019d just needed some communications help). \u201cOkay, give me one of your hands,\u201d she said suddenly.</p><p>Achilles frowned at her. \u201cWhat do you want with one of my hands?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Kat said with an ironic lift of one brow. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be scared of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give me your hand.\u201d She held out her own in invitation.</p><p>The frown turned into a scowl, but he gave her the hand that had been resting behind his head. Kat held it in both of hers, and slowly began to firmly massage it, working on the callused pad. She glanced up at him. He was watching her with hooded blue eyes. The scowl had been replaced with a carefully expressionless mask.</p><p>\u201cTell me about your favorite place,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you wish to know about it?\u201d he said after a moment\u2019s hesitation.</p><p>\u201cDescribe it. Close your eyes and pretend like you\u2019re taking me there.\u201d</p><p>He watched her for a few more breaths, and then\u2014to her surprise\u2014he actually closed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThere is a hidden cove off the coast of Phthia.\u201d He paused and opened his eyes. \u201cPhthia is my birthplace.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded and kept rubbing his hand. He looked down at it, then back up at her. \u201cGo on,\u201d she prompted when he didn\u2019t continue. \u201cTell me what the cove looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe water there is calm and clear,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cClose your eyes and take me there,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned again, but closed his eyes. \u201cThe sand of the beach is white. The rocks that jut from it are dark. The water is a distinctive blue.\u201d Probably just like your eyes, Kat thought, but kept the notion to herself. \u201cIt is a shallow cove, and there is a hoof-print shaped ridge of coral in the middle of it.\u201d At first he spoke self-consciously, in short, halting sentences, but soon he seemed to forget she was there, and as he painted a picture of his favorite place while she rubbed first one hand, and then the other, Kat could see his wide shoulders relax and his breathing deepen. \u201cMy mother, the sea goddess Thetis, comes there often. Oysters that grow black pearls live there, beneath the coral, and I have often retrieved them for her. The fish there are fat and lazy, like the sea birds that perch on the black rocks...\u201d</p><p>He paused, and Kat spoke in the calm, steady voice she used to help induce a hypnotic state in her clients. \u201cThink about being there, Achilles. Let my voice take you back to your cove. You\u2019re laying on the beach... the sand warm against your body... the gentle waves are kissing the shore... rhythmically... Listen to me... let my voice take you there. You\u2019re totally at peace... completely relaxed. Your feet are relaxed, warm in the soft sand. There is no anger in your cove... no war... It is warm and protected. Your legs are completely relaxed...\u201d Kat went on, methodically taking Achilles through the relaxation exercise as she gently released his hand and watched him closely as his warrior\u2019s body finally let loose and his breathing became deep and regular.</p><p>With no change in her tone Kat asked, \u201cAre you there, Achilles?\u201d</p><p>He paused, and then said, \u201cYes.\u201d His deep voice was slightly slurred.</p><p>\u201cGood. I want you to know that no anger can reach your cove, or you while you are there. Your mind is at peace. Your body is relaxed. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re in your cove tonight, which means you are going to sleep deeply. As I count I want you to become more and more relaxed. Your body is heavy... ten... you need to rest it... nine... the sand is warm... eight... inviting your weight... seven... you are safe... six... completely relaxed... free of rage... five... it cannot find you there... four... tonight you will sleep in your cove... three... and not awaken until past dawn... two... until then your heavy body will rest peacefully... one... safely...\u201d</p><p>Kat let her voice trail off. If she were any judge, and she definitely was, Achilles was extremely susceptible to hypnosis. Which, she decided, made sense. This berserker thing that possessed him had to screw with his state of consciousness, and once that was messed with it left his subconscious open to suggestion. She smiled, totally self-satisfied. He was definitely hypnotized, which actually meant he was in what amounted to a trance state. He would awaken from the state, presumably after dawn, as she had suggested, feeling completely refreshed.</p><p>Kat studied his face. He looked different so relaxed. Usually he carried himself with a rigidity that made it apparent, at least to her, that he was constantly worried about what would happen if he let loose. And she could hardly blame him after getting a firsthand glimpse of the berserker that waited to possess him. But right now Achilles thought he was on his special beach, safe and warm and relaxed. His face had lost that hard edge to it. His lips had softened, and were parted just a little bit, reminding her of how they\u2019d felt against her mouth. What Achilles lacked in kissing experience he certainly made up for in enthusiasm and in strength.</p><p>Her gaze glided across his naked chest. She usually wasn\u2019t a fool for muscles, but Achilles didn\u2019t have the stupid steroid-pumped body of a preening gym \u201cwarrior.\u201d His body was his tool. He used it well and he used it hard. And it bore the marks of such use.</p><p>Almost without her realizing it, her hand sneaked out so that her fingers could, once again, rest lightly on the old puckered scar on his bicep. She ran her fingers lightly up the scar, feeling its ridge. And then her fingers were straying to another scar that had once been a nasty slash along the top of his shoulder. This one was flat and thin. It must have healed cleaner than the other, she thought.</p><p>There were several scars on his chest. The worst was a jagged pink line that didn\u2019t look very old. It went from above his left breast all the way down, crisscrossing his ribs and then disappearing under the light sheet he\u2019d pulled haphazardly to his waist. Kat let her fingers follow the scar down his breast and over his ribs. Her fingers were moving lower when Achilles moaned.</p><p>Kat froze, her eyes immediately on his face. His eyes were closed and he still looked completely under. \u201cYou are deeply relaxed. Still in your cove.\u201d Then she bit her lip. She probably shouldn\u2019t ask... she definitely shouldn\u2019t. Well, why the hell not? He\u2019s not one of my married patients. God knows it\u2019d be good for him. Kat cleared her throat and then asked softly, as her fingers continued to follow the path of his scars, \u201cWhat do you feel, Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour touch,\u201d he said immediately.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is your cove, Achilles. Your special place.\u201d Kat\u2019s heartbeat started to increase as she spoke, but her voice stayed hypnotically soft and calm. \u201cYou can have whatever you wish in your cove. So, tell me Achilles, what is it you wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would not stop touching me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Deep in Kat\u2019s body Achilles\u2019 words caused heat to spread like she\u2019d just downed a shot of twentysomething-year-old single malt. She felt the slick need between her legs and subdued the urge to press her thighs together to seek relief. It wouldn\u2019t do any good anyway, that was not the kind of relief she needed. Kat\u2019s eyes drifted lower to the bulge that was becoming more and more obvious beneath the sheet.</p><p>Could she do it? Could she make love to him and keep him hypnotized?</p><p>Unethical skank! Her inner editor shrieked at her. Thankfully Kat was excellent at gagging her inner editor. Plus the real question she needed to ask herself wasn\u2019t if she could keep him hypnotized, but whether she could keep him calm enough that the berserker wouldn\u2019t possess him. And she was far from sure she could keep him calm and make crazy, sweaty love to him.</p><p>Well... maybe they wouldn\u2019t make crazy, sweaty love. Seriously there were just so many levels between celibacy and crazy lovemaking\u2014or even sweaty lovemaking. Perhaps she could find a level that would work.</p> <p>Again Kat reached out to touch Achilles. This time she let her hand caress a path over his chest and down to his hard abdomen. Her fingers dipped under the sheet. She didn\u2019t actually touch his cock, but Achilles\u2019 skin trembled beneath her fingers and he drew in a deep breath, which he let out in a moan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in your cove... relaxed... warm... safe,\u201d she murmured, being careful to keep her voice hypnotic, which was damn difficult because her breathing had definitely picked up. \u201cWhat else do you see there besides sea and coral and sand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said. His deep voice was, thankfully, still relaxed and he sounded dreamy and exquisitely sexy.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kat said before she could change her mind and turn back into a boring professional (sadly not practicing the oldest profession). \u201cI\u2019m there. What am I doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLying beside me,\u201d he said, and then before she could prompt him with another question he added, \u201cThere is no fear in you, and you are touching me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAchilles, there is no fear where you are\u2014no anger\u2014no pain.\u201d Suddenly she had the urge to cry. How long had it been since he\u2019d been touched without fear or anger? Following her impulse, she lay down, facing him. Her head rested on his shoulder, her hand on his chest. \u201cYou are becoming more deeply relaxed,\u201d she murmured softly. \u201cMy touch is your anchor. Your desire is guiding it. What do you desire, Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p><p>And that was it. That single word was her undoing. \u201cThen you\u2019ll have me,\u201d she said, sliding her hand down slowly... slowly... until she grasped his hard shaft. Achilles moaned as she stroked the long, thick length of him. \u201cRemember, this is a dream... only a dream...\u201d</p><p>He moaned again and his hips lifted to meet her strokes. Kat slid her legs under the sheet and moved closer to him, and with a rush of liquid excitement she realized that he was completely naked. The loose linen wrap that had been covering him had come free, so there was nothing except the thin silk of her underdress between them.</p><p>To hell with this! Kat thought, tugging the flimsy silk up so that she was bare to the waist, she pressed herself against his hard thigh.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods!\u201d Achilles said as her wet heat ground against his skin in time with her stroking hand.</p> <p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d she whispered, wishing he would take her aching nipples in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He moaned the word. \u201cMore... give me more of you.\u201d He turned lazily toward her, rolling on his side with a dreamy motion as if he were moving through water. His hands came down to cup her bare buttocks and he pressed his hard cock insistently against her.</p><p>\u201cYes, more!\u201d Kat\u2019s vagina was swollen and so wet that she slid easily up and down against the hard, hot length of him. Achilles didn\u2019t enter her, and Kat continued to whisper calming words to him as she glided against his cock, the thick ridge of his head pulsing against her clit until she exploded in a fast, shattering orgasm. \u201cCome with me, Achilles.\u201d She gasped and reached down to stroke his cock, slick with her wetness. With a guttural cry, Achilles\u2019 hot seed spurted between them.</p><p>\u201cPrincess...\u201d He sighed as she milked him dry and then collapsed against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you are deeply relaxed,\u201d she panted. Well, hell yes he\u2019s deeply relaxed. She stared at his face. They\u2019d both come and he\u2019d stayed under the entire time. Holy shit. That was the nastiest thing I\u2019ve ever done. Kat was sure she\u2019d be blushing, if her cheeks weren\u2019t already completely flushed from the massive orgasm she\u2019d just had. Now what am I supposed to do? Kat cleared her throat, suppressing the seductress and resummoning the shrink. \u201cAchilles, you will sleep for the rest of the night and wake after dawn completely refreshed.\u201d To say the least, she added silently to herself. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d he murmured sleepily, and she noticed that his lips twitched up in his little half-smile.</p><p>Kat slowly unwrapped herself from around him and slid carefully from his bed. She looked down at him. Achilles was utterly, completely relaxed. His breathing was deep and regular. His body was limp and sprawled, spread-legged across the bed, but even like this he still retained a look of fierceness and power. With sudden insight she knew that even without the berserker that possessed him this man would have been a great warrior and a leader.</p><p>Kat bit her lip and wondered (belatedly) how the fierce warrior would feel about the way she\u2019d manhandled him tonight. She could imbed a hypnotic suggestion that he not remember what had happened between them at all. Kat sighed. No, she wasn\u2019t that stank. Plus, even though her behavior was what Jacky would call \u201centirely too fresh,\u201d Kat was not into self-delusion and knew that she wanted him to remember\u2014wanted him to know that they pleasured each other without the berserker taking over. On the other hand, what if remembering freaked him out? According to the goddesses, he hadn\u2019t had sex in years. Maybe he\u2019d wanted to be fully conscious for it.</p> <p>Oh, sure. Then the berserker could have taken over, and that would have definitely been no bueno.</p><p>\u201cWell, crap,\u201d she said softly. Then an idea came to her and she raised her voice back to a clinical level. \u201cAchilles, when you wake you will remember everything that happened tonight, but only if you want to. Sleep now and have only pleasant dreams.\u201d</p><p>Congratulating herself, she sipped from a fresh goblet of wine while she used water from a basin to wash up. When she was done she looked back through the gauzy curtain at Achilles. He was sound asleep. She would have liked to have crawled back in bed with him and snuggled up against that incredibly hard body, but what would happen in the morning when he woke up? Would she be greeted by a surprised Achilles or by a blood-thirsty berserker? Not willing to take the chance, Kat curled up in her thick pallet of downy linens, and was almost immediately asleep.</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t wake up until the kerfuffle coming from outside the entrance to the tent crept into her dream, turning the gorgeous Italian pool boy/man who was massaging her shoulders into a shrieking fishwife. Jolted out of her fantasy Kat sat up in time to see Jacky bursting into her tent. The small, deceptively sweet-looking blonde stalked over to stand in front of her. She put one hand on her very slim hips. The other Jacky pointed straight down at her vagina.</p><p>\u201cMy va-jay-jay is covered with blond hair! Can you fucking believe that? I\u2019ve never seen such a thing,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Automatically Kat shot a glance at the curtained bed in the rear of the tent and was relieved, and a little disappointed, to see it was empty. She rubbed her eyes and smoothed her hair back out of her face.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Jacky said, tapping her foot impatiently against the thick carpet.</p><p>\u201cWell what, Jacky? You\u2019re a natural blonde. What did you expect?\u201d</p><p>Jacky plopped down on the edge of her pallet. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, I didn\u2019t even look last night when I peed. And anyway, it was dark. Then this morning I was washin\u2019 up, and there it was. It was a shock, I tell you.\u201d</p><p>Kat stretched luxuriously. \u201cI love you, Jacky, but you\u2019re kind of a moron.\u201d</p><p>Jacky narrowed eyes at her that were unfamiliar in their color, but completely familiar in their expression. \u201cI am not a moron. I\u2019m just white.\u201d She lifted blond brows. \u201cOf course, some people might say that\u2019s the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Completely unbothered, Kat grinned and stretched again. \u201cYou know, you just need to relax and go with it. We\u2019re not going to be here long and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet baby Jesus, you\u2019ve had sex!\u201d</p><p>Kat frowned at her BFF. \u201cHow can you tell that? And I didn\u2019t really have sex. At last not technically.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst, easy. You\u2019re all rumpled and glowy. And you haven\u2019t been this relaxed in\u201d\u2014Jacky paused, obviously mentally counting\u2014\u201cin about three and a half years. Which is how long it\u2019s been since you\u2019ve had sex. Second, what do you mean not technically? And please recall that we decided several years ago that oral sex is definitely sex.\u201d</p><p>Kat fidgeted. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been three and a half years. It\u2019s been three years and four months.\u201d</p><p>Jacky snorted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t have oral sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Jacky prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut I had sex\u2014kind of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain Katrina Marie.\u201d</p><p>Kat sucked a deep breath and then said in an enormously fast rush, \u201cI-hypnotized-Achilles-and-while-he-was-under-I-had-a-heavy-make-out-session-with-him-and-we-both-came.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist on a cracker. You raped Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not! He said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to try sayin\u2019 that again. This time with the truth stuck in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really crabby now that you\u2019re white,\u201d Kat procrastinated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been crabby, as you know very well. Stop stalling, Katrina.\u201d</p><p>Kat sighed. \u201cOkay, well, he kind of said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know shtuping the TU quarterback on the fifty-yard line is nothing compared to raping an unconscious guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, I did not rape Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatrina. Was he in control of all of his faculties?\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s grin was slow and satisfied. \u201cIt certainly felt like he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh! You are so fresh! And that is not what I meant. I mean was he conscious or under your diabolical influence when you shtuped him?\u201d</p><p>Kat chewed her lip, hesitated, and then gave up. She always told Jacky everything\u2014she might as well get it over with. \u201cLook, earlier last night I met him out on the beach after Agamemnon\u2019s bullshit. And, well, we\u2019d been getting along at the king\u2019s tent, even though I did piss off the king. God, he\u2019s as annoying as Hera said. Anyway, what I said was nothing compared to Achilles announcing that he and all his men who had a mind to follow him would be withdrawing from the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that went over with Agamemnon like hot turds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and Achilles told him off and we almost had to fight our way out of there. And may I take this opportunity to mention that Briseis doesn\u2019t seem like a very nice girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. She was lounging against Agamemnon\u2019s royal knee throwing me dirty looks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of looks did she throw at Achilles?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t. The bitch didn\u2019t glace at him one time. It wasn\u2019t like she wanted him, but more like she just didn\u2019t want me to have him. I ignored her and held on tight to Achilles\u2019 arm. That really freaked her out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolding onto his arm freaked her out? What is she, some kind of weird virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my guess is she\u2019s like most of the women from this time. They\u2019re freaked out by anyone touching Achilles on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Jacky asked. \u201cIs it just that berserker thing? Hell, remember my brief but unfortunate thug phase and Rashod a.k.a. X? He was mean as a snake, but he watched himself and showed some damn sense during the short time I dated him. Yes, I do admit that he is now doing time for accidentally killing his neighbor, LaShawn Johnson, but clearly when we stopped dating he also stopped using good sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky, Rashod a.k.a. X, pulled out a nine millimeter gun and in broad daylight shot LaShawn and his dog\u2014dead. Five times each, if I remember correctly,\u201d Kat said. \u201cI do not think you can call that an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRashod a.k.a. X, only meant to shoot LaShawn\u2019s pain in the ass yappin\u2019 dog. LaShawn lost his damn mind and got out there all between the bullets and the dog. Which, in my professional medical opinion, is not very bright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy were we talking about Rashod a.k.a. X?\u201d Kat asked, utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 if that little Briseis and all the rest of the milquetoast white chippies around here are oh so scared of your boy, I think they could use a little fieldtrip to North Tulsa to chat with some of the brothers to straighten them right up. Truly, Kat, how scary could Achilles be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Achilles,\u201d Kat said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s not scary. He\u2019s sexy and kind of sad and lonely. It\u2019s the berserker they\u2019re afraid of, and they should be. I got a glimpse of him, Jacky. He hadn\u2019t even fully possessed Achilles, and it was awful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatrina Marie, did he hurt you?\u201d Jacky moved instantly into the persona Kat liked to think of as Super Nurse.</p><p>\u201cNo. I, uh, ran.\u201d</p><p>Jacky\u2019s blond brows met the hairline of her flowing tresses. \u201cYou ran. As in away from him, across the beach, with your bosoms floppin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Kat looked down at her young chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think these bosoms flopped much. They\u2019re almost unnaturally perky. But, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you raped him as some kind of twisted revenge scheme? It\u2019s borderline brilliant, but still very stank of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook. I did not rape him. The whole thing was really an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, like Rashod a.k.a. X\u2019s unfortunate murder one accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not like that. I was trying to relax him. Apparently Achilles doesn\u2019t sleep, or at least not much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you, what, gave him a relaxing blow job and that made you come? You\u2019re seriously more desperate than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, no. I didn\u2019t give him a blow job nor am I desperate, Jacqueline. I hypnotized him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then came the blow job?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I didn\u2019t blow him. I jerked him off. But not before I\u2019d taken my pleasure from him,\u201d Kat said with a satisfied smile.</p><p>\u201cYou sat on his face while he was hypnotized? Guys can do that when they\u2019re under?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t sit on his face! God, you\u2019re nasty beyond belief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. I\u2019m not nasty; I\u2019m a nurse. This is all clinical to me. Pretend like you\u2019re at the doctor\u2019s office. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, uh, rubbed myself against his, uh, pee pee,\u201d Kat said, feeling her cheeks get hot.</p><p>Jacky fell back against the cushions and burst into gales of giggles. \u201cOh, god, you said pee pee!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop!\u201d Kat shoved her friend\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLook, I really didn\u2019t mean for it to happen, but there he was all naked and muscular and angsty, and then I touched his scars, and then his, uh, penis\u201d\u2014she enunciated the word carefully, glaring at Jacky who unsuccessfully tried to stifle a giggle\u2014\u201cgot all hard and he said he wanted me to keep touching him and I did. And I did not shtup him because I was worried that the berserker would show up. Plus, if you want to get all technical about it, he wasn\u2019t exactly one-hundred percent himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs in not exactly conscious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. So that\u2019s what happened. The end. Could we please change the subject?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, this whole hypnotize-\u2019em-and-make-\u2019em-service-you thing is really an excellent idea. Think you could teach me how to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely no way in hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is a rumor going around that we might be in hell, so you want to rethink that answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. And now to officially change the subject\u2014how\u2019s Patroklos and what did you do last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI, not being as stank as you, slept. And my white boy is fine, thank you. At least I\u2019m assuming he is. He was gone when I woke up this morning.\u201d Jacky\u2019s lineless brow furrowed. \u201cI suppose I should find him and be sure he hasn\u2019t gotten those stitches dirty or whatnot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, Patroklos stayed passed out all night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTotally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat \u2018totally\u2019 sounded kinda wistful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, you are displacing your stankish-ness on me. I\u2019m not interested in the white boy like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. He\u2019s all tall and young and muscular and handsome. Icky. Who would be interested in that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s white. White boys think I have too much ass and attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Jacky, you\u2019re currently a skinny white girl, remember? So all you have is too much attitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m in denial. What say we get something to eat and I work on filling out this skinny ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRampant stankness will do that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, your blond and flowing tresses are looking rather disheveled this morning. If you\u2019re not good I won\u2019t tell you how to deal with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFresh,\u201d Jacky muttered as Kat dressed. \u201cSo damn fresh...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat and Jacky were munching cheese and olives and some kind of fried swine, and as a side dish arguing about the ethics of hypnotism, when Aetnia, the maid who had recognized her the night before as princess, went rushing by, and then paused when she saw Kat.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Aetnia? Where\u2019s everyone going?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cThe men are drilling by the beach, Princess. I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m sure Achilles would wish for you to come, too.\u201d Then she scampered away.</p><p>\u201cLast night he certainly seemed like he wished for me to come, too,\u201d Kat said smugly.</p> <p>\u201cReally? You mean when he was conscious or afterward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d Kat lied.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s go check him out. Unless you\u2019re scared to face him whilst he\u2019s actually walking and talking.\u201d Jacky jumped up and started quickly after the disappearing maidservant.</p><p>\u201cHe was talking last night,\u201d Kat muttered and pulled a face, but followed Jacky anyway.</p><p>\u201cI mean, I for one would love to see if he\u2019s still under your diabolical spell.\u201d</p> <p>Three women who were headed in the same direction as them gave Kat fearful looks and began whispering amongst themselves as they overheard Jacky\u2019s words.</p><p>\u201cThere is no spell, you dork,\u201d Kat said loud enough for the huddling women to overhear. Then she lowered her voice for Jacky only. \u201cThe hypnosis ended when he woke up this morning\u2014refreshed, and hopefully, good as new.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just exactly what is he going to remember about last night?\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cOnly as much as he wants to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, that\u2019s diabolical,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cNo that\u2019s ingenious,\u201d Kat countered.</p> <p>Jacky gave her a dubious look, but they were both too busy climbing over dunes to bicker with any enthusiasm. Then the sandy, grassy mini-hills gave way to a smooth, wide beach that was filled with\u2014</p><p>\u201cSeminaked men!\u201d Jacky trilled.</p><p>\u201cWith swords,\u201d Kat purred. \u201cIt is a romance novel!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, there\u2019s your boy.\u201d</p><p>Jacky\u2019s pointing finger called Kat\u2019s attention to the largest group of men. In the center of the group was Achilles, stripped to the waist and circled by four men. They were in full armor, even though Achilles was practically naked, holding only his shield and a weird-looking short sword.</p><p>\u201cDamn, he has muscles on his muscles,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know how the hell he survived those wounds. No wonder they say he\u2019s immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what they say?\u201d Kat whispered as they joined the other women who were sitting on driftwood watching the men.</p><p>Jacky shrugged. \u201cI overheard some stuff last night. The Myrmidons talk about him like he\u2019s a god.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not. He\u2019s just a man,\u201d Kat said firmly, and then tried not to wince as two of the four men lunged at Achilles. She needn\u2019t have worried about him. His reactions were so fast he seemed to belie her words. He dodged aside, spun and smacked both men smartly on their asses with the flat part of his sword. The watching Myrmidons broke into loud guffaws, complete with crude comments. Achilles\u2019 answering grin was surprisingly good-humored and he gestured for the other two warriors to come on. They lunged. Achilles moved to the side and easily parried with his eagle-crested shield. The warriors backed off and Kat realized why his sword looked weird\u2014it was wooden.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not even using a real sword!\u201d Kat told Jacky.</p><p>As if he heard her, Achilles\u2019 startlingly blue eyes looked up from the circling warriors directly to her. Kat saw the surprise that widened his eyes, and then felt the electric snap of attraction that sizzled between them. At that moment one of the warriors struck and Achilles was late in his reaction. The warrior\u2019s sword blade skimmed lightly down Achilles\u2019 chest, leaving a thin ribbon of scarlet, before he slapped it aside with the nonlethal wooden sword. With a growl, Achilles dropped into a crouch. Kat noticed the change in the surrounding warriors at once. The circle backed off and the men who were sparring with Achilles seemed to hold their breath. She watched Achilles take deep gulps of air as he obviously fought against the onrush of the berserker.</p><p>Then there was a flash of silver-blond and a tall figure detached himself from the retreating circle. Completely unarmed, Patroklos walked purposefully up to Achilles, making a surreptitious motion to the other two warriors to back off. His smile was clearly reflected in his voice and he spoke nonchalantly, as if he had no idea Achilles was struggling with becoming a monster.</p><p>\u201cThey say, cousin, that none can beat you in a wrestling match. I say that\u2019s because they do not have the inside knowledge of a kinsman.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Achilles\u2019 body straightened out of the feral crouch. Kat saw his lips twitch up slightly. \u201cAnd what inside knowledge would that be, kinsman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you are like a great snapping turtle. Dangerous and unpredictable, but helpless when you\u2019ve been pushed on your back.\u201d</p><p>As Achilles laughed, Patroklos launched himself at the older man and, just like that, the shadow of the berserker was gone and the men were cheering again as the cousins grappled in the sand.</p><p>\u201cIf that damn stupid white boy rips open my stitches I\u2019m gonna strangle him.\u201d Jacky stood up, obviously preparing to march into the group of men and pull Achilles and Patroklos apart.</p><p>Kat snagged her wrist and pulled her back down beside her. \u201cYou are so not going down there to yell at Patroklos in the middle of all of that testosterone and me-Tarzan, you-Jane mentality.\u201d</p><p>Jacky stayed seated but grumbled, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be pissed if he messes up those stitches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, relax. Achilles will make sure he doesn\u2019t hurt himself,\u201d Kat said automatically, and then as she continued to watch she realized how right she\u2019d been. They were putting on a good show. The two men were tossing each other around and being highly entertaining, but Kat could tell that Achilles was definitely avoiding Patroklos\u2019s injured shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just admit it,\u201d Jacky said. \u201cThere is something completely sexy about all this warrior machoness. I mean, look at them. They\u2019re all bare chested and muscular and sweaty and oh, so \u2018I\u2019m gonna bang my chest and kill the dragon for you\u2019 that it makes me want to let him ravish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Kat asked with a waggle of her brows. \u201cWho him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatroklos, of course. Don\u2019t get fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did you say ravish? Since when could anyone ravish you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I turned white.\u201d</p><p>Kat was laughing when Aetnia and two other servants approached her. All of them gave a little curtsey/bow.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me, Princess.\u201d Aetnia spoke in a low, whispery voice while throwing furtive looks over her shoulder at the group of men. \u201cYou should know that we are willing to do your bidding at any time. Simply say the word and we will aid you in escaping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEscaping?\u201d Jacky frowned at them. \u201cWe\u2019re not escapin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>The women looked at Jacky as if she had sprouted wings. One of them began to rub something that looked like a penis amulet that hung from a braided hemp rope around her neck as she quickly backed a couple steps away.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nice of you, but like I said last night, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Kat said. Before Jacky\u2019s feathers could ruffle she amended, \u201cWe\u2019re fine. Honestly. I\u2019ll let you know if we need anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I\u2014\u201d Aetnia began.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being all annoyin\u2019? Is that what you were gettin\u2019 ready to say?\u201d Jacky interrupted with a saccharine smile. \u201c\u2019Cause you definitely are.\u201d</p><p>The woman who was still clutching the penis amulet suddenly said, \u201cMelia, you were not a healer in the palace. You were only the princess\u2019s servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed,\u201d Jacky said in her take-no-prisoners voice.</p><p>\u201cMelia has always had many talents,\u201d Kat said, elbowing Jacky. A stirring in the group of men caught the edge of Kat\u2019s vision. \u201cSpeaking of, it looks like the wrestling match is over and Melia had better check out Patroklos\u2019s stitches. So I\u2019ll see you later, ladies.\u201d She grabbed Jacky\u2019s arm and hauled her away from the women. \u201cJacky, those women know you,\u201d Kat whispered to her.</p><p>\u201cThose women do not know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey know you.\u201d Kat fluttered her hand at Jacky\u2019s new body.</p><p>\u201cOh. I forgot. So?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we don\u2019t need the drama trauma of a bunch of war prizes freaking over the fact that you and I aren\u2019t who or what we appear to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat difference does it make? Like you said, we\u2019re not gonna be here very long. Plus, you\u2019re a princess. They\u2019re servants. They can\u2019t do shit to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle Melia! My savior! Just in time to wipe up my blood!\u201d</p><p>Patroklos grabbed Jacky, lifted her in his arms and kissed her soundly. Kat stared, mouth flopping, as Jacky giggled, pushed half-heartedly against him and blushed a gorgeous shade of pink. \u201cPut me down before you mess up my stitches. And where the hell are you bleeding now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t me this time. It\u2019s him.\u201d Patroklos jerked his chin at Achilles. \u201cBut I still want you to mop the blood from me, my beautiful little war bride.\u201d He put Jacky down, but not before kissing her again.</p><p>Jacky took a shaky step away from Patroklos, and still blushing, turned to Achilles. \u201cLet me look at that sword wound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is nothing.\u201d Achilles made an abrupt gesture with his hand, cutting off Jacky\u2019s advance. \u201cWorry about his stitches. I\u2019ll mind my own wound.\u201d</p><p>Jacky shrugged. \u201cWhatever.\u201d She glanced at Kat as she turned back to examine the smiling Patroklos\u2019s stitches. \u201cYou should probably make sure it\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not\u2014\u201d Achilles began.</p><p>Kat squared her shoulders and finally looked at him. \u201cIt needs to be cleaned out.\u201d Their eyes met. Kat wished like hell that his face was easier to read. At the moment all she saw was the guarded mask he liked to show the public.</p><p>\u201cI thought you did not like the sight of blood,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cAll the more reason to clean it off,\u201d Kat said, trying not to be too glad he remembered she didn\u2019t like blood.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look deep,\u201d Jacky said, peering around Patroklos\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSaltwater should work fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s an ocean of that right there. Perhaps, cousin, you should take another swim?\u201d Patroklos put his arm around Jacky as he grinned at Kat.</p><p>Kat looked from Patroklos to Achilles and wondered just exactly what he\u2019d told his cousin about last night.</p><p>Jacky, who had neatly sidestepped Patroklos\u2019s grasping arm said, \u201cDo not start with me. You\u2019re covered with sweat and sand and his blood. You need a swim, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we all go!\u201d Patroklos took Jacky\u2019s hand and started off down the beach. Kat looked at Achilles. He raised a brow at her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re covered with sweat and sand and your blood,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Achilles repeated. \u201cWe go with them.\u201d</p><p>They followed Patroklos and Jacky. At first neither of them said anything. Kat glanced at him. \u201cSorry about that cut,\u201d she said.</p><p>He looked surprised. \u201cWhy do you apologize for something that isn\u2019t your fault?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was my fault. You were looking at me and not paying attention to the guy coming at you with the sword.\u201d</p><p>He gave a little snort of laughter. \u201cThe fault isn\u2019t yours. I shouldn\u2019t have allowed myself to be distracted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you always make sure you\u2019re in perfect control?\u201d She asked the question automatically, and almost instantly regretted it. The night before he had definitely not been in control\u2014not on the beach, and not later alone with her in his tent.</p><p>His blue eyes seemed to darken as they met hers. Instead of answering her he said, \u201cI slept last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, and then cursed softly as she tripped on the edge of her robe. Abruptly he put out his arm for her to take. She wrapped her hand around his thick bicep, not minding at all that it was slick with sweat. \u201cThanks,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou have trouble walking on your own in the sand,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOnly because I\u2019m trying to keep up with you,\u201d Kat said defensively.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t complaining,\u201d Achilles said softly.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smiled up at him. \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d He asked, looking honestly perplexed by her.</p><p>\u201cYes, it is.\u201d Kat cleared her throat. \u201cUh, about last night...\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 full lips tilted up. \u201cDo you mean about the relaxation spell you placed on me?\u201d</p><p>This time Kat could read the teasing glimmer in his eyes. \u201cJust exactly how much of the, uh, spell do you remember?\u201d</p><p>The tilt of his lips lifted and became a full, heart-stopping smile. \u201cEnough.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat was trying to figure out what \u201cenough\u201d meant when they caught up with Patroklos and Jacky, and deciding okay, fine. She was a professional. She would just ask him. When Jacky turned to her and with a relieved expression said, \u201cGood. There you are. Tell him that we can\u2019t go swimmin\u2019 with them because we have nothin\u2019 to wear in the water.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked at Patroklos, who was smiling at Jacky adoringly. \u201cShe\u2019s right. This silk stuff\u201d\u2014she picked up a fold of her outer dress and swirled so that it flowed gracefully around her\u2014\u201cis pretty, but not good for the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should both do what we\u2019re going to do. Shouldn\u2019t they, cousin?\u201d Patroklos said, with a mischievous glance at Achilles.</p><p>The corner of Achilles\u2019 lips lifted. \u201cThey should, indeed. It would save the lovely fabric of their robes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShall we?\u201d Patroklos asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, cousin,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>And while Kat and Jacky watched, the two warriors stripped off every bit of their clothes and leaped, shouting, into the turquoise waves.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cGod. My god.\u201d Jacky fanned herself vigorously. \u201cI owe you an apology, Kat. Even if there has been a mix-up about my skin color there is no damn way we\u2019re in hell. We have gone straight to heaven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you ever in your life seen such a beautiful body?\u201d Kat asked dreamily, staring at Achilles and wishing desperately that he would swim back to shallower water. And then stand up.</p><p>\u201cKat, tell the truth. Patroklos looks like Spike, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Kat wrenched her eyes from ogling Achilles long enough to roll them at Jacky. \u201cYou are such a dork. And your Buffy infatuation is truly pathetic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe does look like Spike! Check out that lean yet muscley physique and that silver-blond hair. All he needs is a change in hair-style and a long black leather coat. Sweet weeping baby Jesus he has a six-pack to beat all six-packs. I\u2019m going to have to shtup him. I think it\u2019s only right. How can I let all of that deliciousness go to waste?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not Spike, fool. Patroklos is a nice guy. Spike was the Big Bad.\u201d</p><p>Jacky gave her a look that telegraphed you\u2019re a moron. \u201cSpike from Buffy season seven, Kat. Please try to stay with me here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, did you say something?\u201d Kat\u2019s eyes followed Achilles\u2019 every muscular, naked movement.</p><p>\u201cKat, is Patroklos\u2019 penis pink?\u201d Jacky asked, shielding her eyes with her hand to get a better look as she squinted against the sun reflecting off the waves.</p><p>\u201cJacky, do not even try to pretend like you haven\u2019t had sex with a white guy before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Bradley and just those few times. Remember how unsuitable I decided he was, what with his weird addiction to chocolate-covered maraschino cherries? He used to bite the bottom off those wretchedly cheap candies and suck the grossness out. Vile\u2014totally vile.\u201d Jacky shivered dramatically. \u201cAnyway I didn\u2019t notice any overly pinkness with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Patroklos is a very white guy. Hey, think about it like this. His pink penis matches your blond va-jay-jay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, lord, I need to sit down. Being white is exhausting.\u201d</p><p>Jacky was looking around for a log of driftwood when Patroklos ran out of the sea to grab her hand. \u201cSwim with me, my beauty.\u201d</p><p>Kat tried to keep her eyes to herself, which was damn difficult with Patroklos standing there dripping wet, smooth skinned and totally nekked. While Jacky babbled about not having a thing to wear, Kat moved her gaze seaward (versus downward). Achilles was walking slowly toward her. The water was still just a little over his waist, with waves lapping to his wide chest, so she was able to watch every bit of him emerge. He is like an ancient god, golden and powerful and seductively imperfect. He made her body feel flushed and ultrasensitive, and her mind kept flashing back to the night before like an erotic projector flipping on inside her head. Just as she was wondering how she could drop her clothes and wrap herself around him without the berserker showing up and ruining everything, Achilles\u2019 posture changed. He left the water, walking swiftly to his discarded clothes.</p> <p>\u201cA runner from the Greek camp comes,\u201d he said to Patroklos, who instantly stopped the kidding tug-of-war he was playing with Jacky and pulled his clothes on, too.</p><p>Kat squinted back down the beach and, sure enough, a man carrying a long, thin spear and a shield and wearing the same kind of scarlet cloak she\u2019d seen Odysseus wearing was running toward them. He arrived minutes later, winded but obviously being sure to show Achilles careful respect by saluting him and bowing his head slightly.</p><p>\u201cMy lord, Odysseus, has sent me.\u201d The warrior began speaking before he\u2019d completely caught his breath.</p><p>\u201cIs Odysseus well?\u201d Achilles asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, but not all of the Ithacans have been so lucky. Today\u2019s battle was hard fought.\u201d The warrior\u2019s voice was not condemning and his voice held no hostility, but beside her she could feel the tension that radiated from Achilles. \u201cOdysseus sends me to ask if the healer, Melia, would be allowed to tend them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Kalchas too busy sniffing around Agamemnon to bother to tend the wounded?\u201d Achilles said in a cold, flat voice.</p><p>\u201cKalchas!\u201d Jacky practically shrieked. \u201cYou mean that filthy old fool who tried to be sure Patroklos\u2019s arm rotted off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my beauty, that would be Kalchas,\u201d Patroklos said, draping an arm around her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s go.\u201d Jacky extracted herself from Patroklos\u2019s arm and made a shooing motion at the messenger.</p><p>The messenger looked from Jacky to Patroklos to Achilles. Jacky looked from the messenger to Patroklos to Achilles to Kat, and then back to Patroklos. Kat braced herself for trouble.</p><p>Jacky put her hands on her narrow hips, an action which was totally Jacky-like when she was pissed, and Kat thought how weird it was that just the way she was holding herself made her look like her body was more lush. But before she could tie into Patroklos or Achilles, Kat stepped forward.</p><p>\u201cShe should help Odysseus\u2019s men. You know we\u2019ve been sent here by Athena, and Athena is Odysseus\u2019s patron goddess. She\u2019d want Melia to tend his wounded men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does make sense,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>\u201cI do not like her going alone.\u201d Achilles looked pointedly at me. \u201cAnd you do not like blood, so you will not be going with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy beauty will not be going alone,\u201d Patroklos said, putting his arm back around her. \u201cShe has me. I will escort her.\u201d</p><p>Jacky gave him a look that was one part long suffering, one part amusement and one part appreciation. \u201cAnd will you be sure the men do what I tell them to do, even if it means they have to boil and wash things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will do that for you, if you perform a favor for me later.\u201d Patroklos\u2019s infectious smile was more than a little naughty.</p><p>\u201cI might be interested in that, if it doesn\u2019t involve anything that will tear out those stitches.\u201d</p><p>Achilles gave the runner an almost imperceptible nod, and then, with Patroklos laughing and whispering to Jacky, the three of them began moving off down the beach in the direction of the Greek camp.</p><p>\u201cIthacan! Leave your spear,\u201d Achilles said abruptly. The runner paused, looking nervously back at the scarred warrior. Achilles\u2019 lips twitched up slightly. \u201cI have a taste for sea bass.\u201d The warrior, with obvious reluctance, handed Achilles his spear. \u201cCousin, be sure this is replaced with one of ours.\u201d Patroklos smiled and nodded, and then he and Jacky hurried after the retreating warrior. \u201cDid the man really believe I was going to spear him with his own weapon for nothing more than asking to borrow a healer?\u201d Achilles muttered, more to himself than to Kat.</p><p>\u201cSure looked like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here you are, alone with such a fearsome warrior. Some people would call you mad.\u201d His turquoise eyes studied her.</p><p>\u201cAnd how often have you speared one of Odysseus\u2019s men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then it sounds like I\u2019m the sane one and the men like Odysseus\u2019s messenger are the ones who need a reality check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His deep voice had gone flat and cold. \u201cThey are right to fear me. You should not ever forget that there is a monster waiting to possess me, body and soul.\u201d</p><p>Kat met his gaze. \u201cI\u2019ll remember, but I prefer to focus on the man, not the monster.\u201d</p><p>She saw surprise flash through his eyes. \u201cHave you always been so contrary?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>He snorted a half laugh. Then, still studying her carefully, he said, \u201cI\u2019m going to spear some sea bass. You may come with me or return to camp. The decision is yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like sea bass. A lot, actually. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201d</p><p>He gave a short nod and they started walking side by side down the beach, away from the disengaged camps of the Greeks and the Myrmidons. He didn\u2019t offer Kat his arm, but he did walk slowly. They were so near the lapping water that Kat took off her slippers so that she could dig her toes into the wet sand. She did touch him then, using his arm to balance as she had the night before. He felt warm and strong under her hand, and she thought how weird it was that his presence could be so reassuring when the truth was there was a dangerous warrior and a monster lurking not far under his skin. She didn\u2019t look up at him, but she could feel his eyes on her, just as she could feel them on her as she walked closer to the waves, holding her robes up so that the warm water could play around her feet.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss your home?\u201d</p><p>His question surprised her into answering with complete honesty. \u201cYes, I do. I\u2019m homesick for normal things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>Kat realized she\u2019d answered herself into a corner and thought quickly, discarding answers like the Internet and hot running water. When she finally answered, it was, again, with an honesty that surprised her. \u201cI miss my freedom. I\u2019m used to being able to do what I want to do and not worry about asking permission. I like being responsible for myself.\u201d</p><p>Achilles snorted. \u201cI heard old Priam was too lenient with his children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is not too lenient!\u201d Kat said automatically, thinking about her dad back in Oklahoma who raised her to have a backbone and to value herself, but who didn\u2019t tolerate any crap from her, especially when she had been an obnoxious teenager.</p><p>\u201cThen explain to me why he would allow Paris to abduct the king of Sparta\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Shit! Helen\u2019s husband was the king of Sparta? As in the Spartansthat spawned the kick ass three hundred? Kat dug into the wet sand with her toe and wished, for the zillionth time, she\u2019d paid more attention to mythology in college. Finally she shrugged and said what she figured was probably close to the truth based on the vague information she did have (that he was a middle child and that he\u2019d stolen someone\u2019s wife). \u201cParis has always made stupid decisions the rest of us get stuck cleaning up.\u201d Before he could ask any more difficult-to-answer questions Kat asked one of her own. \u201cSo did it bother you today not to join the battle?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering her, Achilles pointed to a half circle of coral that was just a few feet off the shoreline. \u201cBass like to rest in the shady spot there.\u201d This time he didn\u2019t strip but waded, thick-soled leather shoes and all, out to the coral. He climbed up on a benchlike ledge and crouched so that he could look down into the water.</p><p>Kat sighed and picked up a smooth, round seashell, trying to think of something she could ask him he might actually answer.</p><p>\u201cIt did not bother me not to join the battle today.\u201d</p><p>She glanced up from the shell to him.</p><p>\u201cIt does bother me that my absence might have caused the death of even one Greek.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s wrong to have you and your men keep fighting for someone who treats you like Agamemnon does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it more wrong than to cause men\u2019s deaths?\u201d</p><p>Kat wanted to tell him that his absence would cause the war to end sooner, and that would save lives, but Kat knew she couldn\u2019t. He was on the side of the Greeks. No matter how badly Agamemnon had used him and then pissed him off, he still couldn\u2019t want to hear that his people would be defeated. So instead she said the only thing she could: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>In the silence that followed, Achilles suddenly moved with blurring swiftness and hurled the spear into the sea beneath him. When he pulled it up it had neatly impaled a large, writhing bass. He pulled it off the spear and tossed it up on the beach entirely too close to Kat\u2019s feet and she skittered several steps away from the flopping thing.</p><p>\u201cYou said you liked sea bass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do. Cleaned and cooked. By someone else.\u201d</p><p>Achilles crouched back on the coral outcropping and returned to staring down into the clear water. \u201cThen I\u2019ll have to have one of the maidservants who like to whisper escape schemes to you take care of the preparation.\u201d</p><p>Kat realized she shouldn\u2019t be surprised that he knew what was being whispered about in his own camp. \u201cAnd were you told my answer to those escape schemes?\u201d</p><p>He looked up from the water to her. \u201cWhat was your answer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because you fear what I would do to you if I caught you trying to escape?\u201d</p><p>Kat made sure her voice sounded as haughty as a princess. \u201cNo. Because a goddess sent me here. I\u2019ll leave when she tells me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wish to leave me already?\u201d His voice was neutral, verging on uncaring, but Kat recognized the loneliness in his eyes\u2014she\u2019d seen it the night before.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to leave you.\u201d As she said the words she knew they were true. She didn\u2019t want to leave him\u2014not yet. Not until she had helped him to control the berserker and change his fate.</p><p>He didn\u2019t comment. He simply turned his attention back to the water. In no time there were two more huge fish added to the flopping pile on the beach. When he speared a fourth, he waded back to her and rammed the point of the spear through all four fish. Then, while Achilles carried them over his shoulder like a bizarre knapsack, they headed back to camp.</p><p>They walked awhile in silence, which, at least to Kat, didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. But as they got closer to camp, and thereby closer to Achilles\u2019 tent and the inevitability of them spending another night together, her pile of unanswered questions became too heavy.</p><p>\u201cI saw you fight off the berserker when you were drilling with your men today,\u201d she said.</p><p>He glanced at her and then looked away. \u201cThere really wasn\u2019t any danger of the berserker overtaking me. I was simply surprised, that and the pain from the sword scratch were enough to make the men leery of me. But neither the pain nor the surprise was great enough to cause the monster to possess me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t seem like Patroklos was very leery of you.\u201d</p><p>Achilles smiled one of his rare full smiles. \u201cMy foolish cousin believes I would never harm him and he often acts much too rashly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you wouldn\u2019t hurt him,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. He is the closest thing I have to a brother or a son, and I would give my life to protect his. The berserker has no such loyalties.\u201d</p><p>Kat thought about that and wondered just how true that statement was. Odysseus had said that the berserker had been possessing Achilles since he was about sixteen. The berserker was a being of anger and hatred and passion and killing. But did that mean he had no ability to develop a relationship with anyone in Achilles\u2019 life?</p><p>\u201cWhere did the berserker come from before he cursed your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeus,\u201d Achilles said. \u201cHe sent the berserker when I made my choice. First he offered a long, happy life filled with the love of a fine woman and the respect of my family and friends. I would die of old age and my fame would mean naught but to my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds like an amazing future. Many people would give almost anything to know that their lives would be fulfilled by love and family,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI took the second choice. I chose a short, but glorious life of constant battle. I will die on the battlefield before the great walls of Troy shortly after the death of your noble brother, Hector. My life will be bereft of love. No children will carry the burden of my blood in their veins. But even without those things, my name will be remembered in all parts of the civilized world for thousands of years to come.\u201d</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t say anything. What could she say? You made a crappy, immature decision. She didn\u2019t need to say anything like that. It was already more than obvious that the mature Achilles\u2014the man he\u2019d grown into\u2014knew deep in his soul that the childlike version of him had made a serious mistake.</p><p>\u201cWhich one would you have chosen, Princess?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Achilles\u2019 question threw her off guard. Kat wasn\u2019t used to being asked the \u201cif you could change your life decisions would you\u201d questions. She was the shrink. She did the asking. She glanced up at the scarred warrior walking beside her. He was waiting attentively for her answer, as if it truly mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for girls,\u201d she said, trying to reason through her answer and be as honest with him as possible. \u201cIf someone had given my teenage self the choice you were given it wouldn\u2019t have been any choice at all. I didn\u2019t want to be a great warrior.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cI still don\u2019t. But had I been given the choice between... say...\u201d Kat paused, considering. \u201cWell, between your first choice, which was basically to have a happy life fulfilled by all the normal things: marriage, family, home, blah, blah, or to have something heart-stopping, breathtaking and utterly ridiculously romantic. Like maybe a torrid, passionate love affair with someone who was completely taboo but whose love would flame forever in my soul even if it burned me out when I was still young.\u201d Kat clutched her hands over her bosom dramatically and gave an exaggerated sigh, which made Achilles chuckle. \u201cI probably would have taken the ridiculous romantic choice, and then regretted it when I grew the hell up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would regret love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFire-hot passion with someone because he\u2019s off-limits isn\u2019t love; it\u2019s a little girl\u2019s fairy tale idea of love. Plus now that I\u2019m a grown woman I know that it\u2019s possible to have both if you choose wisely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you can have a fiery passion for someone that can actually last, and he doesn\u2019t have to be the bad boy Mommy wouldn\u2019t let you date. It has to be the kind of fire that is fed with reality\u2014as in communication and respect and such\u2014versus the fantasy of...\u201d She hesitated, wanting to refer to Romeo and Juliet, and finally finished with, \u201cthe fantasy of love, or rather lust, at first sight.\u201d She looked up at him to see if she\u2019d totally lost her audience, but he was still watching her with an intent, curious expression on his scarred face. \u201cIt\u2019s a little like the fact that you could have had both, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>His abrupt tone said Kat might have pushed too far, but she figured there was no going back now...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an amazing warrior and a great leader without the berserker. In just the couple of days I\u2019ve been here I\u2019ve seen you stand up to the king of an entire nation, lead your men, who follow you with complete loyalty, and beat four warriors at the same time. You did all of that without the berserker.\u201d</p> <p>Achilles didn\u2019t speak for several moments, and when he did his voice was hollow with regret. \u201cIt is not possible to turn back the wheel of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, guess not...\u201d Kat said as a vision of the queen of Olympus played through her mind.</p><p>Kat quickly decided missing running water and the Internet was nothing compared to not having grocery stores. True to his word, Achilles had tossed the bass at the feet of Aetnia and barked an order at her to cook it before he muttered something about \u201cseeing to Odysseus\u201d and striding away, leaving Kat frowning at his broad back and trying to ignore the dead fish eyes.</p><p>Aetnia, of course, instantly jumped to, grabbing the fish and hurrying off to do whatever it is one did to real fish to get them filleted and ready for the deli case and eventually the skillet.</p><p>\u201cI need a drink,\u201d Kat said. And before she could so much as enter Achilles\u2019 tent in hopes that the pitcher of wine had been refilled, another maidservant seemed to magically materialize at her side, offering a goblet full of a lovely red. \u201cOh, thanks!\u201d Kat smiled at her.</p><p>The young woman blushed and bobbled a sweet curtsey. \u201cAnything for you, Princess!\u201d Then she retreated back across the little clearing that separated Achilles\u2019 tent from the others and joined a group of women who were sitting together mending what looked from the distance like articles of clothing while they threw her curious glances and whispered among themselves.</p> <p>Kat sighed and sat on the bench beside Achilles\u2019 tent. Well, she was playing princess. That probably meant that she shouldn\u2019t go over to the group of women and try to make friends. She wasn\u2019t a mythology expert, but that didn\u2019t mean she was utterly a moron about ancient history. Nobility didn\u2019t mix with servants. Period. That was already more than obvious by the way the women were reacting to Jacky\u2019s new, outspoken persona. Clearly Polyxena was the only noble war-prize bride in the Myrmidon camp. Logically if there were others, they would have shown up to commiserate. The smartest thing to do would be to keep as low a profile as possible and stay away from the other women, avoiding unanswerable questions as well as escape plots.</p><p>But by the time Aetnia got back with the filleted fish, Kat was completely bored just sitting there by herself. Plus she really hated the subservient way Aetnia scurried around like she was really worried about offending The Princess. It made her wonder how awful Polyxena had been.</p><p>\u201cHere, I\u2019ll help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Princess! This isn\u2019t work for\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAetnia, really. I\u2019ll help. I want to.\u201d Kat reached for a long wooden spatula-looking thing that was sitting on the cooking table beside the campfire. There was what seemed to be a perpetually simmering pot of stew hanging from poles over the fire, so Aetnia had placed the huge hunks of fish in two heavy iron skillets directly on the rocks that were interspersed with the glowing coals. \u201cI\u2019ll poke these two. You take those two.\u201d Kat situated herself near the skillet she\u2019d commandeered, enjoying the delicious smell of garlic, olive oil and fresh fish frying.</p><p>\u201cAs you wish, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo whose war-prize bride are you?\u201d Kat asked to fill up the extremely dead air.</p><p>\u201cI belong to Diomedes, Princess,\u201d Aetnia said.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met him yet. Do you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike him?\u201d She looked confused. \u201cHe does not beat me,\u201d Aetnia said, as if that answered Kat\u2019s question. \u201cHe is the warrior who wounded Achilles yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Kat thought back, vaguely remembering a young, muscular guy who definitely had a big sword. She wished Jacky was there so they could make nasty puns about it, but she settled for smiling at shy Aetnia and saying, \u201cHe seemed to know what he was doing with a sword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I hope he didn\u2019t anger Lord Achilles,\u201d she said in a little burst of breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d</p><p>Aetnia looked so relieved Kat thought for a second that she was going to faint.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Princess!\u201d she gushed.</p><p>\u201cAetnia, why were you so worried about Achilles being mad at Diomedes?\u201d</p><p>The young woman\u2019s eyes grew huge and she lowered her voice fearfully. \u201cThe berserker, Princess. It overtakes him and he becomes a monster. He can kill anyone when the creature possesses him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever seen Achilles in his berserker rage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly watching from the walls of our beautiful city.\u201d She shivered. \u201cThat was terrible enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve been in his camp for, what, more than two years?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve never seen the berserker take control of him here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, maybe you should consider that Achilles isn\u2019t as out of control and scary as everyone says he is.\u201d</p><p>Aetnia gaped at Kat. \u201cMy lady, you, too, have watched him from the walls of Troy. You\u2019ve seen him on the battlefield cutting a swath through our men. I do not understand how you can say even one kind word about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAetnia, Diomedes is in need of you. Return to his tent.\u201d Achilles\u2019 deep voice coming from behind them made both of them jump, but Kat thought Aetnia looked like she was going to pass out.</p><p>\"Y-yes, my lord!\u201d She bobbed several jerky curtseys and literally ran off.</p><p>Kat frowned up at the glowering Achilles and was getting ready to tell him to quit being such a bully, that they were already scared enough of him, when Jacky made her grand entrance, followed closely by an unusually pale Patroklos.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet weeping baby Jesus, is that fried food that I smell?\u201d She grabbed a pottery bowl from the table and sat on the log closest to Kat. \u201cI am starving.\u201d She looked at Kat appraisingly. \u201cDid I miss something? Did hell actually freeze over and you cooked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d Kat told her, spooning up some of the hot, flaky fish for her friend.</p><p>\u201cI do not understand how you can eat,\u201d Patroklos said. \u201cNot after the wounds you tended today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, she can eat,\u201d Kat said, gesturing at Jacky with the spatula. \u201cShe could eat a huge dinner while she lanced a boil while simultaneously playing with a ball of tapeworms.\u201d</p><p>Jacky rolled her eyes at Kat. \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to her. She exaggerates. I wouldn\u2019t play with the tapeworms\u2014I don\u2019t like parasites. Plus like I\u2019ve been telling you all afternoon. You\u2019ve been in battle. I have no clue why the blood and guts after the fact should bother you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBattle is one thing. Afterward is another,\u201d Patroklos said. He gave Jacky an adoring look. \u201cMy beauty is not like other women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue for so many reasons.\u201d Jacky smiled flirtatiously at him. \u201cOne of them being I believe in cleanliness.\u201d Her gaze went from flirty to incredulous when she turned it on Kat. \u201cYou would not believe how nasty the infirmary was with\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine!\u201d Achilles cut off Jacky\u2019s gross recounting, as he called over his shoulder to the women who were mending clothes in front of a nearby tent. Several of them scrambled to do Achilles\u2019 bidding, disappearing for only a moment and then reappearing with goblets for everyone, as well as four clay pitchers of wine.</p><p>Kat thought it was interesting how the women skirted around Achilles, giving him a wide berth. One girl, who must have drawn the short stick, was filling up his goblet and her hands were shaking so badly Kat was sure she was going to make a mess of it. \u201cKeep an eye on the fish,\u201d she told Jacky, and hurried over to Achilles. \u201cI\u2019ve got this. Go on back to your sewing.\u201d Kat took the pitcher from her and gave her a friendly smile. The girl bowed and then bolted. With a hand that was decidedly steadier, Kat filled Achilles\u2019 goblet.</p><p>\u201cYou know, if you didn\u2019t bark commands at them, they might stop jumping out of their skin every time you\u2019re near,\u201d Kat said softly as they walked the short distance to the campfire together.</p><p>\u201cThey fear me even though they have no reason to. Commanding them or not will not change that.\u201d</p><p>Kat thought he sounded angry, and she guessed she couldn\u2019t really blame him. The women showed their fear of him so openly that it must grate on his nerves. Kat spooned up fish and garlic for all four of them, and even Patroklos ate at Jacky\u2019s insistence. Then she and Jacky sat comfortable on the bench and ate the utterly delicious fish with fresh bread and wine, while Patroklos and Achilles sat on the sandy beach on either side of them.</p><p>Kat noticed Patroklos leaned his back intimately against Jacky\u2019s knees. They ate and talked easily together. Kat decided she liked Jacky with Patroklos. That he was a good man was obvious, but he also had a fun sense of humor, and he seemed to appreciate her. And Jacky definitely liked him\u2014despite her cynical nature.</p><p>Kat looked down at Achilles. He was sitting close to her, but his back was so ramrod straight that no part of his body touched hers.</p><p>She bent forward and whispered in his ear as she tugged on a long strand of his golden hair. \u201cLean back against me. You look uncomfortable as hell sitting all perfect and straight like that.\u201d</p><p>He looked up over his shoulder at her, grunted, and then leaned against her legs. He was still stiff, so Kat butted him with her knees. \u201cRelax,\u201d she whispered into his ear, and after only a little hesitation, he did relax, leaning back more comfortably.</p><p>Pleased with herself, Kat looked around as she ate the tasty fish and saw that all of the women who had been mending clothes across the campfire from them were staring at her with looks ranging from shock to fear. Kat sighed.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to make all of those women so scared of you?\u201d She asked him quietly, not wanting to be overheard, but Patroklos answered.</p><p>\u201cThe women condemn Achilles no matter what he says or does. He has never harmed one of them. None of us have. We are not barbarians. The war prizes who come to our beds do so willingly.\u201d Patroklos paused long enough to give Jacky a big grin.</p><p>\u201cFinish your dinner. I\u2019ll check your stitches afterward.\u201d Jacky spoke matter-of-factly, but Kat could see that she also stroked the side of Patroklos\u2019s thigh with her bare foot.</p><p>\u201cWill you check them in our tent? Alone?\u201d Patroklos\u2019s eyes gleamed with obviously naughty intent, and for a split second he did remind her of Buffy\u2019s Spike\u2014not that she would ever admit that to Jacky.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Jacky made her voice all breathy, speaking in what Kat thought was a pretty darn good imitation of Marilyn Monroe. \u201cThere are some examinations that are much better done in private.\u201d</p><p>Kat could have sworn only five more minutes had passed when Patroklos was picking up one of the pitchers of wine and two goblets and following Jacky, who said, \u201cGood night,\u201d to Kat with a wink, into their tent.</p><p>\u201cSo they\u2019ve always been scared of you?\u201d She took up the unfinished thread of their conversation after they were alone.</p><p>Achilles answered her, but it was clear the subject made him uncomfortable. \u201cWomen have feared me since the first time the berserker fully possessed me when I was with the maiden to whom I was betrothed.\u201d His voice had gone from reluctant to cold. The more he spoke, the more dispassionate he sounded, but Kat could see the way his shoulders had tensed again and how he held himself too rigid so that he was no longer leaning relaxed against her. \u201cI was nineteen and she was sixteen. She was of Ithaca\u2019s royal house, a distant cousin of Odysseus. We thought to join our families. I\u2019d known her since we were children. The night before our wedding we snuck away to be alone. She wanted me, and I her. I\u2019d had no idea the berserker could possess me during such a time.\u201d His voice raised then, sharp with anger. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on a battlefield. There should have been no reason\u2014\u201d He broke off and shook his head.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed her\u2014raped her to death. I came back to myself with her bloody, lifeless body beneath mine. I have not taken a woman since that night.\u201d</p><p>Abruptly he stood and, without so much as a backward glance at her, Achilles disappeared inside their tent.</p><p>\u201cWell, hell. Where\u2019s some Xanax and a good, sturdy straight-jacket when you need them?\u201d Kat tried to joke with herself\u2014to lighten the sadness of the oppressive mood Achilles had cast over them. Of course it didn\u2019t work. What he\u2019d told her was awful. He\u2019d killed the girl he\u2019d loved and was supposed to marry.</p><p>She stood up, not wanting to sit there and let the women stare at her. Or worse, one of them might come over to her and whisper another escape plot that Achilles could overhear. Kat looked at the closed tent flap. She wasn\u2019t ready to go in there yet, either. With a sigh, she pulled off her shoes, hiked up her voluminous silk skirts and started walking toward the nearby seashore. Maybe the moon shining off the waves would calm her.</p><p>Kat had just reached the water when a huge burst of glittering diamond dust erupted in front of her, out of which Venus suddenly appeared.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you\u2019re not doing a bad job, but I thought that, perhaps, you could use a little advice from Love herself.\u201d</p><p>Kat shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWell, it definitely couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Yes, yes, you\u2019re quite right. You were doing very well together.\u201d Venus had materialized in an almost obscenely short silk tunic that showcased her long, shapely legs as she stood at the edge of the surf, letting the soft sea waves flow over her bare feet and calves. \u201cI particularly liked when you cast that little spell over him and brought both of you to orgasm. Well done you!\u201d</p><p>Kat felt her face flame. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. If my clothes come off, you stop peeping at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, darling.\u201d Venus smiled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d Kat ground out between her clenched teeth.</p> <p>Venus sighed prettily. \u201cYes, of course, I understand. Actually the reason I was watching was to be quite sure Achilles wouldn\u2019t change when he became aroused by you, as he almost had earlier on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he didn\u2019t,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cNo, not while he was under your spell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenus, it\u2019s not a spell. You must know that. It\u2019s just hypnotism\u2014a trick that can be played with the subconscious mind. It\u2019s used to get conscious barriers out of the way. Suggestions can be implanted during hypnotism, too, like don\u2019t smoke. Or don\u2019t eat so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr only remember what happened if you want to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, like that. And, again. No more watching. But speaking of\u2014did you happen to listen in when he told me about raping to death the girl he was going to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles did not do that. The berserker did. You know they are not one and the same,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cI understand that, but it doesn\u2019t change the girl\u2019s outcome, or mine if I happen to trigger a berserker possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatrina, darling, I don\u2019t believe you will.\u201d The goddess paused, studying Kat carefully. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you believe you will, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually I believe that he can learn to control what triggers the possession. I may have figured out what it is that has to happen to call the berserker to him, and it\u2019s not as simple as him being physically aroused or emotionally excited. It has to be a very specific combination of the two,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Venus nodded. \u201cSo you simply need to make sure both don\u2019t happen at once.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not so simple. And both are bound to happen at the same time eventually. What I think I can do is get him to control himself enough so that he\u2019s just on the edge of the berserker\u2019s possession, but he doesn\u2019t trip over into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all of this will take time and keep him away from the battle-field so that a quick, decisive Trojan victory can be orchestrated. Excellent! I will report everything back to Hera and Athena.\u201d Venus\u2019s smile was brilliant. \u201cI knew you were the right choice for this job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. I think.\u201d But she couldn\u2019t help smiling back at the beautiful goddess.</p><p>\u201cOh, and you should know that I would never allow Achilles\u2019 berserker to harm you. Had you awakened him last night, I would have protected you. So feel free to experiment with your lovely hypnotism spell.\u201d The goddess raised her shapely arm, obviously getting ready to disappear.</p><p>\u201cWait! Okay, not that I\u2019m unappreciative about you saying you\u2019ll be sure the berserker doesn\u2019t rape and pillage me, but can we work out some way you could know I need your help without you spying on me in way too intimate moments?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, goddesses do not spy. We watch attentively and oversee our adoring subjects.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, let\u2019s just have your watching be not so personal, and your overseeing be slightly less attentive. Can\u2019t I have like a panic button I could press or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a lovely idea! And I saw the perfect thing on display at one of Tulsa\u2019s exquisite jewelry boutiques on Brookside called Nattie Blue. My mortal friend, Pea Chamberlain, and I have recently discovered the delicious Garlic Rose restaurant there. Their food is fit for a goddess.\u201d Venus laughed. \u201cAnd, of course, I would know!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe panic button. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course, darling.\u201d Venus lifted her arm again and made a fluttering motion with her long, elegant fingers causing diamond glitter to form in the air around her. And then, with a pop a golden heart locket was suddenly dangling from her fingers. Venus held it up in front of her face and frowned. \u201cWell, it\u2019s more modern-mortal-world-looking then I remembered. But not a problem. I can fix that.\u201d Venus closed her hand around the locket and then blew gently into her fist. When she reopened her hand Kat saw that the locket was the same basic shape and size, but the golden color had changed. Now it reminded her of the buttery color of the golden jewelry Agamemnon had draped himself in. \u201cPerfect!\u201d The goddess motioned for Kat to turn so she could fasten it around her neck.</p><p>Kat looked down at the heart that rested between her breasts. \u201cVenus, it\u2019s pretty, but how does this help me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple, darling. If you need me you open the heart and call my name. I\u2019ve inserted an oracle within it. I will hear and come to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll only hear me when I open the locket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>Kat lifted the locket and studied the outside of it. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t let you watch me oh, so attentively?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be so cynical, Katrina. It really isn\u2019t attractive,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not the seeing kind of oracle, only the hearing kind. And only when it\u2019s open. Now go back to your Achilles and remember, Love is on your side.\u201d Venus snapped her fingers and disappeared in a puff of glittering smoke.</p><p>Kat walked slowly back to Achilles\u2019 tent. She\u2019d meant what she\u2019d said to Venus, she did think that she and Achilles had been doing well together. Kat actually liked spending time with him. Yes, he was very alpha male and completely testosteroney. He was also interesting and sexy. But now here they were, back where they\u2019d started last night with her being warned off by him.</p><p>Kat paused outside the tent, drew a deep breath and straightened her spine. Well, last night hadn\u2019t been so bad. Tonight she had the backup of Love herself and maybe she could work on a rerun... maybe even one with a twist...</p><p>He\u2019d already dimmed the lanterns when she entered the tent. Kat could see his shape in bed, and that he was sitting up and definitely not asleep.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might not return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere else did you think I\u2019d go?\u201d</p><p>\"If the servants helped you to escape, I wouldn\u2019t stop them,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNice to know you want me here so badly.\u201d She made no attempt to hide the sarcasm in her voice.</p><p>\u201cWhat I want is not the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell maybe it should be.\u201d Kat strode across the chamber and pushed aside the bed curtains. \u201cToday when Diomedes accidentally wounded you, did you want the berserker to possess you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, of course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so he didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles, maybe it is that simple.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, clearly disgusted. \u201cI have carried this curse for thirteen years. If that were true do you think I wouldn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about considering this theory: You are older now, you have dealt with the berserker for more than a decade. You understand it better. Hell, Achilles, you understand yourself better. Maybe there\u2019s a way you can use your age and experience to fight what triggers the possession.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, Princess, how do I practice this theory of yours? On whom do I chance unleashing a monster?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you remember from last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything.\u201d</p><p>She felt a shiver of excitement at how his voice had deepened and became intimate with just that one word. \u201cThen you also remember that the berserker didn\u2019t possess you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but you did.\u201d</p><p>Kat forced herself not to squirm. She didn\u2019t particularly like Achilles believing that she had used some magic spell on him, but how else could she describe it? Explaining her master\u2019s degree and the intricacies of hypnotism was simply not a possibility. Instead she cleared her throat, tried not to look too uncomfortable and said, \u201cWell, I was sent to you by a goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn oracle of Athena in my bed...\u201d His lips tilted up just slightly. \u201cIt is an intriguing, alluring thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stay in your bed all night last night.\u201d She couldn\u2019t look away from the brilliant blue in his eyes. God, he was so incredibly male and sexy, and so obviously like playing with a captivating fire.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could remedy that tonight.\u201d And then, as if catching himself in saying too much, he added, \u201cIf you think it wise, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWise is probably not the word I\u2019d use.\u201d Like he was pulling her to him by an invisible rope, Kat approached the bed. Without saying anything he moved over, though not far enough to keep their bodies from touching. Kat sat beside him as she had the night before. \u201cSo since I didn\u2019t run screaming from you, would you like to try that spell again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are few things I would like more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to relax,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you will have to help me with that,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThen close those gorgeous blue eyes,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>His brows lifted in surprise.</p><p>\u201cOh, come on,\u201d she teased. \u201cYou must have been told you have beautiful blue eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for more than a decade I haven\u2019t.\u201d He didn\u2019t say it in an oh-please-feel-sorry-for-me voice. He said it in a practical, no-nonsense, that\u2019s-just-the-way-it-is voice. Which made Kat\u2019s heart squeeze.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m telling you. Now close them.\u201d Kat brushed a hand gently down his face and he closed his eyes obediently. \u201cAnd relax your body.\u201d He shifted his posture a little, like he was settling in against the thick down mattress. \u201cI want you to focus on your breathing.\u201d Kat\u2019s voice automatically changed, became softer, more soothing, as she began to take Achilles through the stages of relaxation that would induce hypnotism. He responded more quickly than he had the night before, and within just a few minutes Kat had him back on the beach in his special cove, completely and deeply hypnotized.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you see in the cove tonight, Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sun is setting. It\u2019s hot, but the breeze is cool against my skin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouching myself while I wait for you.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s body jerked in surprise and she almost bit her tongue. She looked down. No, his hand was not actually under the very thin sheet literally touching himself, but she could clearly see the hard bulge that was growing bigger by the instant. Achilles shifted his legs restlessly, and the sheet dropped down far enough to let her see the engorged head of his penis, already slick with a drop of moisture that had escaped the slit.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it you want me to do?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cTouch me, Princess. It has been so long since I\u2019ve known a woman\u2019s touch...\u201d</p><p>His breathing had deepened, but not alarmingly so. Kat leaned forward, resting her hands gently on his chest. She felt him shiver under her touch. \u201cRemember,\u201d she whispered, \u201cyou\u2019re calm and you\u2019re dreaming.\u201d She let her hands roam down his taut abdomen all the way to his thighs, pushing aside the sheet. \u201cYou are an incredibly beautiful man,\u201d she said softly. To Kat the scars that crisscrossed his body extenuated his power. They were visible signs of his strength and of the battles he\u2019d fought and won.</p><p>His penis was fully aroused and lay stretched up his abdomen. She stroked it gently, letting her hand trail down to cup his heavy sack. His hips lifted and he moaned. \u201cRelax... you\u2019re staying relaxed...\u201d Kat murmured as she stroked him, knowing there was no damn way she was staying relaxed.</p><p>Kat bent down and let her tongue flick over the ridge of his abdominal muscles, kissing and tasting him. He was salty and wild, and he reminded her of the sea. She moved closer to his penis, though she didn\u2019t increase the tempo of her stroking. When her tongue finally laved the slick head, his body jerked in response.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods, yes...\u201d He moaned.</p><p>\u201cDreaming...\u201d She let her warm breath brush against his skin between tongue strokes. \u201cYou are having a delicious dream Achilles...\u201d</p><p>Slowly Kat took him into her mouth. Though his hips thrust up, she refused to be hurried. She swallowed him deep in her throat, then released him, murmuring calming words as she let her hands and mouth play across his hard body, then she took him deep into her mouth again.</p><p>Somehow, in the middle of all of the sucking and caressing and murmuring, Kat got rid of her clothes. She lay on top of him, pressing the wet heat between her legs against his hard shaft. Kat kissed his jaw, following the path of a scar to his mouth. She hadn\u2019t kissed him since the beach, and then the berserker had become aroused. But the cool metal of the golden oracle that lay between her breasts was a comforting reminder that, in the worst case scenario, she did have an out. So she took a chance and brushed her lips against his with a soft kiss. His lips parted in response.</p><p>\u201cKiss me, Achilles. In your dream, kiss me...\u201d</p><p>He kissed her. Kat controlled their tempo, taking his tongue into her mouth, deep and slow. She echoed the lazy kiss by moving her hips languidly against him and letting herself slide up his penis and then gradually back down.</p><p>\u201cYes, Princess... yes, more...\u201d he said dreamily against her mouth.</p><p>Kat pushed herself up so that she was straddling Achilles. Whispering calming endearments, she lifted her hips and then came down slowly, impaling herself inch by inch on his thick shaft.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods!\u201d Achilles breath came out in a rush, and his hips bucked against her. But, again, Kat maintained control. She didn\u2019t move against him, but caressed his chest with her hands and let his breathing steady. It was only when it did that Kat began to ride him. Slowly she lifted herself to the end of his penis, and just as slowly she sank back until he was fully buried within her. She paused, and then began the ride all over again.</p><p>Kat thought she was going to lose her mind. It was an exquisite, wonderful, painful torture.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d she whispered to Achilles.</p><p>Without hesitation his hands lifted, skimming from her thighs, up her waist and rib cage, to cup her breasts. The thick callused palms of his sword-hardened hands rasped against her ultrasensitive nipples. Kat couldn\u2019t help herself. While his hands were busy with her breasts and she concentrated on maintaining the slow, steady rhythm of their joined bodies, she let her fingers slide down to the hard bud of her clitoris. She stroked herself quickly, feeling the orgasm build easily and then, as it began to shatter over her in drowning wave after wave of sensation she gasped, \u201cCome with me, Achilles!\u201d His powerful body gathered itself and he pounded against her once, twice and then with a groan he shot his seed into her.</p><p>Kat collapsed against his chest, trying to catch her breath, feeling her heart beating like a crazy bird. She stretched out, half on top of him, half to the side of him, their bodies still joined, both slick with lovemaking. She kissed his shoulder and he tilted his head in her direction, his lips lifting in his familiar almost-smile. She was trying to come up with some calming words when his eyelids fluttered and then opened. Turquoise blue they stared at her, looking dazed and completely satisfied. He glanced sleepily down at their naked, entwined bodies. Then the slight lift of his lips increased and he smiled fully. Kat was amazed how much like a young, carefree boy he suddenly looked.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a dream, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, practically holding her breath. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a dream, but you should probably close your eyes and go to sleep now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes fluttered again and then closed, but the smile remained on his lips. Just before his breathing deepened Kat heard him whisper, \u201cTwo nights in a row I sleep and she touches me...\u201d Then he turned, put his arm around her waist, spooned her back against him, buried his face in her hair and fell soundly asleep.</p><p>Ah, to hell with it, Kat thought. If I wake up with a monster it won\u2019t be the first time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Agamemnon paced back and forth across the bedchamber of his voluminous tent while Briseis lounged on his bed, pouting.</p><p>\u201cYou said we were going to have a party tonight. One with those Greek dancing slaves.\u201d She raised up on her knees, naked except for several strands of exquisite pearls, lifted her arms over her head and swayed her curvy hips back and forth. \u201cYou said they would teach me that lovely dance they do.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon glanced at her, his eyes lingering on her young breasts and their pink, succulent nipples. He wanted her again, of course. And he would have her. But right now she was a distraction he did not need.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I cannot have a party tonight. Not after today\u2019s losses in battle.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s him isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s his fault,\u201d Briseis said, her sweet voice turning sharp and her soft, round face twisting into an ugly sneer.</p><p>\u201cAre you still upset because of how easily he replaced you, pet? Ah, now, don\u2019t fret. He simply didn\u2019t appreciate your appetites.\u201d Agamemnon moved over to the bed and stroked her long hair with one hand. With the other he tweaked her nipple painfully. Instead of crying out or pulling away, Briseis moaned and arched her back.</p><p>\u201cI hate him! He ruins everything,\u201d she said, and then gasped in pleasure as his hand left her hair and slapped her once, hard, across her bare buttocks.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not really our dear Achilles who\u2019s to blame for his absence from the battlefield. It\u2019s that distraction he replaced you with.\u201d Agamemnon enjoyed Briseis most when she was like this\u2014when she discarded the mantle of gentle maid and showed the truth of her black little heart and her limitless craving for sensation of all types. What a fool Achilles had been not to have sampled from her sweet banquet.</p><p>Briseis\u2019s hand roamed down the king\u2019s body and began rubbing his semiflaccid penis to life. \u201cIt\u2019s unnatural that she touches him. No woman touches him.\u201d</p> <p>Agamemnon pinched her other breast and her hand stroked faster. \u201cAh, what a shame he didn\u2019t know what he was missing in you, pet.\u201d</p><p>Her tongue flicked out to lave his nipple and she spoke against his chest. \u201cThe other war brides say she has put a spell on him. And that maid of hers, Melia, has also turned into a sorceress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Suddenly completely serious, Agamemnon took her chin roughly in his hand. \u201cTell me what you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that the women from her father\u2019s palace say Polyxena and Melia are not as they used to be. They speak and act more like Sirens or witches than tools of a goddess. Achilles and Patroklos have both been utterly tamed by them.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon let loose her chin and she went back to tonguing his nipples. Neatly forgetting the fact that his actions in taking Briseis had been what had caused Polyxena to be given to Achilles, he continued, \u201cThe Trojan witch is the reason he is so willing to stay out of the battle and let his Greek brothers be slaughtered for his pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet rid of her, and Achilles will have nothing to occupy his time. Believe me, he lives for battle. If the princess hadn\u2019t bespelled him, he couldn\u2019t bear not fighting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy pet, I do believe you make an excellent point.\u201d Agamemnon pushed her back on the bed, but instead of mounting her, as her splayed legs said she obviously expected, he began pulling on his clothes. \u201cStay here\u2014in that very position. I won\u2019t be long.\u201d Then he paused, changing his mind. \u201cActually don\u2019t stay in that position. I want you to go spread poison among the war prizes.\u201d</p><p>Briseis bounced up, clapping her hands gleefully and looking like an evil kitten. \u201cWhat shall I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEncourage the talk of witchery, but focus on the maidservant. When you speak of Polyxena, let it be known that you\u2019ve heard rumors that Achilles\u2019 mother, the sea goddess Thetis, would like to get a look at her son\u2019s lover.\u201d</p><p>Briseis sneered. \u201cThey can\u2019t be lovers. Achilles is chaste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but if they are lovers, they won\u2019t be for much longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do to Achilles?\u201d Briseis asked happily.</p><p>\u201cNow, pet, you know I would never harm that great warrior and hero of my people...\u201d Agamemnon chuckled cruelly as he strode from his bedchamber, calling for Kalchas.</p><p>The old man rushed up to him, bowing subserviently.</p> <p>\u201cRemind me, Kalchas, is it a fat black bull that Poseidon prefers as a sacrifice when summoning his presence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, indeed, great King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd remind me, again, was it not Poseidon who Laomedon, Priam\u2019s ancestor, refused to pay after the god aided him in building the impenetrable walls of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, great King. And in doing so Laomedon, as well as all of his children\u2019s children, gained the eternal enmity of the sea god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in theory only, mind you, if it were possible for Poseidon to gain access to, say for instance, a daughter of the royal family of Troy, do you believe the sea god would be pleased at the opportunity to exact vengeance on Troy\u2019s king?\u201d</p><p>Kalchas\u2019s thin lips twisted into the caricature of a smile. \u201cYes, I believe he would, great King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn theory, only,\u201d Agamemnon said.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord.\u201d They walked silently for a few steps and then Kalchas asked, \u201cShall I cut a fat black bull from the herd, great king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do believe you shall.\u201d</p><p>Kalchas hesitated. \u201cMy lord, forgive me, but I must remind you that Zeus has made it clear he favors Priam. Would you not be risking his wrath to, in theory only, instigate his daughter\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon smiled slyly. \u201cOne would believe so, except that I happen to be under the protection of Hera herself. And even Zeus does not like to evoke the anger of the Queen of Olympus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent, my lord. I know just the bull...\u201d</p><p>Kat woke slowly. She felt fabulous. She stretched languorously, thinking that it must be Saturday, which meant she didn\u2019t have to be in the office at all. Mimosas sounded good. She\u2019d call Jacky and they could meet at the Stonehorse Caf\u00e9 for the bottomless Saturday mimosa special\u2014to hell with that stupid diet idea. She would love her thighs as they were, and a size ten just wasn\u2019t that big.</p><p>Then she rolled over, opened her eyes and glanced down at said size ten thighs, which were, at that instant, very bare, very young and very size two to fourish and reality crashed back.</p><p>She gave the pillow beside her what she hoped was a nonchalant look while she held her breath. His side of the bed was empty, and she breathed again. Then she blinked and squinted. No, his side of the bed wasn\u2019t empty. There was something on his pillow. Kat sat up. It was a long, thin lotus blossom the color of moonlight. Smiling, she picked it up and inhaled its delicate scent.</p><p>Achilles, the famous warrior who had been written about for thousands of years, had given her a flower. It made her ridiculously, romantically happy.</p><p>\u201cYes, indeedy, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.\u201d</p><p>Humming softly to herself Kat got up and washed. Then, naked except for Venus\u2019s golden heart pendant, that I hadn\u2019t needed, she thought smugly, Kat searched around the bed, trying to find her discarded clothes. She was just starting to worry and consider wrapping the sheet around herself and going in search of Jacky when she noticed layers of new silken robes draped across the back of a chair. The undertunic was a buttery yellow, and the over-robe was the same heart-stopping blue as Achilles\u2019 eyes. The outfit was diaphanous and gorgeous and probably worth a small fortune.</p><p>Clearly it was good to be Achilles\u2019 girlfriend.</p><p>Her tuneless humming changed to the chorus of \u201cI Feel Pretty\u201d as she got dressed and combed her hair, thoroughly appreciating Polyxena\u2019s long, thick locks. Then she ducked out of the tent, pausing to blink and adjust her eyes to the sunlight.</p><p>As the day before, there was food ready at the campfire. Stretching and thinking about how sex always made her hungry, Kat headed to the table\u2014in time to see Jacky coming from the direction of the Myrmidon tents. She was stretching, too, and looking sweetly rumpled. The two friends met beside the campfire.</p><p>Jacky looked Kat over from head to toe.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit. Now I\u2019m worried,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d Kat said around a piece of excellent goat cheese she\u2019d snagged from a laden tray on the table and popped in her mouth.</p><p>\u201cNatural disasters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky, what are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you figure are the odds of both of us gettin\u2019 laid on the same night?\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cToday, I\u2019d say pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is definitely abbey-normal. So I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 it makes me worry about lightning strikes and tsunamis and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be such a cynic. Everything is going to be just fine. Actually everything is going to be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord, I\u2019d forgotten how nauseatingly optimistic sex makes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a beautiful day, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Jacky shook her head in disgust. \u201cYou seriously have it bad.\u201d</p><p>Kat bumped Jacky with her shoulder. \u201cSo Patroklos wasn\u2019t any good in bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kinda grumpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not grumpy. I\u2019m\u2014\u201d Jacky paused for effect. \u201cSore. This little white girl body needs some breakin\u2019 in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh!\u201d Kat laughed. \u201cNo, what you are is stank. Okay, I want all the details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou first. Clearly you fornicated with your boy. You\u2019re still in one piece so I\u2019m assumin\u2019 he didn\u2019t turn into a monster. Details, please...\u201d</p><p>Kat broke off a piece of bread and dipped it in a dish of spiced olive oil. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t turn into a monster. Yes, we fornicated. And, yes. It was soooo good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe stayed under your diabolical slut sex spell the entire time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not diabolical. And, yes, mostly. There was a moment of concern at the end, but everything turned out fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn other words, your magical va-jay-jay saved him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s certainly how I like to think of it.\u201d Kat hesitated, then added. \u201cJacqueline, I like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so where is this going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable that you like him, nice even. But what\u2019s the next step? Are we completing our mission?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVenus seems pleased and Achilles definitely isn\u2019t fighting. So I guess we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw Venus?\u201d</p><p>Kat swallowed another piece of cheese. \u201cYep. She gave me this.\u201d She lifted the heart locket and let Jacky inspect it. \u201cIt\u2019s a panic button.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit? How does it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSupposedly I open it, call for her and she turns into the cavalry. I don\u2019t think literally, though. But what do I know? I barely remember the humanities class that dealt with mythology.\u201d Kat dropped the locket back down beneath her robes. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping it keeps Venus from constantly Peeping Tom-ing. Do you know she watches?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. She is Goddess of Love\u2014that job has to come with a certain degree of nastiness.\u201d Jacky frowned at the plate of olives. \u201cAnd I still don\u2019t like olives. Pass me some of that bread, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, your turn,\u201d Kat said, passing the bread. \u201cGive me all the gory details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s young and very energetic. It was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it? Young\u2014energetic\u2014good? You\u2019ve got to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, fine. It was very good.\u201d Jacky fidgeted and nibbled at a piece of dried meat.</p><p>Kat gasped. \u201cYou like him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? You like Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatroklos is so damn white.\u201d Kat giggled.</p><p>Jacky narrowed her eyes. \u201cKatrina Marie, you\u2019ve been tellin\u2019 me for a decade that I need to expand my dating pool and go out with more white boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and may I just say a great big\u2014\u201d Kat hesitated dramatically.</p><p>\u201cGo on ahead. Get it over with.\u201d Jacky sighed.</p><p>\u201cI told you so!\u201d Kat sang.</p><p>\u201cHappy now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDelighted.\u201d She popped one of the olives Jacky was ignoring into her mouth. \u201cI really wish I had some tea or something to drink. I don\u2019t think they have coffee yet. Do they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dunno,\u201d Jacky mumbled around bread and cheese. \u201cI may just do like the natives and go straight for breakfast wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess? Did you say you would like some tea?\u201d</p><p>Kat looked across the campfire to see Aetnia, who was curtseying nervously to her. \u201cYes, that would be great,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAcalle always has tea brewing at her campfire. She is Ajax\u2019s war bride. It takes an entire campfire of his own to keep him fed, so he\u2019s on the outskirts of the Greek camp, not at all far from here. It will take just a moment to get you some tea.\u201d</p><p>She hurried off and Kat found herself calling, \u201cThanks,\u201d to her back.</p><p>\u201cWonder how long she\u2019d been sittin\u2019 there listening in?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to pay better attention to stuff like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say whatever,\u201d Jacky shrugged. \u201cShe\u2019s just a servant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky, they used to do really nasty things to people they thought were different, a.k.a., witchy. Like burn them. Or impale them. Or crucify them. None of those things are pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t do unpleasant things to people they thought were oracles of the gods.\u201d Jacky pointed a piece of bread at Kat. \u201cYou are an oracle. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but you aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken.\u201d They chewed for a while in silence. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll ever get back?\u201d Jacky finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Kat said slowly.</p><p>\u201cYou do still want to go back, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Kat hesitated.</p><p>\u201cKatrina?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, of course,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cBut I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to fix him first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d Kat sighed. \u201cI want to save him.\u201d She met Jacky\u2019s eyes, finding the friend within the unfamiliar shape and color. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to die.\u201d</p><p>Jacky opened her mouth to respond when Aetnia hurried up to them, a large kettle in one hand and a pottery mug in the other.</p><p>\u201cHere you are, my lady. Rose hips and chamomile with a hint of lavender, sweetened with honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank you, Aetnia.\u201d Kat took the offered mug while the girl poured the aromatic mixture.</p><p>\u201cNo problem. I didn\u2019t want some,\u201d Jacky said with some asperity.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll share,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cOh, nevermind. I should go check on the injured men. Then Patroklos and I are going for a swim. Without swimwear,\u201d she said with a wink.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Patroklos and Achilles?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cMy man said something about going to the Greek camp to sharpen weapons. I don\u2019t have a clue where yours is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so he\u2019s a man now?\u201d Kat kidded under her breath, conscious of Aetnia\u2019s listening presence across the campfire.</p><p>\u201cFreshness,\u201d Jacky mouthed back. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she raised her voice. \u201cGotta go check on the men. No rest for the wicked, ya know.\u201d With a flip of her blond tresses, Jacky sauntered off.</p><p>\u201cMy lady? I know where you can find Achilles,\u201d Aetnia said, moving closer to her now that Jacky had gone.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. Where?\u201d Kat asked, not caring that she sounded like an eager schoolgirl.</p><p>\u201cI heard that he was training down by the seashore.\u201d Aetnia pointed in the direction of the sea, but well down the beach away from both camps.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Kat grinned at her, grabbed a piece of bread and cheese to go, and then called over her shoulder, \u201cOh, and the tea is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for you, my lady,\u201d Aetnia said.</p><p>Kat could feel Aetnia\u2019s eyes on her as she walked toward the beach, which actually made her a little uncomfortable. Aetnia seemed nice enough, but she was definitely obsessed with the princess/devotion thing. Not to mention she seemed to be giving off a weirdly nervous vibe. But then again, what did Kat know? She\u2019d never been a princess before. She was probably misjudging Aetnia because she was using modern standards. Promising herself to be nicer to the young woman, Kat headed down the beach, looking for her lover.</p><p>\u201cMy lover...\u201d she whispered, and then laughed at herself. Yes, she did have it bad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The beach was gorgeous if, sadly, empty of Achilles, or any of the Myrmidons for that matter.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell did all of those half naked men get to?\u201d Kat muttered.</p><p>She probably should have double-checked about where he was and then gone to meet him. Kat shielded her eyes against the sun\u2019s glare off the water. It had to be at least lunch time. Why hadn\u2019t she brought something like a picnic lunch? And a blanket, for that matter. Maybe they could practice some daytime hypnotism.</p><p>Of course that was difficult to do without the patient\u2014or the victim (she could almost hear Jacky adding).</p> <p>Kat sighed. Aetnia had obviously heard wrong. Maybe they were practicing in the area of the beach between the two camps. Feeling hot and annoyed, Kat headed back, walking close enough to the waves that she had to take off her slippers and hold her robes out of the way. But the water felt good against her feet and calves and she was kicking at the spray when a movement not far offshore caught her attention. Kat stopped and peered out into the crystal water, blinking to clear her eyes. There seemed to be something just under the water. She thought she saw flashes of silver and white and red. Hiking up her dress even farther, Kat took a step out imagining the brightly colored salt-water fish in the tanks at the Jenks Aquarium.</p><p>Shapes undulated just below the surface. Lots and lots of shapes. At first Kat was struck by their odd beauty. They were gelatinous and glowed a blue-white light that reminded her of frozen meat lockers and the storage units sci-fi movies used for cryogenic holding. Weird... she could swear the water lapping around her calves had cooled by several degrees. When she saw the eerie, milky eyes she changed her mind about aquarium viewing and began to step back. Then Kat felt something clammy and cold slither around her ankle. She lifted her foot, meaning to brush off what was probably just a piece of seaweed and the sharp pain of a sting jolted her, followed almost instantly by a dreadful numbing sensation in her ankle and foot. Kat looked down.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t seaweed. What was wrapped around her totally dead-feeling foot was a long, thin tentacle that looked like a rat\u2019s tail covered in a clear membrane.</p><p>With a shriek, Kat tried to finish stepping back, but her leg had become completely useless and she fell to her knees.</p><p>The deeper water in front of her writhed with tentacles and glowing, sightless bodies as they closed on her.</p> <p>Another tentacle snaked out. Kat ducked and tried to lurch back, but the thing was still gripping her ankle, and it was pulling her slowly into deeper water toward the swarm.</p><p>\u201cOh, god! Help!\u201d Kat screamed. \u201cAchilles!\u201d Where was her fucking knight in shining armor? Where was her hero? She managed to drag herself back a few inches and another membrane-wrapped tentacle snagged her other ankle, zapping her with a painful sting that faded even faster than the first bite as the numbness took hold.</p><p>Holy shit! These disgusting things were going to drag her under the water and kill her! She was going to die in this ancient world just as surely as she\u2019d died in the car accident when Venus had\u2014</p><p>Venus! Sobbing in relief Kat grabbed the locket and wrenched it open. \u201cVenus! They\u2019re killing me! Help!\u201d</p><p>Then a tentacle wrapped around her wrist. Kat screamed in pain. Numbness blossomed throughout her hand and up her arm. Kat dropped the still-open locket, dug her other hand into the sand behind her like a claw and tried to hold on. Please Venus, please hurry...</p><p>Achilles was, indeed, drilling with his men\u2014on the opposite end of the beach from where Aetnia had sent Kat. He had just stopped to wipe the sweat from his brow when the goddess materialized from a glittering cloud of smoke. One of the youngest Myrmidons instantly fell to his knees in supplication.</p> <p>\u201cVenus! Great Goddess! You have heard my prayers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, darling. Try telling her how you feel instead of moping,\u201d she said quickly, barley glancing at him. Instead she motioned to Achilles, opening her cloak. \u201cYou must come with me.\u201d</p><p>Achilles blinked in surprise. He\u2019d had nothing to do with the Goddess of Love for his entire life. What could she possibly want with him?</p><p>\u201cThe princess is in danger. Hurry!\u201d Venus snapped.</p><p>With no hesitation Achilles grabbed his sword and stepped over to the goddess. Venus wrapped her cloak around him and they disappeared.</p><p>They were pulling her under. There was nothing Kat could do. She couldn\u2019t feel her legs. Her whole left side was numb. And she was having trouble breathing. The things had quit stinging her, and now their cold tentacles were slithering all over her body, almost caressingly. They moved languorously with the waves in a horrible parody of beauty and grace, and all Kat could do was gasp for breath and keep struggling back toward the safety of the beach.</p><p>Her mind was working clearly\u2014her panic had subsided. Kat understood that had something to do with the poison that was filling her system. Just the same, she was grateful for it. It had only been moments since she had screamed into the locket, but already it was probably too late. Even if Venus showed up the poison would more than likely kill her. Kat was just deciding to close her eyes and give in to the inevitable when the world exploded.</p><p>Achilles materialized from a cloud of diamond smoke. Utterly detached, she watched him leap into the water beside her and slice through the tentacles binding her numbed body.</p> <p>\u201cAh, Goddess! Please no. Polyxena! Listen to me. Do not close your eyes!\u201d Achilles seemed to be shouting at her from very far away, even though logically she knew he was touching her\u2014pulling her from the water.</p><p>The lazy tempo of the creatures instantly changed. Five membranes snaked out and wrapped around Achilles\u2019 sword arm. She knew the moment they stung him. She saw the jolt of white hot pain enter his body. As his eyes began to glow he literally tossed her onto the beach and then, with a feral snarl, he waded back into the deadly water.</p><p>Achilles changed. She watched the whole thing, crumpled on the beach, gasping for breath. Unbelievably his body actually got bigger. When his face turned so she could glimpse it, Kat saw a stranger\u2014and one who looked more demon than human. His eyes blazed red. His lips were pulled back, baring his teeth. The sounds he made were terrible, more like a furious animal than a man. Kat thought he looked like a surreal photograph in which one person\u2019s body had been superimposed over another.</p><p>He was inhumanly fast, slicing through the undulating mass of creatures that had swarmed him. Obviously he was immune to their poison. Kat managed a small scream when the hundreds of little tentacles were replaced by one huge, snaking arm, thick as Achilles\u2019 waist. The panic fluttered alive inside her as she realized that must have been what they had been trying to pull her out to. Achilles sliced through it as if it were made of jelly. There was an earsplitting, hissing scream and then all the tentacles withdrew in a seething mass of blood and foam.</p><p>Achilles lunged out after them, roaring a challenge, but they disappeared quickly into the depths. Then he turned toward her. His eyes were still glowing red\u2014a red that was reflected in the blood and gore that covered his body.</p><p>\u201cPrincess...\u201d His voice was utterly changed\u2014lower, guttural and completely not Achilles. He started to walk from the water toward her, his lips twisted in a dangerous smile.</p><p>Kat wanted to talk to him\u2014to try to reach her lover, who she knew was still inside the monster. But she couldn\u2019t speak\u2014she couldn\u2019t move. All she could do was watch as the monster who had been a man approached her, engorged, enraged and deadly.</p><p>There was a flash of silver from the sea behind him, and then a sweet, calm voice drifted across the waves.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, son, you need to come to me.\u201d</p><p>The monster paused, breathing hard. He turned around slowly, as if fighting against himself. Kat could see that a lovely woman with silver-blond hair had risen from the waves.</p><p>\u201cThetis.\u201d He growled the word.</p><p>The sea goddess\u2019s voice hardened. \u201cBe gone berserker! My son has no more need of you today.\u201d She flipped her fingers at him and a crystal wave crashed up over Achilles, covering his entire body. When it receded, it had taken with it the blood and gore that had spattered the warrior, as well as the monster who had possessed him.</p><p>Instantly Achilles rushed out of the water to her. Kat was glad his eyes weren\u2019t glowing red anymore, and he definitely looked like himself again\u2014scarred and imperfect, but hers. She tried to smile at him. She tried to lift her hand to touch him. But everything was very far away and gray around the edges, and her body wouldn\u2019t obey her.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d she heard him call. \u201cPlease help her!\u201d</p><p>Then the silver goddess was kneeling beside her son. Kat thought her smile was the most tender, loving expression she\u2019d ever seen. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help her, my golden one.\u201d The goddess touched Kat\u2019s forehead and she felt a rush of warmth and love, and then everything went black. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat heard Jacky\u2019s muttering before she opened her eyes. She was saying something that had to do with \u201cChrist on a cracker\u201d and \u201cno goddamn sense.\u201d Kat smiled. If she\u2019d died and gone to hell, at least Jacky had come with her. Again. She opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she croaked. \u201cI thought you watched your language when you were on duty.\u201d</p><p>Immediately Jacky bent over her, simultaneously taking her pulse and wiping her face with a cool cloth.</p><p>\u201cKatrina, honey, are you back with me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re calling me honey it must be bad. Did I lose a leg or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, thank the sweet weeping baby Jesus, it is you.\u201d Jacky kissed her square on the lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever, ever scare me like that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hell, Jacky. It\u2019s not like I asked those disgusting things to attack me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I want you to count my fingers.\u201d Jacky held up three fingers like a baseball umpire.</p><p>\u201cYou have three fingers, just like Yoda. By the by, if you don\u2019t get a manicure soon and trim those things you\u2019re going to resemble him even more closely.\u201d Kat batted weakly at her friend\u2019s hand. \u201cDo I have to sleep with you to get something to drink?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThankfully, no, because your breath is really nasty right now.\u201d Jacky turned to the side table and poured water from a pitcher into a cup, then helped Kat drink from it.</p><p>\u201cNo wonder. Man, I so feel like shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for a woman who\u2019s been in a coma for four days, you\u2019re lookin\u2019 remarkably and surprisingly alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour days!\u201d She gasped between long gulps of water.</p><p>\u201cEasy. It\u2019ll make you feel sick if you drink too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already feel sick.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll feel worse. And you may puke.\u201d</p><p>She took one more drink and then reluctantly gave Jacky the cup and lay back on her pillow. \u201cFour days, Jacky? Why? Achilles\u2019 mom healed me from the poison. Well, at least I thought she did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did. Or rather Thetis did what she could despite your \u2018remarkably breakable human shell\u2019 as Athena put it. You had to do the rest of the recovery by yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena was here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. All three of them have been. Well, four actually, if you count Achilles\u2019 mom, who was with him when he carried you\u2014half dead and totally freaking me out\u2014into camp four days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. I feel special.\u201d</p><p>Jacky rolled her eyes. \u201cYou are special,\u201d Jacky used air quotes around the word. \u201cWhen we get home I\u2019ll send the short bus for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey wait. If all of the goddesses were here why didn\u2019t they just use their powers to zap me awake?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did mention that. And perhaps not in the nicest of tones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? Being short and crabby with someone? I\u2019m so shocked. Imagine that not going over well with goddesses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, apparently the bogey monster that grabbed you had more than a touch of magic behind it. The goddesses couldn\u2019t negate all of it. Your humanity had to fight it off by your own damn self.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet that made you grumpy.\u201d Kat grinned at her best friend.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps a little.\u201d She took Kat\u2019s hand and squeezed it. \u201cI am so glad you didn\u2019t die on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d Kat squeezed back. \u201cSorry I scared you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve decided you owe me shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemember your gorgeous pair of red patent leather stiletto pumps I\u2019ve lusted after?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through lusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeesh, you are a mean nurse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now tell me what the hell bit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no clue. One second I was walking along the beach trying to find Achilles, the next I saw something in the water so I stopped to look. Then this tentacle thing grabbed me and stung me, which paralyzed my leg. Then I got grabbed and stung again and again, which is when I pushed the panic button and yelled for Venus.\u201d Remembering, Kat touched the locket that still hung between her breasts and shivered. \u201cThose things were seriously gross. All undulating and rat-tail-like, and there were literally hundreds of them swarming me.\u201d</p><p>Jacky\u2019s face looked like she\u2019d just eaten a lemon. \u201cJesus god! Rat-tail-like? That is so vile!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and they were pulling me out into deep water to feed me to what looked like their gigantic mama when Achilles materialized, changed into the berserker and kicked ass. Then his mom touched me and I passed out. The end. But didn\u2019t Achilles tell you most of that already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. Achilles has been Mr. Big and Broody since he brought you back and has barely spoken two words to anyone. Even Patroklos can\u2019t talk to him. Actually Patroklos has had a lot on his mind and I think he\u2019s tired of tryin\u2019 to get Achilles to do more than grunt and growl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky, are you making the boy crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Patroklos and I are fine. Better than fine. It\u2019s the battle he\u2019s not fighting and stuff like that getting to him. But as long as Achilles doesn\u2019t fight\u2014Patroklos doesn\u2019t fight, so I\u2019m not really worried about it.\u201d Jacky made a dismissive gesture. \u201cAnyway, my woman\u2019s intuition, which is quite good, says Achilles is brooding because you saw him turn into the Big Bad and he thinks you\u2019re gonna run shriekin\u2019 from him now. Of course you don\u2019t have enough sense to do that, which I tried to explain to him, but he wasn\u2019t listenin\u2019. Actually that night I think he might have been drinking heavily. But whatever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should go get him and I\u2019ll explain to him myself how little sense I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Jacky said. Then she added. \u201cKat, he did change into that berserker thing completely, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Kat said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt was awful.\u201d</p><p>Jacky didn\u2019t phrase it like a question, but Kat nodded her head. \u201cIt was absolutely awful. It wasn\u2019t him anymore. Whatever it is that possesses him isn\u2019t even human. It can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he was himself when he brought you back to camp,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cHis mom called to him, and then did something with the water and it was like it washed the berserker away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich you\u2019re interpreting to mean that the thing can actually be controlled. Am I right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you always right?\u201d</p><p>Jacky snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll go get your grumpy-ass man.\u201d Before she left the tent she looked back at Kat. \u201cPromise you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you, too, Jacky.\u201d</p><p>Jacky managed to smile through her worry as she ducked out of the tent.</p><p>Kat was just thinking about how awful her hair must look and trying to run her fingers through it when Achilles\u2019 bulk filled the entrance of the tent. His gaze went straight to her. She smiled. \u201cI do believe I owe you a big thank you for saving my life. Actually you and your mom.\u201d When he didn\u2019t say anything, but just continued to stare at her, she babbled on. \u201cYour mom\u2019s gorgeous, by the way. And she seems like a lovely person, ur, I mean, goddess. If she\u2019s still here I\u2019d love to meet her. Formally. After I look decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou must be having problems with your sight. You should have Ja\u2014I mean Melia look at your eyes. Her bedside manner leaves something to be desired, but she\u2019s an excellent nurse.\u201d</p><p>Achilles\u2019 lips twitched up just a little at the edges. \u201cMelia is fiercely loyal to you. And my mother has returned to the depths. She cannot bide on dry land for long.\u201d He paused, grasped his hands behind his back, then let them fall to his sides, then, as if he didn\u2019t know what to do with them, ran one hand through his hair, before finally saying, \u201cYou do not owe me your gratitude for saving your life. It was not me who fought the creatures.\u201d</p><p>Kat kept her gaze meeting his. \u201cI know that, but it was you who showed up for the fight. Plus, I\u2019ll bet you could have beaten those nasty things without the berserker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He spoke slowly as if he wanted to be certain she understood. \u201cI could not have defeated the creatures without the berserker. The poison that almost killed you would have taken me. The berserker is what made me invulnerable to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, I\u2019m glad the berserker was there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that? I became a monster\u2014a monster who would have raped you and left you for dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t. You came back. You stopped the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause my mother, a sea goddess, intervened!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Kat said reasonably. \u201cBut maybe you can learn to stop the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever believe you would make love to a woman without the berserker possessing you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cNo, I did not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened between us wasn\u2019t a dream. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do know that,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cThen doesn\u2019t what I\u2019m saying make sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are an oracle of the goddess Athena. You have powers other women do not. That is why you can touch me and I remain a man.\u201d</p><p>Kat automatically opened her mouth to tell him what utter crap that was. Then she closed it. She couldn\u2019t tell him.</p><p>And it hit her\u2014why not? None of the goddesses had told her she couldn\u2019t. No one had said she needed to keep her real identity from Achilles. It was just the general Greek camp she had to fool. For a second she wished she could talk to Jacky first, but then again, she didn\u2019t really need to ask her BFF. Jacky was nothing if she wasn\u2019t honest. She told the truth\u2014even when she shouldn\u2019t. It was part of what Kat loved about her. Plus, it was just plain stupid to keep this from Achilles. If she didn\u2019t trust him enough to trust him with her identity, she shouldn\u2019t have had sex with him. Everyone\u2019s mother even knew that.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, would you please come closer? I need to talk to you about this oracle-of-the-goddess thing.\u201d</p><p>Achilles walked through the bed curtain with a mixture of hesitation and anticipation. It was obvious that he wanted to touch her, that he needed to touch her. It was just as obvious as the fact that he was afraid to get too close to her in case she rejected him. She held out her hand and smiled. \u201cWould you sit beside me?\u201d</p><p>The only thing about his guarded expression that changed was the relief that showed in his eyes. He sat beside her gingerly, taking her hand as if it were a butterfly. Then he surprised her by kissing it.</p><p>He spoke still looking down at her hand, circling the place he\u2019d kissed with his thumb. \u201cWhen the monster left me and I saw you lying there I thought you were lost to me.\u201d Then he looked up and met her eyes and she was shocked by the depth of sadness within his. \u201cI do not think I could bear losing you, too.\u201d</p><p>That was the moment Kat stopped lying to herself. This wasn\u2019t just a mission. He wasn\u2019t a project she\u2019d taken on for someone else. Somehow, regardless of time and worlds and logic, Achilles was Kat\u2019s destiny. She was bound to him as she\u2019d never come close to being bound to any man in her world. And she didn\u2019t want to leave him. The realization was as freeing as it was daunting. Jacky was definitely going to kill her.</p><p>Kat had to clear her throat before she could speak.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Polyxena? But the servants recognize you as their princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I want to ask you to listen to me. Just let me say this, and if you start to not believe me because you think it sounds crazy, keep in mind how crazy it sounds that you can be possessed by a monster.\u201d</p><p>Achilles frowned at her but said, \u201cI\u2019ll keep it in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. The truth is that this\u201d\u2014Kat gestured down at her body\u2014\u201cis Polyxena, Princess of Troy\u2019s body. But this\u201d\u2014she closed her fist over her heart\u2014\u201cthe soul inside the body, doesn\u2019t belong to Polyxena. At least it hasn\u2019t since the day Odysseus came to Hera\u2019s temple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe day I came to you Polyxena and her maidservant, Melia, were killed by Agamemnon\u2019s men as they sacked Hera\u2019s temple. That same day, in another time and another world, I was also killed in an accident, along with my best friend. Venus was watching me, so she grabbed our souls and ended up putting them in Polyxena and Melia\u2019s bodies.\u201d She hurried on before he could say anything. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to me, either. The part I understand the most is that the goddesses wanted me here.\u201d She paused on the verge of admitting to him that she was supposed to keep him out of the war so that Troy could win. But how could she ever tell him that? Kat drew a deep breath. \u201cThey wanted me here for you. Athena and Venus and Hera all believe that your fate should be changed, and they think I can help you change it.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, Achilles had become more and more still. He didn\u2019t pull his hand from hers and he didn\u2019t look away from her steady gaze.</p><p>\u201cYou come from another world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s exactly another world, but it is another time. It\u2019s the future.\u201d She managed a little smile. \u201cA really long way in the future\u2014like a couple thousand years or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in your future do they know my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, they do.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her hand and stood, turning his back to her. \u201cThen how can you or the goddesses believe my fate can be changed? It has already happened!\u201d</p><p>Kat thought about it and found the answer easily. \u201cIt\u2019s fiction.\u201d</p><p>He turned back to her. \u201cFiction? Explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe stories of you and your time are told as fiction in our time\u2014mythology to be specific. Stories that aren\u2019t true\u2014that either never happened, or happened and then were exaggerated over time. Okay, here\u2019s a prime example. In my time people believe that you could have been immortal, you were completely invulnerable, except in your heel. You were struck by an arrow in your heel, which was your downfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy heel?\u201d He looked down at his very normal-looking foot.</p><p>\u201cYour heel,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou\u2019re so famous for it that the tendon that runs behind the ankle,\u201d Kat pushed the bedclothes back from her leg and pointed at the tendon, \u201cis known as the Achilles tendon all over my world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly my point. Well, unless you tell me that the only way you can actually be killed is to be shot or stabbed or whatever through your heel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heel isn\u2019t even a vulnerable area of the body. Slice the tendon and a man can usually be defeated because he\u2019s fighting without the use of one leg, but the wound alone won\u2019t kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your heel isn\u2019t invulnerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not immortal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, and how about this\u2014fiction has it that Troy is defeated by a gigantic, hollow horse filled with Greeks. They sneak into the city inside the belly of the fake horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious as a heart attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut a giant hollow horse is silliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, do you see my point? You and the Trojan War are written about in history, but the facts of your life and the war are mixed up and amplified with myths, so what really happens to you could, in actuality, be much different than the fate written about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that fate?\u201d</p><p>Kat didn\u2019t look away from his piercing blue gaze. \u201cYou die here at Troy in this, the last year of the Trojan War.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat thought he would ask more questions about his death, but instead he just nodded briefly and disinterestedly. The only thing he seemed really interested in was her. \u201cWill you tell me your real name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKatrina Marie Campbell. My friends call me Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you are not a princess?\u201d</p><p>Kat laughed. \u201cNo way. I\u2019m definitely not a princess. I\u2019m a shrink.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make things small?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, god no. I\u2019m sorry. Shrink is a slang term for my job. I\u2019m a psychologist. That\u2019s someone who counsels people\u2014helps them to be emotionally healthy. My specialty is couples counseling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is the reason you know the spell needed to calm me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s not a spell. Actually it\u2019s not magical at all. You can even learn to do it for yourself. It\u2019s called hypnotism. It\u2019s just a way of being able to relax deeply and reach your subconscious mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike the dreaming mind? That\u2019s why, at first, I believed I only dreamed that you touched me.\u201d</p> <p>Kat felt her cheeks get warm. \u201cYes. Okay, I\u2019m sorry about that. I really didn\u2019t mean to take advantage of you. It\u2019s just that you were so... uh... male, and when I started touching you, you didn\u2019t want me to stop and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Achilles laughter was loud and long and uninhibited.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She frowned at him. Okay, she wanted him to laugh and smile more, but not at her.</p><p>He kissed her hand again. \u201cI have not been touched by a woman in a decade and you are apologizing to me for something I think of as a miracle. You are an odd, magical woman, Katrina Marie Campbell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Kat,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it really wasn\u2019t ethical what I did. I don\u2019t want you to think that\u2019s how I normally behave.\u201d</p><p>His amused expression sobered. \u201cAre you truly sorry about what has passed between us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not sorry about what happened. I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t talk with you about it first.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cAnd I would not have believed you, and quite probably sent you away for your own protection. No, Kat, you have nothing to be sorry for, unless you do not want my devotion and my protection and my love, because I wish to give you those three things, along with so very much more.\u201d</p><p>Kat took both of his hands in hers and looked straight into his blue eyes. \u201cI do accept your devotion and protection and love, and I also want something else from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cName it and if it is in my power to give it to you, I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you to stay out of the fighting until we\u2019re sure you can control the berserker. And I specifically want you to stay away from Hector.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe prophecy said that I was destined to die after I killed him.\u201d</p><p>Kat squeezed his hands. \u201cThen don\u2019t kill him! How much easier could that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this moment I cannot imagine what could provoke me to fight Hector.\u201d His snort was self-mocking. \u201cI hold no grudge against Hector. I know he is an honorable man, well loved by his family and the Trojan people. I don\u2019t enjoy cutting down honorable young men in the prime of their lives when they have done nothing to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood. That\u2019s settled. So we stay here together and we work on your self-hypnotism abilities.\u201d</p><p>Achilles gave her a horrified look. \u201cI can\u2019t bespell myself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles, how many times do I have to explain to you that it\u2019s not a spell? It\u2019s nothing more than breathing and concentration and relaxation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really believe I can learn to control the berserker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can control him,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cWhat I do believe is that I can teach you how to be sure he doesn\u2019t possess you, so that you won\u2019t have to control him.\u201d</p><p>Achilles got up and paced back and forth beside the bed. \u201cIf the berserker no longer possesses me...\u201d His words trailed off.</p><p>\u201cThen your whole life won\u2019t be about fighting,\u201d Kat finished for him. \u201cYour fate would change. Is that what you want?\u201d Her chest felt tight while she waited for him to answer.</p><p>He stopped and looked at her. \u201cI could return to my country, marry, raise children and know love and peace and forever put war and death and hatred behind me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIt sounds like a dream. The kind of unbelievable dream I had for two nights with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it wasn\u2019t a dream. It was real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps the future that I\u2019d thought impossible can be real, too. Yes. It is what I want,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cAll right\u2014let\u2019s make it real.\u201d</p><p>Achilles moved back to her bedside. \u201cYou say it like it can come true, like my fate can be changed. When you look at me like this, and speak thus, I almost believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, and more importantly, believe in yourself,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Achilles bent and kissed her gently on the lips. She could feel his hesitation and knew that he was afraid to push the line of intimacy between them, which she completely understood. No way did they need a return of the berserker, especially not when Achilles\u2019 belief in himself and his ability to fight the monster off was so shaky.</p><p>Thankfully, at that instant, her stomach let out a huge, obvious growl. Kat laughed. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d he said, with his slight smile. \u201cI\u2019ll have the maidservants bring\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, no!\u201d she interrupted, already swinging her legs over the edge of the bed. \u201cI need to get up\u2014walk around\u2014take a bath.\u201d He looked like he was going to argue with her, but she held her hand out to him. \u201cCould you help me with all three of those things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything within my power,\u201d Achilles said, taking her hand and wrapping it securely through his arm.</p><p>Kat thought she felt surprisingly good for a woman who\u2019d been poisoned, almost eaten and in a coma for four days. By the time she\u2019d reached the bench outside their tent, she was definitely steadier on her feet, even though she sat down and let Achilles call for food and drink. Jacky was over by the campfire with Patroklos (who Kat thought looked utterly love struck), and they both hurried over to her.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling? Having any dizziness? Shortness of breath? Blurred vision? Anything still feel paralyzed or sluggish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. No, no, no and no. Would you just relax? I\u2019m definitely\u2014\u201d</p><p>But before she could finish the sentence, Aetnia rushed over to her and threw herself at Kat\u2019s feet, clutching her ankles and sobbing.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady! Forgive me! Please forgive me! I had no idea I was sending you into danger.\u201d</p><p>Kat exchanged shocked looks with Jacky as she tried to extract herself from Aetnia\u2019s fervent and wet embrace. \u201cAetnia, it wasn\u2019t your fault. You were just trying to help me find Achilles. You couldn\u2019t have known about those sea creature things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! It was my fault. I shouldn\u2019t have listened to her. I am so sorry, Princess.\u201d She sobbed brokenly.</p><p>Achilles grabbed the maidservant\u2019s arm and lifted her roughly to her feet. \u201cYou should not have listened to whom?\u201d</p><p>Aetnia shrieked and cringed away from Achilles, holding her hand out pleadingly to Kat. \u201cPrincess! Don\u2019t let him kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Aetnia. He\u2019s not going to kill you.\u201d Ignoring Achilles\u2019 dark look, Kat tugged on his arm so that he let the girl go while she took Aetnia\u2019s hand and guided her to the bench to sit between her and a scowling Jacky.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too free with the no-one\u2019s-killing-her promises until we find out exactly what she had to do with the attack against you,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Aetnia made a mouselike squeaking sound and scooted closer to Kat. \u201cDon\u2019t let the witch bespell me, Princess!\u201d</p><p>Jacky hissed at her. Aetnia screamed. Kat thought she heard Achilles growl.</p><p>\u201cOkay! Enough! Everyone just settle down.\u201d Kat clamped a hand on Aetnia\u2019s shoulder to keep her from literally crawling into her lap. She pointed at Jacky. \u201cShe is not a witch.\u201d Then at Achilles. \u201cAnd he is not a monster. Now, you are going to take three deep breaths and then explain, slowly and without hysterical crying, what you\u2019re talking about. Breathe with me.\u201d Even though Kat would much rather shake the ridiculous woman, she led her in taking three cleansing breaths. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. Now talk to me.\u201d When the maidservant\u2019s eyes skittered nervously to Achilles and Jacky, Kat did shake her shoulder. \u201cNo. Talk to me.\u201d</p><p>Aetnia\u2019s gaze snapped back to Kat\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2014it was w-when I went to the Greek camp to get your tea.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded encouragement. \u201cYes, I remember. It was nice of you to get the tea for me.\u201d Kat also remembered that it was shortly after that Aetnia had sent her to the seashore where she was supposed to have found Achilles, but she carefully kept her expression and voice neutral. \u201cWhat happened when you were in the Greek camp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw Briseis. She was talking with a group of war brides at Acalle\u2019s campsite. She\u2014she was talking about you and\u2014\u201d Aetnia hesitated, glancing fearfully at Jacky, who curled her lip at her.</p><p>\u201cBriseis was talking about Melia and me,\u201d Kat said, squeezing the girl\u2019s shoulder and forcing her attention away from Jacky. \u201cWhat was she saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why does that have anything to do with the princess being attacked?\u201d Achilles added, in a voice he was obviously trying to keep reasonable.</p><p>Kat could feel Aetnia begin to tremble under her hand. \u201cJust talk to me. It\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said soothingly. \u201cWhat did Briseis say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe called Melia a witch and said she has bespelled Patroklos and might even be trying to teach you spells, too.\u201d</p><p>Kat heard Patroklos snort and Jacky had a minifit of coughing.</p><p>\u201cIs that all Briseis said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She heard me ask Acalle for some of her special tea for you, and she told me that if I wanted to save you from Melia\u2019s evil that I should be sure you go to the seashore so that Achilles\u2019 mother, the sea goddess Thetis, could gift you with immunity to witchery. That is why I told you Achilles was at the shore. I thought only to save you, my lady! Please believe me!\u201d And she dissolved into sobs again.</p><p>\u201cThat bitch set you up,\u201d Jacky said. She gave Aetnia a disdainful look. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean this bitch. I mean Briseis.\u201d Then she waggled her brows at Patroklos, who was standing beside Achilles. \u201cAnd did you know I\u2019ve bewitched you, Blondie Bear?\u201d</p><p>Patroklos grinned. \u201cCompletely, my beauty.\u201d</p><p>Jacky made kissing noises at him.</p><p>Kat ignored them, looking instead at Achilles, whose expression had become masklike and unreadable. \u201cWow. Briseis must really have a thing for you. She wants me out of the way big time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe couldn\u2019t want me. She didn\u2019t. She was as all other women toward me,\u201d Achilles said, then his expression softened for an instant. \u201cAll other women except you, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have known it if she wanted you?\u201d Jacky said. \u201cNot to be insulting or anything, Achilles, but you don\u2019t exactly strike me as an expert on what women want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be mean,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not! I\u2019m just tellin\u2019 the truth. Briseis might have had a major thing for Achilles and he was clueless about it. Didn\u2019t you say she gave you massively dirty looks in Agamemnon\u2019s tent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Briseis. It\u2019s Agamemnon,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kat and Jacky said together.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Go back to the campfire and prepare food for the princess,\u201d Achilles told Aetnia before he continued. She shot out of her seat on the bench and ran, stumbling, to the campfire. \u201cBriseis didn\u2019t send you to the seashore and what she believed would be your death because of desire for me. She has no power to summon sea creatures to do her bidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon does. He has before,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>Achilles nodded. \u201cBriseis is nothing more than Agamemnon\u2019s mouthpiece\u2014the tool he used to get the princess into a vulnerable position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why? What does he have against me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t you. It\u2019s me,\u201d Achilles said. \u201cThe king and I have long been enemies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more than just that,\u201d Patroklos said. \u201cAgamemnon is trying to force you to return to battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would he think killing me would make Achilles fight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? We\u2019ve been bespelled by both of you.\u201d Patroklos\u2019s smile was as boyish and engaging as always, but Kat was surprised by the dark circles she was just now noticing beneath his expressive eyes. And had he lost weight? His high cheekbones certainly looked more visible.</p><p>\u201cSo you get rid of us witches, and you two will, naturally, jump back in the battle,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cBecause, according to Agamemnon\u2019s reasoning, you have nothing to live for except battle,\u201d Kat said, meeting Achilles\u2019 blue gaze.</p><p>\u201cAccording to most people that is all I have to live for,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not most people,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Achilles\u2019 lips lifted at the corners. \u201cAnd that is something of which I am becoming profoundly grateful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"The problem is, Agamemnon\u2019s men are being killed,\u201d Patroklos said abruptly. \u201cGreeks are being killed.\u201d</p><p>Achilles turned to his cousin. \u201cAgamemnon knew the possible cost to the Greek people when he left our shores to attack Troy under the guise of rescuing a faithless woman. Many men have been killed during the past nine years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fighting was even when we were in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCousin, I am not keeping you from the battlefield. You, as well as all of my men, are free to fight with the Greeks.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jacky said, standing up and grabbing Patroklos\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight without Achilles, and Achilles has damn good reasons for not fighting. Agamemnon, the guy who\u2019s supposed to be a great king and leader, is a liar and a cheat. He just tried to have a princess killed to get his way. He\u2019s like a sneaky old harem bitch. Don\u2019t let him get to you.\u201d</p><p>Kat watched Patroklos caress Jacky\u2019s cheek and was touched by the obvious adoration in the warrior\u2019s eyes as he smiled at her best friend. \u201cDon\u2019t fret, my beauty. Fighting without my cousin is not something I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t sound like Agamemnon knows you very well if he thinks the way to get you back on his side is to attack someone you care about,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAgamemnon is a fool,\u201d Achilles said. \u201cI know. I recognize a fool. I have been one for much of my life. The king fights for glory, believing his immortality will be secured by the sword.\u201d Achilles shook his head, looking several decades older than his twenty-nine years. \u201cTrue immortality can only be found in your sons and daughters.\u201d He smiled ruefully at Patroklos. \u201cYou would do well to remember that, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would do well to remember that,\u201d Patroklos said, moving to stand beside Jacky and resting his hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>Kat expected Jacky to blanch and make a comment about \u201cnot birthing no babies for no one.\u201d Instead she smiled up at Patroklos and looked young and completely happy.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re still not fighting,\u201d Kat said. \u201cEven though he had me attacked and almost killed.\u201d</p><p>Achilles had begun to relax, so his instant return to steely self-control was doubly obvious. \u201cWould you have me exact vengeance on your behalf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I would not. But I was wondering if that was your intention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy intention hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou still want to change your fate?\u201d Kat said.</p> <p>\"Y-your dinner, my lady.\u201d Aetnia, clearly overhearing Kat\u2019s last comment, almost spilled the bowl of stew she\u2019d brought Kat.</p><p>\u201cLeave the bowl and bring wine for all of us,\u201d Achilles said with a growl.</p><p>Cringing, Aetnia hurried away to do his bidding.</p><p>\u201cYou have really got to quit scaring her like that,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI like it. Scare away, Achilles,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cOutside you are like the sword, my beauty, sharp and strong and deadly. Inside you are like a succulent peach, always ready for my mouth,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>Kat\u2019s brows shot up when, instead of smacking the crap out of him for the sappy comment, Jacky giggled, said, \u201cYou say the sweetest things,\u201d and tilted her head back for his kiss.</p><p>Kat ate her stew in silence while Aetnia rushed around with another equally cowed servant giving everyone goblets and filling them with dark red wine. Kat was beginning to feel much more like herself physically. The weakness was leaving, as was the insatiable thirst and the sense of not really belonging to this world, which was, she realized, completely ironic. Of course she didn\u2019t belong to this world. Neither did Jacky. But here they both were, undeniably drawn to these two men\u2014unalterably tangled in their fates.</p> <p>\u201cAre you really okay?\u201d Jacky\u2019s soft but insistent question pulled Kat out of her introspection.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d she said. Achilles and Patroklos had gone over to the campfire to retrieve a tray of bread, olives and cheese, and\u2014at Jacky\u2019s insistence\u2014another pitcher of red wine without calling Aetnia back to wait on them, leaving the two women alone for a few moments.</p><p>\u201cConfused about?\u201d Jacky asked.</p><p>Kat met her gaze. \u201cI told Achilles who we really are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all that\u2019s buggin\u2019 you? I already told Patroklos.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I had to do some serious bossing around when your boy carried you back here half dead. They wanted to bleed you and rub bull piss and pig snot or some such nonsense all over you. Being the good girlfriend I am, I insisted they fuck themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat didn\u2019t go over well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not till I explained to Patroklos exactly who we are and why I know more about treating the sick and wounded than the ridiculous killer quacks associated with the Greek army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d he take it?\u201d</p><p>Jacky smiled. \u201cWith only a minor amount of freak-out. I did have to promise to draw a picture of a car for him, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA car?\u201d</p><p>Jacky shrugged. \u201cYou know how boys are. I was just mentioning stuff from the modern world... one thing led to another... and poof! He wants a car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense in a Twilight Zone kind of way,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou love him, don\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, I do believe I might. You love Achilles, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are well and truly fucked, aren\u2019t we?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really getting upset about staying out of the battle,\u201d Jacky said, her eyes following Patroklos to the campfire. \u201cI\u2019d say I wished the Greeks would hurry and lose, but things are so different now. I just don\u2019t know what to wish for, let alone what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. Before they were going to lose and we were going to be zapped home. But now I\u2019m, well...\u201d She faltered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if I ever want to go back,\u201d Jacky finished for her.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus felt old. His shoulder pained him constantly. He\u2019d been wounded earlier that day during the battle. Leading a wave against Troy\u2019s damnable walls he\u2019d gotten within an archer\u2019s range. He\u2019d been lucky. The arrow had only scraped the length of his outer thigh and not embedded itself in his body. Still, it was a painful nuisance, causing him to sit heavily on a gnarled old driftwood log. Absently he pressed a hand against the bloody linen that he\u2019d hastily wrapped around the leg wound. At least he had this stretch of beach to himself. Odysseus stared out at the moon-soaked sea and raised the wineskin to his lips.</p><p>\u201cYou look tired.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus closed his eyes and let her voice wash over him. When he opened them the goddess had materialized in front of him. She was wearing robes the color of a dove\u2019s wing, which matched her unusual eyes perfectly. She hadn\u2019t brought her war helmet and shield, nor did she carry any other symbolic image of her power. He thought she looked like an exquisite maiden in the bloom of beauty and youth. Odysseus bowed his head.</p><p>\u201cYour presence rejuvenates me, great Goddess.\u201d</p><p>Athena waved away his flattery. \u201cAren\u2019t you sleeping well? I\u2019ve told you before\u2014\u201d Noticing the bloody cloth on his thigh she broke off with a little gasp. Then, as was typical for the Goddess of War, she schooled her face back into a stern expression. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you\u2019ve been wounded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an arrow scratch\u2014it is nothing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your goddess. I decide what is and isn\u2019t nothing.\u201d She stepped forward and sank to her knees beside him. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena, no! You shouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u201d Odysseus began, grasping the goddess\u2019s elbow and trying to lift her to her feet.</p><p>Athena pressed her hand against his chest. \u201cIt is my wish to see for myself how badly my warrior is wounded.\u201d</p><p>Her touch made his chest contract. With a sigh he released her arm and sat back, stretching his leg out so that she could see the wound. When he started to unwrap the bloody bandage, her soft hands stopped him.</p><p>\u201cI will do this. You just need to be still.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus sat there, frozen, breathing in Athena\u2019s unique scent. She was so close that as she bent over his leg her long golden hair brushed his body, causing him to feel aroused and breathless, yet afraid she would notice and disapprove. Did she realize how much he loved her? Of course she did. She was his goddess. She knew everything.</p><p>\u201cThis could fester. Why have you not cleaned and dressed it properly?\u201d Athena looked up at him, a frown causing her smooth brow to wrinkle slightly.</p><p>He started to fabricate a story about being too busy to notice it, but the words that came from his lips were much different than those his mind had planned. They were, instead, from his heart. \u201cI was too weary to bother with it, Goddess. I almost wish it would fester and take me. Then, at least, I could rest.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed in what an unknowing person would see as anger. But Odysseus understood Athena\u2019s every expression and what he saw was the shock that his words caused within her.</p><p>\u201cYou will not die. I forbid it.\u201d The goddess placed her hand gently against his wound. She closed her eyes, obviously gathering her power. Then she whispered, \u201cFlesh obey your goddess\u2019s demand. Knit blood and skin, now, at my command.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s hand began to glow and Odysseus sucked in a sharp breath as her power surged into him. Her heat was a fire blazing in his blood, and he could feel his very flesh obeying her whispered command and healing itself. When she lifted her hand and opened her eyes, there was nothing but smooth flesh on his thigh and a small, pink scar.</p><p>\u201cSee,\u201d he said softly, smiling into her gray eyes. \u201cI told you your presence would rejuvenate me.\u201d</p><p>Athena smiled one of her rare smiles. \u201cStubborn man. Will you always insist on flattering me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as I am yours, my goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will be eternally flattered, for you will always belong to me, Odysseus.\u201d Slowly, as if warring against herself, Athena pressed her hand against his thigh again. This time her touch was caressing instead of healing. Still kneeling beside him, the goddess stroked his skin. \u201cHow long has it been since first I appeared to you?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cJust over twenty-two years, Goddess. You first appeared to me before I could even grow a beard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were a delightful boy\u2014already showing signs of wit and wisdom, and such a sweet, smooth face.\u201d The goddess\u2019s usually sober expression softened into a smile of remembrance.</p><p>Odysseus thought his heart would break free from his chest at the sight of such loveliness. When his hand lifted to rub the stubble of his beard he hoped she didn\u2019t notice how it shook. \u201cUnlike now, my goddess. There is no sweet, smooth-faced boy here anymore.\u201d</p><p>He expected her to agree with him, laugh and retreat back into what he thought of as her divine mask\u2014the one that hid Athena\u2019s deepest feelings and kept the goddess from flaring with rage or passion. Instead she completely took him off guard by lifting her hand to stroke his cheek.</p><p>\u201cI still see the boy,\u201d she said in a voice so low that Odysseus had to strain to hear her above his rapidly beating heart.</p><p>Odysseus stared down at his goddess\u2014the woman he\u2019d loved since he was an untried boy. She\u2019d appeared to him many times over his life. She\u2019d chosen him as her warrior, as the mortal man to whom she bestowed her blessings above all others. But she\u2019d rarely touched him, and she\u2019d never come close to fulfilling his secret desire for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Athena? What has happened?\u201d</p><p>She took her hand from his face and stood, turning her back to him. \u201cWhy must there be something wrong? May I not touch you for no other reason than because I wish it?\u201d</p><p>He stood, too, and moved closer to her. \u201cOf course you may touch me, and for any reason you wish!\u201d Odysseus raised his hands, longing to take her into his arms, but stopped himself. Athena was not a mortal woman. He could never forget that.</p><p>Still with her back to him she said, \u201cDid you know that even Achilles has found love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves her, does he? I wondered if he would allow himself to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound surprised,\u201d Athena said, turning to face him.</p><p>Odysseus smiled and shrugged. \u201cIt seems to me that love is rarely predictable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love Penelope?\u201d</p><p>At the mention of his wife\u2019s name Odysseus\u2019s smile faltered. \u201cShe is my wife and the mother of my son. I respect and honor her as such.\u201d</p><p>Athena touched his face again. \u201cBut do you love her?\u201d</p><p>Almost without conscious thought Odysseus pressed his cheek into her hand. \u201cIn my way, I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means that I gave my heart to another just over twenty-two years ago. Since then there has been little left to give anyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Odysseus...\u201d Athena whispered.</p><p>Before he could change his mind, Odysseus bent and pressed his lips gently against hers. When their mouths met a shock of desire sheared through his body with such intensity that it mixed pain with pleasure. Athena gasped, clearly feeling it, too, and her arms wrapped around his neck as she pulled him down to her and opened her mouth to deepen the kiss.</p><p>They stood there for what seemed like a very long time, their mouths exploring, their bodies pressed together. Suddenly Athena broke the kiss. She was breathing hard and her perfect mouth looked swollen, her cheeks pink where the roughness of his beard had scraped her. The goddess gazed up at him, gray eyes wide with several different emotions. Achilles prayed silently that desire and acceptance were chief among them.</p><p>\u201cVenus was right,\u201d Athena said softly. \u201cWe should have become lovers years ago.\u201d Without moving out of his arms, the goddess waved her hand over the beach around them, and a thick satin blanket materialized beneath them.</p><p>Very deliberately she stepped away from him, and then undid the ornate brooch that held her robes in place over her shoulder. The gray silk slid down her body to flutter at her feet and remind Odysseus, once again, of the delicate wings of a dove. She stepped out of the pool of cloth and gracefully lay down, creamy skin luminous and perfect in the moonlight as she reclined against the satin. Athena held her hand out to him.</p><p>\u201cCome to me and prove the love you\u2019ve had for me these past many years, my Odysseus,\u201d she said.</p><p>Odysseus lay beside her, losing himself in his true love\u2019s body. He knew he could not possess her as his own. He knew this might be the only time he would ever know her intimate touch, but he gave his body to her without hesitation and with utter, joyous abandon, much as he had given her his heart all those years ago.</p><p>It would have to be enough... he thought afterward as Odysseus held Athena and their tears mingled. Somehow it would have to be enough... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I was wrong,\u201d Venus said, bursting into Hera\u2019s private chamber.</p><p>\u201cWas? I believe the correct word is \u2018am,\u2019 as in \u2018I am wrong to disturb you in your chamber, my queen.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. I wouldn\u2019t have bothered you except I do believe it\u2019s an emergency,\u201d Venus said, conjuring ambrosia out of the air.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened? Do not tell me your little mortal who\u2019s in Polyxena\u2019s body has gotten herself almost killed again. By Zeus\u2019s beard! This Trojan War gets more and more annoying by the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, Kat\u2019s fine. It\u2019s Athena.\u201d</p><p>Hera had been reclining on a velvet and gold chaise, delicately nibbling sugarcoated, ambrosia-soaked grapes, but Venus\u2019s proclamation had her sitting straight up in concern. \u201cWhat is it? What has happened to Athena?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has had sex with Odysseus.\u201d</p><p>Hera blinked once, twice, then shook her head as if to clear it. \u201cI could not have heard you correctly. I thought you said Athena has had sex with Odysseus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly what I just said.\u201d Venus sat on the chaise next to Hera and conjured a glass of ambrosia for her queen. \u201cI was keeping an eye on the Greek camp. I mean, we certainly don\u2019t want another debacle like the attempt on Kat\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course\u2014of course, you must be diligent. What did you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSex. Between Odysseus and Athena. On the beach.\u201d Venus spoke in shocked little bursts between sips of ambrosia. \u201cShe conjured a satin blanket for them. It was actually very romantic, if slippery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou watched after you knew who they were?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d Venus drank her wine, not meeting Hera\u2019s eyes. \u201cThough I can tell you, from the little I saw, that Odysseus is very, um, enthusiastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, good for Athena. She has been far too serious for far too long.\u201d Hera lifted one slim brow at Venus. \u201cAnd this is what you\u2019re saying you were wrong about? I\u2019m surprised at you. How many times have I heard you rail at Athena that she needed to orgasm, she needed to loosen up, she needed this, that and the other. Now she\u2019s finally got some of the \u2018other\u2019 and you think it\u2019s a problem? You, Goddess of Love, do not make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted her to do all of that with Odysseus before we decided to step into the Trojan War on the side of the Trojans. After what happened on the beach tonight do you think Athena is going to allow Odysseus and his men to be defeated?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is my point. So we\u2019ve gotten Achilles out of the way and set up events to bring about the end of the war. Now here comes the Goddess of War, firmly behind Odysseus\u2019s firm behind. Even if she only manipulates things without actually stepping into the battle, she will more than equal the absence of Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should have a little talk with your mortal. If we sent Achilles back into the fray along with Athena\u2019s influence, I imagine the war would end quickly. And that is what we wanted,\u201d Hera said, sighing heavily. \u201cThough the thought of that wretched Agamemnon being victorious certainly rankles me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose I could...\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYou suppose you could, but?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve also been watching Achilles and Katrina. They\u2019re in love,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cAnd this is important to me because?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if Kat loves him she won\u2019t be willing to send him to his death. Remember that little prophecy about Achilles being killed before the Trojan walls after he kills Hector?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour modern mortal is but one player in this drama. I will not allow her to get in the way of what needs to be done,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cHera, you have, of course, had dealings with modern mortals, and you do visit Tulsa to see your son from time to time, I know that. And I mean no disrespect when I say this, but for all your interaction with modern mortals, you really don\u2019t understand them. They don\u2019t revere or fear us as do the ancients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey should!\u201d Hera snapped. Then she drew a deep breath and controlled her temper. \u201cYou know that I do not enjoy being cruel, so we\u2019ll wait a little longer and see what happens. But if Athena weighs in on the side of Greece, we will have no choice but to put our might behind the army and aid in their victory. I will not risk creating enmity with the Goddess of War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are those who would argue that love is stronger than war,\u201d Venus said, with an unusual hardness in her voice.</p><p>Hera touched the goddess\u2019s arm softly. \u201cI did not mean to say that Athena is more important to me than are you. But would Love want to cause civil strife amongst the gods for the sake of one modern mortal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I\u2019m being accused of in the ancient world, only the strife I was supposed to have caused over one mortal woman is between the Greeks and the Trojans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and how do you feel about that?\u201d Hera asked shrewdly.</p><p>\u201cI despise the fact that the war is being blamed on me,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m assuming you wouldn\u2019t want anything similar to happen on Mount Olympus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Venus sighed. \u201cSo we wait and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if Athena aids Odysseus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen Achilles will have to reenter the battle,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019ve decided,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cSadly, we have.\u201d</p><p>Venus sipped her ambrosia and thought about how distraught Achilles had been the four days Kat had been unconscious. Well, at least he has known love, no matter how brief.</p><p>\"Okay, all I said was I wanted a bath\u2014as in being submerged in water versus splashing in a little bowl that smells like roses. You\u2019re kicking me out of your camp for that?\u201d Kat asked teasingly.</p><p>\u201cDid I not tell you that I would give you anything you wished, if it were within my power?\u201d Achilles touched her arm briefly where it linked with his. She noticed he did that a lot lately\u2014touched her with brief, gentle caresses. He didn\u2019t let his touch linger and he didn\u2019t kiss her. It was as if he was attempting to become used to her in stages\u2014small stages that wouldn\u2019t arouse the berserker. She felt his eyes on her and looked up to see him watching her closely. \u201cTell me if we\u2019ve gone too far. I won\u2019t have you fatigued.\u201d</p><p>They\u2019d gone down the beach away from camp for a while, and then turned inland, following a little goat path. It hadn\u2019t been a short walk, but it hadn\u2019t turned into an exhausting hike, either. \u201cLike I told Jacky. I\u2019ve slept enough for decades and I\u2019m perfectly fine.\u201d Kat made the statement firmly. Not that she hadn\u2019t been freaked out by how much last night\u2019s meal and discussion had exhausted her. She\u2019d planned on another little hypnotism exercise with Achilles, but had been out the second her head had touched the pillow. And, worse, she\u2019d slept all the way through to early afternoon. She felt good now, but the whole incident had scared her. She\u2019d already killed off one body. What was the limit? What if this one went bad, too? Would Venus save her? And if she did, what kind of body would the next one be? She was actually getting attached to this one and wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to even consider what might\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou look troubled.\u201d Achilles broke into her internal babble.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about mortality,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cMortality\u2014that is a subject I have thought little about until lately,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cReally? I would have thought that after you made the choice to die young, you would have been counting down the years and thinking about it all the time.\u201d</p><p>He gave a self-deprecating snort. \u201cWhen I was young I rarely thought\u2014and if I did it was only of the next battle and the next opportunity for glory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, twenty-nine is not old. You\u2019re still really young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been young for more than a decade.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked up at him, knowing that the deep scars that had prematurely aged his face had also taken a similar toll on his soul. \u201cMaybe some of that can be reversed,\u201d she said.</p><p>Obviously noting the direction of her gaze his lips lifted and he said, \u201cYour friend is an excellent healer, but even she cannot reverse these.\u201d Achilles pointed at his facial scars.</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cWas that a joke? And the sky didn\u2019t fall in, nor did you get struck by lightning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your bad influence on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean the fact that I\u2019ve bespelled you? Remember, Jacky\u2019s a witch\u2014I\u2019m a witch\u2014everywhere a witch\u2014witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI stand corrected. You have bespelled me.\u201d Then he surprised her by pulling her, briefly, into his arms and hugging her hard. \u201cAnd we are here.\u201d Achilles took her by the shoulders and turned Kat around.</p><p>\u201cAchilles! It\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Kat was facing an oasis. Willows ringed a basin formed by butter-colored limestone. A stream dumped into the basin, filled it and then gurgled out the other side. It was small, but definitely big enough for someone to bathe comfortably in. Overlooking the oasis was a small temple that reminded Kat of a gazebo, only this one was made of marble with graceful columns and a domed roof. In the middle of the temple a blanket had been spread out. Atop it sat a laden basket. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d Kat asked, walking around the pool to the temple.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a shrine dedicated to Venus. I discovered it years ago. It\u2019s been abandoned because of the war. I\u2019ve come here many times to think\u2014to get away.\u201d</p><p>Kat glanced back at him, surprised to see that he looked embarrassed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Everyone needs time alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but Achilles, terror of maidens and battlefield berserker, is not everyone. If my men knew I found solace at a shrine dedicated to the Goddess of Love.\u201d He laughed humorlessly and shook his head. \u201cThey would probably begin to believe that I had finally gone mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they seem to have accepted me being with you just fine. Haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Achilles shrugged. \u201cRight now they are too preoccupied to even be shocked by you warming my bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to fight,\u201d Kat said, her stomach clenching.</p><p>\u201cThey do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already know my heart. I long for nothing as much as to return to Phthia and to find peace.\u201d Achilles paused, meeting her gaze before he continued. \u201cAnd love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already found love,\u201d Kat said softly.</p><p>Achilles closed the distance between them, joining her in the middle of Venus\u2019s shrine. He took her hand. \u201cHave I found love? Even though we don\u2019t know that the berserker can be defeated?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you have. And the berserker can be defeated; I know it.\u201d Slowly and deliberately, Kat rose on her tiptoes, while pulling him gently down to her. She kissed him softly. She didn\u2019t linger or deepen the kiss, but she also didn\u2019t make a frightened rush to get away. The kiss was her promise to him that the future he\u2019d dreamed could be real. But she didn\u2019t push it\u2014she didn\u2019t push him. Smiling, Kat looked down at the basket. \u201cIf this shrine has been abandoned for years, how did this get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wish to bathe reminded me of this place. While you slept today I brought these things out here. I thought you might enjoy getting away together.\u201d He said the words with his usual gruff confidence, but Kat could see the question in his eyes. One sign of fear or hesitation in her would undo him.</p><p>\u201cYou were absolutely right\u2014it\u2019s a great idea.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and bowed with exaggerated formality. \u201cYour bath awaits, Princess, and then we shall dine on whatever I frightened Aetnia into packing.\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head at him. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a couple arsenic sandwiches with a side dish of glass stew.\u201d Then she glanced down at the clear pool of water and her throat suddenly felt dry. \u201cHave you checked it to be sure that there aren\u2019t any slimy things in there that might be waiting to eat me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould the word of a sea goddess reassure you?\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Kat looked around the little tree-lined oasis. \u201cIs your mom here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe came with me earlier today and made quite certain everything was safe for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to quit sleeping so much. I miss everything.\u201d Kat took a step closer to the water. It did look harmless and utterly inviting. And it would be so good to get completely clean.</p><p>Achilles cleared his throat. She met his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be here, with my back turned while you bathe. You need only call out to me and I can be by your side in an instant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if you kept an eye on me? What if something grabs me and I can\u2019t call out to you.\u201d Kat watched the different emotions play across his face: desire and fear and need. When she realized fear was winning out, she said, \u201cWhy is it that the berserker doesn\u2019t possess you when you argue with Agamemnon? Doesn\u2019t he make you terribly angry?\u201d</p><p>He looked surprised at her question, but answered readily enough. \u201cOf course he does. The old bastard rarely fails to anger me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t the berserker possess you?\u201d she asked again.</p><p>Achilles shrugged. \u201cI suppose because I\u2019ve grown accustomed to how he makes me feel. I tell myself it\u2019s just Agamemnon, and the king is not a battle I am allowed to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not tell yourself that I am just Katrina, the woman you desire. This is the way I make you feel, and I am not a battle you are allowed to fight.\u201d</p><p>She saw hope flare and then die in his eyes. Achilles shook his head. \u201cNo. It is not the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could be if you believed it was.\u201d</p><p>He kept shaking his head. \u201cNo. I will not chance it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I will. Listen\u2014you have warning before the berserker possesses you, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome,\u201d he said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cOkay. It\u2019s simple then. You sit down up there. Make yourself comfortable. There\u2019s wine in that basket, right?\u201d</p><p>\"Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink it and relax. I\u2019ll bathe. You keep an eye on me to be sure nothing stings me senseless.\u201d She held up her hand when he opened his mouth. \u201cYes, I know. Jacky says I\u2019m already lacking sense.\u201d His lips twitched. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t listen to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this moment her observations seem very insightful,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>She frowned at him in mock severity. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t ever tell her that. So, you sit up there. I\u2019ll bathe. Everything will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if it isn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you start to look crazy I\u2019ll use my panic button.\u201d She lifted the locket that still hung around her neck.</p><p>He looked doubtful. \u201cVenus might be busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, she gave me her word. Plus she is one seriously nosy goddess. She\u2019ll be here, even if it\u2019s just to gather gossip.\u201d Kat walked the few steps back to him and put her hand gently on his arm. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal. You need to believe in yourself and in your ability to keep me safe as much as I believe in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou believe I can keep you safe?\u201d</p><p>Kat smiled into his scarred, life-battered face. \u201cOf course I do. You have kept me safe.\u201d She kissed him softly on the cheek then started determinedly toward her waiting bath, crossing her fingers in front of her and sending up a silent prayer to Venus, If you have to watch, maybe now would be a good time... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What in the holy hell had she been thinking? Kat tried not to hesitate too long while she frantically decided how best to take off her clothes without seeming too enticing, and yet also not seeming like she was scared shitless and bolting for the concealing water.</p><p>Concealing water? Kat squinted down at the clear little pool. Where were algae and a good dose of clouding pollution when you needed them? Get if over with, Katrina, she ordered herself. She pulled off the light green silk outer robe that had replaced the new blue one the gross sea things had ruined. Her underrobes were soft layers of eggshell silk. Kat let them fall around her feet. She hadn\u2019t really thought about the fact that neither panties nor a bra had come with any of her outfits\u2014until then. Just remind yourself that you\u2019re glad he\u2019s looking at this tight young little body, versus your pushing forty-year-old, needing to lose fifteen pounds and take your flabby butt to the gym body.</p><p>Kat tried for regal looking as, naked, she stepped into the pool, bracing herself for what she expected to be freezing cold water. But at the first touch of the tepid pool she felt a shiver of delight and, with a happy sigh, submerged herself. Only then did she look up at Achilles. \u201cHey! It\u2019s not cold.\u201d</p><p>He had done as she\u2019d instructed and was sitting, in a semirelaxed manner, on the blanket, leaning against one of the marble pillars. He had an uncorked wineskin in his lap. She thought he looked a little tense, but other than that completely himself.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s too shallow to be cold, at least this time of the year. The sun warms it and the willows shade it, keeping the water a perfect temperature.\u201d As he spoke she noticed he kept his eyes on hers, not allowing his gaze to travel down to her body, which the water did little to conceal. \u201cWhen I first discovered this shrine I thought the pool must have been why it was built and then dedicated to Venus.\u201d Achilles smiled a little sheepishly. \u201cSeems a perfect place for a goddess to bathe.\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cWhy, Achilles, I do believe you are a closet romantic.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI am no type of romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa! You left a flower on my pillow. I would call that evidence exhibit number one of romanticism.\u201d</p><p>He took a long drink of wine and then said, \u201cHow do you know I left it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. It must have been Aetnia\u2014or maybe Briseis. Both of them just love hanging out in your tent.\u201d</p><p>He snorted again and tried, unsuccessfully, to cover his laughter.</p><p>\u201cExhibit number two is that picnic basket full of goodies for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis basket?\u201d He pawed around inside it and pulled out a piece of cheese wrapped in flatbread. He took a big bite and around his full mouth said, \u201cThis basket is for me, not you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure it is,\u201d she said, scrubbing the bottom of her foot with a handful of sand. \u201cRomantic evidence exhibit three is that blanket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that romantic?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t want me to get my delicate skin dirty.\u201d She lifted her other foot, the bottom of which was still dirty, and waggled her toes at him.</p><p>His laughter was free and easy. She thought it was the most wonderful sound she had ever heard. \u201cThe blanket is for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Because I know how obsessed you are with comfort and relaxation.\u201d</p><p>He exaggerated a long stretch, causing it to be her turn to laugh.</p><p>\u201cHey, speaking of comfort, I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you how much I like the tapestries in your tent. Are they of a particular place or just random scenery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all of Phthia. It gives me a sense of home to be surrounded by them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhthia must be very beautiful,\u201d she said, scrubbing her hair and wishing she had her favorite shampoo and conditioner.</p><p>Achilles\u2019 faint smile was wistful. \u201cIt is, indeed. Someday I would like to take you there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, too.\u201d She paused and then decided she might as well ask him. \u201cAchilles, why don\u2019t you just take your Myrmidons and leave now? You\u2019ve withdrawn from the fighting. You\u2019ve broken with Agamemnon. Why stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought of it. If it were just me, or even just you and me, I would. But my men are Greeks. Phthia is a part of Greece. It would go hard on them and their families should they return before the war is over.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cNo, we stay until the end\u2014whether we fight or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do if the Greeks lose?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if they win?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched. \u201cGo home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it doesn\u2019t really matter to you who wins or loses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does matter. I don\u2019t want Greeks to die. But Agamemnon and Menelaus are responsible for that. I am only responsible for the deaths of my own men. Hopefully I will not lose one more Myrmidon.\u201d He paused before continuing. \u201cI should not have come to Troy. I only did so because I believed my fate could not be changed, and because Odysseus asked it of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you believe your fate can be changed.\u201d She didn\u2019t phrase it like a question but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cNow I believe many things I didn\u2019t just days ago.\u201d</p><p>Kat smiled at him and then dunked her head completely under the water. When she surfaced, shaking water from her hair and sputtering, Achilles was looking relaxed and content.</p><p>She studied him carefully for a moment, and then decided it was time for her to get out of the water, and time for their relationship to move forward another step.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, do you still desire me?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, obviously surprised by her question. \u201cYes. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there you are, relaxed and chatting with me. And here I am, naked.\u201d</p><p>His brows went up. \u201cThat is true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd, unless I\u2019m wildly mistaken, there is no berserker possession going on\u2014or even imminent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not something easy to be mistaken about. No, there is no berserker here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr even close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot close, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think I can get out of this pool and come up there with you?\u201d</p><p>Kat saw him swallow hard. \u201cNaked?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cActually I was planning on asking you for the blanket until I dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Yes, of course.\u201d He looked embarrassed, which Kat thought was a huge improvement over him looking stony faced and emotionless or scarlet eyed and completely crazy.</p><p>When he made no further move, she said, \u201cCould you bring me the blanket?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d rarely seen him awkward. Even at rest he had a warrior\u2019s feral grace, but when he jumped up and gathered the blanket he definitely gave off a bull in the china shop vibe and Kat had to bite the side of her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>She stood up and walked out of the water. His gaze never left her eyes, even when he opened the blanket for her and she stepped, naked and dripping, into his arms. Kat felt a tremor go through his body as his arms closed around her. Kat stepped back and smiled at him as if he saw her naked every day. The struggle on his face was obvious. There were no signs of the berserker, but Achilles was no longer relaxed, and she understood if his relaxation level continued to decline and his stress level to rise, she was, quite literally, flirting with danger.</p><p>\u201cTell me a story,\u201d she said.</p><p>His face was a question mark. \u201cA story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d The hand that wasn\u2019t clutching the blanket around her took his, and she pulled him up toward the shrine and the waiting picnic basket. \u201cTell me a story about your childhood while we eat. Something back in Phthia.\u201d She gave him a mischievous look over her shoulder. \u201cSomething not flattering.\u201d</p><p>His snort sounded amused. \u201cWhat if I was the perfect child and I did nothing that was not flattering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll eat the basket instead of the lunch you bullied Aetnia into packing.\u201d Kat sat beside the basket, arranging her blanket around her and wringing out her wet hair before checking out the food. \u201cYum! Cheese, meat, olives and wine. All of my favorite food groups\u2014fat and booze and salt.\u201d Achilles had taken his position next to her, leaning against the pillar again and making an obvious attempt to relax and not stare at her bare shoulders. She handed him some bread and meat. \u201cGood thing this body is so young. Less chance all this cheese will go to my butt\u2014or at least not immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in your time you aren\u2019t young?\u201d</p><p>Kat looked up from the food to him. Achilles didn\u2019t look shocked or upset at the idea of her being old, just curious. She smiled. \u201cBack in my time I\u2019m almost a decade older than you.\u201d</p><p>He did look shocked then. \u201cYou left your husband and children to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, god no. I\u2019ve never been married and I definitely don\u2019t have any kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take vows of chastity to a goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, Hera and Athena were confused about this, too. In the modern mortal world women don\u2019t get married so young. Okay, well, not educated women with any sense and decent teeth. Actually some of us don\u2019t get married at all. Or have children. We don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what do you do with your lives?\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s smile was long and slow. \u201cExactly what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re like men!\u201d Achilles proclaimed, as if he finally understood.</p><p>\u201cI guess from your point of view that\u2019s true.\u201d She raised one brow at him. \u201cAnd in case you\u2019re wondering. I have no intention of changing that about myself, even if I have changed worlds.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a considering look. \u201cDoes that mean you don\u2019t ever want to marry or have children?\u201d</p><p>Kat ignored the little sizzle of excitement his question had her feeling. \u201cNot necessarily. What it means is that if I get married or have children it will be because that\u2019s what I want and not because it\u2019s what\u2019s expected of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cGood. Now I want to hear a story about you as a little boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unflattering story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, they\u2019re the best kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d He settled in against the pillar and crossed his legs at the ankle, occasionally taking a drink from the wineskin while he talked and she worked her way through the food in the picnic basket. \u201cWhen I was a boy I didn\u2019t believe I could drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense. Your mom being a sea goddess and all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would have made more sense if I had been an immortal, too. But I wasn\u2019t, even though I acted like I was.\u201d He shook his head, remembering. \u201cI drove my nursemaids mad. And when I outgrew them, it was my tutors I drove mad. I took ridiculous chances\u2014swimming too far out to sea, getting caught in undertows and barely escaping\u2014silly, reckless things like that. It got so bad that my father was going to forbid me from going to the sea at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet your mom didn\u2019t like that idea.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, not at all. But she also didn\u2019t like the idea of her only son being killed in a childhood accident caused by his own foolishness. So the two of them got together and planned a little lesson for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good,\u201d she said after motioning for him to pass her the wineskin.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t. I must have been, oh, not quite twelve years old, which made Patroklos not even seven. He was forever shadowing me, which annoyed me to no end, but this particular day he told me that he\u2019d discovered a boat abandoned in a cove and he would take me to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd since you thought you were a sea god, a boat was perfect for you,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re using the same reasoning my parents used. And, yes, I did insist Patroklos take me directly to my boat. On our way to the cove the weather changed quickly, as it often does in Phthia. A squall moved in. I actually saw fishermen returning to shore. I scoffed at them\u2014cowards! And Patroklos and I set sail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatroklos was in on your parents\u2019 scheme?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019d just used him as a pawn. My cousin went with me to sea because he would follow me anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Kat watched his face soften when he spoke of Patroklos. \u201cYou love him very much, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is brother and son to me,\u201d Achilles said simply. \u201cSo we sailed into the storm. We were just far enough offshore to get ourselves in serious danger when a wave hit us and I was washed overboard. Patroklos was screaming for me and trying to throw me a line, but the storm-tossed waves were unusually violent.\u201d His lips tilted up.</p><p>\u201cUnusually? You mean as if a sea goddess had stirred them up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is exactly what I mean. I was foolish and reckless, but I wasn\u2019t stupid, and it didn\u2019t take me long to realize I was drowning. I remember trying to call for my mother, but the waves stifled my cries. I cannot tell you how much seawater I swallowed before the dolphins came, but it was enough to have me utterly panicked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, did you say dolphins?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and nodded. \u201cDolphins. They butted and bobbed me around, keeping me on the surface as if I were a melon they were playing with, until they got me up on the beach.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they saved you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, they saved me. They brought me safely to the main dock of Phthia, which was filled with fishermen and fishwives, and my parents, along with most of the royal court who just happened to be taking a stroll down to the docks at that moment. They were all there in time to see me butted out of the water, half drowned and completely naked, by a school of dolphins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNaked?\u201d Kat started to giggle.</p><p>\u201cNaked.\u201d Achilles nodded again. \u201cSomehow while they were battering and butting me around they managed to pull off all of my clothes, even down to stripping me of my sandals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must have been quite the sight,\u201d Kat said, while trying to control her fit of giggles.</p><p>\u201cApparently I was. They talked about it for years. You can still make some of the old servant women cackle hysterically if you bring it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid it have the desired effect on you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean did it scare some sense into my foolish young head?\u201d He lifted a shoulder. \u201cYes and no. I realized I could drown, and I suppose I was more careful after that\u2014or at least more careful about my arrogant proclamations. The boy it really worked on was Patroklos. To this day he loathes boats and turns a sickly shade of green just thinking about sailing.\u201d Achilles smiled and took the wineskin from her. \u201cAnd that, my lady, is my unflattering childhood story.\u201d</p><p>Kat laughed and clapped while he took a long drink of wine. Then when he handed it back to her he leaned forward and kissed her, softly, on the lips. She closed her eyes and leaned into him. Not aggressively, just warm and inviting, letting him set the pace. When they finally parted both of them were breathing heavily, but she could see no sign of the berserker in his clear blue eyes.</p><p>\u201cI can hypnotize you again,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you can.\u201d He touched her face and let his hand slide down to caress the slope of her bare shoulder. \u201cAnd I will allow you to if you feel you must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cBut I would like to make love to you without the spell. I want to experience all of it, and not just as a wonderful dream. Will you let me, Katrina?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Achilles studied Kat\u2019s expressive brown eyes while he waited for her to answer him. He could feel the increase of his breathing and heartbeat, but both were always elevated when he trained, and the berserker never possessed him then. I don\u2019t need him then. I don\u2019t need him now, he repeated silently to himself.</p><p>\u201cYes, Achilles, make love to me.\u201d</p><p>Her words speared through him. \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid?\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. As long as you\u2019re here, I\u2019m safe.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled her into his arms and held her close against him, inhaling the clean, wet scent of her hair and feeling the slight dampness of her skin. By all the gods he would not let her trust in him be misplaced! He wasn\u2019t a callow boy anymore. This would not end as his first love had.</p><p>Achilles kissed her, reminding himself to move slowly, to stay in control. She opened her mouth and his tongue met hers in a sweet, exploratory dance. Her arms wrapped around his shoulders and she leaned into him, causing the blanket to fall free from her body.</p><p>She froze, midkiss. With steady, deliberate moves, Achilles leaned back so that he could see her naked body. He held very still while he looked at her, and then reached out and ran his hands in a long caress from her neck, down over her breasts, the curve of her waist, all the way over hips and thigh. Then his eyes met hers again.</p><p>\u201cYou are exquisite,\u201d he said reverently.</p><p>Kat smiled then, and Achilles saw the future in her eyes\u2014his future. The one he\u2019d stopped dreaming about, stopped believing in. She had brought it back to him as a true possibility. He didn\u2019t know what wonderful thing he\u2019d done to cause the goddesses to bless him with this woman who was such a miraculous gift, but he silently promised them that if they gave him a lifetime with her, he and his children, and his children\u2019s children would honor them always.</p> <p>Achilles slid his hands around her waist and took her into his arms again, kissing her deeply and letting his hands smooth over the impossibly soft skin of her back, down to her lovely ass. He cupped it, pressing her more firmly against the erection that throbbed taut and heavy between his legs. Her hips moved in response and an enticing memory of their first encounter filled his mind and he remembered how her hot slickness had felt gliding up and down against his shaft.</p><p>A wave of desire crashed over Achilles, drowning in its intensity and he struggled to hold onto his control as he felt the searing, red hot intensity of the berserker lick against his lust-fevered skin.</p><p>\u201cOpen your eyes, Achilles. Look at me.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s sweet voice was cool relief against the fire in his mind. He opened his eyes and met her gaze. The berserker threatened. He knew she had to see his shadow lurking, ready to possess, to smother and repress all of his humanity. Yet she didn\u2019t show any fear. Her smile was confident. She didn\u2019t pull out of his arms and she didn\u2019t open the locket and call for her goddess\u2019s rescue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to leave me,\u201d she said in that calm, beautiful voice. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stay here with me. You\u2019re going to keep me safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Achilles murmured, kissing her gently. \u201cI will keep you safe.\u201d He reached within himself and found his inner core\u2014that part of himself that was the seat of his spirit\u2014and Achilles centered himself there. \u201cThis passion is different than what I need for war.\u201d He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d spoken the thought aloud until she answered him.</p> <p>\u201cYes! What you need to love me doesn\u2019t destroy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInstead it builds,\u201d he said.</p><p>Looking into her eyes he shifted her body so that she lay beneath him. Achilles lifted himself on one elbow so that he could continue to keep his gaze on hers as his hand cupped her breast, rubbing the hardening nipple against his callused palm. Her full lips parted as her breathing increased. When his hand moved down to the slick cleft between her legs, Kat moaned and arched her hips to meet him. She put her hand over his, guiding him, teaching him how to please her, and even when she shuddered in climax she still stared into his eyes.</p><p>Before the tremors of release had left her body he raised himself and slowly sheathed his throbbing cock within her tight heat.</p><p>\u201cStay with me, Achilles. Don\u2019t leave me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t ever leave you,\u201d he said, his voice deep and rough with the effort it took to maintain control. He lifted his hips, gliding almost all of the way out of her and then he tunneled within her again, harder this time.</p><p>\u201cAchilles.\u201d Kat breathed his name.</p><p>He stroked himself within her.</p> <p>\u201cAchilles.\u201d She moaned.</p><p>He thrust into her.</p><p>\u201cAchilles...\u201d</p><p>It was as if she surrounded him completely. His body. His soul.</p><p>Anchoring him, not just to her, but to sanity and to his humanity. When he finally found his release it was her name on his lips, and her face in his eyes. And his soul was his own.</p><p>Achilles and Kat got back to the Myrmidon camp as the sun was setting. Walking hand in hand and talking easily together, they reached the illumination of the campfire. Kat watched Aetnia\u2019s eyes widen when Achilles tossed the empty basket at her feet and said, \u201cThank you. That was well packed.\u201d Then, while everyone stared at them openmouthed, Achilles kissed her soundly and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be back after I\u2019ve spoken with Patroklos.\u201d And he walked off, looking incredibly pleased with himself.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me? Did he just say thank you?\u201d Jacky popped up from where she was lounging beside the fire.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why good manners surprise you so much,\u201d Kat said, plopping down beside her. \u201cAh, crap. I need a goblet of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine, my princess?\u201d</p><p>Kat looked up, grinned at the girl, and took the goblet she offered. \u201cAetnia, you\u2019re a mind reader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll take some more, too,\u201d Jacky said. Aetnia hesitated, glanced at Kat, who nodded quickly, and then filled Jacky\u2019s goblet, even though her hand was shaking. \u201cThank you ever so, Aetnia,\u201d Jacky said with exaggerated kindness.</p><p>\u201cBe nice,\u201d Kat whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, boo!\u201d Jacky stomped at Aetnia, who scuttled around to the other side of the fire.</p><p>\u201cMust you tease her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor your information she is a hateful hag when you\u2019re gone. This whole \u2018my princess this\u2019 and \u2018my princess that\u2019 is a big act. When you\u2019re not here she slithers around committing major gossip with those women who give you weird looks all the time. Somethin\u2019s up with that girl. I may have to kick her scrawny white ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, Jacky. Please recall that at this moment your ass is also white and scrawny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I have been eating steadily and I\u2019m determined to change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, go on about your business,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cTo big asses,\u201d Jacky said, raising her goblet.</p><p>\u201cTo your big future ass,\u201d Kat said, clicking her goblet against Jacky\u2019s.</p><p>Jacky took a long drink then raised her brow at Kat. \u201cAll right. Details.\u201d</p><p>Kat scooted over closer to her and lowered her voice. \u201cWe had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood god, you put the boy under again? And I mean that figuratively as well as literally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He was perfectly in control of all of his faculties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unconscious and thinkin\u2019 he was dreaming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tellin\u2019 me today you two had aware-we\u2019re-having-sex sex, versus the semiconscious-almost-rape sex you had those other two nights?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not rape him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I say whatever to your semantics. Just answer the question.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We had totally aware\u2014totally-all-there-sex sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are grinning like a fool, so it must have been good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was utterly delicious,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAnd he controlled the berserker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually, it was more like he controlled himself so the berserker didn\u2019t possess him.\u201d</p><p>Jacky sipped her wine and stared into the fire.</p><p>\u201cAll right. What is it?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little concerned that he didn\u2019t control the berserker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what difference does it make? He controlled the thing not possessing him, isn\u2019t that the point?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKinda. I imagine it makes a big difference if you\u2019re ever around him when he is possessed,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t be. When this war is over he\u2019s going home\u2014to a peaceful life. If he\u2019s never in battle again, the berserker may never come on him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, in other words, your theory is that you\u2019re gonna ignore it and hope it goes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Jacky rolled her eyes.</p><p>Kat frowned at Jacky. \u201cOkay, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hope your theory is more successful with berserker possession than it is with, oh, say, pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles will be fine,\u201d Kat said firmly.</p><p>They both stared into the fire and sipped their wine.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re staying with him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Jacky finally asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She looked at her best friend. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Jacky sighed. \u201cSadly, it appears that I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life white.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Kat put her arm around Jacky. \u201cWell, we can try to tan you up. Would that make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no! I am not one of those white girls who bakes her skin in the sun and then looks like fucking beef jerky when she hits forty. I have entirely too much sense for that. How many times have I yelled at you to keep your light ass out of the sun?\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo many to begin to count.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I have more damn sense than that,\u201d she repeated. \u201cYou know what white girls lying out in the sun remind me of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurkeys drowning in the rain \u2019cause they\u2019re too stupid to get in out of it or swallow,\u201d Kat said promptly.</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky, you have called me a drowning turkey only about a gazillion times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you should bring your white ass in out the sun.\u201d</p><p>Kat stared at her. Hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYour cheeks are looking pink to me. As in sunburn pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bullshit! I just have a little healthy color. That\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s how the obsession begins,\u201d Kat said smugly.</p><p>The two women looked at each other and then dissolved into laughter.</p><p>When her giggles were under control Kat wiped her face and looked around the campfire clearing, populated by the usual group of war-prize brides who were sitting as far away from Kat and Jacky as they could get.</p><p>\u201cWonder what\u2019s taking Achilles and Patroklos so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope he\u2019s talkin\u2019 some sense into Patroklos\u2019s thick skull.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cPatroklos is acting very crazy about this nonfighting situation. Apparently today Odysseus was like Superman\u2014no one could touch him and he led his men on one hell of a charge. Word is that they could win if this keeps up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey, as in the Greek they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. Well, that\u2019s good. I guess. The goddesses just wanted the war over. Odysseus all of a sudden being invincible makes the war over. So what\u2019s Patroklos\u2019s problem with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem \u2019cept he wants Achilles and the rest of the Myrmidons to join in. He says they could for sure win if that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kat said softly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, oh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I should get him to do it? Get him to fight?\u201d Kat\u2019s stomach clenched as she waited for her friend\u2019s answer.</p><p>\u201cYour boy might very well die if he keeps fighting, right?\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t remember much of the stupid Iliad, but that fact is pretty hard to forget. Achilles dies in the Trojan War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen no,\u201d Jacky said firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t let him fight. You just found him, and you had to go to a whole other world to be with him. It\u2019s too soon to lose him. I know it\u2019s too soon for me to lose Patroklos. I don\u2019t want the fool to fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then I stick with the original plan and do what I can to keep Achilles out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s drink on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good, too.\u201d They clinked their goblets together again and settled in to wait for their men.</p><p>\"By the shaggy testes of satyrs you were right!\u201d Venus paced back and forth across the inner chamber of Hera\u2019s Mount Olympus Temple. The Queen of the Gods\u2019 oracle swirled with images of Odysseus leading the Greeks in charge after victorious charge against the Trojans. \u201cAthena gifted him with something more than her goddessly juices. The man is clearly invincible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you? She never takes lovers so she\u2019s completely enamored with her human plaything,\u201d Hera said, frowning into her oracle.</p><p>\u201cIt just proves what I\u2019ve been saying for eons. She\u2019s incredibly repressed and needs to loosen up. Athena should have been trysting with Odysseus on the beach for years, then this wouldn\u2019t have been such an emotional experience for her.\u201d Venus sighed dramatically. \u201cAnd you know this means there will be absolutely no reasoning with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we were both right. What are we going to do about it? This war needs to end. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really hate to say it, but I think we may as well back the Greeks. Let\u2019s just get this thing over with,\u201d Venus said, frowning into the oracle.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to command your little modern mortal to persuade Achilles to lead his Myrmidons back into battle?\u201d</p><p>Venus hesitated, obviously not wanting to answer her queen.</p><p>\u201cVenus! We are in agreement. You simply must be sure Achilles leads his Myrmidons into the battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d Venus said reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right. We\u2019ve already established that. Now let\u2019s just be sure all of this happens very quickly, before Zeus gets wind of anything. He\u2019s supposed to be staying neutral, which is why we\u2019re supposed to be staying out of it, too,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cBut we all know his weakness for the Trojans, especially for old Priam,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cI know, I know, Zeus started the whole thing by supporting Laomedon against Poseidon all those years ago, though he should have never backed a mortal against the Sea God, but those two are always arguing about something and Zeus is terrible about holding a grudge. I really wish he would\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHera! Wife! Where are you?\u201d Zeus\u2019s voice thundered throughout Olympus.</p><p>Hera jumped guiltily.</p><p>Venus rolled her eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s so demanding. And it\u2019s really rude of him to bellow across Olympus for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Hera hurried to her oracle and waved a hand over it to clear the scene from Troy. \u201cWhen I want him do you think he\u2019s ever to be found? Of course not. But let him have even the smallest need for me and his great blustering voice doesn\u2019t hesitate to search me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should have a word with him,\u201d Venus offered helpfully. \u201cYou know Love has rights other immortals do not. Not even the King of Olympus is above a little marital advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no, thank you, but no. Our marriage is just fine.\u201d</p><p>Venus looked doubtful. \u201cWell, darling, I can tell you that you need to keep him occupied while I work my magic down there.\u201d She made a little gesture at the now blank oracle.</p><p>\u201cHera!\u201d This time Zeus\u2019s voice was much closer.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course! Go. I\u2019ll take care of things here,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cThis will help.\u201d Venus flicked her fingers at Hera, showering the Queen of Olympus in diamond dust that soaked into her skin.</p><p>\u201cWh\u2014\u201d Hera began, then gasped as her body flushed and her nipples instantly hardened.</p><p>\u201cJust a little lustful present from Love to her queen.\u201d Venus winked and then disappeared.</p><p>Body tingling, Hera rushed out of her inner chamber and ran into her husband\u2019s imposing body.</p><p>\u201cZeus! Whatever are you doing sneaking up on me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSneaking! The Supreme Ruler of the Gods does not sneak! And why are you running about guiltily?\u201d he asked, peering over her shoulder into the inner chamber she\u2019d just left.</p><p>\u201cI am not running, and I am certainly guilty of nothing. I was simply answering your summons in a timely manner, as any considerate wife would.\u201d</p><p>Zeus snorted.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bellowing for me and disturbing all of Olympus?\u201d she countered.</p><p>\u201cI could not find you. You weren\u2019t in our throne room. Nor were you in the gardens where you usually walk at this time of day. So I called for you. I did not bellow,\u201d he said petulantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t bellow,\u201d Hera assured him, shifting her mood smoothly and smiling as she waved away the comment. \u201cWhat is it you desire, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen so little of you lately I thought you might enjoy accompanying me on a visit to the ancient world.\u201d</p><p>Hera made a mental note to be much more visible to him\u2014at least until this silly war was over. \u201cAs usual, you are so right, my love,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI have been far too busy lately with my divine duties.\u201d</p><p>He gave a pleased little grunt. \u201cGood. It is decided. You will accompany me to Troy. I hear rumblings that the Greeks have made sudden headway in the war\u2014so sudden that there are rumors of divine interference, even though I have forbidden the Olympians to take an active role in the battle. So.\u201d He held out his arm for her. \u201cLet us visit Troy. Perhaps you and I can have an intimate lunch on the beach after I make quite certain no one has been disobeying me.\u201d</p><p>Hera\u2019s stomach fluttered with panic that she quickly squelched. Drawing on the dusting of lust Venus had sprinkled into her skin, she took his arm and smiled coquettishly up at Zeus, leaning her full breast and its erect nipple against his muscular arm. \u201cI thought you called for me, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d he said, obviously trying not to be moved by his wife\u2019s unusually pliant attitude. \u201cI thought we should go to Troy together\u2014form a combined front.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hera pouted prettily, pursing her full pink lips and giving him a meaningful, sideways glance. \u201cI thought you desired me for something more intimate than travel and official duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do, of course. As I said...\u201d he began, and then stopped speaking as his wife lifted his hand and took his forefinger within the warm pink nest of her mouth and suckled it deeply, flicking the tip of it with her cunning tongue. \u201cAh, wife.\u201d He moaned as her other hand found the hardening thunderbolt between his legs. \u201cI have missed you, and you do please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have just begun to please you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>His need to travel to Troy replaced by a more immediate need, Zeus pulled his wife into his arms, and with a masterful motion transported them instantly to their bedchamber, where she did indeed please him, over and over and over... </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"Patroklos, why can\u2019t you understand?\u201d Achilles said. He\u2019d met his cousin returning from the Greek camp and the two of them were walking side by side down the beach as they argued. \u201cI may have a chance to change my fate, and I intend to take the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do understand.\u201d Patroklos stopped and faced Achilles. \u201cI, too, want your fate to change. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t lead our men in battle. It simply means you need to stay away from Hector. It\u2019s only after you kill him that you\u2019re fated to die.\u201d</p><p>Achilles shook his head. \u201cBattle is as simple as chaos. Saying I simply need to stay away from one of the Trojan warriors is well and good when I\u2019m not possessed by the berserker in the middle of the smoke and blood and confusion of battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you. All the Myrmidons will help you. We\u2019ll be sure Hector gets nowhere near you.\u201d</p> <p>Achilles smiled and cuffed Patroklos playfully. \u201cIf you intend to nursemaid me, how am I supposed to lead anyone in battle?\u201d</p><p>Patroklos moved away and said sharply, \u201cThis is not a jesting matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think I jest about my fate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Patroklos sighed and ran his hand through his hair in frustration. \u201cNor do I take the prophesy lightly. The last thing I want is your death, cousin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve grown accustomed to it.\u201d Patroklos began to protest, but Achilles cut him off. \u201cI\u2019d become accustomed to it, too. I was to die before I saw thirty summers, at the gates of Troy, after I killed Hector, but my name was to live on for centuries. It was the choice I made, and when I was young, glory and the immortality of my name were all I thought of. Then I grew older and understood the nature of what I\u2019d chosen and I knew regret, but my fate was a boulder rolling down a mountainside. I could only travel with it. Then she came and everything began to change.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes! That is exactly my point. Everything is changed now. The goddesses plucked Katrina and Jacqueline\u2019s souls from another world, another time, and brought them here to change everything. How could they then allow your death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because I\u2019d been foolish enough to ignore all that they sent me and blundered heedlessly back into battle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles, you said that today you kept the berserker from possessing you. That had to be a gift from the goddesses. Couldn\u2019t they mean for you to use it in battle? To have the ability to fight and lead us without losing yourself to the berserker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy gift is Katrina. She has enabled me to withstand the berserker. And she will not be going into battle with me. Ever.\u201d He put his hand on his cousin\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI love her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, and I want that to be more than a short span of days.\u201d</p><p>Exasperated, Patroklos shouted, \u201cI love Jacqueline! But that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want to fight for the glory of Greece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would not be fighting for the glory of Greece. You would be fighting for the glory of Agamemnon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how history will remember this war,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>\u201cHistory be damned! I\u2019ve had enough of living for what will or won\u2019t be said of me in the future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe men need your help, Achilles. You could save lives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have saved lives,\u201d Achilles said between gritted teeth as he stared out at the moonlit ocean. \u201cOver and over again Agamemnon has used me to fight his battles. For once I choose to save my own life. For once I have a chance at a future I\u2019ve only dreamed of. I will not throw that away\u2014not for Agamemnon and his greed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t how I see it,\u201d Patroklos said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be fighting for Agamemnon. I\u2019d be fighting for Greece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re foolish enough to take a chance with your life and throw away the goddess-given love with which you\u2019ve been gifted, then fight! I\u2019m not stopping you.\u201d Achilles turned and began walking away down the beach.</p><p>\u201cThe men won\u2019t follow my lead!\u201d Patroklos shouted at his back. \u201cThey\u2019ll only follow you. I am not Achilles!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that you were!\u201d Achilles called over his shoulder. \u201cThen I would gladly live your long, fruitful life, and you could charge onto the battlefield with your hard head to your vainglorious death!\u201d</p> <p>Patroklos watched his cousin stride away and then he picked up a conch shell and, with a cry of frustration, hurled it into the sea. \u201cAnd he calls me hardheaded,\u201d he muttered to himself as he paced back and forth at the edge of the surf. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he\u2019s ever bothered to wear that golden helmet. As damnably thick-skulled as he is no sword could possibly harm him.\u201d The young warrior wanted to howl with anger. Why wouldn\u2019t Achilles see reason? Leading the Greeks one more time into battle\u2014the final battle of the Trojan War\u2014wouldn\u2019t cause his death. The goddesses had changed things. They certainly wouldn\u2019t allow all their efforts to be wasted. And Patroklos was truly grateful. Not only did he believe his cousin would live, but he had found the woman of his dreams. He wasn\u2019t throwing Jacqueline away by wanting to fight. He was embracing his honor. And anyway, she\u2019d be there waiting for him. Afterward she\u2019d bandage his wounds, and take him into her soft body and heal him.</p><p>But there would be no honorable last battle. If Achilles wasn\u2019t there to lead the Myrmidons, they wouldn\u2019t fight, and even with Odysseus\u2019s sudden brilliance on the battlefield the war would continue to drag on and on. \u201cI do wish I was Achilles\u2014just for one day,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>\u201cYou know, darling, that\u2019s not a half-bad idea,\u201d Venus said, as she materialized in a cloud of glittering smoke beside him.</p><p>\u201cGoddess!\u201d Patroklos gasped and dropped to one knee, bowing his head to her.</p><p>\u201cArise, Patroklos, and let me look at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddess?\u201d Patroklos asked, obviously confused, but rising to his feet as she\u2019d commanded.</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d Venus walked a slow circle around the stunned warrior. \u201cYou\u2019re almost the same height and build, clearly you\u2019re related. His body is thicker, of course, and you\u2019re much blonder than he, but under armor that won\u2019t be so noticeable. Plus, I\u2019ll add a little magical this and that. Put on his helmet and the rest of this armor and no one will be able to tell the difference, especially in the heat of battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddess, I don\u2019t understand.\u201d But even as he said the words, Patroklos knew what the Goddess of Love was planning, and his heart beat hard and fast with anticipation.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you, darling? You said you\u2019d like to be Achilles so that you could lead the final charge of the Greeks against the Trojans. I believe I can give you your wish. If it is truly what you wish. Is it young Patroklos?\u201d</p><p>Patroklos wanted to shout with triumph and instantly accept the goddess\u2019s offer, but the golden Olympians were often capricious and their whims could be dangerous and deadly. \u201cWhy do you wish to aid me, Aphrodite?\u201d</p><p>The goddess frowned and the air around them heated, whipping fitfully against Patroklos\u2019s skin in response to her irritation. \u201cCan you Greeks not remember that I prefer to be called Venus?\u201d</p><p>Patroklos bowed his head. \u201cI beg your pardon, Great Goddess. I meant no disrespect.\u201d</p><p>Venus drew a deep breath and the breeze died, returning to pleasant coolness of the seaside night. \u201cOf course you didn\u2019t, darling. I shouldn\u2019t be so touchy. I\u2019ve just been under terrible stress lately. This war is wearing on my nerves, which brings me back to the reason for my little visit and your question. I wish to aid you because the war has gone on long enough. We want it to end. You can help that happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe? So the gods are truly becoming involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually the goddesses are.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos\u2019s eyes widened in understanding. \u201cAthena is aiding Odysseus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things,\u201d Venus mumbled, then cleared her throat delicately. \u201cYes, and I am aiding you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m honored, Great Goddess. But why me? I have never been your supplicant.\u201d He smiled a little shyly. \u201cThe truth is until lately I knew very little of love.\u201d</p><p>Venus touched his cheek and he felt a warm flush of love and happiness rush though his body. \u201cBut you have found love, haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Unable to speak, he nodded.</p><p>\u201cThat is why I\u2019ve chosen you. Newfound love is a powerful emotion. It holds a very special magic. I\u2019ve seen it stave off death, heal souls and thwart fate. I\u2019m going to use the magic of newfound love and your physical resemblance with your cousin. Coupled and blessed by me, those things will allow you to impersonate Achilles just long enough to lead the Myrmidons and the Greek army against the Trojans. You\u2019ll head the charge when the great walls are breached.\u201d</p><p>Excitement shivered over Patroklos and his eyes blazed. \u201cI\u2019ll do it, Goddess! I\u2019ll do it for Greece and for you.\u201d</p><p>Venus inclined her head slightly in acknowledgement of his pledge. \u201cI am pleased. Now all you need is Achilles\u2019 famous armor and my blessing just after dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy cousin keeps his armor in his tent. How do I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me. Love will keep Achilles occupied,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cBut the Myrmidons, how do I rally them without alerting Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimply pass the word amongst the tents tonight that Achilles has called a special training session for the morning. They are to meet here.\u201d Venus gestured around them at where they stood on the beach, halfway between the Greek and Myrmidon camps. \u201cShortly after dawn. Imply that he has become restless. The men are already surprised at his choice to withdraw from the fighting. It will take little to convince them he has returned to his old ways.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos nodded slowly, considering. \u201cTrue, and if Love is keeping Achilles busy in his tent, he won\u2019t hear of the early training session he was supposed to have called.\u201d He grinned. \u201cMy cousin will be truly angered when he finds out he\u2019s been duped.\u201d</p><p>Venus\u2019s smile was blinding in its beauty. \u201cAnd by that time the war will be over and the Greeks victorious. Achilles will be too busy rejoicing and making plans to return to Phthia to be too angry with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my lady, are brilliant,\u201d Patroklos said with a gentlemanly flourish and bow.</p><p>The goddess batted her long-lashed eyes coquettishly. \u201cOf course I am, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Greeks\u2014will they be told Achilles is going to lead the charge?\u201d</p><p>Venus raised a slim brow. \u201cI do believe Odysseus can aid us with spreading word of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it is decided.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is. At dawn I will await you behind your tent.\u201d Venus paused, as another thought came to her. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to get Jacqueline out of the way. She\u2019s a modern woman, and she\u2019d never sit idly by while you led the Greeks into battle.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos nodded and chuckled softly. \u201cJacqueline would not sit idly by ever. She has the body of a sweet maiden and the heart of a brave warrior. She is a most unusual woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she is, but you don\u2019t know many modern mortals. Still it causes a problem for us in the morning. She is truly besotted with you and she won\u2019t...\u201d Venus\u2019s words trailed off as she began to smile.</p><p>\u201cGoddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is so besotted with you that she wishes very much to please you. Before dawn awaken her.\u201d The goddess smiled suggestively. \u201cAwake her thoroughly, and then tell her that second only to her you desire the young, tender clams that the sea exposes at low tide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLow tide?\u201d he said, obviously not understanding.</p><p>Venus sighed. \u201cLow tide will be at dawn. Ask her to dig clams for you while you train with the men. She\u2019ll leave your tent at dawn and be out of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure she\u2019ll do that for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFulfill her first. Pledge your love to her. Then she\u2019ll dig clams for you. Modern mortals are logical. You did something nice for her\u2014she\u2019ll want to do something nice for you.\u201d</p><p>Patroklos smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s really that simple?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it will be after a sprinkle or two of my magic. Now go to her brave Patroklos, and on the morrow be prepared for glory!\u201d Venus clapped her hands together and disappeared in a poof of glittering smoke.</p><p>Patroklos, grinning broadly, kicked into a swift jog, determined to take Jacqueline into his tent and spend the remainder of the night worshipping love.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t difficult to find Athena and Odysseus. It didn\u2019t take the divine magic of being love incarnate to recognize the moans and murmured sighs of the passion they were sharing. Out of consideration, Venus materialized around the curve of the beach inside a grove of slender trees. Quietly she approached the lovers. Athena was lying back on a satin blanket, wearing only a transparent silver robe. Odysseus, completely naked, and, Venus noted with appreciation, much more powerfully endowed than she had imagined, was kissing the arch of the goddess\u2019s foot. Venus hoped Athena had bothered to have the forest nymphs give her a thorough pedicure, and made a mental note to speak with her later about such things.</p><p>Venus cleared her throat.</p><p>Odysseus grabbed his sword and in one quick motion whirled around, crouching defensively in front of Athena.</p><p>Venus raised a brow. \u201cHow deliciously protective you are, darling.\u201d</p><p>Athena was on her feet in an instant, stepping between Odysseus and Venus. \u201cHow dare you interrupt me! You have no right to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, blah.\u201d Venus rolled her eyes. \u201cSave your bluster for the mortals. And I\u2019m not interrupting for long. I just have a quick message for Odysseus.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat do you want with him?\u201d</p><p>Venus\u2019s smile was slow and knowing. \u201cJealousy? How very amusing. Ridiculous, but amusing. But, no, I have no intention of ravishing your lover. Odysseus, darling?\u201d Venus looked around Athena, who continued to glare at her. Odysseus stepped to his goddess\u2019s side, giving Venus a delightful look at his full frontal glory. \u201cGood, there you are. And may I say you are looking quite well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe message!\u201d Athena snapped.</p><p>Venus sighed. \u201cOh all right. It\u2019s just this\u2014Achilles will be leading the Myrmidons into the battle tomorrow morning shortly after dawn.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s fists clenched and his smile was fierce. \u201cI knew he would relent!\u201d Then he turned to Athena and dropped to one knee. \u201cTomorrow my goddess, my love, the Greeks will give you victory over the Trojans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d Athena answered, but her eyes never left Venus. \u201cAnd why would that be happening?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you hadn\u2019t been so preoccupied lately you\u2019d know why.\u201d Venus made a motion for Athena to follow her a few paces away. \u201cIf I could have a word with you in private?\u201d</p><p>Still frowning sternly at the Goddess of Love, Athena told Odysseus, \u201cI\u2019ll be just a moment.\u201d And she followed Venus down the beach. \u201cExplain yourself,\u201d she said when they were beyond his hearing.</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, I must say I told you so. You should have taken him as a lover ages ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy love life is not open for discussion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, I\u2019m not discussing your love life, just your previous lack of one. Anyway this whole thing is rather simple. You\u2019ve been aiding Odysseus, which has basically nullified Achilles\u2019 absence from the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>Athena drew a deep breath, obviously readying herself to launch into an excuse. Venus\u2019s upraised hand silenced her. \u201cOh, save it. I say good for you.\u201d She glanced over Athena\u2019s shoulder where Odysseus waited for his goddess. \u201cActually I say very good for you. But you did mess up our little plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that,\u201d Athena said shortly.</p><p>\u201cSo, Hera and I have altered it. The Greeks might as well win. I mean, it\u2019s not like we actually care. We just want the war to end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cI can see that\u2014so this works out doubly well for you. The Greeks win. Your lover is a Greek. All will be happily ever after. Hey, maybe you can manipulate it so that it takes Odysseus another decade to get home. That way you can have him all to yourself for a lovely long affair.\u201d</p><p>Athena\u2019s gray eyes narrowed again. \u201cWe are not discussing my love life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy Poseidon\u2019s wet buttocks, you\u2019re boring!\u201d Then remembering where she was, Venus glanced nervously out to sea. \u201cSorry darling, you know I said it with love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please stay focused? What about Achilles and his fate? Does this mean he dies tomorrow?\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about that. Achilles will be sleeping safely in his bed. It\u2019ll be Patroklos, plus a little of my magic, who is actually leading the Greeks. But do not share that information with your boyfriend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is not\u2014\u201d Athena blustered.</p><p>\u201cOh, whatever. Just don\u2019t tell him. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow after this whole thing is finally over. Unless you\u2019re otherwise occupied.\u201d Venus blew a kiss at Odysseus, and then she disappeared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Agamemnon\u2019s voluminous tents were filled with celebration. Of course most of the revelers were Agamemnon\u2019s contemporaries\u2014men either too old or too highly placed to be involved in the actual fighting\u2014but one would never know from their toasts and their boasts that they hadn\u2019t been in the thick of the battle. And there were women aplenty. Young, supple war prizes who, if not exactly eager to please, were willing to pretend they were for the advantage such a night might gain them.</p><p>Briseis hated them\u2014every old, shrunken-testicled, rutting goat. Though even as she hated them she shot surreptitious smiles to those she found the least repulsive. Agamemnon could tire of her at any time, and if he did, only one of these soon-to-be corpses would be all that stood between her and whatever peasant warrior managed to fight off his comrades for her.</p><p>What she wouldn\u2019t give to belong to someone as virile as golden Achilles. His scars had never bothered her, and the thought of the berserker had always excited more than frightened her. But when she had belonged to him, he had never so much as glanced at her unless he\u2019d wanted her to fetch wine or food for him. Since he\u2019d allowed Agamemnon to take her, Briseis had cursed herself for not being bolder when she\u2019d had a chance at him. She should have gone to his bed uninvited. She should have thought of bespelling him as Polyxena had.</p><p>\u201cBriseis! More wine!\u201d Agamemnon ordered, reaching down from where he sat on his golden throne to cup her breast and tweak her nipple for the benefit of the watching generals.</p> <p>Briseis wanted to curl her lip and hiss at him like a viper. Instead she arched her back erotically and said huskily, \u201cAnything you wish, my lord.\u201d Then she picked up the large empty wine jug and took her time walking past the other men, stroking the smooth side of the pottery suggestively and allowing them ample opportunity to gaze at her aroused young nipples and fantasize about anything they might wish.</p><p>As soon as she left the tent, Briseis\u2019s sensuous walk disappeared and she moved with the catlike silence she\u2019d perfected when she was just a child. Naturally the bovine warriors who huddled around the wine casks didn\u2019t hear her approach. When she heard his name, she froze in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cAchilles! Truly? Are you certain?\u201d One short coarse-looking man said.</p><p>\u201cI heard from Odysseus himself. It must be truth,\u201d came the reply from a taller, pockmarked soldier.</p><p>\u201cWith Achilles and his Myrmidons leading the charge, victory will be ours tomorrow, brothers!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe he would fight again. I heard that the Trojan princess had cast a spell over him,\u201d said another man.</p><p>\u201cShe only cast a spell here,\u201d the short man said, grabbing his genitals and thrusting his hips up, \u201cand not here.\u201d With his other hand he lifted his sword and swung it in a singing arch around his head. All the men laughed.</p><p>Briseis stepped out of the shadows. \u201cAgamemnon wishes more wine. Fill this for me,\u201d she said coldly and held out the jug.</p><p>The short man took it and said, \u201cI\u2019ll fill it for you.\u201d His lingering gaze said that he would love to fill her as he did the jug, but Briseis knew that as long as she was Agamemnon\u2019s war prize none of the men would speak openly of their lust. Agamemnon could do anything he wished to her, his men could not.</p><p>He handed her back the jug, eyes staring at her erect nipples plainly visible through her transparent robes. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d she asked him.</p><p>He smiled, showing rotting teeth. \u201cAentoclus, my lady.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAentoclus, if you ever so much as look my way again, I will tell Agamemnon that you tried to rape me, and I will ask my lover, your king, to bring me your testicles in retribution.\u201d While the warrior blanched a sickly pale color, Briseis smiled and walked away, holding the jug carefully so that it didn\u2019t splash wine on her clothing.</p><p>She quickly went back to Agamemnon\u2019s side, this time ignoring the appreciative looks of the generals. She refilled his goblet and leaned into the king\u2019s side, whispering to him, \u201cI have news of Achilles.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon\u2019s shrewd gaze darted briefly to meet hers and what he saw there made him clap his hands together and command, \u201cMore music and dancing!\u201d The music flared as pubescent girls clothed only in gold chains undulated through the tent, pulling the attention of the men from their king.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you heard?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cAchilles and the Myrmidons are leading the charge tomorrow,\u201d she whispered, nuzzling his ear.</p><p>She felt the jolt of shock that went through his body. \u201cYou are quite sure about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdysseus himself is passing the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf this is true...\u201d His arm tightened around her. \u201cYou are a jewel of rare price, my dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am your jewel, my lord. Always your jewel.\u201d Briseis smiled smugly and snuggled into his side, sneaking one soft hand down to stroke the inside of his thigh. No, he would not tire of her. It didn\u2019t matter what she had to do, she would remain Agamemnon\u2019s war prize, even when they returned to Greece.</p><p>\u201cKalchas!\u201d Agamemnon lifted his voice over the sensuous beat of drums.</p><p>\u201cHere, my lord.\u201d The old prophet seemed to materialize out of the air itself.</p><p>Just like a poisonous mist, Briseis thought, although she always kept her disgust for the revolting old man carefully hidden. He was a favorite of Agamemnon\u2019s and Briseis was far too cunning to make an enemy of him.</p><p>\u201cFetch Ajax to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAjax, my lord?\u201d</p><p>Briseis noted the generals overhearing Agamemnon\u2019s command looked similarly confused, as they should. Ajax was brilliant on the field of battle. Off the field of battle he could hardly put together a complete thought. The man was literally as big and strong and stupid as an ox.</p><p>\u201cYes, Ajax. I had a dream last night that he was key to a great victory tomorrow. I wish to tell him of the dream and of the reward I plan to gift him with for his heroic actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d Kalchas bowed and scuttled from the tent.</p><p>The generals who had overheard smiled and nodded at their king. Dreams were sent by the gods, and seeing their king acting on one of his was something of which they all approved.</p><p>Of course Briseis knew Agamemnon was lying. The only thing he\u2019d dreamed of the night before had been her open thighs. He\u2019d told her so that morning as, upon waking, he\u2019d put his face between them.</p><p>She nuzzled his ear again and whispered, \u201cWhat are you up to, my lord?\u201d</p><p>In one swift motion Agamemnon pulled her onto his lap so that she straddled him and his erection pushed intimately between her spread legs. She leaned into him and, veiled by her hair, he spoke, \u201cIf tomorrow Achilles fights the Trojans, it will be his last battle, as well as the day we are finally victorious. I have waited almost ten summers for the damned prophesy of his death to come true, and I will wait no more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I hear from my sources in the Myrmidon camp that they believe Polyxena is thwarting the prophesy. Perhaps that is true\u2014you know even Poseidon\u2019s minions could not kill her.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon bit her neck and whispered, \u201cAll Achilles need do is to kill Hector and his death will follow. Zeus has proclaimed it. Not even an oracle protected by a goddess can change that. Polyxena has been keeping him from the battlefield, and thus away from Hector. Perhaps Achilles\u2019 arrogance has led him to believe his little oracle can somehow protect him on the battlefield. I\u2019m simply going to be sure Hector\u2019s path to Achilles is clear and then let fate take over.\u201d</p><p>Briseis laughed huskily. \u201cMy lord, you are brilliant!\u201d Then she moaned and rocked against his hardness, closing her eyes and pretending she straddled the strong young body of a warrior.</p><p>\"The spell couldn\u2019t be that simple,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cI keep telling you\u2014it isn\u2019t a spell, it\u2019s self-hypnotism, and it is that simple. And that complex. The mind is amazing. It alone can make a person believe he\u2019s sick, or better yet, believe he is perfectly well when he should be sick. I\u2019ve seen some miraculous things in the ten-plus years I\u2019ve been in practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this self-hypnotism, which is not a spell but seems very much like a spell, can actually help me keep the berserker at bay,\u201d he said, taking a thick strand of Kat\u2019s hair, wrapping it around his finger, and then bringing it to his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sable\u2019s pelt. I\u2019ll never tire of touching it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got lucky,\u201d Kat said, tilting her head so that he could touch her hair more easily. \u201cPolyxena had a seriously nice head of hair.\u201d</p><p>Achilles smiled. \u201cI forget that this body has not always been yours. What color was your hair before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlond. It wasn\u2019t long like this, but it was pretty good hair, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would be beautiful in any form to me,\u201d he said, and kissed her lips gently.</p><p>\u201cThat is a very sweet thing to say. But you\u2019re not going to get me off subject so easily. Yes, self-hypnotism, which is not like a spell at all, can help you learn to control your body and your emotions so that you can keep both relaxed enough, no matter what is going on with you, to avoid the triggers that cause the berserker to possess you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, and then our son will not accidentally trigger me to be possessed by the berserker when he believes he cannot possibly drown because he is the grandson of a sea goddess,\u201d Achilles said, looking into her eyes.</p><p>Trapped in the blue depths of his soul, Kat saw a future where she lived and loved at this amazing man\u2019s side and she knew she would want his babies\u2014she\u2019d want them, and their grandchildren, and whatever was the ancient and magical Greek world\u2019s equivalent of the traditional family and the picket fence. Hell, she even wanted the damn dog. She wanted it all. \u201cAnd what if he is a she?\u201d</p><p>Achilles blinked, obviously not having considered this as a possibility. Then he snorted and his lips twitched up in his little almost smile. \u201cI suppose I will have to double my practice of self-hypnotism then\u2014or perhaps not practice it at all. Would becoming a berserker be a good or bad thing when suitors try to woo my daughter from me?\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cI think control is still the key here. If he shows up sagging or wearing emo pants and eyeliner, we let the berserker loose. If he looks like a good kid, you just growl and scare him a little.\u201d Achilles\u2019 brow knitted together in confusion. Kat laughed. \u201cHow about this\u2014you only eat the suitors we don\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at her. \u201cNot even the berserker actually eats people.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her brow.</p><p>\u201cWell, not usually he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Achilles amended.</p><p>Kat was just trying to decide if she really wanted to question Achilles further about the whole \u201cusually he doesn\u2019t eat people\u201d thing when a woman\u2019s shriek carried clearly into their tent. Achilles had just leapt to his feet when the shriek was followed by gales of giggles. He\u2019d taken one hesitant step toward the tent flap when Kat grabbed his hand and pulled him back to bed.</p><p>\u201cAs embarrassing as it is to admit, that is Jacqueline. And, no, she doesn\u2019t need rescuing.\u201d</p><p>Achilles sat back down on the bed beside her. \u201cIs she always that loud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s her \u2018oh, baby, I think I just won the lottery shriek and giggle.\u2019 Which means that I can tell you with one-hundred-percent accuracy Patroklos is not still pissed off at you. He is out there giving Jacky the time of her life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d Achilles grunted. \u201cThe boy is certainly causing a ruckus. He and Jacqueline should be quieter\u2014more reserved.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cAchilles, you are a stodgy old spinster. My god, listen to you\u2014you sound about a hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a spinster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think Hera and Athena accused Jacky and me of being spinsters just because we\u2019re, well, old. You, Mr. Hero Warrior, are actually an old fuddy-dud, without being old.\u201d More giggles drifted through the tent to them, this time punctuated by a deeply sensuous and insistent male voice. \u201cAnd he,\u201d Kat jerked her chin in the direction of the tent flap, \u201cis definitely no \u2018boy.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you lusting after my young cousin?\u201d Achilles asked, blue eyes sparkling.</p><p>\u201cHow about I answer that question after I get all the details from Jacky tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a tease,\u201d Achilles said and, growling playfully, he pulled her back on the bed with him.</p><p>\u201cYep, and you are a spinster,\u201d Kat said, pretending to struggle.</p><p>\u201cWould a spinster do this?\u201d Achilles bent and covered her mouth with his. The kiss was not wild and out of control. He remembered to pace himself\u2014to monitor his breathing and be sure that lust didn\u2019t overwhelm him and bring on the berserker. But that didn\u2019t mean the kiss wasn\u2019t deep and passionate and an intimate promise of more to come.</p><p>When he finally lifted his mouth from hers, Kat was breathless. \u201cIf I take back the whole spinster thing, will that mean you\u2019re going to stop kissing me like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Achilles whispered.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it, because I don\u2019t want you to ever stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t my Katrina, my princess...\u201d</p><p>And Achilles made love to her. Slowly, languorously, letting her body serve as his blueprint he built her pleasure, one touch at a time, until they both found completion.</p><p>As Kat drifted to sleep in his arms she thought that having a man who loved her slowly and carefully was the most erotic experience of her life.</p><p>Venus materialized inside the dim tent after the lovers were deeply asleep. Moving silently as a shade, she brushed the bed curtain aside and smiled down at Achilles and Katrina. True love, she thought happily. I knew this woman was meant for somethingspecial the first instant I saw her\u2014and Love is never wrong.</p><p>Then she raised her hands over the couple and whispered the spell:</p><p>Achilles, hero and warrior, I want you to sleep</p><p>Well into the morning, soundless, replete.</p><p>Wake when the sun is high in the sky.</p><p>What Love commands, you cannot deny.</p><p>From her raised hand a waterfall of diamond dust sprinkled over Achilles\u2019 body. The warrior smiled and drifted deeply into Love\u2019s magical embrace.</p><p>Sighing with self-satisfaction, Venus left their bedside, easily finding the place where Achilles\u2019 famous armor lay discarded in the corner of the tent. With a slight flick of her wrist, she and the armor disappeared. Venus had one more stop to make to sprinkle a little conciliatory magic on stubborn Jacqueline, and then she had only to wait till dawn when she would meet Patroklos, clothe him in Achilles\u2019 borrowed armor and a touch of her power and then this whole war issue would be dealt with. Venus sighed again... It was always work, work, work. When this was over she definitely would treat herself to a much deserved vacation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacky came awake slowly. She was having the most deliciously erotic dream. Spike (from season six of Buffy, so he was still the Big Bad) had his glorious cheekbones between her caffe latte thighs and he was putting that beautiful mouth to excellent use. She\u2019d always believed there was a whole other world in that mouth...</p><p>She jolted awake.</p><p>There was, indeed, a beautiful blond man\u2019s face between her legs, but her thighs were young, too damn skinny and too, too damn white. Not that that little fact really mattered much to her at that moment.</p><p>\u201cPatroklos...\u201d she murmured. He looked up at her and paused briefly in his work.</p> <p>\u201cYes, my beauty. Are you awake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost,\u201d she said sleepily, considerately spreading her legs so that he fitted more comfortably between them. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you see if you can bring me the rest of the way awake?\u201d As he got back to business, Jacky thought it was like he\u2019d been blessed by the Goddess of Love herself, which, she realized, might truly be possible and made a mental note to thank Venus. Then Jacky found that she was having trouble thinking at all...</p><p>\"Psst! Kat! Wake the hell up.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s eyelids fluttered. God, was she having an awful dream? She could swear Jacky was bending over her, shaking her with one hand while she carried a wooden bucket (bucket?) in the other.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d she rasped to what she hoped was a dream apparition. \u201cI\u2019m calling in sick\u2014crazy people be damned. Let them counsel themselves today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGet up, fool. You\u2019re not dreaming. I got somethin\u2019 to do and you\u2019re comin\u2019 with me.\u201d Jacky snapped back the bed sheets, exposing all of Kat\u2019s naked body. \u201cDamn, you\u2019re young,\u201d she said, studying her friend.</p><p>Kat rolled out of bed and snatched up her underrobe. \u201cDo you mind? You do not need to see all my business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I know all your business. By the by, your thighs are much thinner in this life than they had gotten in the last one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline. Your ass is narrow.\u201d</p><p>Jacky sucked air and got ready to launch into an all out assault when a deep snore made both of them turn to statues. Kat looked slowly back at the mound of bedclothes and the naked man. Jacky tiptoed and peeked over her shoulder.</p><p>Achilles lay on his side, his torso and one scarred but distinctly muscled thigh poking nakedly from the crisp linen sheets. Kat turned back to Jacky and put her finger against her lips. \u201cShh!\u201d She snatched up the rest of her clothes and grabbed Jacky\u2019s hand, hauling her from the tent. Outside Kat looked incredulously up at a sky that was just beginning to show a hint of rosy dawn\u2019s fingertips. \u201cWhat in the holy hell are you doing: one\u2014awake at this insane hour, and two\u2014waking me up, too?\u201d</p> <p>Jacky glanced at the sky and then back at her BFF. Then she fidgeted.</p><p>\u201cOh no, no, no. You woke me up for a really, really stupid reason,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you holding a bucket?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to get somethin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, somethin\u2019 for Patroklos,\u201d Jacky mumbled.</p><p>\u201cPardon moi?\u201d</p> <p>Jacky cleared her throat. \u201cSomethin\u2019 for Patroklos,\u201d she repeated, this time so that Kat could hear her.</p><p>\u201cYou want to get something for Blondie Bear. So explain why my sleep is being disturbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him Blondie Bear. I\u2019ve decided I adore him for himself, and not for his fortuitous resemblance to Spike. And you have to come with me because you\u2019re my best friend and you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s that embarrassing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we drink this early?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my professional nursing opinion in the ancient world it\u2019s healthier to drink wine than water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich means yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefinitely. I\u2019ll grab a wineskin on our way out the camp,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cAre there any fried swine sandwiches ready, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready thought of that.\u201d She pointed to a cheesecloth-wrapped packet nestled inside the bucket.</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll go with your silly ass.\u201d Then Kat hesitated and glanced back at Achilles\u2019 quiet tent. \u201cBut how long are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please. Your boy is sleepin\u2019 like a drugged old woman in a rest home. He\u2019ll be out for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, fine. I\u2019m coming.\u201d Kat followed Jacky as she grabbed a wineskin from the table by the banked campfire. There was no one around except a sleeping maidservant, and she didn\u2019t move when the two of them trudged from camp. \u201cAnd for your information, the simile is supposed to be sleeping like a baby, not like a drugged old woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKat, you need to spend more time in a hospital setting. Babies sleep like shit. Drugged old women sleep for days. Get a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now you\u2019re being fresh. Maybe I should just go back\u2014\u201d Kat began but Jacky grabbed her hand.</p><p>\u201cSorry\u2014sorry. Ignore me. I haven\u2019t had coffee since I\u2019ve been white. It\u2019s made me a little cranky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacqueline, where are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo dig clams.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? It sounded like you said something about digging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. Don\u2019t steamers sound good to you? Lots of butter?\u201d</p><p>Kat stared at Jacky and almost tripped over a tuft of sea grass. \u201cWait. Are you telling me you\u2019re digging clams for Patroklos? To eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe. We are digging clams for Patroklos to eat.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s giggle started in little bursts, but every time she looked at Jacky the bursts got bigger and bigger until Jacky glared at her while she wiped her eyes and gasped for air.</p><p>\u201cWhat!\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014are\u2014cooking\u2014for\u2014a\u2014man,\u201d Kat said between fits of laughter.</p><p>\u201cAm not. This is almost exactly like going to the grocery to buy the stuff so that someone else can cook for my man whilst he and I sit back and enjoy dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, poor deluded girl,\u201d Kat said, only semisuccessfully controlling her hilarity. \u201cLet Dr. Kat help you. Honey,\u201d she said slowly, like she was talking to a second grader. \u201cYou are actually hunting and gathering, and coming precariously close to being domesticated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, I just saw you naked. You are scrawny. I do believe I could kick your ass.\u201d</p><p>Kat burst into giggles again.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Jacky added, \u201cyou need a good bikini wax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Kat asked innocently. \u201cAre you sure? Could you take a closer look for me?\u201d she said as she pretended to hike up her robes. \u201cThis body is new and I really don\u2019t know what\u2019s what with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Jesus wept, do not lift your goddamn skirt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really, nurse. I think I feel a burning sensation. Can you check it out for me, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the nastiest thing I know,\u201d Jacky said, trying not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you lurve lurve lurve me!\u201d Kat said hoisting up her skirts and dancing around like a cancan girl.</p><p>\u201cWould you stop messing around? My man wants some steamers and that, along with the best sex he\u2019s ever known in his virile young life, is just what I\u2019m going to give him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey Miss Smartie, do you even know how to dig for clams?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you even ask me that question? My people grew up near the water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you grew up with me near the center of the country in Tulsa. Hello. No ocean there.\u201d</p><p>Jacky drew herself up to her full, yet miniscule height, and Kat thought how funny it was that she could be plunked into a body the direct opposite of hers, and still retain so much of her innate gestures and expressions and just plain physical stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cI Googled clam digging for that last vacation we were going to take. You know the one\u2014before we died?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I do have a vague memory.\u201d She frowned. \u201cBut in the Cayman Islands I didn\u2019t remember anything saying we had to dig for our own food. Hell, we weren\u2019t even supposed to have to get up to get our own drinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, I did some research. Follow my lead and all will be well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, what\u2019s Patroklos doing right now?\u201d Kat asked.</p><p>\u201cSleeping.\u201d Jacky\u2019s smile was slow and totally nasty. \u201cDid you know there\u2019s a whole other world waiting to be discovered\u2014by me\u2014in that man\u2019s mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis mornin\u2019 he woke me up with his face between my legs. I thought I\u2019d died, again, and this time there was no question about whether or not I was in heaven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to imagine that I may have been likewise awakened had you not messed that up for me,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cRelax. Your boy did not look like he was up to any calisthenics this morning. Let him recover, hussy. Anyway this shouldn\u2019t take long. When we get back you can slip into bed beside him and see if you get lucky. By the way, I did notice Achilles has a nice, long length of thigh.\u201d</p><p>Kat waggled her eyebrows. \u201cThat\u2019s not the only long length he has.\u201d</p><p>Jacky laughed, then she caught Kat\u2019s gaze. \u201cWe\u2019re completely in love with them, aren\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s very odd,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d Kat said. \u201cYou know, I think I\u2019m going to miss champagne almost as much as hot running water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you could squander your wish on a lifetime supply of champagne,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cMy wish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, as soon as the war\u2019s over the goddesses owe us each a wish.\u201d</p><p>Kat blinked. \u201cWell, shit. I forgot all about that.\u201d Then she raised a brow at her friend. \u201cYou want me to squander my wish on champagne so you can drink it, too, without having to wish for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes me sound very shallow, Katrina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, definitely.\u201d They\u2019d reached the receded shoreline and Jacky started tying up her skirts, motioning for Kat to do the same. \u201cOkay, this is easy. We just feel around with our toes out there where the low tide has exposed all that naked sand to find the clams. Then we dump them in the bucket and take them to a menial to cook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, but if something tries to eat me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. I\u2019ll press your panic button or scream for Achilles. But don\u2019t worry about it. His mama said she\u2019d make sure nothin\u2019 from the sea attacks you again. Hey, now that I think about it, it\u2019ll probably be very cool having a goddess for a mother-in-law.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Sadly for you, I hear Patroklos\u2019s mom is a Harpy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus wept! Are you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned at her and started digging around in the smooshy wet sand. \u201cWould I do that?\u201d</p><p>Jacky had been right. The clams practically leapt into their bucket, which made them wonder if Achilles\u2019 sea goddess mom might be lending them a little unseen hand. So it was barely a couple hours past dawn when the two of them, well fortified by swine sandwiches and an abundance of wine, started to meander slowly back to camp.</p><p>And then the day exploded.</p><p>\u201cWonder what\u2019s up with him?\u201d Kat asked, pointing to a warrior who was coming in a flat run down the beach.</p><p>Jacky shaded her eyes and squinted to get a better look. She shrugged. \u201cPatroklos mentioned something about the men training early today. Maybe they\u2019re starting a new sprint-down-the-beach drill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTraining early? Really? Weird that Achilles didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps his mouth was too busy with other things last night,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>Kat opened her own mouth to agree totally, with some juicy girlfriend details added in, when the runner caught sight of them and instantly changed direction to head straight for them.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cCrap,\u201d Kat said in agreement.</p><p>The warrior reached them. Kat recognized him as Diomedes, Aetnia\u2019s man. He was gasping for breath, but his words were still sickeningly clear. \u201cPrincess, you and Melia must come. It\u2019s Patroklos. He is dying.\u201d</p><p>Jacky grabbed Kat\u2019s hand. \u201cTake me to him. Now,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>The warrior reversed his path, slowing his pace so that he wouldn\u2019t outdistance the two women. Kat wanted to ask what had happened, but she didn\u2019t have any breath to waste on words. Obviously neither did the silent and stone-faced woman who ran beside her. It seemed to take forever, but they finally got back to the Myrmidon camp and Patroklos\u2019s tent. Kat looked at the somber, blood-spattered men surrounding the tent and her heart sank.</p><p>She and Jacky entered the tent to find Patroklos lying on the wide bed, drenched in fresh blood, with Kalchas hovering over him like a carrion bird.</p><p>\u201cGet away from him,\u201d Jacky snapped, shoving the skinny old man aside. \u201cOh, god, no.\u201d Was all Kat heard Jacky say, and then her friend was all business. She glanced up at the two warriors standing bedside. \u201cHelp me get him out of this armor.\u201d They obeyed her automatically, pulling off armor that had turned from gold to a damp scarlet.</p><p>Kat felt a rush of sickness as she got a clearer view of Patroklos\u2019s nasty neck wound. He was bleeding from several lacerations on other parts of his body, but it was his neck that looked particularly terrible. Jacky bent over him, prodding and poking. Without looking up, Jacky spoke to her. \u201cYou have to find me something like a straw. It can\u2019t collapse, but it can\u2019t be too much bigger than a straw. Hurry, Kat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find something.\u201d Kat paused only long enough to squeeze her friend\u2019s arm and then she ran from the tent.</p><p>When she saw Odysseus approaching she could have cried with relief.</p><p>\u201cIs he dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet, but I\u2019m afraid he will be unless you help me with something,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cAnything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need a reed, or anything about this long and hollowed out like this.\u201d Kat showed him with her hands. \u201cIt can\u2019t be flimsy or too flexible\u2014it can\u2019t collapse. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. This way.\u201d He turned on his heel and Kat scrambled to keep up with him as he hurried toward the dunes. \u201cLucky it\u2019s midsummer. They\u2019re too weak during the spring, and too brittle during the winter, but this time of year they may work.\u201d Odysseus seemed to be talking more to himself than to her as he searched through the grasses. \u201cWe thought it was him, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHim?\u201d Kat was barely listening. She just wished she knew what the reed looked like so she could help him.</p><p>\u201cAchilles. We thought Patroklos was Achilles\u2014even I believed it. That\u2019s what Athena had told me.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked carefully at his face. Odysseus appeared uncharacteristically angry\u2014almost like he was pissed at his goddess. She touched his arm and his attention went from the reeds he was pawing through to her. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know about this ruse, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Achilles?\u201d</p><p>That took her aback. \u201cHe should be around here with you, or at least with his men. I got up before he did this morning, but I thought he\u2019d be with the Myrmidons.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus stared at her for a long minute, before finally saying, \u201cIt\u2019s true. You had nothing to do with it. You don\u2019t know what Patroklos did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdysseus! Enough of this\u2014what happened!\u201d</p><p>The famous warrior faced her, locking her in his intelligent gaze. \u201cThis morning Patroklos donned the armor of Achilles. He had to have had a goddess\u2019s touch, because the boy was Achilles. We followed him onto the battlefield\u2014we all followed him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"No!\u201d Kat gasped. What the hell was he thinking? He wasn\u2019t supposed to fight without Achilles.</p><p>\u201cHe got tired of waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so he put on Achilles\u2019 armor and pretended to be him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was more than that. Patroklos was Achilles. He looked like him\u2014moved like him\u2014fought like him. He sounded like him. Even after he was cut down, I believed he was Achilles.\u201d</p> <p>Kat\u2019s body felt numb and tingly at the same time. \u201cAnd Patroklos managed it all on his own? They\u2019re cousins, but they don\u2019t look that much alike. We\u2019ve been goddess-dupped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena lied to me.\u201d</p><p>The depth of betrayal in his voice shocked Kat. \u201cMy guess is that there was more than one goddess in on this scheme.\u201d And then another, more terrible thought slammed into her. \u201cOdysseus, who cut down Patroklos?\u201d</p><p>She knew the answer before he spoke it.</p><p>\u201cIt was your brother, Hector.\u201d</p> <p>Kat\u2019s knees went to water and she sat straight down on the dune. \u201cOh, god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector is still alive, Princess,\u201d Odysseus said kindly.</p><p>\u201cHow could this have happened...\u201d she said, putting her face in her hands.</p><p>\u201cAjax. It was as if he was possessed. He bellowed a challenge to Hector saying that Achilles had finally come for him, and then he cleared a path between the two warriors. Hector killed him just before he and Patroklos began to battle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. Achilles wasn\u2019t going to fight Hector\u2014he wasn\u2019t going to fight anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to fight Hector now,\u201d Odysseus said grimly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Patroklos dies, Achilles will exact vengeance for his death.\u201d</p><p>Kat stared at Odysseus, almost uncomprehending, and then a terrible shiver skittered through her body. \u201cPatroklos can\u2019t die. Find the reed and get it back to Jacky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky?\u201d</p><p>Kat shook her head, as if trying to clear it. \u201cMelia\u2014I meant Melia. Get the reed to her.\u201d She stood up, forcing her legs to work. \u201cI\u2019m going to find Achilles.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus touched her arm. \u201cBe careful, Princess. Achilles is not the berserker, and the berserker is not human. He will kill you\u2014never doubt that fact.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded tightly and started to turn away, but his words stopped her.</p><p>\u201cI know you and Melia are not what you seem, but unless you are immortal do not think you can defeat the berserker.\u201d</p> <p>She met his gaze for another moment before sprinting off. Her mind was totally focused on one thing\u2014Achilles. She knew where he was. The weird way he\u2019d slept through Jacky\u2019s wake-up call made sense now.</p><p>Kat burst through the tent flap. The inside was cool and dimly lit\u2014and Achilles hadn\u2019t moved since she\u2019d left with Jacky. She hesitated, looking down at his sleeping face. He was so peaceful, utterly relaxed and sprawled across the bed. His golden hair had fallen over part of his face, obscuring his scars and making him look so young that for a second she couldn\u2019t breathe. She knew everything would change after she woke him, and she didn\u2019t want to shatter things\u2014she didn\u2019t want to shatter him. Kat smoothed the hair away from his face and he didn\u2019t stir. She kissed his cheek and his lips tilted briefly up. Then she shook his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, you have to wake up.\u201d</p><p>She had to shake him hard before he rolled over groggily and blinked up at her.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cKatrina, I was dreaming of you.\u201d</p><p>The sweet look on his face made her stomach hurt. She braced herself and kept her voice calm and steady. \u201cYou have to come with me. There\u2019s been an accident and Patroklos has been hurt.\u201d</p><p>She watched him shake off the last of whatever had kept him asleep all morning.</p><p>\u201cHow bad is it?\u201d he asked as he pulled on his clothes and started for the door.</p><p>\u201cAchilles.\u201d She caught his arm and he paused to look down at her. \u201cIt\u2019s bad. You need to ready yourself. Patroklos is going to need you, and not the berserker. There is no battle here to fight,\u201d she said slowly and distinctly.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, I understand,\u201d he said a little impatiently. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn his tent. Remember,\u201d she added in a low voice as she hurried outside with him, \u201cJacky is a nurse\u2014a very talented healer. So it\u2019s going to look bad, but...\u201d</p><p>Her voice faltered and she was unable to speak the lie. She couldn\u2019t tell Achilles that Jacky could save Patroklos. Then she realized that she needn\u2019t have been worried about what she said or didn\u2019t say to him. Achilles hadn\u2019t heard her. He was striding to Patroklos\u2019s tent and she had to jog to keep up with him. When he saw the blood-spattered Myrmidons standing in full armor around the tent, silent and grim faced, Kat felt the shock that went through his body as if it were her own. He paused before he ducked inside the tent, bowing his head and taking several long, deep breaths. She touched his arm and his gaze met hers.</p><p>\u201cNo battle here to fight,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cNo battle here to fight,\u201d she repeated, as if the words held power.</p><p>They entered the tent. Achilles took two steps toward the bed and then the wet, awful sound of breath gurgling through blood hit both of them and he stopped as if he\u2019d walked into an invisible wall.</p><p>Jacky glanced up. Her eyes went quickly from Achilles to Kat. \u201cDid you bring it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOdysseus is getting a reed,\u201d Kat assured her. \u201cHe should be here any second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it yesterday,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a sword wound. He\u2014they\u2019ve been in battle,\u201d Achilles said as he lurched forward to the side of the bed, inadvertently kicking a section of the discarded bloody armor. He glanced down. Kat saw the question cross his face, and then his eyes widened in recognition. \u201cHe was wearing my armor.\u201d</p><p>To Kat Achilles\u2019 voice sounded dead, but it somehow reached Patroklos. He opened his eyes and his gaze went immediately to Achilles.</p><p>\u201cBy the gods, what have you done?\u201d Achilles said, reaching for his cousin\u2019s hand.</p><p>Patroklos couldn\u2019t speak. All he could do was struggle to breathe. His bloody lips formed the words Forgive me, and then his eyes rolled to show their whites before they fluttered closed.</p><p>\u201cHe wore my armor and led them into battle,\u201d Achilles said in his dead voice as he watched the unconscious Patroklos try to breathe.</p><p>\u201cWe thought he was you, my lord,\u201d Diomedes said from a shadowy corner of the tent.</p><p>Kat saw his eyes flash up at the warrior, and Diomedes moved his shoulders restlessly. \u201cEveryone thought he was you. Even Hector thought he was battling you until he knocked off his helmet. Then he stopped and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHector!\u201d</p><p>Kat had never heard anything like the coldness in Achilles\u2019 voice. It chilled her through to her soul.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord. It was Hector,\u201d Diomedes said.</p><p>\u201cSo Hector has killed him,\u201d Achilles said in the same, emotionless tone.</p><p>\u201cNot yet he hasn\u2019t,\u201d Jacky snapped. \u201cDon\u2019t say that kind of crap. He might be able to hear you.\u201d She didn\u2019t spare a glance for Achilles, but looked at Kat instead. \u201cI need the reed. Now. If Odysseus has it you have to go get him.\u201d</p><p>Kat nodded and started back toward the tent flap, almost as reluctant to leave Achilles as she was freaked out by what would happen if she didn\u2019t get Odysseus and the reed.</p><p>\u201cGo. Find him,\u201d said Achilles\u2019 strange, cold voice. \u201cGet what she needs.\u201d</p><p>Kat had just turned when Odysseus entered the tent. Breathing hard he rushed to Jacky and handed her several long, hollow reeds of slightly differing, strawlike sizes.</p><p>\u201cWill these do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll have to,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>And Patroklos stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cPatroklos! Cousin!\u201d Achilles shouted, and began shaking his shoulder, much as Kat had done to awaken him moments before.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Jacky commanded. \u201cOdysseus, get Achilles out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not\u2014\u201d Achilles began to roar.</p><p>Kat moved to his side and touched his arm. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping him like this.\u201d</p><p>Achilles looked wildly down at her.</p><p>Kat kept her voice calm. \u201cThere is no battle here, Achilles.\u201d She glanced quickly at Odysseus. \u201cTake him out of here.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus nodded, approaching Achilles carefully. \u201cMy friend, you must\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need this room cleared, now!\u201d Jacky\u2019s no-nonsense voice broke in. \u201cEveryone out except the princess.\u201d</p><p>Kat saw that Achilles was set to argue, and she stepped between him and the bed. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for this, and no way we\u2019d be able to deal with the berserker in here. If there\u2019s a chance of her saving him, you need to get out of here and keep yourself under control.\u201d</p><p>Kat held her breath as she watched Achilles\u2019 jaw tighten and his turquoise eyes darken in anger, but he gave a stiff nod and, followed by Odysseus and Diomedes, left the tent.</p><p>Kat turned back to the bed in time to catch a wad of clean linens Jacky had tossed at her.</p><p>\u201cClimb up on the bed beside him. Try to keep the blood wiped up and out of my way,\u201d Jacky said as she hastily inspected the reeds Odysseus had given her. Choosing one, she bent over Patroklos, a small sharp knife closing on his throat.</p><p>Kat clenched her teeth against rush after rush of nausea while she assisted Jacky in the tracheotomy. It seemed to take days, but logic told Kat that only minutes had passed when Patroklos\u2019s chest began to rise and fall gently again. Kat drew a deep, relieved breath\u2014then she looked at Jacky who was still pale and grim lipped.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s breathing now. Isn\u2019t he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s temporary. His neck\u2019s sustained a lot of damage. This is a Band-Aid on a dam. It\u2019s not going to last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we have to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet him to a hospital. With real doctors, and real medicine, and real surgery.\u201d Jacky wiped her wet brow with her sleeve. Kat noticed her hands were shaking. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna die, Kat. There\u2019s nothin\u2019 I can do to stop it. Not here\u2014not now.\u201d She pressed the back of her hand against her mouth to try to stifle a sob.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, hell, no. He is not going to die, not because of some meddling, goddess-be-damned scheme.\u201d Kat opened the heart locket that dangled from the chain around her neck and shouted into it, \u201cVenus! It\u2019s an emergency. I need you now!\u201d Kat held her breath, praying silently, Please, oh please show up.</p><p>In the center of the room a cloud of diamond dust exploded, and Venus stepped from the fading glitter. \u201cDarling, what is it? I was sure Thetis said there wouldn\u2019t be any more nasty sea surprises.\u201d The goddess\u2019s gaze traveled up and down Kat\u2019s decidedly uninjured form. \u201cBut you look perfectly healthy. Katrina, you know I adore you, but you really shouldn\u2019t waste\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me. It\u2019s Patroklos,\u201d Kat interrupted, pointing at the bed behind Venus.</p><p>The goddess turned and then gasped. \u201cNo! This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u201d</p><p>Kat stepped up beside her. \u201cYou knew he was taking Achilles\u2019 place,\u201d she said.</p><p>Venus\u2019s beautiful eyes filled with tears. \u201cIt was a good idea. Patroklos leads the Greeks to victory pretending to be your Achilles. The war is over, and Achilles lives.\u201d The goddess shook her head sadly at Jacky. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean for him to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave him,\u201d Jacky said in a low, strained voice.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Kat said. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t mean for him to get hurt then you should save him.\u201d</p><p>Venus approached Patroklos\u2019s battered body. She pressed her hand on his forehead and closed her eyes. A shudder passed through her and she made a small, painful sound. \u201cHe\u2019s going to die. This is beyond my powers to heal. It\u2019s fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Jacky yelled. \u201cYou changed fate before. Kat and I died, but you snatched our souls\u2014you altered our fate. Do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot. There are some things beyond even Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo there aren\u2019t,\u201d Kat said firmly. \u201cLove is stronger than anything\u2014it has to be. You can save him, Venus. All you need to do is mix magic with the modern world, and you\u2019ve definitely done that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea, Katrina?\u201d Venus asked, obviously intrigued.</p><p>\u201cGive him a little of your goddess magic. Not enough to change fate, just enough to lend him some extra strength, and then send him to Tulsa. Let modern medicine change fate. They do it all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy magic and your modern world... You may be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaint John\u2019s emergency room would be best. You know Tulsa\u2014you could do it,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIt might work,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNothing will work unless you hurry,\u201d Jacky said, lifting Patroklos\u2019s slack wrist.</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d Venus asked her suddenly.</p><p>Jacky met her eyes. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I simply must help you.\u201d Venus smiled, kissed her palm and blew the kiss onto Patroklos, who shimmered briefly as if he\u2019d been dipped in glitter. \u201cNow, go with him and be sure you are the first face he sees when he awakens.\u201d The goddess clapped her hands together and Patroklos and Jacky disappeared in a poof of glowing smoke.</p><p>Neither Kat nor the goddess saw Agamemnon, who at that moment backed out of the tent. They also hadn\u2019t noticed when the Greek king had slipped within the tent, silently prepared to pretend regret at the death that should have been Achilles. Kalchas had brought him the bitter news of the masquerade after Agamemnon had already entered the Myrmidon camp, coming as soon as he\u2019d heard that \u201cAchilles\u201d had fallen under Hector\u2019s hand. By that time too many warriors had seen him. Had he turned back then he might have been blamed for the charade that had caused Patroklos his life.</p><p>But his irritation and frustration had vanished with the little scene he\u2019d witnessed between the goddess and the two women pretending to be Polyxena and her servant. So the gods were actively orchestrating the war. He\u2019d known it all along! Hera herself had probably whispered into his ear to hurry to the Myrmidon camp. Yes, he was sure he\u2019d heard the goddess\u2019s soft voice. And now he knew exactly what to do. Silently he left the tent and turned to face the Myrmidons who were keeping watch.</p><p>\u201cPatroklos is gone,\u201d he said solemnly, loving the irony in the truth he was only partially revealing. \u201cWhere is Achilles? He must be told.\u201d</p><p>Diomedes stepped forward. \u201cHe has gone to the shore with Odysseus. We were to send word to him there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Agamemnon nodded. \u201cHe was trying to hold off the berserker in case Patroklos needed him. Well, that is of no consequence now. Your lord should be told.\u201d Diomedes glanced over the king\u2019s shoulder at the tent. \u201cThe women will be preparing his body. It is a house of death now, and no place for warriors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut who will tell Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am his king. I will tell him.\u201d</p><p>Diomedes hesitated. \u201cBut, my lord, perhaps\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Agamemnon cut in, \u201cyou should gather your men at the edge of the battlefield. What do you believe Achilles will do when he learns of his cousin\u2019s death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSire.\u201d This time it was Automedon who spoke. \u201cShould we not prepare for the funeral games of Patroklos? Will he not be honored for his bravery?\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon widened his eyes in exaggerated surprise. \u201cOf course I would say he should be thus honored, but what do you believe Achilles will say? Or rather, what do you believe the berserker will say?\u201d</p><p>The men muttered and Agamemnon smiled to himself.</p><p>\u201cWe will gather the men and prepare to return to battle,\u201d Automedon said. Diomedes nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will give Achilles this grim news,\u201d said Agamemnon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"I really did think it was a good idea,\u201d Venus said with a long-suffering sigh after Patroklos and Jacky had disappeared. \u201cI mean, how was I to know he\u2019d run into Hector? Hector and Achilles have avoided each other for an entire war. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does if you factor in divine interference,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Me? I didn\u2019t do anything to Hector. I barely did anything to Patroklos except to maybe nudge along an idea he\u2019d already been playing with and sprinkle a simple glamour over him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean you. But we all know that there are several goddesses playing in this sandbox.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd gods,\u201d Venus said, considering. \u201cHera did have to keep Zeus busy. He was showing far too much interest in Troy, and she said he said he\u2019d heard the Olympians were interfering in the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa think?\u201d</p><p>Venus frowned at Kat. \u201cI am not talking about Hera, Athena and me. Well, at least not about Hera and me. Athena has lost her head a little, but it was bound to happen some time. By Apollo\u2019s hard shaft she\u2019s just so repressed! Nevertheless, what the three of us have done is really inconsequential. We shouldn\u2019t have attracted Zeus\u2019s attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re underestimating the effect the three of you have on mortals, but whatever. Here\u2019s the point\u2014this war needs to end before anyone else dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly our point, darling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201d Kat glanced nervously at the tent door flap. \u201cFirst, what in the hell am I going to tell them about where Patroklos and Jacky went?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell the Myrmidons anything except that your maidservant, a healer gifted by the gods, must be alone with him to pray and fast and heal him. They\u2019ll assume divine intervention, but they\u2019ll stay fairly quiet about it unless they see Patroklos, healed and healthy, walking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll tell Achilles the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you must, although you know there are some things Love even keeps to herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPardon, darling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI told Achilles the truth about us. Patroklos knows, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course they do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t seem surprised,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDarling, you and your delightful friend are many things; unobtrusive is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well. As long as you know. Now, how are we going to stop this war?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you will remember, this is the point at which I brought the two of you\u2014you in particular\u2014into this mess,\u201d Venus said. \u201cIf we\u2019d known a quicker way to stop the war, we would have done it ourselves, but short of starting a war in Olympus\u2014another war in Olympus, which none of us are willing to do, we settled for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI keep coming back to the horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, what horse?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Trojan horse. The one written about in the stupid Iliad,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean the enormous horse that carried the Greek army inside it within the walls of Troy? Like Achilles can be killed if you kick his ankle? That horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes. Clearly there was fictional license taken by whatever his name was, but maybe there\u2019s a sprinkle of truth to it. I did see some of the war brides wearing pendants that looked like horse heads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd some of them also wear pendants that look like erect phalluses, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to build a giant penis, fill it with warriors and roll it into Troy. If that would work I would have thought of it years ago. I am rather a penis specialist.\u201d</p><p>Kat rubbed her head. She felt terrible\u2014all hot and sandy and salty and bloody. And Venus was giving her a headache. And she needed to tell Achilles that everything was going to be okay with Patroklos. At least, she hoped everything was going to be okay with him. \u201cI have to go talk to Achilles,\u201d she told Venus. \u201cPatroklos is really in Tulsa, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>Then Kat\u2019s stomach flipped. \u201cVenus, you are going to bring them back, aren\u2019t you? Jacky and Patroklos? You can\u2019t just leave them over there, what with Jacky being in the wrong body and all.\u201d And in a different world than me, her panicky mind voice added.</p><p>\u201cOf course they will return. Both of them. If he lives. If he doesn\u2019t I\u2019m not certain that Jacky would want...\u201d The goddess paused, noticing Kat\u2019s wide-eyed look, and then shook her head. \u201cNo, he simply must live. And, yes, I will bring them back. In the meantime I\u2019ll just do a little zapping here and there, quickly, before word leaves this tent that they\u2019ve, well, left. Actually...\u201d Venus raised her hand. \u201cDarling, you should go now. I\u2019m going to seal the tent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone notices? Or tries to get in?\u201d</p><p>Venus smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s the ancient world, Katrina. If they can\u2019t open the tent they\u2019ll believe it\u2019s cursed\u2014or blessed. It all depends upon point of view.\u201d The goddess fluttered her fingers at Kat. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take care of Achilles. You keep thinking about ways to end this war,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes, of course. Call if you need me,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cCount on it,\u201d Kat muttered, and ducked out of the tent, feeling a weird slam and lock as the flap closed behind her.</p><p>She blinked, adjusting her eyes to the bright, midmorning sunlight. She couldn\u2019t believe it was barely noon. It seemed like years had past. Where the hell was everybody? Not one warrior was in sight. \u201cAchilles?\u201d Kat called, walking around the side of the tent. \u201cOdysseus?\u201d</p><p>No one. Not a warrior or a war-prize bride stirred. \u201cThis is giving me a bad feeling,\u201d she said to herself, as she hurried to Achilles\u2019 tent.</p><p>The first thing she noticed was Aetnia, sitting slumped over on the bench by the campfire. She looked up at Kat, cheeks washed with tears.</p><p>\u201cAetnia? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady! It is so terrible! He\u2019s going to kill Prince Hector\u2014I know he will!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, slow down. Who is going to kill Hector?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles, of course! That terrible brute! Agamemnon is bringing him the news of Patroklos. The berserker will take over then, and our poor prince will be doomed.\u201d The maidservant clasped Kat\u2019s hands suddenly. \u201cPerhaps you can warn him, my lady! We\u2019ll go now. Agamemnon might not have reached Achilles yet. The day is young. Hector is probably still on the battlefield. You could be within the walls of Troy in no time.\u201d She pulled at Kat\u2019s hands as if she would drag her into Troy.</p><p>\u201cStop it, Aetnia. I don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d The girl let go of her hands, face filled with shock and confusion. \u201cTell me where I can find Achilles.\u201d</p><p>Aetnia\u2019s head began to shake back and forth slowly. \u201cWhat has happened to you, Princess? Has Melia truly bespelled you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAetnia, that spell stuff is utter bullshit. Why in the hell are you, and all the other women here, so willing to believe that when a woman acts against the norm she has to be under a spell, or wrong in the head, or something else bizarre? How about this\u2014how about considering that maybe I\u2019ve made my own mind up about Achilles and about this stupid war, and it might not be what the...\u201d She paused, almost saying government, and then amended it with what would make more sense to Aetnia. \u201cIt might not be what the rulers of this place want us to think.\u201d</p><p>Aetnia\u2019s mouth opened and closed, reminding Kat of a carp.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Achilles and some of these other men. You\u2019ve been with Diomedes for how long now? Two years? Maybe this war is wrong on both sides, and maybe it just needs to be over. Oh, and by the by, Achilles is not a monster,\u201d she added for good measure. \u201cNow, where is he?\u201d</p><p>Aetnia pointed to the sea behind Kat. \u201cHe and Odysseus went to the shore. Agamemnon followed them there not long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she said quickly and started off. Then called back over her shoulder, \u201cAnd you might want to consider thinking for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon had seen the berserker before, many times actually. Although it was usually from a distance as Achilles defeated the champion of this or that tribe and saved the Greek army a nasty battle. All of those times the king had never been frightened of the creature that possessed the warrior. Not so this time. What Agamemnon witnessed this time petrified him.</p><p>He\u2019d caught up to Achilles and Odysseus at the seashore, where the scarred warrior paced back and forth at the edge of the waves, obviously attempting to control his roiling emotions. Odysseus had been speaking to his friend in a low, calming voice when he noticed Agamemnon approaching, and both men went silent and still as the Greek king joined them.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cHe is gone. Patroklos is no longer of this world,\u201d Agamemnon said with perfect honesty. \u201cI honor his memory by telling you myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonor?\u201d Achilles snarled. \u201cThere is no honor is this world or justice or hope. My cousin died pretending to be me, that isn\u2019t honorable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree, Achilles,\u201d Agamemnon said, carefully controlling his sense of glee as he watched the rigid control with which Achilles usually held himself crumble like the support column of an acropolis. \u201cHis sense of Greek honor is what made him create the pretense. It was Fate who put Hector in his path.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFate! I curse Fate and all of her minions in Olympus! This world has no honor or justice or hope, but it does have vengeance.\u201d The word came out as a growl.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, my friend. Let us go back to camp and plan your cousin\u2019s funeral games,\u201d Odysseus said, stepping between the king and the warrior.</p><p>\u201cListen to Odysseus, Achilles. I will even agree that no Greek will go to battle for a full ten days of gaming to honor him,\u201d Agamemnon said with exaggerated concern. \u201cThough we will have to wait until the fighting is over for the day. Many of the Myrmidons are still battling Hector. He has been fighting like a man possessed since he cut down Patroklos,\u201d Agamemnon finished, loving the irony he evoked by using the word possessed.</p><p>Odysseus grabbed the king\u2019s arm. \u201cEnough, Agamemnon. You know the Myrmidons followed\u2014\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon wrenched his arm from Odysseus\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou dare too much, Ithaca!\u201d Then the king\u2019s eyes widened and he stumbled back several paces.</p><p>Odysseus whirled around, shouting, \u201cAchilles, no!\u201d</p><p>It was too late. Achilles\u2019 eyes were already beginning to glow a rusty, bloody scarlet. \u201cTell her the dream has ended. She should return to her home. Ask her to forgive me.\u201d His voice was already beginning to deepen into the guttural snarl of something decidedly not human. Then he lifted his arms to the heavens and let loose a deafening roar as, with a rush, rage cascaded into his body.</p><p>Agamemnon continued to back away from what used to be Achilles. This possession was different. His body grew and twisted with obscenely exaggerated muscles. His scars, always grotesque, overtook the rest of his skin so that he appeared to be pieced together by wounds\u2014defined by pain. His face retained only the bare structure of the man, but built on that structure was the visage of a beast, monstrous, inhumane, a creature who knew nothing but anger and pain and the lust for blood. Agamemnon realized what had happened and, even in his fear, had to repress a shout of victory. Until that moment Achilles had always battled the berserker. He\u2019d fought to retain a vestige of humanity so that he could find his way back to himself.</p><p>This time Achilles had no intention of returning.</p><p>What Agamemnon was witnessing was the utter destruction of the man\u2014the fragmenting of his soul. Though Achilles might still be somewhere within the twisted shell, he had given up and finally completely accepted his fate.</p><p>With another frightening roar, the thing that had been Achilles sprinted off toward the walls of Troy.</p><p>Agamemnon drew a long, relieved breath. Then he felt Odysseus\u2019s eyes on him. He gave the Ithacan king a bland look. \u201cI did him a favor. He\u2019s done fighting it now, and, doubtless, his name will be remembered for ages for what he\u2019s about to do.\u201d That piece of the puzzle, Agamemnon added silently to himself, was annoying, but unavoidable.</p><p>\u201cYou bated him on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe chose glory long ago. I was simply giving him his wish.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus\u2019s sharp gaze studied the aging king. \u201cYou lied.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon lifted one golden clad shoulder. \u201cNo. Patroklos is no longer in this world and the Myrmidons are on the battlefield, as, I\u2019m quite sure, is Hector.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus was shaking his head and looking at the Greek king with pure disgust when Kat stumbled over a dune and rushed up to them.</p><p>\u201cAchilles!\u201d She gasped, trying to catch her breath. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmbracing Fate instead of you, Princess,\u201d Agamemnon said with a sarcastic sneer.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done, you old shithead?\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare speak to me in such a manner, woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck off!\u201d Kat yelled, stepping forward into his face, which shocked him so badly that he actually took a step backward. She gave him a disdainful look and turned her back on him, speaking instead to Odysseus. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles knows Patroklos is dead. The berserker has utterly possessed him and he\u2019s gone to kill Hector,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>Kat felt the world tilt. Over a bizarre humming in her ears she said, \u201cNo... no, he\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will be shortly. There is no stopping it. The monster has already defeated the man,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cNot Achilles, Patroklos,\u201d Kat said, fighting not to sob in despair.</p><p>Odysseus rounded on Agamemnon. \u201cYou said Patroklos was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said he\u2019d left this world, and he has.\u201d</p><p>Kat gasped, reading the truth in Agamemnon\u2019s smug eyes. \u201cYou knew Patroklos wasn\u2019t dead. You saw them disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I saw was proof that you are not a princess of Troy.\u201d</p><p>She curled her lip at Agamemnon. \u201cYou\u2019re finally right about something. No, I\u2019m not an ancient woman you can bully.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? You look soft and weak to me.\u201d Agamemnon made a threatening move toward her, but Odysseus stepped swiftly between them.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t touch her,\u201d he said.</p><p>Agamemnon hesitated, and then chuckled mockingly. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s only right that you have her now that your friend is finished with her. But you should know that she\u2019s been lying to you, too. She\u2019s not Athena\u2019s oracle. She\u2019s in league with the Goddess of Love. I saw them together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you should return to your camp, great king.\u201d Odysseus\u2019s voice was flint. \u201cYour battle is about to be won for you, and you should be there to seize the glory.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon narrowed his eyes at Odysseus. \u201cShe\u2019s only a woman. Will you stand with her against your king?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re such an asswipe!\u201d Kat blurted before Odysseus could speak. \u201cYou think I\u2019m just this?\u201d She pointed down at her body. \u201cThis is just a shell\u2014it\u2019s temporary. It\u2019s the spirit inside that lasts and really counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I believe you, Princess,\u201d Agamemnon said, voice rich with sarcasm. \u201cWhich makes what has happened to Achilles even more tragic. What was inside of him is gone. But don\u2019t despair. His name will certainly last forever.\u201d</p><p>Kat felt rage build within her. Acting purely on instinct, she wrapped her hand around Venus\u2019s pendant and with the other pointed a condemning finger at him. \u201cToday is your lucky day. You were right twice. I am not an ancient princess, and I am in league with the Goddess of Love. So it\u2019s with Venus\u2019s power that I say love will betray you, like you betrayed my love. Love will be your death and your curse.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon shuddered, but recovered himself quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t curse me, witch creature. I have the protection of the Queen of Gods herself.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s laugh completely lacked humor. \u201cReally? Last time Hera and I chatted about you she said you were an arrogant fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m lying, then let the sea monsters Hera helped save me from come up here and grab me.\u201d Kat took a couple resolute steps to the edge of the water. The waves washed over her shoes as she waited, looking seaward, and then when the placid water didn\u2019t so much as stir, she slowly turned her gaze back to Agamemnon. \u201cYou\u2019re screwed.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon stared at her and what he saw in her eyes made his face drain of color. \u201cStay away from me, witch!\u201d he cried. The king began to hurry back down the beach toward the Greek camp, golden robes flapping behind him like he was an oversized, gilded gull.</p><p>Kat stared after him and prayed with every fiber of her being that curses really did work in this world. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\"You have to take me to Achilles,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cThat will only get you killed, or worse. You\u2019ve gotten close to Achilles. The berserker could easily target you. If that happens killing you would be the best possible outcome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit! Getting Achilles back would be the best possible outcome. Now take me to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe battlefield is this way.\u201d Odysseus gestured up past the dunes that eventually gave way to a field of wheat, a grove of lovely olive trees, and various temples that used to be quite busy, and then, beyond the temples, the massive walls of Troy. As they hurried toward the great city, Kat thought she recognized Hera\u2019s temple where she and Jacky had first been zapped into this world.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll lead you as close as I can, but you\u2019ll need to stay clear of the battlefield. It is no place for a woman,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cOdysseus, I\u2019m not going to lie to you. I have no intention of staying clear of the battlefield. I\u2019m going where Achilles is, and that\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t Athena\u2019s oracle, are you?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus pulled her attention from focusing on not stepping on her skirts as she practically jogged to keep up with his long stride. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not Athena\u2019s oracle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you immortal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI wish. Which means hell no. I\u2019m just a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even one of Athena\u2019s priestesses?\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice made her look up at him, and she saw a terrible depth of sadness in his eyes and remembered how he had looked at Athena. Then she also remembered how stark his expression had been when he\u2019d said the goddess had lied to him. What had Athena done to him? He loves her, Kat realized. \u201cWell, not exactly. I work for three goddesses. I guess you could say I\u2019m closest to Venus.\u201d She didn\u2019t mean to sound oh-so-divine, but it was damn difficult to explain. \u201cLook, there\u2019s a bunch of stuff going on here, and it can definitely be confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goddess didn\u2019t take me into her confidence. I thought she...\u201d He looked away, clearly too hurt to continue.</p><p>Kat felt terrible for him. She didn\u2019t know much about Odysseus or about Athena, but she recognized heartache and betrayal. She also recognized a decent man when she saw one, and she definitely liked Odysseus.</p><p>\u201cVenus is the goddess who cooked up the whole thing with Patroklos to impersonate Achilles. Athena didn\u2019t have anything to do with it. She probably didn\u2019t even know about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope that is true. I hope she hasn\u2019t been using me,\u201d Odysseus said haltingly, and Kat could see what it was costing him to show such vulnerability. She\u2019d seen it many times before in her office, and always when a man had found himself truly, deeply in love. Kat hoped Athena deserved him.</p><p>Kat decided to tell him as much of the truth as she knew. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you and Athena together and I can tell you that there is a bond between you, one she doesn\u2019t appear to take lightly.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus stared at her for a long while. \u201cIt is a difficult thing to love a goddess. I have a wife, you know. She\u2019s been waiting almost ten years for me to return to our kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd do you love her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena asked me that question recently. My answer was the same then as it is now. I honor Penelope as my wife and respect her as the mother of my son. But my love?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t been mine to give away since I was a youth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d Kat asked the question, but she was pretty sure she already knew his answer.</p><p>\u201cI met Athena, and pledged my life and my love to her service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of your choice then?\u201d Kat asked.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I realized it\u2014I embraced it. I\u2019ve belonged to Athena since the first moment I saw her. I have never regretted my love for her, even when it seemed I was no more than a slight favorite among many. I didn\u2019t even mind being used as a pawn\u2014I was her pawn, and that was enough. Until now. Today, for the first time, I find myself wishing I did not love the goddess.\u201d</p><p>He sounded utterly destroyed, and even in the midst of the turmoil with Achilles and Jacky and Patroklos, Kat wanted to help him. \u201cYou and Athena have become lovers.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus nodded, giving a little self-mocking laugh. \u201cYes, despite knowing that doing so is unwise, I have fallen gladly, joyously, into her arms. Remember this, Princess, or whoever you really are, when mortals love the gods there is a price to pay, and it\u2019s usually the mortal who pays it. Achilles is the product of such love, and I have watched his mortality, his humanity, suffer for as long as I have known him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll remember, but it seems what you\u2019re saying is that Achilles has been a victim, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe isn\u2019t Achilles anymore. You\u2019ll soon see.\u201d</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be anything left to say, and Kat concentrated on keeping up with Odysseus as she wondered just what the hell she thought she was going to do when she finally found Achilles. In the middle of battle. Totally berserked out. She could hear Jacky\u2019s voice calling her a damn fool.</p><p>And then she realized that it wasn\u2019t Jacky\u2019s voice that was crowding into her mind, but the voices of many men and horses, swords and pain. They struggled up the side of an olive-lined ridge, Odysseus taking her elbow to help her, and Kat stumbled to a shocked halt.</p><p>\u201cOh, holy shit!\u201d she blurted.</p><p>The walls of Troy stretched before her, thick and tall and impossibly magnificent. They were made of butter-colored limestone, and the midday sunlight made them shine a soft, compelling yellow. She could see some of the city built up inside the walls, the center-piece of which was a graceful, pillared palace that stretched all along the inside of the city walls to the left of the huge front gates. Beautiful arched windows led to ivy-hung and flowered balconies that afforded excellent views of what should be the placid and prosperous comings and goings of merchants, farmers and the people of Troy. Now the empty balconies looked out onto chaos.</p><p>\u201cSo many men,\u201d Kat said, staring at the melee of warriors who shouted and screamed, fought and died in front of the city walls. How will I ever find him? But before she could voice the question, a terrible roar sounded from the center of the battlefield, so powerful that it had no trouble carrying over the two armies. \u201cAchilles,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cNot Achilles,\u201d Odysseus said. \u201cYou\u2019re not dealing with the man. You\u2019re dealing with the monster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man is still inside the monster,\u201d she said stubbornly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, but I saw no evidence of that when he gave himself over to it.\u201d Odysseus paused, and rested his hand gently on her shoulder. Kat looked up at him questioningly. \u201cAs the berserker was possessing him he asked me to give you a message. Achilles said that the dream was over, and that you should go home. It was his final wish, along with asking that you forgive him. Reconsider, Princess. Imagine what it would do to him if he knew that he had again destroyed the woman he loved.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s throat burned with unshed tears. She remembered all too well the story Achilles had told her about the berserker raping and killing his young fianc\u00e9e, who had also been Odysseus\u2019s cousin.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re making sense,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I know it must seem to you like I\u2019m behaving recklessly and being ridiculously stubborn, but here\u2019s the truth, Odysseus. I\u2019m not from your time. I\u2019m not even from your world. I\u2019m a different kind of woman than what you know here, and I have the power of generations of independent thinkers and educated mothers and sisters, daughters and girlfriends, all within me. I believe in myself, and what the power of one woman can bring about. That gives me a different kind of strength, a strength that Venus and Hera and Athena knew would be needed here. I can change what\u2019s happening. All I have to do is trust myself and believe that Achilles will trust me, too.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus had listened to her carefully, studying her intently while she spoke. \u201cYou make me hope you are right, Princess,\u201d he finally said.</p><p>\u201cKatrina, that\u2019s my real name. My friends call me Kat.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWell, Kat, shall I lead you into chaos?\u201d</p><p>She bobbed a little curtsey. \u201cThere are few men I\u2019d rather go there with, kind sir.\u201d</p><p>The battlefield was like nothing Kat could have ever imagined. The smells alone were horrendous, the sights and sounds utterly frightening. As soon as they\u2019d reached the outskirts of the fighting, Odysseus sent a Greek runner to gather as many of the Myrmidons as he could find. Kat waited impatiently behind the battle lines, wishing for modern communications and transportation, and all the while the roar of the berserker sounded over and over again, filling the air with a bestial violence that made the men fighting and dying mere yards from her seem tame.</p><p>The Myrmidons responded to Odysseus\u2019s call much more quickly than Kat would have anticipated, and soon she was looking at the surprised, blood-spattered faces of familiar men who nodded to her in respectful greeting.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking her to Achilles,\u201d Odysseus announced.</p><p>The Myrmidons\u2019 faces were utterly confused.</p><p>\u201cBut he is Achilles no more,\u201d Automedon said.</p><p>As if to punctuate the warrior\u2019s words, another roar shook the battlefield and Achilles\u2019 own men shuddered.</p><p>\u201cI know about the berserker, but I think I can reach Achilles,\u201d Kat said, looking from man to man. \u201cPatroklos is not dead. All I have to do is get to a small part of Achilles and make him understand that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPatroklos lives!\u201d Automedon said, as the men nearest them took up the cry and let it ripple through the group. Then the smiling warrior turned back to her. \u201cBring Patroklos to the battlefield, Princess. Even overtaken by the berserker, Achilles must recognize his cousin. When he sees that he is alive, all will be well again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes!\u201d said another warrior whose name Kat couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cWe may even get to Achilles before he has killed Hector and called the prophesy to him.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was looking expectantly at Kat, even Odysseus. Kat wished like hell she could produce a living, walking, talking Patroklos, but of course that was impossible. Even if the warrior was actually alive, he was probably in surgery. Pulling him out of the modern world would kill him as surely as Hector\u2019s sword.</p><p>\u201cPatroklos can\u2019t be brought out here on the battlefield. It would kill him. He\u2019s alive, but he\u2019s badly hurt. No, I\u2019m all you have. You have to take me to Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAchilles will not see you, my lady,\u201d Automedon said sadly. \u201cIt will only be the berserker, and we cannot save you from him if the creature decides to destroy you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. You won\u2019t have to save me. I\u2019ll save myself.\u201d</p><p>Every single man looked at her as if she had just said she was going to sprout a red cape and fly faster than a speeding bullet.</p><p>\u201cJust take me to him,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of the rest of it. No, I won\u2019t hold you responsible for my deadness if things don\u2019t work out. And once you get me to him, all you guys back off. I don\u2019t want any of you getting hurt.\u201d</p><p>She saw the incredulous looks and heard a muttered, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want us getting hurt?\u201d which she ignored. They were definitely not helping her confidence level.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s get her to Achilles,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>The men snapped to like the experienced, disciplined warriors they were. They created a phalanx, putting her safely in the middle of them. Then they began to move onto the battlefield, fighting slowly, as one man, moving inexorably forward, drawing ever nearer the animalistic cries that came from the creature who used to be Achilles.</p><p>Afterward Kat couldn\u2019t decide if the nightmare trip across the battlefield had taken a very short or a very long time. It had seemed she had entered a place where time had no meaning, a Twilight Zone landscape of death and blood and violence that her eyes took in, but her soul refused, at least temporarily, to see. Later the memories came to her, mostly in black-and-white snapshots of horror, but at that moment she had marveled what the human mind could deny to survive.</p><p>Then the pace of the group changed, picked up, before coming to a stop. Odysseus was beside her, breathing hard. \u201cThere is only one more layer of men between us and the berserker. We should push easily through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, good. Just get me close to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may not have long before he\u2019s upon you,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cLet me worry about that.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus nodded and called the men surrounding them to order. \u201cPush through the line then open the column for the princess!\u201d</p><p>Kat was sick and scared. As she moved forward again with the men she thought she might puke and was gritting her teeth together against it when the dark shields in front of her parted to let in daylight and madness.</p><p>He was standing in a clearing of dead men. Blood had turned the dirt to rusty clay. His back was to her, giving Kat a bizarrely peaceful moment in which to study him. Odysseus and the other men had been right\u2014this creature was not Achilles. His body had grown to such huge, misshapen proportions that the tunic she had last seen him wearing had split, leaving him naked except for a short linen wrap knotted around his waist. She must have made an involuntary noise because he suddenly whirled to face her. Kat felt the men tense. She glanced at Odysseus and told him \u201cGo!\u201d before walking away from their protection.</p><p>The creature growled. Kat took a few more steps, distancing herself from the other men, then she stopped and met his burning red gaze. Blood and gore covered his scarred body. It ran in dirty rivulets from his matted hair. His face was not his own. Like his body, it was misshapen, as if there was something under his skin trying to stretch its way free.</p><p>\u201cAchilles, it\u2019s me, Katrina.\u201d She made sure her voice was steady and calm, as if he were a client who had just told her that he was thinking about suicide. And wasn\u2019t that just what Achilles was doing? He believed he\u2019d caused his cousin\u2019s death, so now he was planning on paying for that with his own. \u201cAchilles,\u201d she repeated his name. \u201cPatroklos is not dead.\u201d</p><p>Achilles curled his lip, bearing his teeth. He began to move toward her, slowly but with a deadly, almost seductive grace. She thought he reminded her of a huge poisonous snake. Kat wanted to turn and run for all she was worth back into the sea of warriors behind her. Instead she drew a deep breath, sent a silent, pleading prayer asking Venus for help, and held her ground.</p><p>\u201cAchilles,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cYou have to listen to me. Patroklos is not dead. He\u2019s alive and he\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d</p><p>As he circled her he made a noise that sent chills skittering across her skin\u2014she realized the creature was laughing.</p><p>\u201cAchilles,\u201d she said again, turning her body so that she could continue to meet his gaze. \u201cI know you\u2019re there somewhere. I know you can hear me. Patroklos is not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will taste you.\u201d His voice was so awful, so utterly not human, not Achilles that she had to clench her hands into fists so that their trembling wouldn\u2019t be obvious.</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you will.\u201d Kat kept her voice as well as all of her mannerisms carefully neutral, as placid as possible. \u201cAchilles loves me, and he won\u2019t let you hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His laugher was terrible, mocking and monstrous. \u201cFoolish woman, I am not Achilles.\u201d Almost within touching distance he stopped circling her. She could smell him\u2014blood and sweat and something feral and male.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s obvious.\u201d She lifted her chin, pretending with every skill she\u2019d learned in her clinical experience to be calm and unaffected by him. \u201cAchilles\u2014\u201d she began, but he cut her off.</p><p>\u201cNo! Achilles is no more!\u201d</p><p>As he lunged toward her, Kat stumbled back, her composure crumbling. \u201cAchilles!\u201d she cried. \u201cYou have to come back to me!\u201d</p><p>She saw recognition flicker through his eyes, cooling the scarlet and causing the monster to pause awkwardly. \u201cYes! Achilles!\u201d Kat smiled, dizzy with relief, but before she could say more or move toward him, her arm was being yanked roughly back and up, and she was pulled out of the clearing and off her feet.</p><p>\u201cAh, gods, we thought you were dead!\u201d said the handsome, kind-eyed man who had lifted her onto the back of a quivering black stallion and into his arms. \u201cPolyxena! Sister!\u201d</p><p>Kat looked into Hector\u2019s eyes as the berserker roared his challenge and charged. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keeping one arm around her, Hector kneed the stallion so that it sprang to the side, narrowly avoiding Achilles\u2019 charge. With a fluid motion, the big horse spun while Hector grabbed a spear from the saddle quiver and hurled it at Achilles. Kat screamed, but with the berserker\u2019s inhuman reflexes Achilles knocked the spear aside as if it had only been a toothpick.</p><p>\u201cHector! No!\u201d Thinking frantically she pulled on the stranger\u2019s arm. \u201cLeave him. Let\u2019s get back inside the city walls.\u201d</p><p>Hector glanced down at her, trying to maneuver the stallion to avoid Achilles\u2019 next rush.</p><p>\u201cYou cannot have her!\u201d the creature snarled.</p> <p>\u201cBy the gods! It is you he\u2019s after.\u201d His arm squeezed her protectively.</p><p>\u201cGet me out of here Hector!\u201d Kat yelled above the noise of battle.</p><p>\u201cTrojans! To me! Protect your Princess!\u201d</p><p>For a second Kat thought it would work and they would leave Achilles to roar impotently at the walls of Troy, giving her time to figure out what the hell to do next. Hector had begun backing the stallion from the clearing and a line of Trojan warriors was rushing to meet them. Then the creature that had been her lover gave a terrifying cry and hurled himself at Hector\u2019s stallion. As Achilles flew past them his bloody sword tore down the horse\u2019s flank. The stallion screamed, stumbled and lost his rear footing on the slick, bloody clay. Kat automatically threw herself forward, clutching the stallion\u2019s wide neck. She felt Hector\u2019s grip on her release at the same instant Achilles snagged his shoulder, ripping him from the saddle.</p><p>Then everything happened with blinding swiftness.</p> <p>Hector regained his footing. He ran to the stallion, pulling his sword and shield free. His eyes met Kat\u2019s. She saw his love for Polyxena there, and knew that he would do anything to keep his sister safe.</p><p>\u201cGet inside the walls. I\u2019ll hold him off for as long as I can.\u201d Hector raised his hand and brought it down on the horse\u2019s rump, sending him galloping across Trojan lines.</p><p>Achilles followed the horse, roaring with fury. Hector ran, jumped and put himself directly in the berserker\u2019s path, cutting him off from Katrina. The Trojan warriors encircled Kat and the wounded stallion, but she had an excellent view of the battlefield as they fought off the Myrmidons, now rallied by Odysseus, and began moving her toward the city gates. Her eyes were locked on Achilles and Hector, and she watched everything as if in slow motion. Hector fought bravely, but he wasn\u2019t battling a human. The creature was utterly uncontrollable, but Hector stood his ground, until Achilles sliced through the muscles of his thighs, and even then the brave man fought from his knees, keeping the monster engaged as the massive gates groaned open enough for Kat, the stallion and Hector\u2019s guard to slip within. As they closed Kat heard a wail of despair begin from atop the Trojan walls and she knew that Hector, Prince of Troy, was dead.</p><p>The soldiers took her directly to the king. Priam\u2019s arms enfolded Kat, and she wept with him while he held her.</p><p>\u201cA miracle from the gods... a miracle from the gods...\u201d he kept repeating over and over. Finally he steadied himself and called for wine for both of them. Only then did Kat get a good look at him, and her heart squeezed. He was an older, shorter version of Hector\u2014a handsome man with kind brown eyes and thick silver and black hair. With a little jolt Kat realized that his eyes weren\u2019t familiar just because Hector had had them. They were familiar because since she\u2019d been transported to the ancient world and plunked into this body, those same expressive brown eyes had been looking out from her face, too.</p><p>Priam collapsed into a high-backed wooden chair exquisitely carved with plunging stallions. His hands shook as he drank deeply of the offered wine. Feeling lightheaded, Kat sipped her own wine, and then handed the goblet back to a servant who had been crying silently but openly. She heard a choked noise, and more arms were suddenly around her. An older, elegant woman who was too thin and a delicate, beautiful twenty something cried while they embraced her. Overwhelmed, Kat could only stand there and wish this had all been different\u2014that she\u2019d managed to make things right.</p> <p>\u201cIt is true. Hector is dead. Achilles has killed him.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked up with the women who had been holding her to see who had spoken. A slender man stood in the arched door to the spacious chamber. He was probably not much older than Polyxena, and he, too, had kind, expressive eyes. A blond woman stood behind him in the shadow of the doorway, her beauty undiminished by the tears that washed her cheeks. She stared with adoration at the young man who had just spoken. Kat thought she\u2019d never seen anyone so gorgeous\u2014she easily rivaled even Venus\u2019s beauty. Paris and Helen\u2014it has to be.</p><p>Then his awful words registered on the group and the woman who must be Priam\u2019s wife, the mother of Hector and Paris and Polyxena, threw herself onto the floor at the king\u2019s feet while she tore her hair and wailed. The other woman who had been embracing her didn\u2019t make a sound, but crumpled to the floor, unconscious.</p><p>\u201cGet Astyanax. Holding Hector\u2019s son will help her survive this,\u201d ordered the young man as he came into the room.</p><p>\u201cYes, Lord Paris.\u201d A crying servant hurried to do his bidding.</p><p>Paris rushed to the fallen woman, whose eyelids were beginning to flutter weakly. He lifted her and carried her to a chaise not far from Priam\u2019s throne. Then Kat was in the young man\u2019s arms. She hugged him hard and she could feel the tremors that went through his body. \u201cYou are alive... You are alive,\u201d he whispered over and over, his warm breath mixing with the tears that dampened her hair.</p><p>Kat couldn\u2019t do any more than nod. Her mind was in tumult. Her heart felt as if it was shattering over and over.</p><p>There was a sobbing gasp from behind them, and Paris released his sister reluctantly, moving back to the chaise. \u201cAndromache, I\u2019ve sent for your son,\u201d Paris spoke softly to the reviving woman. \u201cAstyanax is being brought to you.\u201d He touched her cheek and then he drew himself up and slowly, almost painfully, he turned to his father.</p> <p>The king was stroking his wife\u2019s hair. Her face was buried in his knees and her wails had become broken sobs. Priam\u2019s face was absolutely expressionless.</p><p>\u201cFather,\u201d Paris said brokenly, wiping the back of his sleeve across his face. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, Father.\u201d</p><p>The old monarch\u2019s eyes rested briefly on his youngest son. His blank expression did not change, but he focused his gaze over Paris\u2019s shoulder as if he was looking into the past.</p><p>\u201cYou should take your sister to her chamber. I cannot see you when I am mourning my son.\u201d Priam\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t cruel, but it, like his face, was devoid of expression, which made it all the more terrible.</p><p>Paris seemed to crumple in on himself. \u201cFather, I am your son, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that is something the gods will never let me forget,\u201d Priam said. \u201cGo now. Return to my presence only when I call for you.\u201d He paused, and then added, \u201cTake your woman with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, sister.\u201d Paris held out his hand for hers and, not knowing what else to do, Kat took it and let him lead her from Priam\u2019s throne room. As they passed Helen, she fell into step on Paris\u2019s other side. Kat saw that she kept her head bowed, as if she was trying to obscure her face with her shining hair.</p><p>They walked silently through a marble-floored hallway, past several lovely, airy rooms. It was as if despair walked with them. All around them sounds of women crying echoed in the magnificent palace. Finally they came to a silver-inlayed door and Paris stopped.</p><p>\u201cI will send maidservants to see to you,\u201d Paris said. His cheeks were still wet and his voice was rough with emotion. \u201cI\u2019m so glad they didn\u2019t kill you, little Xena.\u201d</p><p>And as it had been for the brief time she\u2019d been with Hector, she could tell that Paris had loved Polyxena, too. Impulsively she hugged him. \u201cThank you,\u201d Kat whispered.</p><p>Paris clung to her. \u201cIt\u2019s my fault,\u201d he said brokenly. \u201cI caused his death. I caused all of their deaths.\u201d</p><p>Kat pitied him. He was really not much more than a teenager\u2014he must only have been thirteen or fourteen when he\u2019d taken Helen from the Greeks. These two kids had started a war that had gone on for almost a decade? It hadn\u2019t taken meeting Agamemnon and his cronies for Kat to know what utter bullshit that was. She shook her head at the sad young man. \u201cNo, Paris, it\u2019s gone way beyond being your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome, love. Polyxena needs to bathe and rest. Come with me, sweetest one,\u201d Helen coaxed in a voice like poured honey.</p><p>Still sobbing, Paris nodded and stumbled away mostly supported by Helen\u2019s arm around his waist.</p><p>Kat entered the chamber untouched by its splendor and stood numbly while she waited for the maidservants to come to her. They were there in minutes, grim-faced women who treated her reverently, but who kept breaking into sobs. Kat let them bathe, anoint and dress her in a simple silk robe. They left her wine and food and then, amid whispers and sobs, seemed to melt away.</p><p>Feeling detached and unfocused, Kat walked across the room to a huge, arched open window. Gauzy gold curtains picked up what was obviously the light from a fading sun, and shimmered evening colors of rust and orange and yellow. Sounds of fighting men drifted with the warm breeze and Kat stepped out onto a balcony that perched above the front walls of Troy, commanding an amazing view of the battlefield. She didn\u2019t let her eyes look at it, though, just like she didn\u2019t let her ears acknowledge that the one voice she could hear above all the other cries and clashing of two armies was the one that had possessed her Achilles. Instead she gazed beyond everything to the distant, watery horizon and the sun that was dying into the sea. She stared at it until the tears that blurred her vision filled her eyes, spilled over and ran down her cheeks.</p><p>Then through grief and noise and confusion Kat heard another sound. Her mind picked it up as it washed over her like clear, cool water over smooth river stones. Something about it reached her, soothed her and brought her subconscious the answer before her thinking mind understood it.</p><p>There was a clanking followed by many click-click-clicks, and then a familiar groan she\u2019d heard only once before, when she\u2019d ridden Hector\u2019s wounded stallion through the opening gates of Troy.</p><p>Kat stepped out to the edge of the balcony. Following the clicking noise, she looked down and to her immediate left. Built inside the thick walls was an indention, a niche large enough for a man to stand comfortably within, a single arrow-slitted window gave an abbreviated view of the battlefield. Beside the man was an enormous chain, the links of which were half the size of his body. Kat watched the links slither down in a hole at the man\u2019s feet like a waterfall of iron. There was a system of large iron levers in front of the man. His hands were on the levers, which were all pushed in a downward direction.</p><p>\u201cClose the gates!\u201d On the platform outside the niche a warrior suddenly called an abrupt command and lowered a scarlet flag he had been holding over his head. The man in the niche immediately tripped all of the levers, pushing each of them up. The chain stopped its slithering motion.</p><p>Leaning farther out over her balcony Kat peered down at the front gates of Troy as more than two dozen warriors rushed to close the gates while archers held off the bedraggled looking Greek army. The gates had been opened far enough for all of the Trojan warriors to retreat within the city, so it took a considerable amount of time to get them closed, but finally, with another eerie groan, the city was sealed.</p><p>Kat\u2019s gaze went back to the man in the niche. He and the soldier holding the flag saluted each other and then relaxed into a stance that resembled parade rest.</p><p>So it took a couple dozen men or so to close the gates of the city, but only one to pull down some levers and open them?</p><p>Kat\u2019s body flushed hot and then utterly cold. Everything fell suddenly into place. She and Jacky had missed the entire point\u2014in the myth it wasn\u2019t about fitting the whole Greek army into a ridiculous, hollow horse, out of which they emerged and kicked Trojan ass. It was about getting inside the impenetrable, god-fashioned walls of Troy and opening the gates.</p><p>Kat stared at the levers and at the two men who guarded them. No way would they allow anyone to get close enough to them to trip the chain and open the gates. But a princess of Troy was not just anyone.</p><p>\u201cI am the Trojan horse,\u201d she whispered, and the words sent a terrible shiver through her body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kat lifted her hand to grasp the heart-shaped pendant that still hung from around her neck, but a movement just outside the city walls caught at the edge of her vision. Gold and scarlet flashed, drawing her eyes. The Greek army had already pulled back and was disappearing into the olive grove. Only one warrior remained.</p><p>\u201cAchilles! Oh, god, no.\u201d Horrified, Kat shook her head back and forth, back and forth. He was driving a chariot, lashing the horses into a frenzy as he drove past the city gates again and again, dragging the bloody, brutalized body of Hector behind him.</p><p>That terrible scene decided her. Kat was going to do whatever it took to end this. Resolutely she went back into her chamber, opened the locket and called to Venus.</p><p>\u201cVenus, come to me.\u201d</p> <p>This time the glittering of the goddess\u2019s divine cloud was markedly subdued as she materialized.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Venus said. \u201cHector is dead. I heard Andromache\u2019s cries of grief. They were very much in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know about this?\u201d Kat gestured to the balcony. The goddess walked close enough to gaze out. Kat saw the jolt of shock that went through her body as she realized what she was witnessing.</p><p>\u201cAchilles is desecrating Hector\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Achilles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not Achilles!\u201d Kat drew a deep, steadying breath. \u201cI need you to get Hera and Athena here. Oh, and Thetis, too. I know how to end this, but you\u2019ll all have to play a part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible for Hera to come. She\u2019s keeping Zeus busy.\u201d Venus\u2019s gaze briefly went back to the balcony before she continued. \u201cAnd she needs to keep him busy. If he knew what was going on out there you would never have a chance at saving your Achilles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s Zeus\u2019s fault that the berserker is here at all! He cursed Achilles with him,\u201d Kat said angrily.</p><p>\u201cDarling,\u201d Venus said gently, \u201cit was Achilles\u2019 choice\u2014Achilles\u2019 responsibility. That\u2019s why this is so terrible for him. He picked this fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m changing it. Love is changing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs. And by changing Achilles\u2019 fate I\u2019m ending the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou figured out a way,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Trojan horse,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDarling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust trust me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImplicitly. What do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that Thetis, being a sea goddess, can conjure up some fog?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. In the hour before dawn have Thetis make fog roll in from the sea. I need a lot of it\u2014enough to hide the Myrmidons. Tell Athena to have Odysseus lead Achilles\u2019 men to the city gates. And I mean right up to them. I\u2019ll have them open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrojan horse, remember?\u201d</p><p>Venus nodded slowly. \u201cYou truly are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d Or maybe a better analogy is that I\u2019m Judas, Kat thought, then shook herself mentally. That line of reasoning wouldn\u2019t help her or Achilles. \u201cBe sure Athena tells Odysseus to have the Greek army waiting just out of sight\u2014the entire Greek army. This is their only chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDone. And what do we do about Achilles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. He\u2019s my diversion.\u201d Kat retreated into her clinical persona\u2014calm, dispassionate, free of clogging emotions like despair and guilt and fear. \u201cIf anyone looks from Troy, they\u2019ll be looking at him. The fog should do the rest. This is going to get the Greeks inside the walls of Troy\u2014they should be able to end the war then, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne would think so,\u201d Venus said. \u201cAnd what will you be doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be getting Achilles back.\u201d</p><p>Venus hesitated before speaking. \u201cI should probably warn you against trying to reach him. It didn\u2019t work today. It probably won\u2019t work tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Kat prompted.</p><p>\u201cBut I believe in the power of love,\u201d she said simply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m finding that I have a newfound appreciation for the power of love myself,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Venus smiled. \u201cI knew I\u2019d made the right choice in you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope so. Okay, I need one more thing: a sleeping potion that works quickly. A really strong one.\u201d</p><p>Without any hesitation Venus held out her hand, wiggling her fingers. Almost immediately a tiny crystal bottle filled with a clear liquid appeared in a glittering of dust.</p><p>\u201cCareful with this. It\u2019s a little something the gods use when they need oblivion. It\u2019s made by nymphs from the Island of the Lotus Eaters. If it so much as touches mortal skin you will feel its effects.\u201d</p><p>Kat took it gingerly, setting it down on the polished surface of a vanity desk. \u201cThanks, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d</p><p>The wind suddenly increased, causing the gauzy curtains that framed the balcony to billow diaphanously into the chamber, bringing with it the berserker\u2019s insane roars. Venus stepped closer to Kat and cupped her face with a smooth palm.</p><p>\u201cKatrina, I leave you with Love\u2019s blessing.\u201d Venus kissed Kat\u2019s forehead softly, and Kat felt a delicious surge of warmth and tenderness rush into her body.</p><p>As the goddess raised her hand, Kat suddenly remembered to ask, \u201cVenus, is Patroklos still alive?\u201d</p><p>The goddess smiled. \u201cAlive and recovering from surgery with Jacqueline nursemaiding him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bring them back unless I get this mess worked out,\u201d Kat said, although it hurt her heart to think about Jacky being a world away from her.</p><p>Venus nodded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014if something happens and I don\u2019t make it out of this, will you promise to take care of Jacky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Venus said. Then she lifted a slim brow. \u201cAnything else, my delightfully demanding mortal?\u201d</p><p>Kat chewed the side of her cheek and then decided, what the hell, she might as well go for it. \u201cYes. If I die\u2014this time for good\u2014would you let me go wherever it is that Achilles\u2019 soul goes? He\u2019s going to be lonely without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have my oath on it, Katrina. Should you die tomorrow I will personally escort your soul to the beauty of the Elysian Fields,\u201d Venus assured her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, that makes me feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die tomorrow, Kat, darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know that for sure?\u201d Kat asked hopefully. \u201cLike did a goddess oracle thing show you my future?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just call it Love\u2019s intuition. I see a happily ever after coming on.\u201d Venus raised her arm again, flicked her wrist and disappeared in a puff of glittery smoke.</p><p>Kat sighed. \u201cGreat, and now I know the origin of the saying: Love is blind.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus felt utterly hopeless. He\u2019d failed the princess who called herself Katrina, the Myrmidons, his own men and Achilles. Disquiet ran deeply through the army. No one, not a single man, approved of what Achilles was doing to Hector\u2019s body. The desecration of any dead angered the gods\u2014the desecration of an honorable warrior, a prince of royal blood, would doubtless cause retribution to rain upon them from Mount Olympus.</p><p>All of that was bad, but Odysseus had angered the gods before and never felt as he did that night. He knew why. It was Athena\u2019s betrayal that had sliced him to the bone. It didn\u2019t matter what Katrina had said. He recognized her words for what they were\u2014a kind attempt to reassure him. He knew better. Of course Athena had known about Patroklos\u2019s masquerade. She was Goddess of War. How could she not have known?</p><p>Odysseus sat heavily on the simple chair in his sparsely furnished tent. He stared into the goblet of wine he\u2019d poured himself, wishing he could divine answers from the blood-colored liquid.</p><p>The air in the tent changed, got warmer, sweeter, right before she materialized. It didn\u2019t matter that Odysseus braced himself before he gazed at her. His reaction was still the same as it had been since he\u2019d had his first glimpse of her when he was a young boy. Longing for her heated and sweetened his blood, just as it had the air around him.</p><p>\u201cMy Odysseus,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>She came to him and offered her hand. Odysseus took it in both of his. Dropping to one knee before his goddess, he closed his eyes, pressed his lips to her skin and inhaled her scent.</p><p>\u201cMy Goddess,\u201d he said. Then he opened his eyes, let loose her hand and stood. \u201cI\u2019m honored by your visit.\u201d His voice sounded as empty as his heart felt.</p><p>Odysseus had forgotten that his goddess knew him very, very well. Her gray eyes narrowed as she studied him.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t washed or changed your clothes from today\u2019s battle. You look terrible. What has happened?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus refilled his goblet, using his actions as an excuse not to meet her gaze. \u201cI think you know what happened today, Great Goddess. Achilles believes Patroklos to be dead. He has given himself over completely to the berserker. The princess, who told me today her real name is Katrina, tried to reach Achilles and she was rescued\u201d\u2014he pronounced the word sarcastically\u2014\u201cby Hector and his Trojans, and then Achilles cut down Hector. He is currently desecrating the prince\u2019s body.\u201d</p><p>Athena had gone very still. \u201cYou\u2019re angry at me.\u201d</p><p>He did meet her gaze then. \u201cI thought you loved me.\u201d</p><p>Odysseus saw the jolt of surprise his words caused the goddess to feel as she snapped an immediate response. \u201cI do love you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you loved me you would not have lied to me.\u201d</p><p>Athena didn\u2019t speak, but Odysseus saw the truth in her eyes. He\u2019d been right. She\u2019d known.</p><p>\u201cWere all the goddesses in on the joke you played on Achilles, or was it just Venus and you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a joke,\u201d Athena said, gray eyes flashing in anger. \u201cIt should have worked\u2014it should have ended the war.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might have worked if you had told me! Had I known I could have protected him!\u201d Odysseus shouted, all his pent-up emotions finally exploding. \u201cAm I worth so little to you that you do not trust me at all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo little!\u201d Athena began, then when her words caused the ground beneath them to shake and the sides of the tent to quiver dangerously, she drew a deep, calming breath and began again. \u201cYou are the only mortal man I have ever loved. Every day I live in fear of your mortality because I know that I must eventually surrender to Fate and lose you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut am I truly a man to you\u2014with a heart and soul and mind worthy of respect\u2014or am I simply your favorite plaything?\u201d he asked bitterly.</p><p>Her fair face flushed. \u201cHow can you say such a thing after what we have known together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say it because all mortals know the capriciousness of the gods.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I do not take human lovers on whim. I do not take any lover on whim. I thought you knew that\u2014I thought you knew me better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I did, too.\u201d He sounded defeated, and his wide shoulders slumped. \u201cBut you did not trust me with your confidence.\u201d</p><p>And then Athena, Goddess of War and Wisdom, shocked him utterly. She met his gaze and said, \u201cI was wrong. Forgive me. I should not have lied to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAthena, I\u2014\u201d He paused, struggling with joy so overwhelming that it clogged his throat and choked his words.</p><p>The gray-eyed goddess came to him and lay her head on his shoulder. \u201cMy Odysseus,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Odysseus held his goddess and forgave her. And then, while she lay beside him, Athena told Odysseus everything about Katrina, Achilles, Venus and Hera, and for the first time the Goddess of War discussed battle plans with a mortal, rather than commanding a mortal to obey her whim.</p><p>And Odysseus\u2019s heart soared.</p><p>Kat was so nervous her legs were wobbly. When the black of night had just begun to be relieved by a hint of gray, she poured the sleeping potion into a clay pottery jug half full of red wine, grabbed two goblets from a bedside dresser and left her room.</p><p>It was a mourning palace\u2014a palace of muffled tears and melancholy silence. The halls were deserted, lit only dimly by an occasional wall sconce. Unimpeded, Kat wandered, doing her best to keep heading in what she thought was the right direction. Her sense of direction had always been pretty good, but she was starting to believe she\u2019d never find the way to the niche in the wall when she turned a corner and saw a simply dressed middle-aged woman coming out of a side room.</p><p>\u201cMy lady, are you well? Is there something I can get for you?\u201d the servant asked, bobbing a quick curtsey and looking worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lost,\u201d Kat blurted. She\u2019d rehearsed in her head how she would react to the many different circumstances she could get herself into that night, and she\u2019d opted to stick as close to the truth as possible, deciding it would cut down on mistakes, if not babbling. \u201cI know it\u2019s silly, but I\u2019ve gotten confused. It\u2014it must be because I haven\u2019t had enough sleep since...\u201d Kat let her voice fade, finding it easy to look upset and scared and completely disoriented.</p><p>\u201cOh, my lady! Of course you\u2019re not yourself. Let me take you back to your chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould you lead me to the warriors who are watching over the gates instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe gate warriors? I don\u2019t understand, Princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that the two men guarding the, uh, levers that open the gates\u201d\u2014Kat mentally crossed her fingers, hoping that she wasn\u2019t saying anything too wrong\u2014\u201cwere key to my rescue.\u201d The servant\u2019s face was still an utter question mark, so Kat did the only thing she could think to do. She burst into tears. \u201cI have to thank them! Hector would want me to. It\u2019s just all so terrible.\u201d Kat sobbed.</p><p>\u201cOh, Princess! Please don\u2019t cry. You\u2019re home now, my lady. All will be well.\u201d The servant reached out hesitantly, as if she wanted to take Kat into her arms, but wasn\u2019t sure she dared.</p><p>\u201cWill you lead me to the gate warriors, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Princess. You\u2019re tired and overwrought, and you\u2019ve simply gotten yourself turned around. You\u2019ll see\u2014the gate room isn\u2019t far from here. You were almost there.\u201d</p><p>Keeping up a steady stream of soothing chatter, the servant led Kat around a turn in the hall, down a fork to the right and then stopped before a narrow archway. A door was open to a stone catwalk on which was built the wooden platform and the niche carved into the Trojan wall. Just as she had seen from her balcony, one warrior was positioned on guard on the platform, and another stood between the chain and the levers.</p><p>Kat sniffled and smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShall I wait for you, my lady, and be certain you find your way back to your chamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Thank you, but no. You were right. I\u2019d just gotten confused and upset. I know where I am now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good, my lady.\u201d The woman curtseyed, gave her one more worried look, and then retraced the path they had just taken, disappearing around the bend in the hallway.</p><p>Kat wiped her eyes with her sleeve, put on her best damsel-in-distress face, and went out onto the catwalk.</p><p>Both warriors snapped to attention. Neither of them spoke. Kat cleared her throat, pitching her voice to sound as young as possible.</p><p>\u201cHello. I came to thank the two of you.\u201d</p><p>She saw twin flickers of confusion in the men\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cFor saving me from\u2014\u201d She broke off and began to sob.</p><p>The men\u2019s confusion turned to panic.</p><p>\u201cPrincess Polyxena, there is no need. We did not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you did! You saved me! I could still be there, with the Greeks, in that horrible camp where they...\u201d Kat dissolved into unintelligible blubbering.</p><p>Both men looked helpless and rather pale.</p><p>\u201cPrincess,\u201d said the warrior who had been standing in the niche, but who had now joined the other warrior on the platform. \u201cYou are safe now. Our sacred walls will always protect you from the Greeks\u2014you have our oaths on that.\u201d</p><p>Feeling like the biggest ass in the known universe, Kat smiled innocent adoration at them through her tears. \u201cThank you, darlings,\u201d she said, sounding weirdly like Venus. Then, for the coup de grace, she finished with, \u201cI brought you wine from my own chamber.\u201d Kat handed them each a goblet and quickly poured a generous splash of wine for both. \u201cTo Trojan warriors!\u201d She shouted tearfully, raising her fist in the air.</p><p>The men glanced at each other. Kat could almost see their emotional shrugs. Then they repeated, \u201cTo Trojan warriors!\u201d and upended the goblets.</p><p>\u201cI feel so much better now,\u201d Kat babbled. \u201cHere, have some more.\u201d She\u2019d just begun to lift the jug to the first man\u2019s goblet when a look of shock widened his eyes. Kat glanced at the other man. His brow was furrowed, as if he had a question he\u2019d like to ask, but had forgotten what it was. Then both men swayed, and with surprisingly little sound, fell backward as if a giant hand had smacked them. Kat bent over them only long enough to see that they were snoring peacefully, then she retrieved one of their swords from where it had clattered on the platform between them. As she gripped the hilt Kat was surprised at how heavy it was, and was glad of the weight in her hand. Maybe it would help keep her trembling under control. She approached the levers and peered out of the long, narrow window onto the battlefield.</p><p>The night had gone from coal to slate, and with the gloaming had come Thetis\u2019s fog. It drifted across the battlefield like waves of mist, lapping against the olive grove, then, unhindered, poured out into the blood-crusted emptiness that surrounded the walls of Troy. It was dreamlike in its otherworldly beauty, but for whom the dream would morph into a nightmare was yet to be seen.</p><p>Kat saw shapes moving within the fog, darkness against darkness\u2014spectral forms that could be mist, men or madness, and before it all was the creature who had been Achilles, and was now the ultimate expression of nightmare.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t left the battlefield. He\u2019d driven the horses all night, around and around the walls of Troy dragging the prince\u2019s body, halting only when they fell to their knees and could go on no longer. Then he\u2019d demanded a new team. Automedon had brought fresh horses, and he\u2019d continued his grisly, monotonous journey. Kat knew, because she\u2019d watched from her window all night. She\u2019d felt like she had to. Someone who cared about Achilles, someone who believed in him, needed to keep watch over him.</p><p>Kat put her hands on the levers, closed her eyes and pulled them down.</p><p>The sound of the massive chains coming alive was jarringly loud in the guilty silence. She kept her eyes trained on the ghostly shapes she\u2019d glimpsed within the mist and soon she was sure she could make out the distinctive figure of Odysseus leading them closer and closer to the slowly opening walls. Even hidden by the magical fog, he had a light that seemed to surround him that had to be evidence of Athena\u2019s favor. Kat whispered a prayer to the goddess while she stared out at Odysseus. He\u2019s a good man, and he loves you very much. Try to keep him safe, Athena.</p><p>And then there was a shout below Kat. At the street level of the gate a man noticed the massive walls opening, even though there was no sight of the Trojan army mounted and ready to take to the field.</p><p>Kat hastily ran back to the door that opened to the catwalk and closed it, dropping a bar into place to secure it. Then she pulled the sleeping warriors inside the niche and pressed herself against the inner wall, trying to be inconspicuous, but the shouting got louder and louder as the gates, Sisyphus-like, pushed themselves relentlessly outward. Kat could see that already three men abreast could enter through the gates.</p><p>\u201cClose them! Fool! No one has ordered the gates open until midday!\u201d came the command from a powerful voice below her.</p><p>Kat shut them all out of her mind and counted slowly to ten: \u201cOne\u2014Mississippi, two\u2014Mississippi, three\u2014Mississippi, four\u2014Mississippi...\u201d When she finally got to ten\u2014Mississippi, men were pounding on the door to the catwalk.</p><p>Kat glanced down at the gates. Myrmidons, led by a shining Odysseus, were plunging into the city. Satisfied, Kat lifted the sword over her head with both hands, and then she brought it down with all her force, smashing it into the system of gears and chains and balances that the city had so meticulously refined over several hundred years. With a scream that sounded like a mad woman, the chain locked into place, and the wide open gates came to a groaning halt.</p><p>Now all that was left was Achilles and the final battle for his soul. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The door to the catwalk burst open. Kat had positioned herself between the bodies of the two sleeping warriors. At the first sight of the men, she drew a tremendous breath and let loose the most ear-shattering girl scream she could conjure. Then she rolled her eyeballs up in her head and fell down in a faint worthy of Scarlett O\u2019Hara.</p><p>She continued to play possum as a warrior lifted her and carried her from the room amid much discussion of what could have possibly happened\u2014the general consensus of which was that there must be divine mischief afoot. Kat slitted her eyes and peeked over the warrior\u2019s shoulder to see the other men milling impotently around the broken gears.</p><p>Halfway to her chamber Kat roused. \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d she asked faintly. Then she gasped and began to struggle. \u201cPut me down! Where are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>The warrior put her down as if she\u2019d caught on fire. \u201cPrincess, you were found in the gate room. You and the warriors were unconscious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe gate room?\u201d Kat looked hysterically around, letting her eyes fill with tears. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Noise from the battle that was raging in the city drifted up to them. Kat clutched at her throat, looking like she was going to faint again. \u201cWhat is that sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, the gate was opened. The city has been breeched.\u201d</p><p>Kat let out a shriek and swayed dramatically.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, let me take you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! You have to go help them keep the Greeks from the palace! Go! I\u2019ll find my father.\u201d When he hesitated she added, \u201cHurry!\u201d turned and whirled away down the hall. Thankfully he didn\u2019t follow her.</p> <p>Kat\u2019s heart hurt as she made her way, playing the hysterical princess, from the palace. It was easier than she imagined it would be. Chaos ruled. There was mass panic. Women screamed, darting hysterically into and then out of the streets when they glimpsed Greek warriors. The women needn\u2019t have worried, at least not at that moment. The Greeks were too busy engaging in bloody pockets of fighting with desperate Trojans to bother with the raping part of raping and pillaging. The stones of the city streets were slick with blood. Fire colored the dawn, turning the world scarlet.</p><p>The great front gates were wide open, belching Greek warriors. Kat pressed herself against the wall of the city, searching desperately for a familiar face. Finally she noticed a knot of Myrmidons fighting not far from her and she pushed herself through the seething mass of warriors, swallowing down debilitating fear as she dodged bloody swords and dismembered bodies.</p><p>\u201cMyrmidons! Help me!\u201d she cried as she struggled to get closer to them.</p><p>First one helmeted head lifted, and then another. She saw eyes widened as they recognized her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Achilles\u2019 princess!\u201d Diomedes shouted. As one, the Myrmidons moved to her and surrounded her in a protective circle.</p><p>\u201cGet me to Achilles. I have to try to reach him again.\u201d</p> <p>Diomedes\u2019 incredulous look was mirrored in the other men. \u201cPrincess, Achilles is gone. No one has been able to reach him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can,\u201d she said firmly. Kat grabbed the young warrior\u2019s bloody forearm. \u201cYou have to let me try, and we have to hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, let us get you safely from this place. You can return to Phthia with us, and be honored there for the love our lord had for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiomedes! Don\u2019t give up on him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake her to Achilles,\u201d said one of the warriors whose name Kat couldn\u2019t remember.</p><p>Automedon stepped forward, nodding briefly to her. \u201cI say take her to Achilles, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d said another man.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d chorused several others.</p> <p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Diomedes said. \u201cLet\u2019s get her to Achilles. Form up!\u201d</p><p>Moving inside the phalanx of men was an eerily familiar sensation. With the Myrmidons surrounding her, Kat pushed easily through the gates, glad that the broad shoulders and protective shields of the men shielded her view of the mayhem. Caused by me, her mind berated her. But I\u2019m ending the war! she shouted back at herself. At what cost? her guilt whispered.</p><p>The berserker\u2019s roar shattered her internal struggle.</p><p>Kat pushed on Automedon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLet me though\u2014let me see him.\u201d</p><p>The men parted enough for Kat to see that Achilles was still dragging Hector\u2019s deteriorating body behind his chariot, but he was also engaging in the battle by picking off any unfortunate Trojan who had managed to fight his way through the city gates.</p><p>\u201cYou have to force him out of the chariot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2014\u201d Automedon began.</p><p>\u201cEncircle the chariot. The princess and I will do the rest.\u201d Kat looked up to see Odysseus had joined the Myrmidons. \u201cNow. Spread out around him. I\u2019ll protect her while you\u2019re getting into place.\u201d</p><p>The Myrmidons obeyed Odysseus, leaving her alone with the warrior.</p><p>\u201cI know how you can reach him,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cTell me,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cIt has to be through love. Don\u2019t think about calming him\u2014it\u2019s gone beyond that. Don\u2019t try to reason with him and explain about Patroklos\u2014he won\u2019t listen. Just make him know that, no matter what else has happened and will happen in your lives, he can count on your love. He has to believe that you value him above everything else. That you see him as truly worthy of you will be what reaches him.\u201d</p><p>Kat looked into the famous warrior\u2019s eyes and knew that he was speaking from his heart, soul and experience. She smiled. \u201cShe loves you.\u201d</p><p>In the midst of chaos, Odysseus\u2019s eyes sparkled as if he was a worry-free boy again. \u201cShe does, indeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess!\u201d Diomedes called.</p><p>Kat and Odysseus glanced up. The Myrmidons had Achilles circled. He\u2019d stopped insanely driving the horses. Now he stood in the chariot, growling at his men.</p><p>Odysseus held out one hand to her. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I\u2019ll ever be.\u201d Kat took his hand, gripping it hard as if Odysseus\u2019s strength could be transferred into her body through their palms.</p><p>Odysseus led her through the circle of warriors. He stopped just inside the line of men.</p><p>\u201cAchilles!\u201d he shouted. \u201cI have something that belongs to you!\u201d</p><p>Snarling, Achilles whirled to face them. His blazing red eyes narrowed as he caught sight of Katrina. With terrible speed he stalked forward.</p><p>Kat gave herself no time to think\u2014no time to hesitate\u2014no time to reconsider. She squeezed Odysseus\u2019s hand, then dropped it and stepped forward to meet the beast. She saw the flash of surprise in those blood-colored eyes, and then the surprise was replaced by satisfaction. He reached her quickly, grabbing her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cNow, woman, I will taste you.\u201d</p><p>Kat gazed up into his ravaged face. It had gotten worse over the past twenty-four hours. The berserker\u2019s possession had become even more physically pronounced. His skin was stretched tight, his lips were permanently curled to expose teeth that were more fang-like than human. His head appeared bulbous, as if it were literally trying to change shape. And covering this nightmare visage was gore and filth and the putrid odor of death.</p><p>She stepped into his arms, sliding her hands up and around his grotesquely misshapen shoulders. \u201cThere is no reason for this rage, Achilles. There is no battle here.\u201d The monster hesitated. She could feel the tremor that quaked through his body. Kat focused all the love and desire and need she had for the complex soul who was still within the tormented body\u2014her Achilles, the man who believed he had never been good enough and only thought of himself as almost a leader... almost a husband... almost a hero... and not ever truly worthy of love. She smiled. \u201cI love you, Achilles. It isn\u2019t a dream. Come back to me.\u201d Then she pulled his ravaged face down to hers and kissed him.</p><p>That Agamemnon had pronounced Patroklos\u2019s death and had been the mouthpiece that had sealed his fate had, by that time, been but an irony and irritant to Achilles. He\u2019d known he couldn\u2019t escape his destiny. Yes, for Katrina\u2019s sake he\u2019d pretended to believe in the dream, but it had been only that, just a waking dream he\u2019d been allowed to visit temporarily. Like all dreams, by its very nature, it must end.</p><p>He let his despair at losing Katrina couple with the pain his cousin\u2019s death caused, breeding rage, and then Achilles gave himself over to it. For the first time he didn\u2019t hold on to his humanity. Instead he welcomed the glowing scarlet fire of the berserker, letting the creature fill him and burn away his agony. Achilles became rage, embracing the fate that had haunted him for more than a decade. The man retreated to the farthest reaches of his soul where he waited for inevitable death to free him.</p><p>The light of consciousness had nudged him once and the man had stirred, but then rage exploded, searing humanity and blinding him again.</p><p>When the light returned it came not simply in the form of a brightness that shined through the darkness of the berserker\u2019s red rage. This time it was Katrina\u2019s voice, a shimmering beacon of cool water that extinguished the berserker\u2019s fire, washing a path of love from the external to Achilles\u2019 spirit, the man within the man.</p><p>Achilles\u2019 vision returned to him in a shocking rush. Katrina was standing within his arms.</p><p>Completely disorientated, Achilles could feel the wrongness in his body and the hideous changes the berserker had wrought. He wanted to fling her away from him and then find a place deep within the seas where he could hide himself forever.</p><p>And then Katrina smiled. \u201cI love you, Achilles. It isn\u2019t a dream. Come back to me.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled his face down to hers and kissed him, Katrina kicked away the crutches of rage that had sustained him, leaving Achilles with only his humanity and her love as his support. He wrapped his arms around her and returned the kiss.</p><p>She leaned back enough to look into his eyes. He knew what she would see. Though his consciousness had returned, his body had been ravaged, permanently changed by the complete possession of rage. He braced for her rejection, promising himself that he would fight off the berserker until he got Katrina to safety.</p><p>She smiled again, this time followed by a beautiful, joyous laugh. \u201cI knew you would come back to me!\u201d Kat threw herself into his arms, hugging him hard. \u201cAchilles, Patroklos isn\u2019t dead. I give you my word\u2014he\u2019s alive and well and with Jacky.\u201d</p><p>Elated, Achilles held her fiercely. Patroklos was alive and Katrina loved him despite everything!</p><p>Then his brain processed what his eyes were seeing and he pulled gently away from her, looking disbelievingly at a world utterly changed. The Trojan gates were open wide and the city was afire. And he remembered none of it. Always before when he\u2019d returned to himself Achilles had remembered everything the berserker had done, as if it had been a play he\u2019d been observing. This time, there was nothing, only a charred spot burned out of his memory.</p><p>Dazed, Achilles realized he and Katrina were standing in the center of a circle of his warriors. Behind him was his chariot and tied to the rear of it was a bloody body that\u2014</p><p>\u201cAchilles! My friend!\u201d Odysseus was suddenly there, grasping his forearm. \u201cIt\u2019s true. He\u2019s returned!\u201d He shouted to the ring of Myrmidons, who broke ranks and approached him more hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d Achilles asked.</p><p>\u201cThe princess opened the gates. Troy has fallen,\u201d Odysseus said.</p><p>\u201cYou did this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I had a little help from the goddesses, but basically, yes,\u201d Kat said. Achilles thought she looked extremely uncomfortable and wondered about the full story, hoping he would have years, decades, to ask her about it.</p><p>Then his eyes were drawn to the desecrated body. There was something about the dead warrior...</p><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><p>Odysseus hesitated. Kat looked obviously upset. And he knew.</p><p>\u201cHector. I killed him.\u201d Achilles felt a sweep of horror. \u201cAnd then I desecrated his body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Kat said firmly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, gods! Why was I allowed to do this?\u201d Achilles walked slowly over to Hector\u2019s body. He bowed his head, warring with his feelings, refusing to allow the berserker another opportunity to spread more destruction. He spoke to the body. \u201cYou were a valiant warrior and honorable prince. I give you my oath that I will make this right. I will build a funeral pyre to you so great that even Mount Olympus will feel its heat.\u201d</p><p>The stabbing, terrible pain in his leg shocked a cry from Achilles. He tried to turn around, to crouch defensively, but the spear had skewered him through the ankle, pinning him to the ground. Clutching uselessly at the deeply imbedded spear, he twisted his body and saw the young, slender man, eyes wide with hatred and madness, draw the bow and let fly a flaming arrow covered in tar.</p><p>\u201cDie, monster!\u201d Paris screamed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The arrow hit Achilles in the middle of his chest, impaling itself to the flaming quill, spilling molten tar down his body like overflowing lava. Through the agony, Achilles heard Katrina scream and saw her rushing to him as the Myrmidons converged on Paris, burying him under an avalanche of swords and blood.</p><p>The berserker, so newly banished, slammed back into his body. Achilles fought the possession, but as his body began to burn, the pain overwhelmed him. Then Katrina\u2019s face swam before him, and through the red haze he watched her snap the golden chain from around her neck and wrench open the locket.</p><p>\u201cVenus! Hera! Athena! I call the three of you to me to claim the boon you swore you would owe me!\u201d</p><p>The air shimmered, like mist rising from a morning field, and the three goddesses appeared as Achilles was driven to his knees. Body and mind afire, he still struggled against being lost to the berserker.</p> <p>\u201cI fulfilled my part of the deal,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThe boon I want is Achilles. I claim the man and ask that you save him from the monster.\u201d</p><p>Achilles began to lose hope when the goddesses exchanged surprised looks. It was too much. Katrina had tried. He had tried. His fate was unavoidable\u2014what had been purposed by the gods could not be changed, not even by the gods themselves. He closed his eyes, concentrating on maintaining his humanity. He wanted to die a man, not a monster.</p><p>\"Please.\u201d Kat looked pleadingly at each of the goddesses.</p><p>\u201cDarling, if you choose this you cannot return to your old life,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYou will live and die in this ancient world,\u201d Athena said.</p> <p>\u201cBe very sure this is your wish,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been surer about anything in my life,\u201d Kat said. \u201cPlease save him.\u201d</p><p>Venus smiled. \u201cYou have already saved him. Take his hand and call him to you.\u201d</p><p>Venus blew a kiss at her, and Kat felt the shock of divine power fill her body. She hurried to Achilles. His body was completely engulfed in fire, but she didn\u2019t hesitate. She reached through the flames and grasped his hand. She felt no heat, no pain, only the surety of her love for him.</p><p>\u201cCome to me, Achilles.\u201d Her voice reverberated across the Trojan plain, magnified by the magic of the goddesses.</p><p>Kat felt Achilles shudder. Something gave under her hand. Automatically she pulled, and from the burning, ruined body of the berserker-ravaged warrior stepped a golden man. He was smaller in stature than Achilles, and he looked years younger. His body was free of scars. His eyes were a brilliant, clear blue. Gone were the pain and despair, regret and guilt that had been his companions for more than a decade. He gazed at Kat with an expression of happiness so complete that her heart felt as if it would burst with joy. Achilles pulled her into his arms and kissed her tenderly. Then, still holding her hand, he faced the three goddesses. Achilles dropped to one knee. The men around him followed suit. The fighting stopped and all eyes turned to the goddesses.</p> <p>\u201cMy name will not be remembered for thousands of years, but I pledge that my children will honor goddesses for as long as my blood runs through their veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, darling, your name will be remembered forever,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Goddess.\u201d He pointed back at the burning body that had been reduced to smoldering ash. \u201cThat is Achilles. I am only a man, not a legend, not a myth and definitely not a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have discovered that being a man means being more than any of those things,\u201d Athena said, her gray eyes finding Odysseus.</p><p>\u201cGo with our blessings, mortal man. And know that when love is strong enough it can even cause Fate to change her course,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Still clasping hands, Achilles and Katrina walked from the battlefield with the Myrmidons silently following them. The armies, Trojan and Greek, parted to let them pass. The fighting, after almost a decade, was finally over.</p><p>So it was with no little sense of shock that Kat heard an ear-piercing scream. They were in the middle of the dunes between the Greek and Myrmidon camps when a small party of soldiers stumbled into view. There were two women with them. One was being led by a rope around her slender, white neck. She held her head high and ignored everyone and everything around her. The other woman was hurling herself against the man leading the others\u2014it was she who was shrieking and crying.</p><p>Kat recognized the hysterical woman instantly. \u201cHoly crap, it\u2019s Briseis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done for you, you dare cast me aside for Cassandra! A witch!\u201d Briseis railed at Agamemnon.</p><p>The king called the line of warriors to a halt. \u201cBriseis, I have already assured you that I will arrange for your return to your father and will send with you a handsome bride price. Your father will be able to make an excellent match for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a reprobate! The reason that I\u2019m here is that I fled his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again I say that is not my concern.\u201d Agamemnon motioned to his personal guard. \u201cEscort my lady to the ship I have provided, and see her safely off with the next tide.\u201d</p><p>The warriors saluted him. With utterly blank expressions, they began to drag Briseis away.</p><p>\u201cI curse you, Agamemnon! You reject love, so love will be your downfall!\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon yawned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too late. I\u2019ve already been cursed by love once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking asshole,\u201d Kat murmured.</p><p>As if he heard her, Agamemnon\u2019s gaze turned her way. Kat watched his eyes glance past Achilles, discount him and then widen in disbelief and return to him. She looked up at her lover. His lips were curved up in his little half smile as he met the king\u2019s shocked gaze.</p><p>\u201cMake that three times you\u2019ve been cursed by love,\u201d Achilles said. He didn\u2019t shout, but his voice carried easily over the dune. \u201cYou deserve no less than to be destroyed by that which you thought to use against others.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon paled, called an order to his men and the group hurried away toward the Greek camp.</p><p>Achilles glanced at Kat as they continued walking. \u201cWas it you who cursed him the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d Achilles said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could remember what happens to Agamemnon,\u201d Kat said softly to Achilles as they came to the Myrmidon beach where the black-sailed ships were docked just offshore. \u201cWell, I suppose I mean what happened to him according to Greek mythology. You know, Jacky is just as bad at mythology as I was, which is...\u201d Kat ran out of words as the heartsick truth hit her. Jacky was still in the modern world.</p><p>\u201cRemind them,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the goddesses grant Jacqueline a boon, too? Remind them, and if it is her wish, they will return her.\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cAnd Patroklos.\u201d</p><p>He mirrored her smile. \u201cAnd Patroklos.\u201d</p><p>She opened the locket that she still gripped in her fist. \u201cUh, Venus. Sorry to bug you again, but I think the three of you forgot that Jacky gets a boon, too. And I know for a fact that she would like to come back here with Patroklos. So, if it\u2019s not too much trouble I\u2019d really appreciate it if\u2014\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt pop Jacky and Patroklos materialized on the beach in front of them. Jacky was wearing an exceedingly short, tight, nurse\u2019s \u201cuniform.\u201d The kind that can be found in smut shops, especially around Halloween, complete with white thigh highs, garters and red come-fuck-me pumps. She was obviously in the middle of a very nasty bump and grind and was caught midfling of her long, waving, blond tresses. Patroklos, who materialized sitting on his butt in the sand, was wearing an open-backed hospital robe. He was sporting several different sizes and shapes of bandages, the most evident of which was wrapped around his neck. Patroklos was very obviously alive and very, very obviously firmly in the middle of a recovery stage.</p><p>Jacky blinked and looked around, eyes widening. \u201cOh, Jesus wept! Could you not have waited a few minutes or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky!\u201d Kat cried, hurling herself into her friend\u2019s arms while Achilles and the Myrmidons descended upon Patroklos, thumping him not so gently on the back and commenting on his strange manner of dress.</p><p>Kat was happily telling Jacky how utterly stank she was when the sea began to boil. Achilles moved swiftly to her side, pushing the complaining, mostly naked Patroklos behind him with Kat and Jacky and shouting for the Myrmidons to form ranks as the god arose from the cove.</p><p>Kat had never seen, never even imagined anything like the being who towered out of the sea over them. He was huge. Instead of skin he had scales that were shaded all the colors of the oceans. His white beard curled down to his massive chest, matching his thick hair that fell in ringlets around his shoulders. Barnacles made of diamonds and sapphires and aquamarines decorated his body. He was carrying a trident carved from red coral, which he lifted and then thudded against the sea floor, causing waves to froth in the normally placid cove, and making the Myrmidon fleet bob precariously like a petulant child\u2019s bathtub toys.</p><p>\u201cThe walls of Troy have been breeched!\u201d His voice boomed across the water. \u201cThey no longer keep out the Greeks, so they will also no longer keep out the sea. This is one oath old Priam cannot ignore.\u201d The god lifted his trident again, as if he was getting ready to lead a charge, but the clearing of a lovely voice from behind him had him hesitating and looking around.</p><p>The beautiful Thetis of the Silver Feet stepped delicately forward, gliding over the top of the waves as if she was strolling on dry land. \u201cPoseidon, wouldn\u2019t you like to reward the mortal who has finally given you Troy?\u201d she said.</p><p>Poseidon lifted his bushy white brows. \u201cI would, indeed, lovely Thetis.\u201d</p><p>Thetis glanced in their direction. Achilles gave his mother a respectful nod and then took Kat\u2019s hand and moved up to the shoreline. He bowed deeply to Poseidon.</p><p>Poseidon inclined his head familiarly. \u201cAchilles, it is with glad eyes that I see you have shaken off my brother\u2019s curse. For your mother\u2019s sake I am pleased that the berserker is no more. So what reward do I owe you for breeching the walls of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat God of the Seas, I thank you for your kind offer, but it is not me to whom you owe a reward.\u201d Achilles took Kat\u2019s arm and presented her to Poseidon. \u201cThis mortal woman is responsible for delivering to you the walls of Troy.\u201d</p><p>Poseidon stared down at her. Kat wasn\u2019t sure of correct protocol, but she bobbed a nervous curtsey.</p><p>\u201cThis small mortal woman did what an entire army of Greeks could not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Poseidon bent so he could get a better look at her, then his eyes widened. \u201cYou! But you are the Trojan princess, Polyxena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear I am,\u201d Kat said calmly.</p><p>\u201cThen it also appears I owe you a double boon\u2014one for bringing me the walls of Troy and another for a slight, ur, misunderstanding earlier that could have ended very badly without divine intervention.\u201d The god actually seemed chagrined, giving Thetis an apologetic look. Then he turned his attention back to Kat. \u201cSo, Princess, what reward do you choose? I offer you anything within the wide seas of the world as yours.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s gaze met Achilles\u2019. \u201cChoose for us, my princess,\u201d he said. She looked over her shoulder at Jacky and Patroklos, who nodded and smiled at her.</p><p>She drew a deep breath. \u201cI know exactly what I want. I want you to give me an island that can be hidden from the world\u2014a separate place of unimaginable beauty dedicated to healing and peace and the goddesses.\u201d</p><p>Poseidon stroked his beard while he considered. \u201cI believe I do have such an island, but it is far from here. In another time\u2014another place.\u201d</p><p>Kat squeezed Achilles\u2019 hand. \u201cThe farther away, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come!\u201d Poseidon waved a hand over the cove. The black-sailed Myrmidon ships scattered like autumn leaves as a shining ship made of pearl surged to the surface from beneath the ocean depths. The waters of the cove parted, leaving a sidewalk of dry land leading to the glistening iridescent ship.</p><p>Achilles faced his men. \u201cI can no longer lead you. That Achilles died in flames on the Trojan battlefield. I want no more battles\u2014no more glory. I want only the magic of peace. If that is what you want for your lives, you are free to join me.\u201d His half smile flickered. \u201cBut only if you are willing to bow to the goddesses.\u201d Then he took Kat\u2019s hand, and they started down the god-made path, with Jacky and Patroklos following immediately behind them.</p><p>Kat glanced back and was pleased to see that almost every Myrmidon and several of their war-prize brides, Aetnia included, were choosing to take the path to the pearl boat, too.</p><p>\u201cUm, Poseidon?\u201d Jacky called as the last of the Myrmidons boarded and she and Kat, Patroklos and Achilles had moved to the bow of the ship.</p><p>The God of the Seas peered down at Jacky, his bushy brows lifting when he saw what she was wearing. \u201cYes, mortal woman with the unusual costume, you have a question for Poseidon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was wondering, does this island you\u2019re giving the, uh, princess have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, indeed. The mortals call it Avalon.\u201d</p><p>Kat and Jacky exchanged stunned looks.</p><p>\u201cJesus wept,\u201d Jacky whispered, fanning herself and leaning weakly back against Patroklos. \u201cMy heart! I feel my heart going again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit,\u201d Kat said, shaking her head numbly.</p><p>\u201cMy god, Kat! I can\u2019t wait to meet the locals,\u201d Jacky said, laughing softly.</p><p>Achilles\u2019 arms went around Kat. \u201cIs all well? Do you know this island called Avalon?\u201d</p><p>Feeling dazed, Kat looked into his beautiful eyes. \u201cI do. And it is utterly, completely, perfect.\u201d</p><p>She pulled Achilles down to her and kissed him while Poseidon waved his hand over the cove and the waters returned to normal as the pearl ship began to glide seaward into a bank of fog that shimmered and rippled magically. \u201cI wish you a good voyage and a blessed future!\u201d the God of the Seas called.</p><p>\u201cKat, stop making out and look at this. I do believe we\u2019re sailing into something that is less than normal,\u201d Jacky said, thumping Kat on her back.</p><p>Kat turned, but stayed within Achilles\u2019 arms, and looked out at the rippling magic of their future. \u201cI think we\u2019d better just forget about what we used to think of as normal,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jacky snuggled against Patroklos\u2019s side. Kat was glad to see that the warriors had pieced together something for him to wear\u2014although the hospital gown had revealed a nice view of his firm backside.</p><p>\u201cFine with me. I\u2019ve never liked normal,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you\u2019ve never been normal,\u201d Kat teased.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to rename me,\u201d Achilles said abruptly. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to taint our new life, so Achilles is a name that must forever die at Troy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Jacky said. Three sets of eyes turned to her. \u201cI think you should name him Angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, you are a very troubled woman. Get over your Buffy addiction\u2014it\u2019s just not right,\u201d Kat said while the two men looked confused.</p><p>\u201cI did not mean Angel as in Buffy. I meant Angel as in fallen. Please! He doesn\u2019t even have dark hair,\u201d Jacky grumbled.</p><p>Kat shook her head in disgust. \u201cI seriously do not think so. Anyway, I have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will you call me?\u201d Achilles asked.</p><p>Kat turned in his arms. \u201cWhat do you think of Kirk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKirk...\u201d Achilles tested the name. \u201cI think I like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like the name of a leader,\u201d Patroklos said.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d Kat asked Jacky.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you give me a hard time about my Buffy issue, Ms. Star Trek,\u201d Jacky said.</p><p>\u201cBut you think it\u2019s a good choice, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kat grinned mischievously at her best friend.</p><p>Jacky laughed. \u201cWhat I think is that our future is going to be anything but boring.\u201d</p><p>And the magical fog closed around the pearl ship, carrying them away to a new time... and new place... and a future that was definitely not boring. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The arrow hit Achilles in the middle of his chest, impaling itself to the flaming quill, spilling molten tar down his body like overflowing lava. Through the agony, Achilles heard Katrina scream and saw her rushing to him as the Myrmidons converged on Paris, burying him under an avalanche of swords and blood.</p><p>The berserker, so newly banished, slammed back into his body. Achilles fought the possession, but as his body began to burn, the pain overwhelmed him. Then Katrina\u2019s face swam before him, and through the red haze he watched her snap the golden chain from around her neck and wrench open the locket.</p><p>\u201cVenus! Hera! Athena! I call the three of you to me to claim the boon you swore you would owe me!\u201d</p><p>The air shimmered, like mist rising from a morning field, and the three goddesses appeared as Achilles was driven to his knees. Body and mind afire, he still struggled against being lost to the berserker.</p> <p>\u201cI fulfilled my part of the deal,\u201d Kat said. \u201cThe boon I want is Achilles. I claim the man and ask that you save him from the monster.\u201d</p><p>Achilles began to lose hope when the goddesses exchanged surprised looks. It was too much. Katrina had tried. He had tried. His fate was unavoidable\u2014what had been purposed by the gods could not be changed, not even by the gods themselves. He closed his eyes, concentrating on maintaining his humanity. He wanted to die a man, not a monster.</p><p>\"Please.\u201d Kat looked pleadingly at each of the goddesses.</p><p>\u201cDarling, if you choose this you cannot return to your old life,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cYou will live and die in this ancient world,\u201d Athena said.</p> <p>\u201cBe very sure this is your wish,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been surer about anything in my life,\u201d Kat said. \u201cPlease save him.\u201d</p><p>Venus smiled. \u201cYou have already saved him. Take his hand and call him to you.\u201d</p><p>Venus blew a kiss at her, and Kat felt the shock of divine power fill her body. She hurried to Achilles. His body was completely engulfed in fire, but she didn\u2019t hesitate. She reached through the flames and grasped his hand. She felt no heat, no pain, only the surety of her love for him.</p><p>\u201cCome to me, Achilles.\u201d Her voice reverberated across the Trojan plain, magnified by the magic of the goddesses.</p><p>Kat felt Achilles shudder. Something gave under her hand. Automatically she pulled, and from the burning, ruined body of the berserker-ravaged warrior stepped a golden man. He was smaller in stature than Achilles, and he looked years younger. His body was free of scars. His eyes were a brilliant, clear blue. Gone were the pain and despair, regret and guilt that had been his companions for more than a decade. He gazed at Kat with an expression of happiness so complete that her heart felt as if it would burst with joy. Achilles pulled her into his arms and kissed her tenderly. Then, still holding her hand, he faced the three goddesses. Achilles dropped to one knee. The men around him followed suit. The fighting stopped and all eyes turned to the goddesses.</p> <p>\u201cMy name will not be remembered for thousands of years, but I pledge that my children will honor goddesses for as long as my blood runs through their veins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, darling, your name will be remembered forever,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cNo, Goddess.\u201d He pointed back at the burning body that had been reduced to smoldering ash. \u201cThat is Achilles. I am only a man, not a legend, not a myth and definitely not a god.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have discovered that being a man means being more than any of those things,\u201d Athena said, her gray eyes finding Odysseus.</p><p>\u201cGo with our blessings, mortal man. And know that when love is strong enough it can even cause Fate to change her course,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Still clasping hands, Achilles and Katrina walked from the battlefield with the Myrmidons silently following them. The armies, Trojan and Greek, parted to let them pass. The fighting, after almost a decade, was finally over.</p><p>So it was with no little sense of shock that Kat heard an ear-piercing scream. They were in the middle of the dunes between the Greek and Myrmidon camps when a small party of soldiers stumbled into view. There were two women with them. One was being led by a rope around her slender, white neck. She held her head high and ignored everyone and everything around her. The other woman was hurling herself against the man leading the others\u2014it was she who was shrieking and crying.</p><p>Kat recognized the hysterical woman instantly. \u201cHoly crap, it\u2019s Briseis.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter all I\u2019ve done for you, you dare cast me aside for Cassandra! A witch!\u201d Briseis railed at Agamemnon.</p><p>The king called the line of warriors to a halt. \u201cBriseis, I have already assured you that I will arrange for your return to your father and will send with you a handsome bride price. Your father will be able to make an excellent match for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father is a reprobate! The reason that I\u2019m here is that I fled his house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd again I say that is not my concern.\u201d Agamemnon motioned to his personal guard. \u201cEscort my lady to the ship I have provided, and see her safely off with the next tide.\u201d</p><p>The warriors saluted him. With utterly blank expressions, they began to drag Briseis away.</p><p>\u201cI curse you, Agamemnon! You reject love, so love will be your downfall!\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon yawned. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019re too late. I\u2019ve already been cursed by love once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking asshole,\u201d Kat murmured.</p><p>As if he heard her, Agamemnon\u2019s gaze turned her way. Kat watched his eyes glance past Achilles, discount him and then widen in disbelief and return to him. She looked up at her lover. His lips were curved up in his little half smile as he met the king\u2019s shocked gaze.</p><p>\u201cMake that three times you\u2019ve been cursed by love,\u201d Achilles said. He didn\u2019t shout, but his voice carried easily over the dune. \u201cYou deserve no less than to be destroyed by that which you thought to use against others.\u201d</p><p>Agamemnon paled, called an order to his men and the group hurried away toward the Greek camp.</p><p>Achilles glanced at Kat as they continued walking. \u201cWas it you who cursed him the first time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it,\u201d Achilles said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI wish I could remember what happens to Agamemnon,\u201d Kat said softly to Achilles as they came to the Myrmidon beach where the black-sailed ships were docked just offshore. \u201cWell, I suppose I mean what happened to him according to Greek mythology. You know, Jacky is just as bad at mythology as I was, which is...\u201d Kat ran out of words as the heartsick truth hit her. Jacky was still in the modern world.</p><p>\u201cRemind them,\u201d Achilles said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Kat said.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the goddesses grant Jacqueline a boon, too? Remind them, and if it is her wish, they will return her.\u201d</p><p>Kat grinned. \u201cAnd Patroklos.\u201d</p><p>He mirrored her smile. \u201cAnd Patroklos.\u201d</p><p>She opened the locket that she still gripped in her fist. \u201cUh, Venus. Sorry to bug you again, but I think the three of you forgot that Jacky gets a boon, too. And I know for a fact that she would like to come back here with Patroklos. So, if it\u2019s not too much trouble I\u2019d really appreciate it if\u2014\u201d</p><p>With an abrupt pop Jacky and Patroklos materialized on the beach in front of them. Jacky was wearing an exceedingly short, tight, nurse\u2019s \u201cuniform.\u201d The kind that can be found in smut shops, especially around Halloween, complete with white thigh highs, garters and red come-fuck-me pumps. She was obviously in the middle of a very nasty bump and grind and was caught midfling of her long, waving, blond tresses. Patroklos, who materialized sitting on his butt in the sand, was wearing an open-backed hospital robe. He was sporting several different sizes and shapes of bandages, the most evident of which was wrapped around his neck. Patroklos was very obviously alive and very, very obviously firmly in the middle of a recovery stage.</p><p>Jacky blinked and looked around, eyes widening. \u201cOh, Jesus wept! Could you not have waited a few minutes or so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacky!\u201d Kat cried, hurling herself into her friend\u2019s arms while Achilles and the Myrmidons descended upon Patroklos, thumping him not so gently on the back and commenting on his strange manner of dress.</p><p>Kat was happily telling Jacky how utterly stank she was when the sea began to boil. Achilles moved swiftly to her side, pushing the complaining, mostly naked Patroklos behind him with Kat and Jacky and shouting for the Myrmidons to form ranks as the god arose from the cove.</p><p>Kat had never seen, never even imagined anything like the being who towered out of the sea over them. He was huge. Instead of skin he had scales that were shaded all the colors of the oceans. His white beard curled down to his massive chest, matching his thick hair that fell in ringlets around his shoulders. Barnacles made of diamonds and sapphires and aquamarines decorated his body. He was carrying a trident carved from red coral, which he lifted and then thudded against the sea floor, causing waves to froth in the normally placid cove, and making the Myrmidon fleet bob precariously like a petulant child\u2019s bathtub toys.</p><p>\u201cThe walls of Troy have been breeched!\u201d His voice boomed across the water. \u201cThey no longer keep out the Greeks, so they will also no longer keep out the sea. This is one oath old Priam cannot ignore.\u201d The god lifted his trident again, as if he was getting ready to lead a charge, but the clearing of a lovely voice from behind him had him hesitating and looking around.</p><p>The beautiful Thetis of the Silver Feet stepped delicately forward, gliding over the top of the waves as if she was strolling on dry land. \u201cPoseidon, wouldn\u2019t you like to reward the mortal who has finally given you Troy?\u201d she said.</p><p>Poseidon lifted his bushy white brows. \u201cI would, indeed, lovely Thetis.\u201d</p><p>Thetis glanced in their direction. Achilles gave his mother a respectful nod and then took Kat\u2019s hand and moved up to the shoreline. He bowed deeply to Poseidon.</p><p>Poseidon inclined his head familiarly. \u201cAchilles, it is with glad eyes that I see you have shaken off my brother\u2019s curse. For your mother\u2019s sake I am pleased that the berserker is no more. So what reward do I owe you for breeching the walls of Troy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat God of the Seas, I thank you for your kind offer, but it is not me to whom you owe a reward.\u201d Achilles took Kat\u2019s arm and presented her to Poseidon. \u201cThis mortal woman is responsible for delivering to you the walls of Troy.\u201d</p><p>Poseidon stared down at her. Kat wasn\u2019t sure of correct protocol, but she bobbed a nervous curtsey.</p><p>\u201cThis small mortal woman did what an entire army of Greeks could not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Kat said.</p><p>Poseidon bent so he could get a better look at her, then his eyes widened. \u201cYou! But you are the Trojan princess, Polyxena.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would appear I am,\u201d Kat said calmly.</p><p>\u201cThen it also appears I owe you a double boon\u2014one for bringing me the walls of Troy and another for a slight, ur, misunderstanding earlier that could have ended very badly without divine intervention.\u201d The god actually seemed chagrined, giving Thetis an apologetic look. Then he turned his attention back to Kat. \u201cSo, Princess, what reward do you choose? I offer you anything within the wide seas of the world as yours.\u201d</p><p>Kat\u2019s gaze met Achilles\u2019. \u201cChoose for us, my princess,\u201d he said. She looked over her shoulder at Jacky and Patroklos, who nodded and smiled at her.</p><p>She drew a deep breath. \u201cI know exactly what I want. I want you to give me an island that can be hidden from the world\u2014a separate place of unimaginable beauty dedicated to healing and peace and the goddesses.\u201d</p><p>Poseidon stroked his beard while he considered. \u201cI believe I do have such an island, but it is far from here. In another time\u2014another place.\u201d</p><p>Kat squeezed Achilles\u2019 hand. \u201cThe farther away, the better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come!\u201d Poseidon waved a hand over the cove. The black-sailed Myrmidon ships scattered like autumn leaves as a shining ship made of pearl surged to the surface from beneath the ocean depths. The waters of the cove parted, leaving a sidewalk of dry land leading to the glistening iridescent ship.</p><p>Achilles faced his men. \u201cI can no longer lead you. That Achilles died in flames on the Trojan battlefield. I want no more battles\u2014no more glory. I want only the magic of peace. If that is what you want for your lives, you are free to join me.\u201d His half smile flickered. \u201cBut only if you are willing to bow to the goddesses.\u201d Then he took Kat\u2019s hand, and they started down the god-made path, with Jacky and Patroklos following immediately behind them.</p><p>Kat glanced back and was pleased to see that almost every Myrmidon and several of their war-prize brides, Aetnia included, were choosing to take the path to the pearl boat, too.</p><p>\u201cUm, Poseidon?\u201d Jacky called as the last of the Myrmidons boarded and she and Kat, Patroklos and Achilles had moved to the bow of the ship.</p><p>The God of the Seas peered down at Jacky, his bushy brows lifting when he saw what she was wearing. \u201cYes, mortal woman with the unusual costume, you have a question for Poseidon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I was wondering, does this island you\u2019re giving the, uh, princess have a name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, indeed. The mortals call it Avalon.\u201d</p><p>Kat and Jacky exchanged stunned looks.</p><p>\u201cJesus wept,\u201d Jacky whispered, fanning herself and leaning weakly back against Patroklos. \u201cMy heart! I feel my heart going again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly fucking shit,\u201d Kat said, shaking her head numbly.</p><p>\u201cMy god, Kat! I can\u2019t wait to meet the locals,\u201d Jacky said, laughing softly.</p><p>Achilles\u2019 arms went around Kat. \u201cIs all well? Do you know this island called Avalon?\u201d</p><p>Feeling dazed, Kat looked into his beautiful eyes. \u201cI do. And it is utterly, completely, perfect.\u201d</p><p>She pulled Achilles down to her and kissed him while Poseidon waved his hand over the cove and the waters returned to normal as the pearl ship began to glide seaward into a bank of fog that shimmered and rippled magically. \u201cI wish you a good voyage and a blessed future!\u201d the God of the Seas called.</p><p>\u201cKat, stop making out and look at this.

Straggling remnants of the Trojan army were being rounded up and, under Odysseus\u2019s direction, treated with mercy. Athena had ordered Greek warriors to go to all of the temples outside the Trojan walls and be sure that the priestesses and priests were not harmed. When Poseidon showed up with his army of Oceanids and began ripping apart the walls, the three goddesses, rolling their eyes, moved to a safer position in the grove of ancient olive trees.</p><p>Hera was restless and kept jumping at every twig crack and leaf flutter.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you?\u201d Venus asked. \u201cThe war\u2019s over\u2014we got what we wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that. We very visibly got what we wanted, clearly showing that the three of us orchestrated all of this.\u201d Hera waved a hand sweepingly at Troy. \u201cAt any moment Zeus will awaken from sleeping off the exhaustion caused by our days of magnificent lovemaking and he will learn of our interference here. Angry is an understatement about what he will be\u2014and you know how he is when he\u2019s angered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWow, you exhausted him? Well done you!\u201d Venus said.</p><p>Athena sighed. \u201cLove missed the point, as usual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t miss it. I just liked the other part better,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to be so angry,\u201d Hera said softly. \u201cAnd we\u2019d been getting along so well, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen there is nothing to do but to make sure Zeus does not hear of the parts we played here,\u201d Athena said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d Hera said. \u201cAnd keep in mind I really don\u2019t think I can keep up the sexual calisthenics. For a few days it was fun. For eternity it would be...\u201d She paused and grimaced. \u201cPainful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll simply bespell them,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Venus said. \u201cBespelling the genitals of the King and Queen of Olympus is going to be far more difficult than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you please get your mind off everyone\u2019s genitals? I\u2019m talking about the Trojans and the Greeks. It should be no problem if the three of us join our powers. Let\u2019s wipe the mortal\u2019s memories clean of everything that happened after the berserker was killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we really do that?\u201d Hera said, beginning to brighten.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not,\u201d Venus said. She gave Athena a considering look. \u201cYou know, all this sex is really having an excellent effect on you. Of course I hate to say it again, but I told you so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhile it pains me, it does appear that you were right.\u201d When Venus\u2019s face blossomed into a victorious smile, she added, \u201cThis time, that is.\u201d Then the gray-eyed goddess looked out on the battlefield. Her eyes were unerringly drawn to the tall warrior she loved so dearly. Not raising her voice above a whisper, she said, \u201cOdysseus, come to me.\u201d Even from that distance she could see that he looked at her, smiled and began closing the distance between them.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling him? We\u2019re supposed to wipe their memories,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cNot his,\u201d Athena said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the rest of them, but Odysseus will always remember everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only right,\u201d Venus said. \u201cShe loves him. Messing with his memory would dishonor what they\u2019ve shared together.\u201d</p><p>For once Athena smiled at Venus with genuine appreciation. \u201cThank you, Goddess of Love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, Goddess of War.\u201d Venus gave her a snappy little salute.</p><p>\u201cSo if we wipe their memories clean, what are we going to put in place of what really happened?\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cWe could blame it on Poseidon,\u201d Athena said. \u201cHe\u2019s already here and obviously has issues with the Trojans.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, everyone knows that he couldn\u2019t touch the Trojan walls until they were breeched. He made that deal decades ago with King Laomedon. If it could have been broken, he would have done so by now. Plus we really don\u2019t want to anger the sea god. You know how ugly it can get when the seas are in turmoil,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>Then Venus burst into giggles. \u201cI\u2019ve got it! And it\u2019s perfect. Remember the stupid Trojan horse that that ridiculous author made up along with the whole Achilles\u2019 heel thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course we remember it. It\u2019s just like that horrid rumor about the three of us starting the Trojan War.\u201d Hera shuddered. \u201cIt\u2019s simply unconscionable!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell let\u2019s use the asinine rumors and the verbose fictionalizing to our benefit. Let\u2019s zap the Trojan horse into the city and put that memory in the mortals\u2019 minds,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s brilliant,\u201d Hera said.</p><p>\u201cI do like it,\u201d Athena said.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Trojan horse?\u201d Odysseus asked.</p><p>Athena smiled lovingly at him. \u201cAnd we\u2019re giving Odysseus credit for thinking of it.\u201d</p><p>Athena and Venus shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Venus said. Hera nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhat is a Trojan horse?\u201d Odysseus asked again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll explain all of it to you later,\u201d Athena said. \u201cRight now perhaps you should step aside.\u201d</p><p>The three goddesses joined hands and together they walked onto the ravaged battlefield. As they got closer to the Trojan walls, the goddesses began to glow with combined power. Each woman\u2019s voice rang throughout Troy, washing the mortals like a cleansing rain.</p><p>\u201cOur task is complete. The Trojan War is done,\u201d Athena began.</p><p>\u201cBut the memory of we three shall fade with today\u2019s setting sun,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cAnd with the dawn new memories and a new era will have begun,\u201d Hera concluded.</p><p>Then the goddesses raised their arms and, in perfect accord, flung their powers out to Troy. A massive wooden horse materialized just as, behind them, the sun set into the bleeding ocean.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s that,\u201d Venus said, brushing her hands together as if wiping off the crumbs of a job well done.</p><p>\u201cI have to get back to Zeus before he wakes up,\u201d Hera said. \u201cYou know, this has invigorated me. I may be ready for some more calisthenics.\u201d She lifted her hands to bless them. \u201cGoddesses, it has been a pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Queen,\u201d Venus and Athena said together, bowing respectfully as Hera disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI really should explain everything to Odysseus,\u201d Athena said, her eyes already seeking out her lover.</p><p>\u201cGo with Love\u2019s blessing, Athena,\u201d Venus said.</p><p>\u201cThank you, my friend,\u201d Athena said, and then she hurried away.</p><p>Venus sighed happily, thinking about her virile husband, Vulcan, who she had definitely not spent enough time with since this whole adventure had begun. Already her mind was humming with the romantic rendezvous she would plan for that very night. \u201cHera was right\u2014I feel invigorated,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter all, Love does adore a happily ever after.\u201d Venus lifted her smooth arm and, with a snap of her fingers, disappeared, leaving a cloud of diamonds that turned into fireflies that filled the silent grove like beacons of hope. </p> </body></html>"]
