I\u2019ll look at you like that all night if I want. Are you trying to kill my future brother-in-law?\u201d I teased, knowing that less than two minutes ago she was locked in Dean\u2019s room doing who-knows-what while I sat in Jack\u2019s room waiting for her.</p> <p>She narrowed her eyes before turning to face me. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>Frustrated, I rolled my eyes. \u201cTry not to. I\u2019ve grown attached.\u201d</p><p>After applying a new coat of lipstick, she smacked her lips together before moving next to me. \u201cYou look gorgeous, by the way.\u201d Her hands touched the back of my hair as she rearranged specific strands while I smoothed the nonexistent wrinkles from my knee-length white dress.</p><p>\u201cThanks. So do you.\u201d Despite being annoyed with my pint-sized pal, I couldn\u2019t help but smile.</p><p>\u201cSo, was your dad pissed about not walking you down the aisle?\u201d</p> <p>I sucked in a breath. The last thing I wanted on my wedding day was to feel bad about any of my decisions. The choice of walking alone or with my father weighed heavily on me at first. But I eventually decided that having my father walk me toward my life with Jack and then handing me over to him would all be for show. And I knew in that moment that I didn\u2019t want anyone to be responsible for \u201cgiving me away,\u201d least of all the one man in my life who had disappointed me more than any other.</p><p>It only seemed right that I walk down the aisle on my own and join Jack freely to start our lives together, since it was my choice, my decision, my heart waiting for me at the end of that aisle. After all, no one could give me to the one person I\u2019d already given myself to years ago.</p><p>\u201cHe was definitely hurt at first. But I don\u2019t think he truly got the message I was trying to convey. I think he just wanted to walk me down the aisle because that\u2019s what a dad is supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh well. Maybe he should have been a better dad,\u201d Melissa said in a sharp tone.</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cHopefully after he sees how untraditional everything is today, he\u2019ll understand and be less disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Music filtered through the open windows and into the living room where Melissa and I stood waiting. I took in a deep breath and bit my bottom lip as excitement surged through me.</p> <p>\u201cOh my gosh! It\u2019s time!\u201d Melissa moved toward the glass patio door and let out a little gasp as she peeked outside. \u201cOoh, it\u2019s so pretty, Cass!\u201d She gave me a hug and whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll see you out there,\u201d then stepped out and slowly made her way down the makeshift aisle.</p><p>After taking a deep breath, I followed her lead, pausing briefly at the doorway. She was right. Gran and Gramps\u2019 backyard had been transformed into a place of wonder. Candles cast tiny shadows everywhere as the sun began to sink behind the trees. A myriad of tiny lights twinkled in the tree branches.</p><p>When I stepped outside, my gaze landed on the mason jars filled with quarters and candles that lined the aisle, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile as my heart filled with the sheer amount of love I felt for Jack. Still smiling, I looked down the aisle and immediately locked on to his chocolate-brown eyes. The air whisked from my lungs for a moment at the sight of him standing there in his charcoal-gray suit, waiting for me with a shit-eating grin plastered on his face.</p><p>I had to stop myself from running to him and leaping into his arms. Although I don\u2019t think he would have minded.</p><p>Once at the altar, Jack reached out and took my hand in his, caressing it with his thumb in a sensual gesture that sent tingles throughout my body. \u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d he whispered as he leaned toward me.</p><p>\u201cAnd you look hot,\u201d I whispered back, then gave him a wink.</p><p>Gramps cleared his throat and both Jack and I stifled a laugh. Jack\u2019s grandfather looked serious as he welcomed our friends and family to this \u201cspecial day,\u201d before diving right into the ceremony.</p><p>Looking into Jack\u2019s eyes, I swear I only heard a few things that Gramps said. My mind spun as I thought back to the journey Jack and I had traveled, from the pits of hell we\u2019d been through to where we were now. We had come so far together.</p> <p>I glanced briefly at Jack\u2019s brother, Dean, who stood next to him, but his eyes were fixed on the petite brunette standing next to me. Shaking my head softly, I smiled before returning my gaze to the man who held my heart.</p><p>When it came time to exchange vows, mine a little more tearful than Jack\u2019s. My heart melted at the sight of him getting choked up, and when he cleared his throat to regain his composure, I lost all of mine.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d I confessed through my joyful tears.</p><p>Jack reached for my face, wiping away my tears with his thumbs as he tilted his head and leaned his face toward me for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh! Wait!\u201d Gramps called out, interrupting the moment as Jack froze, my cheeks still held between his hands. Gramps paused a beat, then his face split into a wide grin as he announced proudly, \u201cI now pronounce you man and wife. Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Gramps?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice rose in pitch as he remained frozen in place, and the crowd laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou may kiss your beautiful bride,\u201d Gramps pronounced before slamming his bible shut.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d Jack said before crushing his lips against mine. Cheers and enthusiastic shouts filled my ears at first, but they quickly faded away in that moment. Soon, all I heard was the sound of my heart rapidly beating in my ears. And all I could feel was Jack\u2019s hands on my skin, and his tongue gently tasting mine.</p><p>Already on shaky legs, I grabbed Jack\u2019s shoulders for balance as he slowly pulled away, breaking our first kiss as husband and wife.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I\u2019d like to present for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Carter.\u201d Gramps smiled wide.</p><p>\u201cBaby-making time,\u201d Jack whispered in my ear before grabbing my hand and pulling us from the altar.</p><p>Heat spread across my cheeks as I choked back a response, but followed him anyway. I\u2019d follow that man anywhere.</p><p>Married Life</p><p>Bright morning light filtered in through the curtains as I opened my eyes to the sound of Gran and Gramps placing dishes and silverware on the kitchen table. My room was closest to the kitchen, so whenever they banged around in there, it always woke me up. For a second, I was reminded of my high school days, when the smell of Gran\u2019s fresh-cooked waffles would waft down the hallway before school. With a smile, I remembered what day it was and focused my attention on the blonde hair splayed across my arm.</p><p>My wife, Cassie, lay curled up next to me, her ass pressed tightly up against my groin.</p><p>My wife.</p><p>Someone actually loved me enough to not only put up with my shit, but to agree to put up with it for the rest of her life. She was probably insane on some level, but I\u2019d take it. Whatever kept this woman by my side was fine by me. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was about being married, but the pieces that used to spin out of control inside me actually felt settled now. Knowing that Cassie had vowed to be mine forever filled me with a sense of comfort I\u2019d never known I was missing.</p><p>In that moment, I felt like I could do anything. I could put on a cape, sprout some wings, and save the whole fucking world if I wanted to. And the best part was, the girl by my side wasn\u2019t going anywhere. She\u2019d sew a J on that cape and watch me fly if I asked her to.</p><p>How did I just revert to a twelve-year-old with superhero fantasies? Fucking loser.</p><p>I reached my arm around Cassie\u2019s bare waist, my fingers exploring the side of her body I couldn\u2019t see. She moaned and my dick throbbed to life.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, wife,\u201d I whispered against her face, before kissing the lobe of her ear and sucking it into my mouth.</p><p>Cassie moaned again before turning to face me, her gorgeous green eyes beaming. \u201cGood morning, husband.\u201d</p><p>Husband.</p><p>Fuck yeah, I\u2019m your husband. I think that means I\u2019m legally allowed to kill anyone who fucks with her, right? Right.</p><p>Leaning down, I pulled her lower lip between my teeth and nibbled playfully. Without warning, I pushed my tongue into her open mouth, moving it in sync with hers. I fucking ached to be inside her. Literally. Fucking. Ached.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d I breathed out between kisses.</p><p>Her hands reached for my lower back, her fingers pulling at my skin to move me into position on top of her. I did as she silently asked, and she pushed her knees apart in welcome. \u201cI guess that\u2019s a yes?\u201d I joked, sliding inside her before she changed her mind.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jack,\u201d she moaned, then bit her lip. \u201cGo slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cassie. Do you know how hard it is to go slow when you feel this fucking good?\u201d I attempted to manage my thrusts, but my dick was uncooperative. Like it had a mind of its own, it betrayed the commands from my brain. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, babe, but it won\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>She giggled underneath me as a line formed between her eyebrows. \u201cWhat won\u2019t listen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dick,\u201d I breathed out.</p><p>Her hips moved beneath me, rising and falling in perfect time against me, with me, whatever. \u201cI\u2019m not going to last,\u201d I warned, trying my best to slow the inevitable.</p><p>Those beautiful green eyes met mine before she gripped the back of my neck and pulled my mouth to hers. Our tongues explored each other with increasingly frantic desperation. I moved in and out of her perfection, my hard-on growing with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cI feel you getting bigger inside me.\u201d Her breath was hot against my mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s such a turn-on, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d Those words were all it took to send me over the edge. With one last thrust, I lost myself inside of her. Cassie\u2019s mouth fell open as pleasure coursed through her body. I watched as she found her own release and shuddered when it was done.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful. I love you so much,\u201d I said as I ran my fingers through her hair.</p><p>She smiled and said, \u201cI love you too. Always,\u201d and I was instantly reminded of how lucky I was to have her.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d I agreed. \u201cWe should get up. I smell Gran\u2019s cooking and they\u2019re already in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Face flushed, she buried her head into my pillow. \u201cDo you think they heard us?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cThey didn\u2019t hear us. But we\u2019re married now, so we can do this stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack! Don\u2019t be disrespectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? You\u2019re the disrespectful one,\u201d I teased before planting a kiss on her forehead. \u201cNow get up. Unless you plan on eating breakfast naked. Honestly, I don\u2019t think Gramps would mind. Or Dean.\u201d</p><p>Her face twisted in mock horror and she smacked me playfully. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>A little while later, we settled into our seats at the table and I noticed Dean heading our way. I palmed a blueberry muffin and waited. He walked through the entryway and I hurled the muffin.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d He looked down to see the crumbled pastry at his feet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack! Don\u2019t throw food!\u201d Gran scolded and I shrugged.</p><p>\u201cNothing says good morning like a muffin to your gut,\u201d I teased and Cassie swatted me in the arm.</p><p>Dean\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cHit him harder next time, Sis. Like this.\u201d He walked over to me and socked me square in the right shoulder.</p><p>The chair screeched as I scooted out of it and chased after my little brother. He ducked and weaved throughout the kitchen, Gran yelling in the background and Gramps laughing at our antics, before I finally caught him and started whaling on his shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cStop hitting me, you dick!\u201d Dean yelled as he attempted to pull his shirt from my grasp.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hit me in front of my wife.\u201d I released the death grip I had on his clothes and watched as he stood up straight, brushing off his bicep where I\u2019d just hit him.</p><p>\u201cYou just wanted an excuse to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay what?\u201d I mocked with fake confusion.</p><p>\u201cWife.\u201d Dean looked over at Cassie for support, who watched us with a grin on her face and shook her head, refusing to get involved.</p> <p>\u201cStop acting like you\u2019re twelve again and eat some breakfast,\u201d Gran insisted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack. Stop acting like you\u2019re twelve.\u201d Dean shoved me before running to his seat and slamming his ass down.</p><p>\u201cYou two are ridiculous,\u201d Cassie remarked. \u201cThis smells amazing, Gran. Thank you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m just so happy to have you all here,\u201d Gran said with a smile before placing full plates of food at the center of the table.</p><p>Dean lifted a waffle with his fork and I swatted at it with mine, causing it to fall on the table. \u201cYou\u2019re such a jackass,\u201d my brother whined.</p><p>\u201cDean! Language.\u201d The scolding from Gran had become all too familiar whenever we were together.</p> <p>\u201cHe was being a jackass, hon,\u201d Gramps noted and I stifled a laugh.</p><p>A voice called out from the front door, and I noticed Dean stop midbite when he realized it was Melissa. \u201cKnock-knock! Anyone home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYay! Melis!\u201d Cassie jumped up from her seat and ran out of the kitchen as Dean glared across the table at me.</p><p>\u201cYou could have warned me she was coming over.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and shoved a bite of waffle in my mouth, mumbling around it, \u201cDidn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you two can\u2019t get your shit together, so don\u2019t get all PMS\u2019y on me like a little bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack!\u201d Gran said sharply. \u201cApologize to your brother right now.\u201d</p> <p>Gramps pinned me with a disapproving look over his glasses. \u201cThat was uncalled for.\u201d</p><p>I chewed my food extra slowly, my gaze never leaving Dean\u2019s. \u201cSorry,\u201d I mumbled before narrowing my eyes and adding, \u201cthat you can\u2019t make the girl fall in love with you.\u201d</p><p>Dean shook his head and looked away as he finished the bite in his mouth with a scowl.</p><p>My beautiful wife walked back into the kitchen with her fun-sized best friend, Melissa, following close behind.</p><p>\u201cHi, everyone,\u201d Melissa said cheerfully.</p><p>Gran gave her a big smile. \u201cGood morning, dear. Are you hungry? Let me grab you a plate.\u201d She started to stand but Cassie stopped her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do that. You eat.\u201d</p><p>Melissa pushed Cassie toward her chair and shook her head. \u201cI already ate, but thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Fun-Size, did you have a good time yesterday?\u201d I asked suggestively, trying to get her to admit she actually liked my brother as more than a friend. Dean froze and tipped his head to the side, obviously waiting to hear her answer.</p><p>She stared straight at him as she spoke without blinking, \u201cIt was the most fun I\u2019ve had in a long time. How about you?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cConsidering I married the girl of my dreams, I\u2019ll say I had more than just fun yesterday.\u201d</p><p>Melissa slid into an open chair at the table and asked, \u201cSo, when are you guys leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur flight leaves tonight at nine,\u201d Cassie answered, her voice deflated.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t y\u2019all just stay forever? Screw New York!\u201d Melissa shouted in an overly animated voice, and I noticed Dean rubbing his temples.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Dean?\u201d she asked with a laugh. \u201cHead hurt?\u201d She tilted her head as she goaded him playfully.</p><p>He glared at her and gave her a sharp nod before turning to me. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay any longer, can you?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the food in my mouth, half-wishing my answer could be yes. \u201cWe have to get back so I can get ready for the pre-season. I feel like I haven\u2019t thrown in forever, and I need to work out. You know how I get in January.\u201d</p><p>Being a major league baseball player probably didn\u2019t appear like it would be that difficult from the outside. But I worked my ass off for the majority of the year. During the off-season, I still had to work out, stay in shape, and keep myself healthy. Not to mention the fact that I had to start mentally preparing myself for the season months before it actually started, which basically meant I sort of checked out from everything else. Cassie has had to learn to deal with an absentee boyfriend, whether mentally or physically, most of the time. And now I\u2019ll be an absentee husband.</p><p>\u201cSucks you\u2019re so far away,\u201d Dean added before reaching for his glass of orange juice.</p><p>\u201cYou can come visit us anytime, Dean. Just let us know. We\u2019d love to have you,\u201d Cassie said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Sis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about me? Can I come visit anytime?\u201d Melissa cocked her head to the side and Cassie rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said before laughing. \u201cOf course, dummy. Actually, you and Dean should visit together sometime.\u201d</p><p>She winked and I seconded the suggestion. \u201cYou two should definitely come out together.\u201d Dean\u2019s shoulders tensed noticeably as a grunt escaped his lips.</p><p>Despite how much I razzed him, I wanted to help my brother get the girl. Yesterday I had caught them hooking up before our wedding, and if I could do anything to get them together once and for all, I\u2019d do it. The boy deserved to be happy.</p><p>Gran changed the subject before I could ask any more questions. \u201cSpeaking of Dean and traveling,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen do you start at the agency?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, bro,\u201d I asked as I kicked Dean under the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you and my agents?\u201d My agents, Ryan and Marc, had offered Dean a job at their sports management company as soon as he graduated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part-time now, but I start full-time at the end of May,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat will you be doing exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be a junior agent. They\u2019re going to teach me the ropes when it comes to dealing with guys like you.\u201d He gave a slight head nod in my general direction.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d Cassie said with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll mostly be researching at first. I\u2019ll be looking at new talent for the guys to check out. It\u2019s going to be a lot of computer work and apparently I\u2019ll be the local contact for any of the players or their families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor everything, or just certain things?\u201d Cassie asked.</p><p>Dean shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know yet. I\u2019m sure there will be questions I can\u2019t answer, so maybe just helping facilitate their moves if they get traded, or talk about the trade deadlines and stuff.\u201d</p><p>Warming up to the subject, Cassie asked, \u201cDo the families call a lot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNot everyone understands the business side of things, so sometimes they get really frustrated. I have to literally explain every single thing to them that they don\u2019t quite grasp.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s eyes grew wide as she inhaled audibly. \u201cI bet those are some fun and long calls.\u201d</p><p>Dean nodded. \u201cI was on the phone for over two hours the other day with the wife of one of your ex-teammates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOne of the outfielders for the D-backs. She was concerned about him not getting a long-term extension after last season and wanted to know how that would affect his playing time and reaching the full pension package. I had to explain the entire business side of things to her and I think she was still confused. She\u2019s obsessed with the pension.\u201d</p><p>Gramps dropped his fork and it clanged against the table. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said as he picked it up with a funny look on his face. \u201cHow many seasons do you have to play before you get the pension?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get full pension benefits, you have to play for ten full seasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens if you get hurt before then, or if you can\u2019t play all ten?\u201d</p><p>Dean sucked in a breath. \u201cThen you only get a partial pension, but it\u2019s way more complicated than that. Your contract terms, the number of years you signed for, it all comes into play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, enough of this talk. Let\u2019s let the kids have some time together before they leave.\u201d Gran pushed back from her chair and started collecting her dishes and the plates closest to her.</p><p>\u201cLet me help, please?\u201d Cassie asked and Gran swatted at her hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, dear. You\u2019re a newlywed. Go spend your honeymoon with your friends,\u201d she said with a wry laugh as we filed out into the living room.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon flew by as we hung out with Dean and Melissa. Before I knew it, Cassie was reminding me we needed to pack our things and say our good-byes. I hated leaving, but at least I wouldn\u2019t be alone. I\u2019d never be alone again.</p><p>Breaking Bones</p><p>Three Months Later ...</p><p>Engrossed in my work, I fiddled with the key that hung from a chain around my neck, my fingers running across the letters that spelled out STRENGTH across the top. Melissa had given it to me after all the drama with the tabloids and mean fans during Jack\u2019s first season. The rule of the necklace, she told me, was that I should keep it until I saw someone else who needed the message on the key more than I did. I hated the thought of ever giving that special gift away, but had to admit it was a really clever idea.</p><p>Sitting in my cubicle, I pored over photos I had recently shot during my last assignment. Nora, my boss, wanted to submit one picture for a highly respected photography award. But as I looked at them, I realized that I couldn\u2019t pick the one.</p><p>As usual, I\u2019d become emotionally involved on my assignment, and could no longer see the photo for just what it portrayed. I saw the emotions behind it, the meanings that weren\u2019t necessarily captured through my lens.</p><p>When I looked at the photograph of the elderly man desperately clutching a child covered in dirt and blood, I saw the hundreds of other people in the background just as desperate and dirty who didn\u2019t make it into my picture. Just out of view sat houses demolished into piles of debris, and their owners, faces filled with disbelief, digging through the rubble in vain. Several square miles of land that had once held schools, businesses, and homes, were now completely leveled into what could only be described as a war zone. It sounded so clich\u00e9, but that description was the most accurate. Mother Nature sometimes brought hell to Earth. And I captured it with my camera. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was one thing to see devastation on the news or in magazines, but was quite another to walk through the scene and witness the destruction firsthand. There were no words to describe what it was like to feel your feet crunching through the broken glass and debris of what used to be someone\u2019s home. Or what you felt as you saw the shock on people\u2019s faces as they realized that everything they\u2019d ever held dear had vanished into thin air, or been crushed into particles of dust. I\u2019d never felt as helpless as I did the day an elderly woman admitted to me that all her family photos and heirlooms had been lost, and I could do nothing but watch as she crumpled to her knees in grief. There was such raw and exposed pain in those first few days after a tragedy, that I often found it hard to shoot. It was virtually indescribable to witness, and almost unbearable to live through.</p><p>It probably didn\u2019t help my career that I didn\u2019t enjoy being intrusive. I wasn\u2019t the type of photographer who pushed into people\u2019s faces, piercing their personal space in hopes of getting the money shot. It didn\u2019t bring me joy to photograph the agony of others. After being with them, experiencing it with them, their pain was forever etched in my memory, and I carried it with me wherever I went. I didn\u2019t see the sense, or what good it brought, to expose that pain for all to see.</p><p>But then at some point during the recovery, something almost magical seemed to happen. You could literally feel the change in the thick and dusty air. The immediate shock had worn off and people in the community came together in the most incredible of ways. There was a sense of family and strength that was humbling to witness. Every. Single. Time. The focus shifted from each individual\u2019s loss and transformed into the community\u2019s pulling together as a whole to not only survive, but to come back stronger, more resilient, as a more cohesive whole. Experiencing that transformation was in itself worth all the earlier tears and pain.</p><p>That was why it had always been my goal on any assignment to look for the beauty amidst all the heartache. Those tiny moments of peace and happiness, like when two friends see each other for the first time after wondering if the other were dead or alive. When panic turned to elation, that was what I wanted to capture. If I could put hope into a photograph where it looked like none existed, I\u2019d have done my job. At least, I\u2019d have done it the way I wanted to.</p> <p>\u201cCassie, come in here.\u201d My phone buzzed to life with Nora\u2019s voice over the intercom.</p><p>I pressed the flashing red button and responded, \u201cBe right in.\u201d I rose from my desk and glanced around the workspace. Joey, the guy I had gone on one date with when Jack and I were broken up, moved away a couple of years ago. He got a job offer back in his hometown of Boston and jumped at the opportunity. Jack had wanted to throw a party when he heard that news. Which I never really understood because, really? It wasn\u2019t as if Jack ever had any real competition.</p><p>The faces in my office may have changed over the last five years, but the pace remained the same. The floor buzzed with energy of creative people working on layout, designs, and editing. I loved my job and I loved living in this city.</p><p>I rapped my knuckles against Nora\u2019s door before twisting the knob and pushing it open. She waved me over and pointed for me to sit, her phone pressed tightly against her ear. I did as she asked and waited patiently. Ever since I moved to New York to accept the job offer with this magazine, Nora had always had my back. She supported me when Jack and I went through hell with Chrystle\u2019s accusations and the backlash that followed. She even offered to do a full spread on our relationship, just to set the record straight.</p><p>In the end, we didn\u2019t need to go through with the feature spread because Chrystle\u2019s ex-best friend Vanessa did all the dirty work for us. Vanessa gave an exclusive interview to the magazine and spilled every detail of Chrystle\u2019s plan to use a fake pregnancy to manipulate Jack into marrying her. My reputation got a much needed-boost, and the fans stopped their incessant name-calling and online hatred of me. Actually, the article had proved to be the best publicity for my relationship with Jack, and I had both Nora and Vanessa to thank for that.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll have them for you by the end of the day. Thanks, Bob.\u201d</p><p>Nora dropped the handset onto the phone base, then leaned back and raised an eyebrow at me. \u201cSo, did you choose a photograph yet?\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cI\u2019ve narrowed it down to five. That\u2019s better than yesterday,\u201d I said, thinking back to the thirty pictures I had scattered on the conference room table yesterday afternoon.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cassie, just pick one! I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all brilliant. Hell, take them home to that hot husband of yours and make him choose,\u201d she said with a hearty laugh.</p><p>My mouth dropped open. \u201cI\u2019m not making Jack pick! He\u2019d probably close his eyes and see which one his finger lands on.\u201d</p><p>Nora narrowed her eyes at me. \u201cWhich is what you\u2019re going to have to do if you don\u2019t choose one by the end of the day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll pick one,\u201d I said with a slight huff.</p><p>Nora pushed her wire-rimmed glasses up against the bridge of her nose while she stared at me with a smirk on her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d I asked warily. \u201cWhy are you looking at me like that?\u201d</p><p>Her smirk turned into a full smile. \u201cI need you to photograph an upcoming feature story.\u201d</p><p>I cocked my head to the side, knowing full well we had other photographers to handle that type of shoot. Each photographer had a specialty. Some excelled at taking indoor studio shots with models, but I wasn\u2019t one of them. I worked best with natural light and unconventional settings, pretty much the exact opposite of a posed studio photo. \u201cLike someone local? Who? Why me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s Trina.\u201d</p><p>Now I was the one smiling. Trina was the one Mets players\u2019 girlfriend who actually talked to me the first season Jack played on the team. When we met, she had been dating Jack\u2019s teammate Kyle. She was a model and missed a lot of games due to her travel schedule, but whenever she was there, she was my savior.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re shooting Trina? That\u2019s amazing! What\u2019s the focus of the story?\u201d</p> <p>Nora waved a dismissive hand in the air. \u201cSomething about \u2018From Models to Moms in Manhattan.\u2019 I haven\u2019t worked out all the details yet, but she\u2019ll be the focus. And she\u2019ll only work with you.\u201d</p><p>As I shook my head in amazement, my mind drifted back to when I\u2019d first met Trina, and the man who became her new husband.</p><p>After the fiasco where our driver, Matteo, tried to kiss me and Jack fired him, Jack eventually allowed him to work for us again. In the meantime, Matteo had opened his own car company for exclusive clientele only. Once he began working with us again, Matteo personally only drove and worked for one couple, Jack and me, but his company was rapidly becoming the go-to car service for all the local pro athletes.</p><p>Matteo and Trina started dating right after she and Kyle had called it quits. Their wedding ceremony several months later was small, but elegant. Trina claimed the rushed date had to do with Jack\u2019s spring training schedule, so that we could attend the wedding, but I knew the real reason was because she didn\u2019t want to be showing in her wedding pictures. Matteo also insisted that they be legally married before their baby entered this world. I remember him saying, \u201cI could wait and marry you someday, but I\u2019d much rather marry you today. Someday may never come. Today is already here. Please don\u2019t make me wait to make you my wife.\u201d</p><p>When Trina had told me she and Matteo were getting married, I nervously asked her if she were certain this was what she wanted. I had clearly gained a deep-seated fear of people marrying for the wrong reasons over the last couple of years; whenever I thought back to the situation with Jack and Chrystle, I shuddered. Putting my fears to rest, Trina had informed me that while they didn\u2019t plan on having a baby first and a wedding second, she didn\u2019t care what order they did things in. They were truly happy and that was all that mattered. And I had to agree because happiness was all I truly wanted for my friends as well.</p><p>Nora looked at me over her glasses and raised her eyebrows, obviously waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cThe only reason Trina wants to work with me is because if she hates the pictures, she can make me pay for it later,\u201d I said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do great. We\u2019ll book a studio with lots of natural light for you, okay?\u201d</p><p>I breathed out in relief. \u201cYou know me so well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want pictures of her before and after. Make sure you schedule something with her husband after the baby is born so we can show off the happy family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo pick out a damn picture already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. But if it sucks and loses, it\u2019s your fault.\u201d I shot Nora a grin as I pushed out of my chair and headed toward the door.</p><p>Back at my desk, I was no closer to choosing a photo than I was an hour ago. Glancing up, I spotted one of our interns walking through the elevator doors, balancing two cardboard trays filled with coffee cups.</p><p>\u201cBecca,\u201d I shouted and she glanced up, trying not to spill the drinks. \u201cWhen you get a minute, can you come over here, please?\u201d</p><p>She nodded her head as a small smile appeared. Becca was young and still in college, but she had a good eye. And I liked her style.</p><p>\u201cHi, Cassie. You needed me?\u201d Becca sounded nervous and I breathed out a sigh of relief.</p><p>\u201cYes! Thank God you\u2019re here. You have a great eye and I love the way you see things. I need to pick a photo to submit for something, but I can\u2019t choose. I\u2019m too close to the subject matter. Which one do you like best?\u201d</p><p>A giant, toothy grin spread across Becca\u2019s youthful face. \u201cI\u2019m honored. Thank you,\u201d she said before hovering over the pictures splayed across my desktop.</p><p>It took her all of two seconds to grab a photo and declare it was the one. And I trusted her eye because it meant something in that particular picture stood out above all the others.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Becca. You\u2019re a lifesaver!\u201d</p><p>After work, I stepped through the revolving door and onto the crowded sidewalk. Sidestepping the pedestrian traffic, I weaved my way toward the idling black car at the curb. Matteo stood patiently waiting for me next to the car, just like he did every evening. His handsome face broke out into a wide grin as I neared and he held open the passenger door.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so smiley?\u201d I asked and he shrugged.</p><p>He hopped into the driver\u2019s seat and pulled into traffic. \u201cLife\u2019s good, Cassie. Life is good,\u201d he said in an annoying singsong voice. Matteo\u2019s attitude had been like this ever since he and Trina had hooked up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so annoying. Go home to your hot wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Right after I drop you off at your hot husband\u2019s office,\u201d he said playfully with a wink.</p><p>\u201cEw,\u201d I said with a shudder. \u201cDon\u2019t say Jack\u2019s hot and then wink. It\u2019s weird.\u201d</p><p>Unable to respond, he broke out into a huge belly laugh. He was still chortling a little over it as he navigated his way to the field while I scrolled through my personal e-mails on my phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A few minutes later, he straightened up and said over his shoulder, \u201cTrina told me about the photo shoot,\u201d which got my attention.</p><p>I glanced up to meet his eyes in the rearview mirror. \u201cYeah. It should be great. You\u2019re in it too, you know?\u201d</p><p>Matteo\u2019s posture changed as he shifted nervously in his seat. \u201cI am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But not until after the baby is born. I\u2019m going to shoot Trina now while she\u2019s showing and then all three of you after.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust make sure you take the most pictures of her. She\u2019s the one who sells magazines, not me,\u201d he offered humbly.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOh yeah, \u2018cause being forced to look at your mug is really hard on the ladies,\u201d I said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cI knew you wanted me,\u201d he teased and I almost choked.</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I shook my head and gave a little snort. \u201cNot this again.\u201d</p><p>Since Jack forgave Matteo, acknowledging his hotness no longer made me feel completely awkward. Granted, I wouldn\u2019t be walking around and announcing it to the world anytime soon, but still. It also didn\u2019t hurt that Matteo eventually realized that his feelings for me weren\u2019t based in reality. He figured out quickly that he had gotten caught up in protecting me and caring about me. It muddled his emotions, but once Trina entered the picture, any romantic feelings he thought he had for me were out the window. Thank God for Trina.</p> <p>The car slowed to a stop as I gathered my things. Matteo reached for the driver\u2019s side handle and I stopped him. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to let me out. I got it.\u201d I opened my own door and scooted out before leaning into the open passenger window, \u201cSee you later, future cougar prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d Matteo called out in mock indignation as I turned away and walked toward the entry gates of the stadium, laughing. I knew Matteo would love every minute of attention he would get once the article was published.</p><p>I scooted into my regular seat next to Tara in the wives\u2019 section, my presence here now a familiar sight amongst the other girlfriends, wives, family, and friends. No longer a girlfriend, the players\u2019 wives accepted me the way they only accepted other wives. And as much as I hated to admit it, being married changed things. I never planned on treating any of the players\u2019 girlfriends the way I was treated, but I acknowledged the difference between being married and not. The social hierarchy existed for a reason, and after seeing the number of girls that came and went with some of these guys, I understood now in a way that had only offended me before.</p><p>When I glanced down at the field, the sight of Jack warming up forced my heart to squeeze with pride. His gray sliding pants hugged against the muscles as he lifted his leg into the air before each pitch. The black shirt-style jersey waved in the breeze he created as his arm flew down to release the ball.</p><p>I watched as Jack grabbed his hat and tipped it twice, and I couldn\u2019t hide my smile. That was his sign to me. He had started doing it when I couldn\u2019t travel with him on his road trips, which had become more and more frequent with my work. Whenever he pitched, he\u2019d tip his hat twice and his face would light up with a soft smile. He never knew if the cameras were on him or not, but he tipped his hat regardless.</p><p>Eventually it became a habit, because he started doing it at the home games as well. Sometimes his eyes would flash to the stands and meet mine. When they did, I swear my heart would stop beating, causing my breath to catch. Every. Single. Time. If anyone noticed, I would have been embarrassed, but no one ever seemed to.</p> <p>I more than loved this man. My husband. My ball player.</p><p>My Jack Fucking Carter.</p><p>Even his name still gets me all hot and bothered.</p><p>Jack bent over deeply, looking at the catcher through the glove covering half his face. With a shake of his head, he indicated no to whatever pitch the catcher wanted him to throw. Another shake and the catcher called time out, than ran over to Jack, who stood waiting on the mound, kicking the dirt.</p><p>After a short conversation, the catcher gave Jack a pat on the ass before jogging to his position behind home plate. The umpire pointed at Jack and Jack\u2019s feet touched the rubber mound. With one fluid motion, the ball left his hand and the batter swung and missed. The ball crashed against the catcher\u2019s glove, the sound of it echoing throughout the stadium as the crowd erupted into cheers and I smiled. I loved watching him play. It seemed silly to call Jack beautiful, but when he played baseball ... he was.</p><p>Someone yelled from the dugout area, but Jack waved them off with his glove hand. I scooted to the edge of my seat and automatically held my breath, anticipating the pitch. Jack leaned down, eyeing the catcher before nodding his head in agreement with the called pitch. He lowered his glove to his waist before bringing it back up in time with the rising of his knee. His entire body lurched forward with the release of the pitch and the crack of the bat meeting the ball distracted everyone else\u2019s eyes but mine. My eyes stayed loyally focused on the guy I loved.</p><p>Because my eyes never left Jack, I witnessed the entire incident. The ball screamed back at him and he reacted as best he could; his body twisted to get out of the way as his pitching hand instinctively reached out to stop the flying ball. I watched as the ball crashed against Jack\u2019s exposed hand before dropping to the ground near his feet.</p><p>He scrambled to make the play, but a pained scream tore from his lips as he tried to close his hand around the ball. Face contorted with pain, Jack took a knee and pressed his chin tightly against his chest.</p> <p>Someone yelled for time out and Jack\u2019s manager bolted onto the field. He helped Jack to his feet and walked him out of view.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I muttered to myself.</p><p>\u201cGo, Cassie,\u201d Tara demanded. \u201cGet down to the locker room. That\u2019s where they\u2019re taking him.\u201d</p><p>Without a word I nodded, grabbed my things, and hurried toward the staircase that would take me underground. I flew down the last set of stairs to where anyone in the public could go before heading through a private door. Once inside, the air of the cold brick tunnels hit me. The tunnels ran the length of the stadium and unless you\u2019d been under here before, you wouldn\u2019t know they existed. I rounded the corner and jogged up toward the burly security guard.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jimmy, is he here? Did you see them bring Jack off the field?\u201d I asked, my voice distraught.</p><p>His forehead creased as he answered, \u201cJack? No. What happened?\u201d</p><p>I released a shaky breath. \u201cHe hurt his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Damn. I hope he\u2019s okay.\u201d He stepped aside, revealing a small clearing between the guardrails, and I rushed through, walking as fast as my nervous legs would allow.</p><p>I followed along with the bricks as they curved gently, noticing the Mets sign attached to the wall up ahead. My pace quickened as I ached to reach the double mahogany doors that read NEW YORK METS CLUBHOUSE.</p><p>Another security guard sat in a folding chair next to the entrance, his face pinched with concern. He stood upon my approach. \u201cCassie. He\u2019s in there with the doc.\u201d The sympathy in his sad eyes rattled me even further, and my mouth went completely dry.</p><p>\u201cHow did he look, Joe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in a lot of pain,\u201d he admitted grimly.</p><p>My throat constricted, making it hard to swallow. I realized in that moment that I\u2019d never once considered the possibility of Jack getting hurt. He seemed invincible in a way ... like his body was born to play this sport and it would never allow him to be hurt by it. It would never betray him like that.</p><p>But it did.</p><p>And I found myself scared to death about what this meant for him. Jack without baseball ... well, that wasn\u2019t Jack at all. I wouldn\u2019t even know who that person was; I\u2019d never known Jack when baseball wasn\u2019t a huge part of his life. Worry shot through me and I couldn\u2019t stop a nervous shiver.</p><p>\u201cCassie?\u201d Joe\u2019s voice echoed in the tunnel, followed by the sound of him hanging up the rotary phone. Unable to speak, I looked up at him helplessly. \u201cNo one else is in there,\u201d he said gently. \u201cYou can go in.\u201d</p><p>He opened one of the large doors for me and I walked through into the one place at the stadium I\u2019d never been before. I eyed the oversized couch and the carpet patterned with the team\u2019s logo, before my gaze fell on the lockers bearing each player\u2019s name and jersey number, a soft spotlight highlighting each one as if they were museum exhibits. I laughed to myself that the guys called them \u201clockers\u201d when they looked more like the thin oak closets you would find in hotel rooms.</p><p>I found myself longing to photograph the room as each individual detail called to me in ways that only new places can. Occupational habit, I supposed. Or denial, maybe.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice rang out through the large space, an undertone of pain causing it to sound different somehow.</p><p>Snapped back to the present, I called out, \u201cJack? Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWalk to the back of the room and make a right.\u201d</p><p>As I hurried past the row of lockers, number 23 grabbed my attention and I couldn\u2019t resist the impulse to pause for just a second at Jack\u2019s locker since I\u2019d never seen it, and might never have the chance again. His travel bag and street clothes hung inside, waiting for him, and I ran my fingers down the fabric, moving them slightly. Taped against the back wall was a picture of the two of us on our wedding day, flanked by other candid shots of us. I loved how much this man displayed his love for me.</p><p>With a slight smile, I headed toward the back of the room and rounded the corner just as the team doctor injected a shot into Jack\u2019s arm to help ease his pain. I noticed that he didn\u2019t even wince.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s shattered,\u201d Jack admitted as soon as his dark brown eyes met mine.</p><p>SHATTERED.</p><p>And in that moment, that\u2019s exactly how my heart felt. I rushed to his side, needing to be as physically close to him in that moment as I could.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d the doctor interjected. \u201cI\u2019m Dr. Evans.\u201d</p><p>I extended my hand to his. \u201cI\u2019m Cassie.\u201d</p><p>One look at Jack\u2019s face and my chest ached with the need to protect and comfort him. I stroked his shoulder as I asked, my tone all business, \u201cWhat do we know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely broken, but to what extent I\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cBut it will heal just fine, right? People break their hands all the time.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Evans nodded. \u201cTrue. But we need to make sure it won\u2019t require surgery, or pins or metal plates.\u201d</p><p>Pins or metal plates? Oh my God.</p><p>Jack swallowed audibly and I continued to prod the doctor, my growing concern overruling all levelheadedness. \u201cAnd if it does, then what? People have surgery on their hands all the time too. They get better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Mrs. Carter, they do,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cBut most of those people aren\u2019t major league pitchers.\u201d</p><p>My heart sank. \u201cSo, what are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that I need to x-ray his hand first and then I\u2019ll have more answers for you.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s chin dropped to his chest and I watched his eyes close.</p><p>\u201cDo I need to take him to a hospital?\u201d I started to reach for my cell phone to call Matteo. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, no. I have a machine in the other room. As the team\u2019s physician, I\u2019m responsible for Jack\u2019s condition and his recovery. It\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. So we don\u2019t have to go anywhere else?\u201d Since I\u2019d never thought this through, I didn\u2019t know how it worked when a major league player was injured. Wrongly, I\u2019d assumed Jack would have to get checked out at regular hospital, like normal people. But then again, the team chartered their own commercial planes to fly them places, so nothing about this lifestyle was normal.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m on the road with the team, one of my trainers will be here to help you, so no. You should never have to take Jack anywhere other than here.\u201d</p><p>The Mets organization cared about Jack\u2019s recovery, so I allowed myself to be comforted by the thought that he would be taken care of by the people who were invested in him the most. It was in their best interest, as well as his, to get him healed.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse us, Mrs. Carter, we\u2019ll only be a minute.\u201d The doctor motioned for Jack to follow him into another room. \u201cLet\u2019s go see what we\u2019re dealing with, Jack.\u201d</p><p>I paced the floor, one hand tugging at my lips from nervous habit. I wanted to call Dean, but knew he\u2019d ask me questions I didn\u2019t have the answers to. So I waited to call anyone until I had more to tell them. A broken hand was one thing, but having a hand that required surgery was another.</p><p>A few minutes later, Jack exited the medical room alone and scooped me into a careful hug. I felt his heart racing as our chests pressed together. \u201cI love you, Kitten.\u201d He gave me a quick kiss, then released me and hopped back onto the exam table. His hand looked painful, his fingers had taken on a purplish tint and were swollen to a ridiculous size. The sight of it made my stomach tighten painfully and I had to turn my gaze away.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d I wanted to say more, but words failed me. Bringing my hand toward my heart, my fingers grazed across the ball chain necklace that lay there. I glanced down at the key attached and moved my fingers to it, rubbing them across the etched letters for comfort.</p><p>Between the lies from Chrystle and the brutality from the press and fans, it wasn\u2019t that long ago when I felt like my insides were unraveling. Melissa had given me this necklace when I needed it the most. Imagining that Jack was experiencing the same sort of feelings right about now, I realized this was the right time to pass the necklace on, as was intended.</p> <p>I reached around the back of my neck, my fingers gripping at the chain before pulling it over my head. When I lowered the necklace around Jack\u2019s neck, he looked up at me, his face pale and strained with pain, and raised his eyebrows at me. The bronze key fell against his sweaty white T-shirt before he glanced down at it. With his uninjured hand, he lifted the key and flipped it to the stamped side, then read its message out loud. \u201cStrength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need this more than I do,\u201d I said before leaning in and planting a kiss on his scruffy cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. No matter what the doctor says when he walks through that door, we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d</p><p>I tried to sound positive and strong, but my insides were rattled and fraying. If Jack lost baseball because of this, I wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever get over it. His self-image, his hopes and dreams\u2014hell, his whole identity\u2014were wrapped up in the game. If the worst happened, if he could never play again, I had no idea how he\u2019d process that loss.</p><p>The sound of the door creaking open caused me to pull my gaze from Jack\u2019s and glance behind me. Footsteps slapped against the floor as Dr. Evans walked in our direction, a smile on his face. \u201cGood news. You don\u2019t need surgery and it\u2019s not shattered.\u201d I exhaled a huge sigh of relief and watched Jack do the same as the doctor continued. \u201cYou do have multiple fractures, however, here and here.\u201d He pointed at areas on the x-rays as Jack tensed beside me. \u201cAnd we need to get you in a cast immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will I be out?\u201d Jack asked, his face turning even whiter.</p><p>\u201cMinimum, six weeks. It could have been a lot worse. Frankly, I\u2019m surprised it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>I watched as Jack flexed his jaw and worked to keep his emotions in check. He didn\u2019t like that answer, but there was no answer that Jack would have liked. One day not playing baseball was one day too many for him. Six weeks probably sounded like a death sentence.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave my team for that long.\u201d Jack shook his head as he mumbled, \u201cI can\u2019t let them down like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, look at me,\u201d I begged. \u201cYou\u2019re not letting them down. They\u2019ll understand, and they\u2019ll want you to get better. Six weeks is better than six months, right? Let\u2019s take it one day at a time.\u201d</p><p>The pained look in his eyes informed me that these next six weeks were going to be anything but easy.</p><p>I\u2019m a Baseball Player</p><p>Hearing Dr. Evans tell me I\u2019d be out for six weeks made me want to fucking scream. But I didn\u2019t scream when I was frustrated; I hit shit. And right now, with a broken fucking hand, I couldn\u2019t hit anything.</p><p>A million thoughts raced through my head at once.</p><p>Why the fuck did I stick my hand out like that? No one in their right mind could catch a fast-ball being hit straight back at them. I must be mental. What if my hand doesn\u2019t heal right? What if they find someone new to replace me? Six weeks is a long time to have your job up for grabs. What if I can\u2019t throw again after this? I didn\u2019t want to get hurt. I just want to play baseball. What if I can\u2019t play anymore? I busted my ass to get where I am, I don\u2019t want to lose it. I\u2019m a ball player, that\u2019s what I am. That\u2019s who I am. What the hell will I do if I\u2019m not playing baseball?</p> <p>It was one thing when it was your choice to leave the only job in this world you could see yourself doing, but being forced to quit was another. The truth was that it was rarely ever your choice to leave.</p><p>I sucked in a breath, took one look at my beautiful wife, and hopped off the table. Grabbing her by the hand, I pulled her forcefully out of the locker room.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jack, stop. That hurts.\u201d She jerked her hand from my grip and I winced.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten. I just want to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me with sympathy in her eyes and I almost fucking exploded. The last thing I needed right now was my wife looking at me with pity. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d She stopped walking and tilted her head at me questioningly.</p><p>\u201cLike my life just ended and you want to make sure I\u2019m going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>She huffed out a breath before rolling her green eyes at me. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I shouted, my voice echoing throughout the concrete tunnels.</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to make sure you\u2019re okay, Jack! Jesus. Excuse me for giving a shit about your mental state. But I never once thought that your life just ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d I breathed out, my tone agitated. I was acting like a complete asshole in this moment and I fucking knew it. But I was pissed off. I was angry about putting my hand out like that ... for letting it get hit ... for letting it get broken.</p><p>\u201cOh, so now I don\u2019t get it? You\u2019re joking, right?\u201d she snapped in response, her tone matching my own, before she turned around and walked away from me.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>I needed to stop doing this to her; it wasn\u2019t fair. Irritated with myself, I smacked the palm of my hand against my head before rushing to catch up to her. I reached for her arm with my good hand, desperately pulling for her to stop. \u201cKitten. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m mad at myself, not you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her long blonde hair swinging with the motion, then let out a little sigh. \u201cI know.\u201d Then she locked her fingers with mine and pulled me toward the parking lot.</p><p>Once in the car with Matteo behind the wheel, I watched Cassie as she scrolled through her contacts, searching for my brother\u2019s phone number. She must have already warned Matteo, because he hadn\u2019t said two words to me and was avoiding all eye contact. My girl was good at this. I wished I hadn\u2019t been such a dick earlier.</p><p>I reached my free hand across the seat and squeezed her thigh. She glanced at me, still a little wary of me, it seemed. \u201cThank you,\u201d I whispered as she scrunched up her face in confusion.</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d She scooted her body closer to mine to keep our conversation private.</p><p>\u201cYou know what.\u201d I nodded my head in Matteo\u2019s direction and she shrugged. I chose wisely when it came to picking a wife. She was the best thing I\u2019d ever done. I needed to not fuck us up. Again.</p><p>She refocused her attention to her phone and I watched as Dean\u2019s name popped up on her screen and she pressed SEND. The phone rang twice before my brother\u2019s voice came from the speaker. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sis?\u201d</p><p>Cassie turned off the speaker and sucked in a breath as she lifted the phone to her ear. \u201cHey, Dean. I just wanted to let you know before you saw it on SportsCenter or Baseball Tonight or something.\u201d She paused briefly before continuing. \u201cJack broke his hand tonight.\u201d</p><p>I could only imagine the questions my brother was shooting at her from the other end of the line. His voice was muffled since she\u2019d taken him off speaker, so I couldn\u2019t make out any of his words.</p><p>\u201cHe was pitching and the ball got hit straight back at him. He threw his hand up to stop it, or catch it, or something. But the ball crashed into it and he has multiple fractures.\u201d</p><p>Cassie grew silent and I knew Dean was talking her ear off. I glanced in the rearview mirror and noticed Matteo paying attention to Cassie\u2019s side of the conversation as well.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting a vacation or anything, buddy,\u201d I called out in his direction.</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t dream of it,\u201d he responded without missing a beat.</p><p>\u201cI still have to go to the field every day to work out and I\u2019ll need a ride there and back,\u201d I informed him with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to check with my other clients.\u201d He raised his eyebrows and looked at Cassie. \u201cBut tell me, do you still have to go to the games and stuff?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYep. I have to suit up for the home games and hang out in the dugout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about when they\u2019re on the road?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meet with a trainer at the field when the team\u2019s gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you won\u2019t travel with them then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Not for six weeks.\u201d I sighed, suddenly feeling agitated.</p><p>Cassie sounded like she was wrapping things up. \u201cYeah. I\u2019ll call you tomorrow. Will you let Gran and Gramps know for us?\u201d She paused. \u201cThank you so much. Yep, I\u2019ll tell him. \u2018Bye.\u201d</p><p>She pressed END and turned toward me. \u201cDean says to take it easy and to not do anything stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell would I possibly do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. He\u2019s your brother,\u201d she teased and I grabbed at her.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah? Well, he\u2019s your brother too,\u201d I reminded her and a smile appeared across her face as she turned away from me. I leaned over and grazed my teeth against her earlobe, touching it with the tip of my tongue before whispering, \u201cI love your smile. It\u2019s sexy. Really fucking sexy. Don\u2019t be mad at me. I really am sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her face turned and I pressed my lips against hers before she could respond. Her lips parted slightly as she gave a little gasp that sent a message straight to my groin, so I sucked on her bottom lip lightly, then swept my tongue across it before sliding it into her mouth. The throbbing of my dick replaced the throbbing in my hand as I realized I had the cure to any broken bones right here in this car with me.</p><p>My hot-as-hell wife.</p><p>Matteo cleared his throat. \u201cUh. We\u2019re here, horny teenagers.\u201d</p><p>Cassie squeaked and I laughed as we pulled out of our kiss. \u201cThanks, cock-block.\u201d I eyed him before opening the car door. \u201cI\u2019ll call you when I know my schedule for the next couple of weeks, okay?\u201d</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>We walked into our apartment building and straight onto the waiting elevator. The doors closed and I pinned Cassie against the wall.</p><p>\u201cJack, what are\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d I demanded before quieting her with my mouth. I nipped at her lips before exploring her neck. My unbroken hand followed the curves of her waist, down her hips, before cupping her ass. I squeezed, causing her to whimper, and my dick felt like it might explode right there. I needed to be in her. And I needed it now.</p><p>The ding of the elevator arriving on our floor interrupted the sexual assault I was launching on Cassie\u2019s irresistible mouth. I moved to grab her with my broken hand and quickly switched arms. Reaching for her, I pulled a little too aggressively toward me and she yanked her hand from mine.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t apologize. Instead I fumbled with the keys, constantly reminding myself to do everything with the opposite hand. You never realize how much you take for granted until you\u2019re forced to. My left hand had always been great, completely reliable, my go-to hand ... until it broke and stopped working. Now I had to remember to perform even the most mundane of tasks with the hand that felt the most foreign to me.</p><p>Fighting off the frustration that seemed to be making itself at home, I needed to do something that made me feel like a man. Finally managing to get the front door open, I moved to grab Cassie, but she pressed her hands against my chest to stop me.</p><p>\u201cJack? Aren\u2019t we going to talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hand? What you\u2019re thinking?\u201d</p><p>I huffed out a laugh. \u201cYeah, Kitten. We\u2019ll talk. After you give me what I want, I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d</p> <p>I needed to fuck my wife. I needed to own her, take her, show her I was still the man in this relationship, even if I wasn\u2019t the man on the field. Her eyes narrowed as her lips twisted into a snarl. My girl was itching for a fight, and I wanted to suck that expression right off her face.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works, jackass,\u201d she snapped, and I immediately puffed out my chest.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play tough with me. You know you want some of this.\u201d I ran my hand down the length of my body and she chuckled. \u201cSo now my body\u2019s funny to you? I\u2019ll show you funny.\u201d</p><p>I stormed into the living room before stopping at one of the many mason jars filled with quarters around our house. Remembering the quarters I\u2019d saved for our first date after Cassie told me it cost me fifty cents every time I touched her, I smiled to myself. She had tried to be so sassy, but I saw her defenses weaken when I poured the bag of quarters all over the table at the diner where we were having dinner. Holding two coins between my unbroken fingers, I walked back to where Cassie stood. She hadn\u2019t moved. Not a muscle. She wanted this as much as I did, no matter how much she pretended she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cOpen your hands.\u201d She eyed me, but refused to move. \u201cI said, open your hands, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>She slowly cupped her hands in front of her body, and I dropped the fifty cents into her palms.</p><p>\u201cNow, get in the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Being Hurt Doesn\u2019t Work For Us</p> <p>Ever since we left the field, Jack had been a roller coaster of emotions, taking me on a violently jerky ride. One minute he was sweet and attentive, and rude and nasty the next. Unsure of which Jack I might get, I stayed quiet in our bed in the aftermath of having sex, trying to figure out what the hell had just happened between us.</p><p>Jack had always dominated in the bedroom, but this was something else entirely. He bossed me around, making demands he\u2019d never once said out loud before. He pushed and pulled at my body like he owned it, and I had no choice but to comply. Maybe under different circumstances I might have been turned on by his aggression, but not like this. Not after my husband just broke his pitching hand and potentially ended his career. He wasn\u2019t in his right mind and his performance in the bedroom only proved it.</p><p>I\u2019d never in a thousand years tell him that the thought of his career being over crossed my mind, but it did. Of course it did. I wasn\u2019t an idiot. Multiple fractures would eventually heal, but there could be complications. Everyone knew that. Jack needed his hand to work on the ball field. His fingers were required to grip and maneuver across the seams of the baseball for different pitches. If his grip loosened, his pitches wouldn\u2019t be the same. And the idea of Jack without baseball scared the hell out of me.</p><p>I knew he avoided talking about his injury for this very reason. I wasn\u2019t the only one scared, but at least I admitted it. Glancing over at his sweaty body, the lines of his chest rising and falling with each breath, I longed to make his pain and hurt go away. He was quieter than he\u2019d ever been before, and I realized how deep in his own head he must be.</p><p>Although I was the queen of building emotional walls, Jack could do a pretty good job too if he wanted. The memory of how I\u2019d behaved earlier in our relationship flooded through me. All the times I kept my feelings to myself, refusing to burden him with any of my personal drama. The only problem was that not talking to Jack about it forced me into personal overload, where the only solution I saw was to run away. Holding feelings in hadn\u2019t worked then, and it wouldn\u2019t work now. Desperate to keep the lines of communication open between us, I touched his chest lightly. \u201cJack?\u201d I whispered, still reeling from the sex we\u2019d just experienced.</p><p>He rolled over to face me. \u201cYep?\u201d His tone sounded annoyed again.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted to talk about how you\u2019re feeling, what you\u2019re thinking, something?\u201d</p><p>He growled. \u201cCassie, can we not do this tonight, please? Can\u2019t you just give me one fucking night to process everything before you make me spill my guts like a fucking chick?\u201d</p><p>I fought against the tears threatening to spill over and rolled away from his glare. \u201cBut you said we could talk after.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, I fucking lied. Just go to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I felt very small. I definitely wasn\u2019t used to this Jack and I most certainly didn\u2019t like it. He had never acted so callous when it came to talking to me before. He seemed so uncaring, so cold. My brain knew it was all a front, but my heart couldn\u2019t take the pain. Being treated like this by Jack, of all people, hurt more than words. We were married now. Didn\u2019t he feel differently about us? I certainly did. Or I had up until about five minutes ago.</p><p>Wiping the tears I couldn\u2019t stop from falling, I silently made a deal with myself to give him time to process and deal with what happened tonight, but after that he needed to get his act together. I wouldn\u2019t put up with this attitude forever, and I\u2019d make that abundantly clear if necessary.</p><p>I woke up the following morning to the light streaming through the windows where I forgot to close the curtains the night before. It was stupid the things you forgot to do when you were otherwise occupied with situations you weren\u2019t expecting. Sucking in a small breath, I glanced at Jack, who appeared to be sleeping peacefully on his back, his cast-covered arm resting across his bare chest.</p><p>Pushing myself up from the mattress, I walked quietly toward the bathroom to get ready for work.</p><p>\u201cCassie, can you close the fucking curtains?\u201d Jack\u2019s sharp voice cut through me.</p><p>Apparently a good night\u2019s sleep had done nothing for his attitude. Honest to God, no matter how beautiful I thought this man was, there was no way I would deal with this craptitude for very long. He was testing my patience, and that was something I had in short supply anyway. Fighting the urge to snap back at him, call him names, or stand up for myself, I merely did as he requested before walking into the bathroom and closing the door behind me. I stared at my reflection for a good five minutes before I attempted to do a single thing to my hair or face.</p><p>He\u2019ll get past this.</p><p>He has to.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Sucking in a long, deep breath, I closed my eyes and willed myself to be strong. With a firm nod to the only person in the room, I reached for my makeup bag and tossed the contents onto the counter before putting my face on.</p><p>When I arrived home from work that evening, Jack wasn\u2019t there. I had completely forgotten that the Mets had one last home game before they headed out on the road for ten days. Jack didn\u2019t mention anything about attending the game, but I knew he was required to be there. I clicked our television on just to make sure. No sooner had the picture cleared when I heard the announcer talking about Jack\u2019s \u201cbusted hand\u201d and his face appeared across my high-definition screen. He looked miserable.</p><p>By the time Jack got home, I could barely keep my eyes open. When I heard the front door open, I pretended to need a glass of water from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHow was the game?\u201d I asked, trying to sound cheerful and supportive. Jack didn\u2019t answer my question. He barely gave me a passing glance before moving around me and into our bedroom.</p><p>His silence stunned me.</p><p>I stood alone in the kitchen, my bare feet pressing against the cold tile flooring as I clutched at my chest. As soon as the stunned feeling arose, it disappeared. Anger replaced it and I shouted from where I stood, \u201cYou gonna pretend like you didn\u2019t hear me?\u201d I waited for a response before shouting again, \u201cAre you seriously not talking to me?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what was worse, the silent treatment or the asshole one. At least when he was being an asshole, he was talking. Not that it was pleasant.</p><p>The silent treatment went on for two more days.</p><p>Two. More. Days.</p><p>When you\u2019re living in that sort of hell, two days might as well be years. It felt like a fucking lifetime because I was so goddamned miserable. It affected everything in my life from the second my eyes opened, to the moment my mind finally allowed me to sleep at night. I was consumed by Jack\u2019s behavior and the fact that I couldn\u2019t get through to him.</p><p>I stared at the telephone on my desk and stopped myself from calling to check on Jack at least ten times. Part of me couldn\u2019t handle the idea that he\u2019d send my call to voice mail without a second thought. I glanced at my engagement ring and wedding band, suddenly nervous that what we\u2019d just shared with our family and friends felt threatened. Certainly we\u2019d been through tougher relationship challenges than this?</p><p>Hadn\u2019t we?</p><p>I hated the thoughts spinning in my mind, but what if Jack\u2019s baseball career were over? Was this how my husband was going to act from here on out, snappy and pissed off all the time? I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with it forever, no matter how much I loved him. I wanted my husband back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nora interrupted my musings by calling me into her office to discuss Jack\u2019s latest issue. \u201cClose the door,\u201d she demanded before I\u2019d even finished walking through it.</p><p>With a click, the door closed and I walked to the chair facing her and sat. I laughed as she glared at me, her mouth pursed into a displeased pucker.</p><p>\u201cBroke his hand, huh? I bet he\u2019s a joy to live with right now.\u201d She tapped her pen against a yellow notepad.</p><p>\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a real peach. How\u2019d you know?\u201d I asked, wondering how she could be so aware of Jack\u2019s moodiness.</p> <p>\u201cJack\u2019s one of those guys. A real man\u2019s man, if you know what I mean. Can\u2019t imagine he enjoys feeling helpless. And I\u2019ll tell you, Cass, that\u2019s exactly how he\u2019s feeling right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right, but it sucks. He\u2019s acting like a complete jerk.\u201d I pulled my mouth into a pout, wanting sympathy or understanding or something.</p><p>Her head tipped to one side as a slight smile crept across her lips. \u201cOf course he is. He doesn\u2019t know what else to do. He doesn\u2019t know who else he is if he isn\u2019t a baseball player. The bottom line,\u201d she paused before looking me straight in the eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s scared. He may never admit it, but he\u2019s terrified of losing the game.\u201d</p><p>The reality sank into my throat and I swallowed it whole. \u201cI know that. But it doesn\u2019t give him the right\u2014\u201d</p><p>She clicked her tongue to stop me midsentence. \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t give him the right to treat you badly. But just give him some time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have an assignment in another country you can send me on?\u201d I suggested with a halfhearted laugh.</p><p>\u201cNo, I do not,\u201d she said sternly. \u201cAnd even if I did, I wouldn\u2019t send you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you out to get me?\u201d I said it half-jokingly, but part of me wondered why she was being so hard on me.</p><p>Nora leveled her gaze to mine, a stray wisp of hair falling over one eye. \u201cI\u2019m not out to get you. I simply refuse to help you run away when it comes to this. He will get past it. And you\u2019ll be there for him when he does. You just need to be patient with him right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not really my strong suit,\u201d I said. \u201cPatience, I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, you\u2019re a woman. You can do anything. And you will.\u201d She smiled and waved her hand in dismissal. \u201cNow, get out of here and send me something pretty to look at. These new photographers don\u2019t have your eye.\u201d</p> <p>Without another word, I left Nora\u2019s office and headed back to my desk. Like I\u2019d done a million times already today, I checked both my cell phone and my work phone; neither showed signs of any missed calls. I hated living like this.</p><p>But Nora was right. I could do this. Jack would do this for me, wouldn\u2019t he? Hell, I didn\u2019t know what Jack would do at this point anymore.</p><p>I assumed Jack would still be on vocal strike when I got home from work, so I didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge him when I walked through our front door and saw him watching TV in our living room.</p><p>\u201cCassie, bring me a beer.\u201d</p><p>I froze in our foyer; stopped walking, moving, breathing. \u201cOh, now you\u2019re talking to me?\u201d I belted out, still surprised by his demanding tone.</p><p>His disheveled head turned in my direction. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>My temper hit the boiling point as I tossed my purse and keys on the hallway table and stalked to the living room. Hands on hips, I shouted, \u201cAre you fucking delusional or something? Do you even realize that you haven\u2019t spoken to me in almost three days?\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced back at me from his usual TV-viewing spot on the leather sofa, his cast-covered arm resting on a throw pillow and his sock-covered feet propped on the ottoman. I watched as his eyebrows pulled together before slowly releasing. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cBeer me.\u201d Then he turned his focus back on the Mets versus Astros game on the television.</p> <p>Tempted to pull a beer from the fridge and chuck it at his fucking head, I stormed through the kitchen before heading toward our bedroom. \u201cGet off your ass and get it yourself,\u201d I shouted as I slammed the door shut.</p><p>Angry tears burned at the back of my eyes and I wanted to scream and throw things. I felt like a prisoner in my own home. Whatever room Jack was in, I wanted to be nowhere near it, his rejection hurt me so badly. But the tears wouldn\u2019t fall; I was too busy feeling pissed off to waste time crying. Grabbing my latest read, I sank against my pillows and cracked open the spine, wanting nothing more than to escape the hell our life had become for just a little while.</p><p>\u201cStop acting like a bitch,\u201d Jack shouted through the closed door as he stomped through the kitchen.</p><p>My head snapped up. Did he just call me a bitch? Jack had never talked that way to me before. Ever. I slammed my book down on the bedside table and dialed the only person I thought could help me. The phone rang five times and I almost hung up when I heard his winded voice say, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean?\u201d I paused.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Sis?\u201d</p><p>I smiled, the action feeling almost alien after the last few days. \u201cAre you busy? Is this a bad time?\u201d I listened as he struggled for breath.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. I just had to run upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think you could come out here for a little bit? I know you\u2019re busy with work, but even if it\u2019s just for a few days it would be great. I need your help with Jack.\u201d</p><p>He laughed a breathy sound into the phone. \u201cIs he really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re not really seeing eye to eye right now, so maybe you should come out here and punch him in one.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll gladly beat the shit out of him. So, what\u2019s he doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d my tone turned serious. \u201cHe literally hasn\u2019t spoken a single word to me in almost three days. Not. A. Word,\u201d I said, pausing between each word for effect.</p><p>\u201cSay what? You\u2019re joking.\u201d Dean half laughed.</p><p>My frustration boiling over, I balled my hand into a fist and punched my thigh. \u201cI\u2019m not joking. It\u2019s not funny. I need your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sorry. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s being like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, I can. But I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s being like that to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s pretty awful,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cYou let me know when you want me there, and I\u2019m there.\u201d</p><p>I breathed out in relief. \u201cThank God. I\u2019ll take care of all the details. Just e-mail me your schedule and I\u2019ll do my best to book around it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan and Marc will let me take off whatever time I need. Book whatever and I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you so much, Dean. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d I ended the call, then got up and opened the bedroom door and walked out into the darkening house.</p><p>When I switched on the kitchen light, I heard, \u201cFinally come out to get me that beer?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice broke into the room, cutting the sliver of hope that was weaving its way within me clean through.</p><p>I bit my tongue so hard it almost bled. I wanted to be the bigger person, but he made it really damned hard.</p><p>At my silence, he called out, \u201cWho knew it was that hard to get your broken husband a beer?\u201d He was relentless.</p><p>\u201cFor Pete\u2019s sake, Jack, you\u2019re not broken. It\u2019s not like you can\u2019t get up and get it yourself.\u201d I leaned on the kitchen table and breathed deeply, willing myself to stay calm.</p><p>\u201cI am broken!\u201d he shouted, his eyes turning around to meet mine, the fire in them blazing. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you think of me?\u201d</p><p>What?</p><p>I stood in the small space between our room and the kitchen, stunned at his outburst. I honestly had no idea what Jack was talking about, and wasn\u2019t sure how to respond without this turning even uglier than it had already been.</p><p>His gorgeous face twisted into a sneer. \u201cSee? You can\u2019t even admit it! At least say it to my face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d I said carefully. \u201cI honestly have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d I shifted my weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Cassie. The least you can do is not lie to me.\u201d His voice took on a desperate quality and it caused my heart to ache for him, the pain so real I was certain it could be seen on an EKG.</p><p>Turning to face Jack where he still sat on the couch, I let out a sigh and my shoulders slumped. \u201cI\u2019m not lying to you, Jack. I love you.\u201d I longed to cross the space between us and close it, wrap my arms around him and reassure him that it would all be okay, but I was too scared. I couldn\u2019t make him that kind of promise and we both knew it.</p><p>Emotions flitted across his face\u2014yearning, distrust, then his expression settled into an angry mask. \u201cBut it\u2019s not enough to love me when I\u2019m broken like this, right? You love a baseball player, not just a man. And I\u2019m not a baseball player anymore. I\u2019m worthless on the field and I\u2019m worthless at home. I know that\u2019s what you think. And I don\u2019t blame you, but at least admit it.\u201d</p><p>My heart twisted as I looked at the torment evident on his face. I wanted so desperately to lock that pain and insecurity in a box, and then burn that box to ash and dust so he\u2019d never feel this way again. Seeing my confident husband reduced to this shell of a man crushed me.</p><p>I stepped toward him and he snapped, \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t come over here and look at me with pity in your eyes. Don\u2019t pity me, Cassie! I don\u2019t deserve your pity. And I don\u2019t want it. Just leave me the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d I cried out with a sob. \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore!\u201d Clutching one hand to my mouth, I broke down, tears of frustration falling without warning.</p><p>Jack narrowed his eyes and spit out, \u201cI knew it! I knew you were weak.\u201d</p><p>His voice burned me like venom from a snake bite, and I steadied my shaking body against the counter.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>He doesn\u2019t mean it.</p><p>It was easy for your head to know the truth, but try telling that to your heart when it was too busy shattering to hear.</p><p>Trembling, whether from heartbreak or anger, I wasn\u2019t sure, I swiped at my wet cheeks and said, \u201cI just meant that I can\u2019t deal with your attitude anymore. Dean is coming out here, so you\u2019d better get your act together.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d wondered how I was going to tell Jack that Dean was coming out. Thankfully, he\u2019d just given me the perfect opportunity.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you mean, Dean is coming out here? When did you two plan this little bullshit charade?\u201d he demanded, slamming his unopened beer down on our coffee table.</p><p>He\u2019d already gotten himself a beer? What the hell?</p><p>\u201cToday. I can\u2019t deal with you like this, Jack. You\u2019re mean. You\u2019re just plain mean.\u201d</p><p>His good hand balled into a fist before he looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t know what you think bringing Dean out here is going to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, me either.\u201d I sighed before walking away. It seemed like that\u2019s all I did lately, walk away from him instead of to him. I wondered if he truly thought I was quitting, or giving up. It probably looked that way in his eyes. But the truth was, I just needed to leave him alone, give him space before I said something I\u2019d regret. We were clearly making each other miserable, and I didn\u2019t want to make it any worse. Being away from him was the only way I could think of to stop the fighting. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Welcome to the Big Apple</p><p>Tapping my foot, I waited in baggage claim at JFK for Melissa and Dean. Tempted to bring a super-embarrassing fake sign congratulating them on the birth of their sextuplets, I\u2019d nixed that idea and waited empty-handed instead, an anxious smile plastered all over my face. Melissa\u2019s head covered with bouncy curls appeared first, followed by Dean\u2019s muscular frame towering over her.</p><p>When Melissa caught wind of Dean\u2019s impending trip, she invited herself along, claiming she still hadn\u2019t seen our place yet and it wasn\u2019t fair if Dean saw it first. Even though she\u2019d been to New York a hundred times before, it had been years since she\u2019d last visited. I said yes immediately, but reminded them both that we only had one guest room, so no fighting over the bed and the couch. In the end, they each agreed to share the one bed and I secretly wondered if I could cast a love spell on it before they arrived. I might have even searched for one online.</p><p>Hell, I think we were all tired of waiting for the inevitable coupling that should be Dean and Melissa. But maybe it was just inevitable to all of us on the outside? Especially since no one really knew what had happened between them.</p> <p>Melissa looked around curiously as she grabbed me with both hands. \u201cNo Jack?\u201d she asked and I breathed out a sarcastic sound.</p><p>Dean eyed me with sympathy. \u201cI\u2019ll kick his ass, Sis. It\u2019s all good.\u201d Then he wrapped his strong arms around me and gave me a tight squeeze.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not all good, Dean. It\u2019s not even close to all good.\u201d</p><p>The three of us walked side by side toward the baggage claim carousel. \u201cIs it that bad?\u201d Melissa asked in a low voice.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen this side of him.\u201d Unable to compare Jack\u2019s current personality to any of his moods I\u2019d witnessed since knowing him, I turned to Dean. \u201cHas he ever been like this before?\u201d</p> <p>Dean shrugged. \u201cNot that I can think of. I mean, he was a wreck when he lost you, but he wasn\u2019t a dick. The things you\u2019ve been telling me don\u2019t sound like my brother at all.\u201d</p><p>His words actually relieved me. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause then this isn\u2019t really a part of him, you know? It\u2019s just something he\u2019s going through right now.\u201d I nodded to myself before continuing. \u201cAnd I think I can deal with that if I know for certain it\u2019s eventually going to come to an end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell then, you\u2019d better pray he can pitch in six weeks.\u201d</p><p>The truth of that sentence sucked the air from my lungs and I almost doubled over in the middle of the airport. Dean was right. And even though I wasn\u2019t the type of person who prayed, I would definitely start praying tonight.</p> <p>We stopped walking as other people from their flight started filling in the space around us. Melissa looked around. \u201cAny paparazzi follow you here?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cThey\u2019ve backed off since the article with Vanessa came out. You know that. Although I am a little surprised they aren\u2019t more up my ass since Jack got hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe thankful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, trust me, I am. The last thing I need is for them to catch wind of Jack\u2019s piss-and-vinegar attitude.\u201d</p><p>Melissa glanced around. \u201cSo, where\u2019s our hot driver? Meow,\u201d she said playfully, raising her eyebrows as I smacked her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s home with his pregnant wife, you whore. She wasn\u2019t feeling well and I told him I\u2019d go with another driver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s no fun.\u201d Her bow-shaped lips puckered into that famous Meli pout.</p><p>I glanced at Dean, who tried to pretend like her words didn\u2019t bother him, but his body language said otherwise. His back had stiffened and his lips had pressed together into a slight snarl. Glancing back at Melissa, I asked, \u201cWho needs Matteo when you have Dean?\u201d</p> <p>Dean glanced at me, a sarcastic smirk replacing the snarl. \u201cWe all know I\u2019m not good enough for Princess Melissa here.\u201d He waved his hand in her direction.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Melissa snapped back. \u201cWhoever said you weren\u2019t good enough for me? And don\u2019t call me Princess!\u201d</p><p>Tension practically crackled in the air between them, and I sighed.</p><p>Dean squinted his hazel eyes and lowered his face to hers. \u201cIf you actually liked me back, Princess, then we\u2019d be together right now.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cWe are together right now, dummy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean we\u2019d be a couple and you know it. Stop avoiding the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not avoiding anything. You\u2019ve never even asked,\u201d Melissa half-shouted over the sound of the baggage claim carousel kicking into gear.</p><p>\u201cAsked? Asked you what? I don\u2019t even know what the hell you\u2019re talking about right now!\u201d Dean threw his hands into the air before pacing back and forth. \u201cYou make me crazy, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Melissa shrugged her slim shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t even do anything.\u201d</p><p>He stopped pacing and pointed a finger at her. \u201cYou don\u2019t even do anything? YOU DON\u2019T EVEN DO ANYTHING?\u201d he repeated as his face reddened.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d She looked at me before smiling and flipping her hair.</p><p>Listening to this verbal ping-pong match all weekend was going to be the death of me. I stepped between them and gritted out, \u201cHoly shit, you two, shut up. Work it out in the bedroom. Please, for the love of all that\u2019s holy ... just work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying for the last two years,\u201d Dean said through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cHe always makes me the bad guy!\u201d Melissa yelled before stomping away.</p><p>Dean\u2019s hands flew to the back of his head, where he threaded his fingers through his hair. \u201cShe is going to fucking kill me. Look at her.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked and stifled a laugh. Melissa was currently struggling to get her suitcase off the spinning carousel. The damn thing looked twice her size and she was being dragged along as she yanked at it, unable to maneuver it over the edge and onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d I nudged his rib cage with my shoulder.</p><p>When we got into the car, I positioned myself in the rear seat between Dean and Melissa, feeling like a referee just waiting to blow my whistle and shout, \u201cInterference!\u201d or \u201cOffside!\u201d But neither of them so much as looked at the other. This was going to be a long few days.</p><p>Dean stared out the car window, his eyes widening as he took in the views. I remembered how alive I felt the first time I came here. In the midst of my Jack-shattered heart, New York seemed to be the only place that could mend it. It buzzed with energy in the day, but it created it at night. I loved this city.</p><p>\u201cWait until you see the view from our balcony.\u201d</p><p>Dean turned to me. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you guys live here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty awesome, right?\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p><p>The car slowed to a stop as we pulled in front of our building. \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Dean didn\u2019t wait for our driver to open his door. \u201cThis looks like something straight out of Disneyland,\u201d he said, glancing up at the light bulbs that lined the awning over our building\u2019s entrance, and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just those lights. I know. They look like the movie theater on Main Street. But you won\u2019t think that in the daytime. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Pete.\u201d I smiled at the driver as he unloaded the last of the suitcases from the trunk.</p><p>Melissa looked straight up into the night sky. \u201cTwenty-three floors up, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I responded before wrapping an arm around her. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. Just don\u2019t look down.\u201d A small sound squeaked out of my best friend.</p><p>The doorman held open the front door for us to walk through. \u201cEvening, Mrs. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Antonio. This is Jack\u2019s brother, Dean, and my best friend, Melissa. They\u2019re staying with us for a few days, so be sure to give them access.\u201d</p><p>Antonio studied their faces, as if committing them to memory. \u201cYou got it. I hope you enjoy your stay.\u201d He tipped his head. \u201cOh, and Mrs. Carter, tell Mr. Carter we miss him on the field and to get better soon.\u201d</p><p>Forcing a smile, I told him I would pass along his message, but inside I started to crumble. \u201cI hope you\u2019re ready for this,\u201d I warned Dean as the elevator dinged and we stepped inside.</p><p>Dean nodded. \u201cBut can I just say that this place is awesome? A doorman? Lights like Disneyland? I can\u2019t wait to see what your apartment looks like.\u201d</p><p>I held back a chuckle; he sounded like an excited kid. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculously nice. We\u2019re really lucky.\u201d</p><p>My mind shot back to the day we first toured this apartment. Jack had the rare day off and had found us this place after researching all morning. It was love at first sight for me, what with the granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, enormous master bedroom, and equally huge marble bathroom. The balcony with its view of the city was simply an added perk that called to my photographic side. To put it mildly, I fell in love the moment I walked through the front door.</p><p>Jack, on the other hand, didn\u2019t even explore the apartment at all. Waiting for my approval, he said all that mattered was that I liked it. He had been sold on the doorman, the twenty-four hour security, and the private gym.</p><p>\u201cCassie? Hellooo.\u201d Melissa waved a hand in front of my eyes, forcing me back to reality.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d I said with a sheepish smile. \u201cI was just remembering the first time we saw this place.\u201d I shook off the memory and stepped out of the elevator.</p><p>When I opened the front door, the shadows from the television and the city lights danced across the otherwise darkened walls. Floor-to-ceiling windows provided the most beautiful views of the city, and Melissa gasped as she pulled her suitcase through the entryway.</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s stunning. What a view, Cass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Dean agreed as the wheels on his suitcase squeaked.</p><p>Melissa leaned toward me and whispered, \u201cWhere\u2019s Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to sleep, but you\u2019re all so fucking loud.\u201d Jack\u2019s snarky voice sliced through our otherwise enjoyable moment, putting us all on notice.</p><p>I pursed my lips together, my eyes instantly filling with tears, and waved a hand in the direction of the couch.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a peach?\u201d Dean mocked, before walking through the living room and flipping on every switch he could find.</p><p>The apartment lit up like a showroom and Jack cursed. \u201cTurn those off. Fuck.\u201d He glared at his brother in the bright light, and for a moment I was embarrassed at his appearance. He refused to shave and wouldn\u2019t let me help him, so his beard was overgrown and he looked really scruffy.</p><p>\u201cStop being a dick,\u201d Dean snapped back.</p><p>\u201cStop being here,\u201d Jack growled before covering his eyes with a pillow.</p><p>\u201cNice to see you, too.\u201d Dean moved away from his brother and walked back toward his things. \u201cWhere\u2019s the guest room?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I wiped the lone tear that fell, disheartened to witness this kind of interaction between them. \u201cSorry. It\u2019s over here.\u201d I led him to the far left side of the apartment. \u201cOur room is on the other side of the kitchen. This is your bathroom, so make yourself at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen him like this. He didn\u2019t even make eye contact with me,\u201d Dean said with a wince.</p><p>\u201cTold you it was bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d he breathed out. \u201cI need a minute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course. Take all the time you need. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s going anywhere.\u201d I turned to leave the room and ran straight into Melissa.</p><p>\u201cIs this our room?\u201d she asked, peering around me.</p><p>\u201cYep. Bathroom\u2019s behind you. Make yourself at home.\u201d I sucked in a deep breath, then leaned down to give her a hug and whispered, \u201cTake care of Dean, please. Don\u2019t fuck with him any more. You\u2019re going to break him.\u201d</p><p>Melissa coughed against me, shocked by my words. \u201cOh my God, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding. He needs you,\u201d I said pointedly before walking away.</p> <p>New York State of Mind</p><p>The next morning, I woke up with a back sore from sleeping on the couch two nights in a row. The constant barrage of conversation surrounding me reminded me that my brother and Melissa were here.</p><p>Great.</p><p>It had to be clear to everyone that I was avoiding my wife. My mind was spinning out of control with thoughts I never imagined having. The idea of my baseball career being over wrecked me.</p><p>Literally fucking ruined me.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t function like a normal human being anymore. The thought turned me into an unrecognizable asshole. And the worst part was, I knew it. I was completely aware of my behavior, but it was like I couldn\u2019t stop it. My head would tell my mouth not to say what it was about to say, but my mouth would say it anyway.</p> <p>And even though I wanted to take it all back, I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s as if I started digging a hole and once I got in it, I couldn\u2019t stop digging. I wanted to get low enough so that I could bury myself inside and never see the light of day again. That was what losing baseball felt like.</p><p>\u201cHey, asshole,\u201d my little brother\u2019s voice called out and I cleared my throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, dick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to sightsee and you\u2019re taking me,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>I almost fucking laughed. There was no way I was going to let Dean boss me around. \u201cI\u2019m sure Cassie would be better at that sort of thing.\u201d Even that sentence came out sounding like a slam against her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure she would be too. But I want you to take me. You need to get out of this house. And you look like shit.\u201d</p><p>Melissa laughed and I shot her an evil look. \u201cShut up, Fun-Size. Why are you even here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Jack. I\u2019m here because you\u2019re being an asshole to my best friend. And someone has to give a shit about her.\u201d</p> <p>Her words stung, but I pretended not to be fazed. Each breath I sucked in pierced my heart more deeply. I had to stop hurting Cassie, but I couldn\u2019t. Why couldn\u2019t I just fucking stop? Pushing up from the couch, I glared at the three of them sitting at the table, then growled at Dean, \u201cBe ready to leave in ten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, where we going?\u201d my brother asked after we left the girls at the apartment, his face filled with excitement.</p><p>\u201cYou like it here, don\u2019t you?\u201d I teased, my mood already lifting. The trees were losing their leaves and the weather was changing. That was definitely one of the coolest things about living here\u2014the feeling in the air as the seasons changed.</p><p>He looked around. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyplace like it.\u201d</p><p>And he was right. There was nothing like this in Southern California, and New York did have a magical feel to it. That is, once you looked past all the dirt, trash, and large rats running around. Hell, even that shit didn\u2019t bother me.</p><p>\u201cWell, I haven\u2019t seen much, to be honest,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time to play tourist, but you\u2019ve got to see Central Park. It\u2019s huge.\u201d I punched my brother in the arm.</p><p>\u201cHow far is it? Do we drive there? Or walk? Or take the subway?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cShut the fuck up. Jesus, you\u2019re like a damn chick. We\u2019ll walk there. It\u2019s nice out and that way you can see more. You can\u2019t see shit if we\u2019re underground in the train.\u201d</p><p>Dean agreed and basically walked with his head up his ass, staring up and around the whole time. \u201cDude, you need to be aware of your surroundings. At least act like you\u2019re paying attention or someone\u2019s going to mug you,\u201d I said, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shot me an incredulous glance.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big fucking city. Shit happens. Don\u2019t act stupid.\u201d</p><p>A group of young couples passed by us and I pulled my hat lower, trying to avoid being noticed. \u201cI think that was Jack Carter! Oh my God,\u201d a girl squawked from behind me.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I mumbled to no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cThat is him,\u201d I heard another one say. \u201cLook, he has a cast on and everything. Jack? Excuse me, Jack?\u201d The sound of shoes slamming against the pavement stopped me.</p><p>I turned to face the group of twenty-somethings.</p><p>\u201cCan we have your autograph?\u201d one of the girls asked hopefully.</p><p>Lifting up my broken arm, I shrugged. \u201cCan\u2019t really sign anything with a broken hand, sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, stupid me.\u201d The girl smacked her forehead. \u201cCan we get a picture with you, then?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath and glanced around before agreeing. \u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>After one shot, I\u2019d hoped we were done, but everyone had their own camera phone, and wanted their own picture. Soon a small crowd had formed, all clamoring for the same thing. Trying to keep my irritation in check, I obliged everyone wanting a photo with me before turning toward my brother, who had willingly turned photographer. \u201cSorry. Maybe we should have taken the train,\u201d I said before continuing up East Fifty-Ninth.</p><p>\u201cNah. It\u2019s cool,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cPlus, you were actually nice to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? What\u2019s your problem, man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start with me,\u201d I said through clenched teeth. I didn\u2019t want to talk about this. My thoughts alone caused me enough grief. The last thing I wanted to do was actually talk about them.</p><p>\u201cI will start with you,\u201d Dean said harshly. \u201cYou\u2019re being a real dick. And to Cassie, of all people. Do you want her to fucking leave you?\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking. Mid. Fucking. Step.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you just say to me?\u201d I glared at my little brother, my heart fucking pounding out each beat against my chest.</p><p>Dean hardened his expression. \u201cShe won\u2019t put up with this forever. Eventually she\u2019ll leave you. And it will be your own fault.\u201d</p><p>I moved to shove him but he dodged me. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Don\u2019t you dare fucking say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t want to hear the truth? You\u2019re unbearable right now. I\u2019ve never seen you like this. And heaven forbid your hand not heal right and\u2014\u201d</p><p>I cut him off, not wanting to hear the next fucking word that came out of his mouth. Right now all I wanted to do was punch him in it. \u201cShut up, Dean. Shut the fuck up right now. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. You have no idea how I feel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me! Tell someone!\u201d he shouted and I swore the entire city stopped moving so they could listen.</p><p>\u201cKeep your goddamned voice down,\u201d I demanded and resumed walking. His fingers wrapped around the sleeve of my shirt and he pulled me back. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about this,\u201d he said as he leveled his gaze to mine. \u201cSo figure out someplace we can go to do it. I\u2019m not taking no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>My stubborn nature refused to let me respond. Instead I marched forward, heading in the direction of the park. Central Park was massive. There were plenty of places we could go to talk and not be surrounded by prying ears.</p><p>As we crossed over Fifth Avenue, I turned to Dean and pointed. \u201cThat\u2019s the Plaza Hotel. It\u2019s Cassie\u2019s favorite, she\u2019s absolutely in love with it. And that fountain.\u201d</p><p>Dean looked in the direction of the hotel. \u201cI can see why. It\u2019s fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on. The park\u2019s right there.\u201d</p><p>I could tell Dean still didn\u2019t get it. He didn\u2019t know how grand this park was. I\u2019m sure he assumed that the park would be the size of one of our parks at home. I should have told him that Central Park was more like Griffith Park, only more awesome.</p><p>Entering through the southeast corner of the park, it didn\u2019t take long until the sounds of the outside world started to fade. The park was alluring in that way. You could cross the street in front of screaming cabs and tourists, and before you knew it you\u2019d entered a world where birds were chirping, people were jogging, and the only other sound you heard were those of horseshoes clacking against the pavement. Submersed inside this world, it was easy to forget anything existed outside of it.</p><p>A few more steps and we were at the pond. \u201cWow,\u201d Dean said with a smile. \u201cSo this is Central Park, huh?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. Shit. I hadn\u2019t laughed in days and my face knew it. It hurt. \u201cThis is barely Central Park.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDude, this is the pond. There\u2019s a lake, a merry-go-round, an ice skating rink, baseball fields, a zoo, the meadow where they have concerts and shit. This place is huge. I still haven\u2019t seen the whole thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a park. That sounds like a city.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt sorta is, like a city within a city.\u201d Spotting some large boulders in the distance, I sped toward them as Dean followed behind. I climbed up on the largest one and sat on top. Dean climbed up next to me.</p><p>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDoes what hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour hand. I see you tucking it against you every now and then, and I wondered if it hurts.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at the cast covering my pitching arm. \u201cDo I really do that? I didn\u2019t notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not an answer,\u201d he said.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t admitted it to anyone. Not even to the team\u2019s doctor, but yes, my hand hurt. It fucking killed me. As far as they knew, I was taking their prescribed painkillers. But the truth was that I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it hurts,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cHow bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a constant pain. I can feel my heart beating in my fingertips. It fucking kills me.\u201d</p><p>Dean\u2019s head tipped to one side as though he were confused, or worried. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good. They gave you painkillers, right?\u201d</p><p>I nodded sharply.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not working, then? You have to tell them.\u201d</p><p>I huffed out a breath. \u201cI\u2019m not taking them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Why on earth not?\u201d His face scrunched up with confusion and I looked around at the green trees surrounding us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t do that shit. I don\u2019t do drugs. I\u2019ve never taken a painkiller in my life and I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re addictive. What if I get addicted to them?\u201d</p><p>Dean laughed. Full-out belly laughed, and I resisted punching him in the gut to shut him up.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get addicted,\u201d he said. \u201cJust cut them in half. Whenever you start to feel the pain, take half of whatever they prescribed you. Soon, the pain will stop and you won\u2019t need them. You\u2019re not Superman, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI say that because I know you, brother,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnd I say no because I\u2019ve seen way too many guys get addicted to shit. I refuse to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>He sighed, clearly more convinced of my own strength than I was. \u201cHere.\u201d He pulled an envelope from his back pocket and tossed it onto my lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a letter from Gran.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou read it?\u201d I asked, my tone defensive.</p><p>He frowned at me and snapped, \u201cDoes it look like I read it?\u201d</p><p>I turned the envelope around, and ripped open the seal.</p><p>Dear Jack,</p><p>Sometimes life doesn\u2019t unfold the way we want it to. You, of all people, have learned that lesson all too well. First with your parents, then with Cassie and that other horrible girl, and now with baseball.</p><p>Gramps and I are so sorry that your hand is broken. And we know how much you must be hurting because of it. But, Jack, I\u2019m hearing things about your behavior and attitude toward your wife that I cannot condone. I did not raise you to be mean, rude, or disrespectful to the one person who has loved you at your worst.</p> <p>I know you feel as though your life IS baseball, but the reality is your life is so much more than just your chosen profession. True, baseball is a part of your life, but it is only a part. No matter how wholeheartedly you think differently, you are not baseball, and baseball is not you. It will not last forever. Nothing does, dear. Nothing except love, of course.</p><p>Eventually your hand will heal, but if you ruin things with your wife, I fear your heart never will. Remember how it felt to lose her. And don\u2019t let it happen again.</p><p>Remember who you are. You\u2019re Jack Carter, the boy with the unbreakable spirit and resolve. The boy who doesn\u2019t take no for an answer when it\u2019s something he wants. You\u2019ve been like that since you were five years old. And I know you haven\u2019t changed. So stop throwing this little pity party of yours and get your priorities straight.</p><p>You know how I feel about flying, so DO NOT MAKE ME GET ON A PLANE AND FLY OUT THERE! I will if you leave me no choice, but I won\u2019t be happy about it. The next time I talk to that wife of yours, she\u2019d better not be crying.</p><p>I love you,</p><p>Gran (Gramps too)</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d I breathed out, running my free hand through my hair. \u201cCassie cried to Gran?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Dean asked, clearly as clueless as I was. I handed him the letter so he could read it himself and sucked in a long, slow breath. They were right. Everyone was. I was being a fucking asshole to the one person who deserved it the least.</p> <p>Cassie.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>My beautiful Kitten. My heart. My soul. The only thing in this world I loved more than baseball. Had I somehow forgotten that? I certainly acted like it. I owed her a million apologies, and a thousand explanations. And I hoped that they would be enough.</p><p>All I\u2019d done since I met this girl was bring her grief. It wasn\u2019t enough to have some good times when you overshadowed them with bad ones. I needed to stop being such a dick and get my head on straight.</p><p>\u201cRemind me to never upset her, okay? I don\u2019t think I could handle a Gran letter like this.\u201d Dean\u2019s eyes were wide as he handed the letter back to me.</p><p>I grabbed it and folded it carefully, then tucked it into my jeans pocket.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get out of here. I need to go home.\u201d I rose from the rock and climbed back down it, trying not to fall on my ass and break my other hand.</p><p>I thought Dean might be disappointed, but he sat there looking at me with a shit-eating grin plastered all over his face. \u201cThank God!\u201d he called out toward the sky.</p><p>\u201cNow we\u2019re religious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s what it takes, then hell yeah, I\u2019m religious.\u201d He hopped down and patted my back. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home to your wife.\u201d</p><p>I hailed a cab the second my foot hit the crowded sidewalk outside the park. We scooted into the backseat and I gave the cabbie our address.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you want to talk about it?\u201d Dean looked at me and the sympathy in his eyes made me cringe.</p><p>\u201cI do,\u201d I said with a nod. \u201cBut not with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, thanks.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that. I just need to talk to my wife first.\u201d</p><p>Dean nodded his head in agreement. \u201cDefinitely. But then I want to hear about it, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks for coming out here.\u201d I punched his thigh playfully, wanting him to know that having him here made me happy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your brother. I\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he said, and I knew he meant it.</p><p>\u201cSame here.\u201d Of course I didn\u2019t need to say it, but I wanted to.</p><p>I\u2019d missed Dean more than I realized. It was easy to forget how much you miss people when you didn\u2019t see them every day. I must be more of the out of sight, out of mind type. Unless we were talking about Kitten; then all bets were off. Because when it came to her, I was more the distance makes the heart grow fonder type. Or you could just call me pussy for short.</p><p>I burst through our front door with Dean on my heels, praying Cassie would be home. When I found her in the kitchen table with Melissa, her green eyes instantly found mine before they looked away, the pain I\u2019d caused her abundantly clear.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She hated me. I\u2019d hate me too. How many times had I said that before?</p><p>Ignoring Melissa, I rushed to Cassie, grabbed her hand in my good one, and pulled her into our bedroom, slamming the door behind us. Without a word, I pulled her over to the bed and sat down, pulling her to a seat on the mattress next to me.</p><p>\u201cJack, what are you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShhh. Please. Just wait here for a minute,\u201d I begged. Leaning over and placing my head against my cast, I closed my eyes and silently berated myself. Cassie didn\u2019t move and I didn\u2019t either, afraid that if I disturbed the emotional dust settling around us, I\u2019d mess it all up again.</p><p>I sat there a good ten minutes without moving a muscle. When I finally sat up and opened my eyes, tears began to spill down my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Kitten. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. Please, please don\u2019t leave me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave you?\u201d Her eyebrows flew up and her eyes grew wide, as if she had no idea what I was talking about.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up. I\u2019m just so scared for what all this means, you know?\u201d I held my cast-covered arm in the air and she nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to lose baseball. I\u2019m not ready for my career to be over. And I\u2019ve taken it all out on you.\u201d</p><p>She started to cry. No words came, just tears, so I went on. \u201cI know you probably hate me. Or you\u2019re mad at me. And I deserve it. But please know how sorry I am. I\u2019ll never treat you like this again, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep,\u201d she said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>I shifted over, closing the space between us, and pulled her body against mine. \u201cI\u2019ll never treat you like this again,\u201d I said against her hair as she trembled in my arms. \u201cI am so sorry for the way I\u2019ve been acting. I\u2019m scared. Terrified I\u2019ll never be able to throw again. I\u2019m not ready. I\u2019m not ready to lose baseball. But I\u2019ll never be ready to lose you.\u201d</p><p>Cassie pulled back slightly so she could look up at me. \u201cJack,\u201d she said softly as I wiped the tears from her face. \u201cWhy are you so convinced your career\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>I paused, my mind instantly thinking about my parents both choosing to abandon me and Dean at different times. The helpless feeling started to sweep over me again, filling me with dread. It amazed me how after all these years, one simple past action could send me into a tailspin. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Because I love baseball so much and I want it so badly, I\u2019m afraid it will be taken from me. Like I don\u2019t deserve to have the things that I love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have me,\u201d she said softly as she pinned me with her gaze.</p><p>\u201cBut I lost you. I had to get you back. Nothing comes easy. I fuck things up. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s only a matter of time before I fuck up baseball too.\u201d</p><p>Her face scrunched up and she shouted, \u201cStop it!\u201d which surprised me. \u201cJust stop it. I hate this side of you. It\u2019s like you\u2019re quitting and that\u2019s not the Jack I know. Stop being so complacent. Be a fucking man. Be the man I know and love.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, her words striking me square in the chest. I wanted to yell at her for being so harsh, but she was right and I needed to hear it. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m filled with self-pity and it\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t give a fuck if baseball tries to quit on me, I\u2019m not going to let it.\u201d</p><p>The corners of her mouth started to tilt upward with my confession. \u201cThat\u2019s what I like to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I am really sorry. I can never take back the way I acted, but I can promise you I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d I fell to my knees. \u201cI know all I do is apologize to you for fucking up, but please, Kitten. I need you by my side. I\u2019ll always need you by my side. Say you forgive me. Please.\u201d</p><p>I waited. Waited for her to say she forgave me. Waited for her to say she loved me and she\u2019d never leave me. I\u2019d wait forever to hear those words if she wanted me to. She lowered herself to the floor next to me and took my face in the palm of her hands. God, her hands were soft.</p><p>Her green eyes stared through me, intense and ferocious as she spoke. \u201cI\u2019m your wife. I vowed in front of our friends and family that I would love you until I died. And I plan on doing just that, but please,\u201d she paused, \u201cstop making it so hard for me.\u201d Her lips found mine and my chest instantly eased with relief.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I fucking love you.\u201d My tongue explored the inside of her mouth and I wanted to bury myself in her. \u201cI need you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, we have guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t guests. They can wait. I need to be inside you. You\u2019re my home. I need to be home right now.\u201d</p><p>Cassie hesitated and pulled away slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t do it like last time.\u201d She looked down as I struggled to remember what she was talking about.</p><p>Then I remembered. I was rough with her the night I got hurt, and that was the last time we\u2019d been together. \u201cOh shit, Cassie. Did I hurt you?\u201d Her head shook slowly back and forth, her eyes still focused on the floor. \u201cI did, didn\u2019t I? I fucking hurt you, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt me,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cThen what? What did I do? I know I was rough and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll never forgive myself if you\u2019re not okay.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe this. It was one fuck-up after another with me. How could I be so stupid all the time? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She looked up, her eyes meeting mine. \u201cYou scared me a little. Not a lot. But still.\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head into my hand and wiped at my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. Kitten, please. I needed to feel like a man because I felt so useless on the ball field. I wanted to dominate something, but I didn\u2019t even think about how it would make you feel. I just wanted to make myself feel better. \u2018Cause I\u2019m a selfish prick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just need a little time, okay? I love you and we\u2019ll be fine, but I need us to go slow right now,\u201d she suggested and my dick ached.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. We\u2019ll go at your pace. Whatever you want. I\u2019ll do whatever you want.\u201d I pulled her against me and hugged her tight. She probably couldn\u2019t breathe, but I needed her to be that close to me.</p> <p>\u201cThank you. We should probably get out there.\u201d She smiled and I pushed up from the floor before reaching for her.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry,\u201d I whispered against her ear before hugging her again.</p><p>\u201cI know. Just talk to me, please. You can\u2019t get like that. I can\u2019t get like that. It doesn\u2019t work for us when we don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never dealt with this before,\u201d I admitted and she nodded against my chest.</p><p>\u201cI know. But we\u2019ll deal with it together. We\u2019re a team, remember? You told me that. It\u2019s you and me against the world, Carter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor fucking ever,\u201d I said before covering her mouth with mine and pouring all my love for her into that kiss. She moaned and her body relaxed against me. We\u2019d be okay. We just needed a little time.</p><p>When we finally left our bedroom, Melissa and Dean were sitting on the couch watching some chick flick. He had his arm around her and she was leaning against him.</p><p>\u201cFigures you\u2019d grow a vagina the second I leave you alone,\u201d I teased and Dean breathed out a sigh. \u201cWhat the hell are you two watching?\u201d</p><p>Dean shoved a fist in the air. \u201cMy brother\u2019s back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done being an asshole, Asshole?\u201d Melissa chirped in my direction.</p><p>\u201cAre you done being a cock tease to my brother, Cock-Tease?\u201d I chirped back.</p> <p>Cassie\u2019s hand landed hard against my chest. \u201cJack! Leave them alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was planning on it, until you shot me down.\u201d I threw her a glance and flashed a smile in her direction.</p><p>\u201cCrash and burn, huh, big brother?\u201d Dean asked.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t talk if I were you,\u201d I warned.</p><p>Cassie cleared her throat. \u201cEnough with the dick measuring. Jeez.\u201d</p><p>Melissa turned her head around. \u201cOh my God, go put a shirt on,\u201d she shouted at my ripped chest. \u201cWait! Get over here.\u201d</p><p>I knew she wanted me.</p><p>I sauntered over to where they were lying on the couch and she reached for my pecs. \u201cHey, keep your hands off the goods, lady,\u201d I teased.</p> <p>\u201cYou wish.\u201d Melissa rolled her eyes and grabbed at my necklace. \u201cShe gave you her key?\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath and pulled the key from her grip. \u201cYeah. The night I got hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty cool,\u201d she said with a smile.</p><p>Cassie closed a drawer and yelled out, \u201cCan we order dinner in? I\u2019m starving. Unless you guys wanna go out? I\u2019m sorta spent, to be honest, but I could rally.\u201d</p><p>That was my girl, always putting everyone else\u2019s wants and needs above her own. I knew she was exhausted after everything we\u2019d been through, but she\u2019d still go get all dolled up and head out for the night if that was what my brother and her best friend wanted to do.</p><p>I shot Dean a look that said I\u2019d fucking kill him if he made her go out. Thank God he could read my mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay in,\u201d Dean called out while holding my gaze. \u201cWe can go out tomorrow. Is that okay with you?\u201d He glanced at Melissa.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care what we do. I\u2019m comfortable right here.\u201d She leaned her tiny body into his and sighed.</p><p>He winked at me, then shouted, \u201cOrder in!\u201d</p><p>Note to self: Remind Dean to never fucking wink at me again.</p><p>It\u2019s Just Sex</p><p>The next morning I woke up to Cassie sleeping on my chest. My left arm was pressed against her back, which I figured was a complete waste since I couldn\u2019t feel her skin through my cast.</p><p>She\u2019d initiated sex last night and I let her control the pace. I figured she\u2019d make me wait weeks to earn back her trust in the bedroom, but thankfully she wanted it just as badly as I did. After apologizing with my tongue until she came in my mouth, I entered her slowly, making sure nothing I did would remind her of the other night. It didn\u2019t take long for her body to give itself over to me and for her mind to follow. Thank God.</p><p>No matter how much hurt and pain we\u2019d caused each other in the past, the fact was that we were in it for the long haul. We trusted each other. Sometimes we lost our way, but we always found our way back. I never wanted that to end. And I never wanted to be the cause of it again. I hated that I scared her. What kind of asshole scares his wife during sex?</p><p>I tangled my good fingers through the strands of her long hair, surprised at how soft it always felt. She stirred against me. \u201cMorning, babe,\u201d she said against my chest.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Her head shot up from my chest, leaving it cold and empty. \u201cOh my God. Do you remember what we heard last night?\u201d She covered her mouth to stop from laughing too loudly.</p><p>I had forgotten. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bullshit! You know as well as I do they were totally having sex in our guest room!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe they were just playing Monopoly. With their mouths,\u201d I suggested with a smile.</p><p>She snorted. \u201cRemind me to ask Melissa how Dean plays Monopoly because it sounded like she was really enjoying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2018cause he\u2019s a Carter,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are good at board games?\u201d</p><p>Smartass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good at everything. Who knows what Dean\u2019s good at.\u201d I rolled on top of her, pressing my hard-on against her.</p><p>\u201cNo way! I need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get you dirty first,\u201d I whispered against her ear, taking the lobe into my mouth and sucking.</p><p>\u201cHow about you come clean me off instead?\u201d She wriggled out from under me and the sight of her naked body caused my dick to throb even more.</p><p>Shower sex isn\u2019t the same when you have a saran-wrapped cast on your good arm. But I powered through it because I\u2019m a team-fucking-player.</p><p>When I walked into the living room awhile later, my brother was already at the table eating cereal. Smiling to himself. He looked like a complete asshole.</p><p>\u201cSomeone get some last night?\u201d I gave his back a hard slap and he turned to smack my arm away, but missed.</p><p>\u201cA gentleman doesn\u2019t kiss and tell,\u201d he responded before spooning another bite of food into this mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d I said as I sat down across from him and poured cereal into my own bowl. \u201cSound really carries in this place. I never knew that before last night.\u201d</p><p>He choked on his cereal. \u201cYou don\u2019t say?\u201d</p><p>I handed him a napkin. \u201cOh, I do say. I say very loudly and very scream-like,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Cassie entered the room and sat down next to me at the table. She gave Dean a sweet smile and asked, \u201cSo, how was Monopoly? It sounds like you\u2019re a really good player.\u201d</p><p>I fucking lost it. I laughed so hard I almost spit food across the table. When Melissa finally came out of the guest bedroom, I noticed my little brother\u2019s smile grow wider. As she neared, his eyes lit up and he reached for her. His fingertips barely grazed her exposed skin before she angled her body away and picked the seat farthest from him. I only noticed all this shit because I was paying attention, not because I\u2019m a pussy or anything.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious right now?\u201d Dean asked her, his tone instantly angry.</p><p>I sat up straighter, finding myself intrigued. The idea of my brother standing up for himself impressed me.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s eyes narrowed as her cheeks reddened and she looked away. \u201cDon\u2019t do this here, Dean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what? Are you just going to pretend like nothing happened last night?\u201d</p><p>I knew it.</p><p>Of course I knew it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say that,\u201d she said in an indifferent tone.</p><p>\u201cSo, what then? We\u2019ll just go back to being \u2018friends,\u2019 or whatever the fuck we are?\u201d</p><p>Cassie cleared her throat and I gave my brother a swift kick under the table. He glared at me, his cool facade slowly unraveling. Melissa stayed quiet, avoiding any eye contact as Dean looked back and forth between her face and mine.</p><p>He shoved out of his chair, almost tossing it into the wall before grabbing his cereal bowl and throwing it a little too roughly into the sink. The sound of it breaking echoed throughout the apartment and his eyes grew wide. \u201cShit. I\u2019m sorry, Cass.\u201d</p><p>I looked down at my cereal and shook my head. Little brother couldn\u2019t even be mean when he was mad.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s only a dish,\u201d she said, walking away from the table and over toward him.</p><p>Dean lowered his chin and stared at the floor as Cassie wrapped her arms around him and squeezed. He hugged her back for a second before pushing her away and jumping to his feet. \u201cI need to get the fuck out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I shouted and Dean stopped midstep. \u201cDon\u2019t fucking push my wife like that. I will hit you, I don\u2019t care who you are.\u201d</p><p>My temper flared as he stalked into the guest room and slammed the door. Right on his heels, I knocked hard on the door, causing the knuckles on my good hand to ache immediately. \u201cDean?\u201d I shouted and turned the knob without waiting for a response.</p><p>I stuck my head inside the room and when my gaze met his, I could see in Dean\u2019s eyes that he was falling apart. \u201cI\u2019m taking you out.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You are.\u201d</p><p>My brother\u2019s response made me laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll call Matteo. He\u2019s coming too. We need a guys\u2019 day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re best friends with the guy who kissed your wife now?\u201d Dean\u2019s sour comment caused me to sharply inhale.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a dick. He still works for us, doesn\u2019t he? If I didn\u2019t trust him, he wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near Cassie. Plus, he\u2019s married and has a baby on the way. And he knows my forgiveness was a one-time deal. He tries any of that shit again and I\u2019ll fucking kill him.\u201d</p><p>Walking into the kitchen, I pulled Cassie aside and kissed her sweet lips. \u201cKitten, I\u2019m going to take Dean out. Talk to your friend. Find out what the fuck her deal is. This shit between them needs to stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo joke. I feel so bad for your brother. I\u2019ll talk to her. Or at least, I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d She smiled and I wanted to kick myself for ever being mean to her.</p><p>My cell phone beeped soon afterward, letting me know that Matteo was waiting downstairs. I shouted to Dean, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Matteo\u2019s waiting.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dean appeared and I ushered him out the door without another word. Once in the lobby, I pointed Matteo out to him.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Jack. That\u2019s the guy you hired to drive Cassie around the city? What the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m overly confident and cocky. Have we met?\u201d</p><p>We walked through the revolving door and Matteo extended his hand. \u201cHi, Dean. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you,\u201d Dean added, his tone wary.</p><p>Matteo opened the door and walked toward the driver\u2019s side and hopped in. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have,\u201d he said as he caught Dean\u2019s gaze in the rearview mirror. \u201cI\u2019ll apologize to you as well, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah. She wasn\u2019t my girlfriend.\u201d Dean looked at me. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky Cassie didn\u2019t leave you for him. Hell, I\u2019m about to leave you for him. Are you looking for a new brother? Want to adopt me?\u201d Dean blurted out.</p><p>Matteo laughed from the front seat. \u201cYou bet, kid. \u2018Cause us Italian New Yorkers don\u2019t have enough family members.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your wife? Does she have any sisters?\u201d</p> <p>I sat up straighter. \u201cHoly shit, does she? I never even thought about that. I mean, of course, I wouldn\u2019t but\u2014\u201d I stopped abruptly, realizing that didn\u2019t exactly come out right.</p><p>Matteo chuckled and shook his head. \u201cSorry. She\u2019s all mine and there\u2019s only one of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking figures,\u201d Dean muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cDo you care where we drink?\u201d Matteo asked.</p><p>\u201cSomewhere private. No sports bars or shit like that,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>\u201cDo you really think I\u2019d take you to a sports bar? I\u2019m hurt, man. Crushed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, where are we going?\u201d Dean asked as the car slowed to a stop.</p><p>I looked out the window, recognizing the entrance from a profile shoot Cassie had done on historical bars in the city.</p><p>\u201cI know this place. Cassie photographed it for the magazine.\u201d</p><p>Matteo threw his head back. \u201cThat\u2019s right! I remember that. This place used to be a speakeasy. Sinatra used to hang out here with his boys. It\u2019s pretty cool. Lots of history.\u201d</p><p>We walked into the dimly lit bar and paused for a second so our eyes could adjust. Coming inside from the bright afternoon sunshine, this place seemed almost as dark as night. Giving the bartender a nod, Matteo pointed toward the back of the room, where a velvet rope hung. The three of us headed toward the small table behind the rope. The place was virtually empty, except for the few guys sitting at the bar. I prayed they wouldn\u2019t recognize me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab us drinks,\u201d Matteo offered. \u201cWhat are we having?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeer for me. Whatever\u2019s on tap and good,\u201d I responded.</p><p>\u201cSame here,\u201d Dean added.</p> <p>I waited for Matteo to return before I started asking Dean any questions, figuring he might have some outside perspective to offer. A few minutes later he came back, balancing all three beers in his hands before setting them on the table without spilling a drop.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking boss,\u201d I said, complimenting him on his skills before tapping my glass against his.</p><p>\u201cAh, I used to tend bar in college,\u201d he said, and I laughed, almost spitting my beer at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy am I not surprised?\u201d I took a deep swig of the beer, closing my eyes for a second in appreciation of its icy goodness.</p><p>\u201cThe real question is why is that so funny?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged and said, \u201cI have no fucking idea.\u201d Then I laughed some more, convinced my body and mind were out to betray me after I\u2019d treated them so badly this past week.</p><p>Dean looked back and forth between me and Matteo. \u201cI don\u2019t get why you\u2019re laughing? What the fuck did I miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Matteo said with a raised eyebrow as I pulled myself together.</p><p>Why the fuck was I suddenly giggling like a fourteen-year-old schoolgirl? It was like once I started laughing, I couldn\u2019t fucking stop. And knowing that I needed the release only made it worse. I focused on my breathing, pretending I was on the mound during a crisis. I needed to calm down.</p><p>My breathing slowed and I looked at my baby brother. \u201cSo, what happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you done with your giggle fit?\u201d Dean asked, apparently full of piss and vinegar.</p><p>\u201cFor now. So, tell me what happened,\u201d I urged before taking a swig of my ice cold beer. I loved cold beer.</p><p>Dean sighed and rolled his beer between his palms. \u201cWe had sex last night and I thought that changed things between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, why would that change things? This wasn\u2019t the first time you two ...\u201d I paused, eyeing him.</p><p>\u201cYes. It was the first time. Melissa knows how I feel about her. She knows.\u201d He shook his head and I could see that he was hurting.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t good sex,\u201d I said with a laugh to lighten the mood.</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Dean shot back. \u201cIt was the hottest sex I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\u201d</p><p>I leaned toward him. \u201cFor you, maybe. But what about her?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cThe whole thing was hot. She practically begged for it, more than once. I think she liked it.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cThen I don\u2019t know what to tell you. That girl\u2019s always been a pain in the ass to figure out. Even Kitten\u2019s no help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Matteo sipped his beer and waited for my response. I\u2019d filled him in a little bit in the past about Dean and Melissa\u2019s history, but he didn\u2019t know much. Hell, none of us really did.</p><p>\u201cI asked her once what Melissa\u2019s problem was and she said she didn\u2019t know. That she\u2019s always hooked up with guys and shit, but she never really likes them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Who\u2019s like that?\u201d Dean spat, his temper finally showing up for the party.</p><p>I lifted my beer. \u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat,\u201d he said with a snort. \u201cSo she\u2019s a female version of you?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m just saying. It\u2019s sort of a guy\u2019s way of thinking, if you break it down. And that probably works for you since you\u2019re such a chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d he snarled at me.</p><p>Shaking my head, I grinned. \u201cI\u2019m only fucking around, little brother.\u201d</p><p>The scantily clad bartender walked over to our table and the three of us immediately shut up. She asked if she could get us anything and I ordered three shots of tequila. Once she walked away, I looked at Matteo\u2019s worried expression and shrugged. \u201cIt seemed like a good idea at the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I drink too much, we\u2019ll need a driver for the driver,\u201d he explained and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhere were we?\u201d I paused and looked at Dean. \u201cOh yeah. You\u2019re a chick and Melissa\u2019s a dude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. And I\u2019m over it. I\u2019m done. And when we get back to your place, I\u2019m telling her that.\u201d He sounded determined and angry, and it hit me that those feelings were exactly what he needed. My brother needed to take control of his dick back.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d Dean eyed me, then downed the last of his beer.</p><p>I loved Melissa because she was my wife\u2019s best friend, and because she\u2019d been there for me on more than one occasion. But she\u2019d been stringing my brother along since I\u2019ve known her. So yeah, I supported my brother\u2019s decision to tell her to shit or get off the pot.</p><p>\u201cYou deserve the best and if she\u2019s not going to be that, then fuck her. It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t given her enough chances to make a decision already. No girl\u2019s worth all this hassle. Except mine. But she\u2019d never pull this kind of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd mine,\u201d Matteo added.</p><p>\u201cTrina is a good one, bro.\u201d I raised my glass toward him before taking a drink.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I already know how fucking great both your wives are. Can we get back to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe never left,\u201d Matteo reassured him.</p><p>\u201cSo, what do you think? You don\u2019t really know either of us. What\u2019s your take?\u201d Dean lifted his chin in Matteo\u2019s direction. \u201cYou know, as an outsider?\u201d</p><p>Matteo looked between me and my brother before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know the whole story between you two, but it sounds like she\u2019s just leading you on. She knows how you feel about her, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Dean answered.</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt? You\u2019ve told her?\u201d Matteo asked.</p><p>Dean\u2019s face scrunched up. \u201cYes. More than once.\u201d</p><p>The bartender appeared and placed our shots on the table. I handed her my credit card and told her to bring us the check, wanting her to leave as soon as possible so we could get to the bottom of this shit with my brother.</p><p>\u201cOkay, so what does she say?\u201d Matteo asked, getting us back on track.</p><p>\u201cShe usually avoids it. But she\u2019ll kiss me to shut me up or say she likes me too, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>\u201cShe likes me too, but she doesn\u2019t want a boyfriend right now. Or she can\u2019t. Or some other bullshit excuse. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all lies. Fuck her. I\u2019m done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly what she needs.\u201d Matteo stared at my brother and a light bulb went off inside my head.</p><p>\u201cMatteo\u2019s right. You have to make sure she knows you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just said that I would.\u201d</p><p>I slapped my hand against his shoulder. \u201cBut you have to follow through. She needs to lose you to figure out once and for all what the fuck she wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a game to me, Jack. I\u2019m done. She just wrecked me and I won\u2019t let her do it anymore. She either wants to be with me or she doesn\u2019t. Either way, I\u2019m fucking done waiting around for her to make up her mind.\u201d I watched as he downed his shot.</p><p>\u201cReady to go back home?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>The three of us rose to our feet as Matteo pushed his tequila shot toward Dean and he downed it as well. I signed off on our tab with the bartender before we headed out of the darkness and into the bright Manhattan sunlight.</p><p>\u201cI need to park the car. Apparently my wife is upstairs with yours,\u201d Matteo said from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cDo you want me to drop you two off at the entrance and then meet you inside?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole. We\u2019ll park the car and go in together.\u201d</p><p>Dean stayed quiet the elevator ride up to the twenty-third floor and he was the first one off when it came to a stop. I\u2019d never seen him so fired up before. Matteo and I jogged to keep up with him, neither one of us wanting to miss a minute of this show. It was a shitty move, I know, but the idea of seeing my super sweet brother be a dick to someone was fucking exciting.</p><p>He walked through the door before any of us and grabbed Melissa by the arm. \u201cWe need to talk. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch. Jeez, Dean, let me go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You want to talk in private or do you want me to say what I have to say right here in front of all these people?\u201d He waved his arm in our direction and I looked at Cassie, who was currently glaring at me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I mouthed \u201cnot my fault\u201d to her and she narrowed her eyes at me.</p><p>Melissa glanced around the room at Trina, Cassie, Matteo, and me before whispering, \u201cIn private,\u201d and stalked off behind Dean\u2019s giant frame.</p><p>\u201cHey, Trina!\u201d I smiled at Matteo\u2019s wife. \u201cYou look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop hitting on my wife,\u201d Matteo joked.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go there, do you? We can if you want,\u201d I joked back.</p><p>Dean\u2019s shouting stopped our conversation as all four of us turned our heads in the direction of the guest bedroom. We were mesmerized by the sound of Dean actually yelling at someone. And knowing that the someone was Fun-Size. The whole thing seemed insane.</p><p>Despite the closed bedroom door, we could hear absolutely everything. It was awesome.</p><p>\u201cYou acted like it didn\u2019t matter. Like nothing between us ever fucking matters. Why? Why do you do that?\u201d he yelled, the frustration in his voice coming through loud and clear from a room away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she answered softly.</p> <p>\u201cBullshit! That\u2019s bullshit! You do know. Do you have any idea how much of an idiot I felt like this morning when you walked out of the room? I thought things were different after last night, but I was wrong. I\u2019m always fucking wrong when it comes to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so mad?\u201d Her voice was shaking, and knowing girls, I knew tears couldn\u2019t be far behind.</p><p>\u201cAre you joking? You make me feel like a fucking fool over and over again and I\u2019m sick of it. I\u2019m not doing it anymore. I\u2019m done with this.\u201d His voice was cold and I glanced at Cassie, who looked like she was holding her breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you\u2019re \u2018done with this\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith this. With you. I\u2019m not doing this anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, that\u2019s it? We\u2019re not even friends?\u201d she asked, her voice rising in pitch.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be your friend! How many times do I have to tell you that?\u201d he shouted, and it sounded like he punched something, but I couldn\u2019t imagine what. \u201cDamn it, Melissa. I don\u2019t want to be your fucking friend, okay? Stop acting like you don\u2019t know this already. You know how I feel. And I can\u2019t be around you with all this back-and-forth bullshit that you do to me. I\u2019ve wanted you for two years. Two years!\u201d he yelled and I almost felt bad for eavesdropping. Almost.</p><p>\u201cWell, who asked you to want me? I didn\u2019t, did I?\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened at her response and I shifted closer to Cassie and grabbed her hand. She squeezed it hard.</p><p>Dean whistled a sound before responding to her. \u201cNo, you sure didn\u2019t. Well, you don\u2019t have to worry about me anymore. You can delete my phone number from your cell since I won\u2019t answer if you call.\u201d</p><p>The guest bedroom door flew open and none of us even pretended to be doing anything else. We all stared at my little brother as he walked into the kitchen and grabbed a beer from the refrigerator.</p><p>I cleared my throat, determined to be a good host. \u201cDean, this is Trina, Matteo\u2019s wife. Trina, this is my little brother, Dean.\u201d</p><p>Dean smiled, then sauntered over to Trina and shook her hand. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, I\u2019ve heard wonderful things. Sorry about all the yelling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand,\u201d she said with a sympathetic smile.</p> <p>\u201cI love your accent. No one told me you were British,\u201d Dean said, laying on the charm.</p><p>\u201cAnd no one told me you were so cute,\u201d she flirted back and I had to bite my lip to keep myself from laughing. My brother could use the attention.</p><p>Melissa rounded the corner, and Cassie immediately dropped my hand and headed toward her. They disappeared and I heard a door close. I glanced at Matteo and Trina and apologized.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. We need to get going anyway. We have reservations in a little bit. It was nice to see you, Jack. And nice to meet you, Dean.\u201d Trina kissed my cheek and gave Dean a squeeze and told him, \u201cPersonally, I think she\u2019s crazy to not be head over heels for you. But don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll find the right girl. You\u2019re a catch. Don\u2019t ever forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Trina. It was nice meeting you. You too, Matteo,\u201d Dean said with a nod in his direction. \u201cThanks for this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what adoptive brothers do for each other,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>I shook Matteo\u2019s hand and closed the front door behind them as they left. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>My brother peered around the kitchen column to look at me. \u201cI\u2019m still pissed, but I feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re right, you know,\u201d I offered in consolation.</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything you said to her. So don\u2019t feel bad when you wake up tomorrow and want to take it all back.\u201d</p><p>He half smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Slow Recovery</p><p>I couldn\u2019t believe the drama that happened during Dean and Melissa\u2019s visit. Hell, I\u2019d only suggested they come out here together because I wanted them to finally get together. I guess that backfired. And now Dean was hurting and I didn\u2019t know what Melissa was feeling, but I somehow feel responsible for it all.</p><p>Dean refused to sleep in the guest room last night, so he stayed on the couch. I tried to get him to stay in our room with Jack and I\u2019d sleep with Melissa, but he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cJust go stay in our bed. It\u2019s no big deal, Dean. I\u2019ll go stay with Melissa,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cNo, thanks. I like couches,\u201d he said with a wink as his gaze looked past me to something over my shoulder.</p><p>I turned around and noticed Jack standing behind me. \u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cMe? Nothing? Just staring at your ass,\u201d Jack said and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d I smacked my palm against his chest.</p><p>\u201cI just told Dean that if he said yes to sleeping in a bed with me that I\u2019d smother him with a pillow and throw his dead body off our balcony. I\u2019m not fucking sleeping with my brother, Kitten, when I can sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>I tapped my foot against the tile flooring. \u201cYou said all that from behind me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with words. But the message was conveyed.\u201d He ran his finger across his neck like a sinister throat-slasher.</p><p>\u201cDean, I just want you to be comfortable on your last night here. Please let me know if I can do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Sis. Really. Stop worrying.\u201d</p><p>It was only after his insistence that I finally left him alone and went to bed with Jack. Melissa had fallen asleep pretty soon after our post-fight chat, and both times that I checked on her, she hadn\u2019t moved.</p><p>She confessed to being rattled by Dean\u2019s explosion of emotions and she cried on my shoulder. A lot. But she wouldn\u2019t really admit to anything. I kept asking if she liked Dean and she would nod her head, but she wouldn\u2019t say much else. Honestly, I was still just as confused now as I was six months ago. Something was preventing Melissa from letting go and loving Dean, but I had no clue what it was. And she wouldn\u2019t tell me.</p><p>The next morning we all got ready in silence. I insisted that Jack come to the airport with me because I didn\u2019t want to deal with the two of them by myself. I had no idea how things would go and I needed all the support I could get. Plus, Jack would be able to tell them to go fuck themselves when all I\u2019d want to do is superglue their body parts together.</p><p>Forever.</p><p>Dean avoided Melissa entirely. He refused to look in her direction, sit near her, or even acknowledge her existence. One look at her and I could tell it was eating her up inside. She looked like she was breaking. When we got to the airport, the four of us walked together toward the check-in counter. Jack stopped for a couple of pictures, reminding his fans that he couldn\u2019t sign anything with his broken hand, as the three of us took care of getting them checked in.</p><p>\u201cDean,\u201d Melissa whispered in his direction, but I heard.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he responded without turning or moving toward her.</p><p>\u201cCan we talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d He turned his head and met her gaze straight on, and my heart cracked in that instant for them both. I hated what they were going through and longed to take their pain away.</p><p>\u201cYou seriously won\u2019t talk to me right now?\u201d Melissa asked, her voice small.</p><p>\u201cNo, I seriously won\u2019t talk to you right now.\u201d</p><p>The lady at the ticket counter shouted, \u201cNext,\u201d and Dean walked up alone. I squeezed my tiny best friend and pulled her head against me. \u201cThanks for coming out. I really do miss you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too. I hate that you\u2019re so far away,\u201d she complained.</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too. You need to fix this thing with Dean,\u201d I suggested and she sighed.</p><p>After getting her bags checked, we met the Carter boys in front of the security line. I hugged Dean tightly. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m going to miss you. Thank you so much for coming out. Come out more, okay? We miss you.\u201d</p><p>He gave me a big smile. \u201cI will. I\u2019ll miss you guys too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell Gran and Gramps hi for me please!\u201d I added before I forgot. I missed them all the time. I\u2019d never had a couple who were as wise about life as the two of them. They knew what truly mattered in life and they never hesitated to make it known. I had so much to thank them for.</p><p>Jack squeezed his younger brother and patted his back so hard it sounded like he broke him. Dean turned toward Melissa and said, \u201cEnjoy your flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? Aren\u2019t we on the same one?\u201d She looked at me, uncertainty written all over face.</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped completely open and mine followed. \u201cSeriously?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>\u201cWhat flight are you on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yours, so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Dean entered the security line and I stood there completely stunned.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit,\u201d I said to no one in particular.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s eyes teared up, but she sniffed them back as I gave her one last hug. \u201cI\u2019ll call you later.\u201d She sucked in a breath and entered the line by herself, now separated from Dean by numerous people.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d I asked, the shock still overwhelming my senses.</p><p>She forced a smile. \u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>I reached for my husband\u2019s hand and squeezed it hard. Jack told Melissa good-bye again and pulled me toward the exit doors. \u201cI cannot believe he did that,\u201d I said, stealing a look into Jack\u2019s chocolate-brown eyes.</p><p>Jack shot a sideways glance my way. \u201cHate to admit it, but that was pretty badass.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten, but she deserves it.\u201d</p><p>Oh, how I wanted to disagree. I wanted to defend my best friend and tell my husband that he was wrong and being an asshole. Go off on him for being so cruel and callous, and tell him only a complete jerk would say something like that at a time like this. But he was right. And I knew it. So even though I wanted to stand up for her, like she\u2019d done so many times in the past for me, I couldn\u2019t. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I tightened my grip on Jack\u2019s hand and allowed him to pull me outside where Matteo was waiting by the car. The heat and humidity smacked me square in the face and I sucked in one final breath before letting all the stress of the weekend go.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, I still couldn\u2019t believe what had happened between Melissa and Dean. Watching him lose his shit on her was the most I\u2019d ever seen him act like Jack. And it was hot. I\u2019d never admit that to Jack, but it really was. I was surprised Melissa\u2019s panties didn\u2019t melt off her body and into a puddle on my apartment floor. Instead, she dug in her heels and acted stubborn and defensive, which was her version of a defense mechanism, I supposed.</p><p>Truth be told, I was really sad for them. I wanted them to work it out and I had no idea why Melissa was fighting it so hard. What kind of person doesn\u2019t know what the hell was wrong with her best friend?</p><p>All I knew for sure was that I did not want to be in the middle of the two of them, so I bowed out; told them both I didn\u2019t want to be involved. True to their word, neither of them asked me about the other when we talked, which wasn\u2019t as often as it used to be. We\u2019d all come so far from our college days in the student union.</p> <p>Dean kept busy maintaining the office while Jack\u2019s agents, Marc and Ryan, traveled around the country scouting new baseball talent. It was Dean\u2019s job to be the local contact for potential talent. He took phone calls, handled the mail and the contracts, and filed scouting reports. He also kept tabs on new, upcoming, and past players, and was available in person at any time. Dean told me once that the only thing he didn\u2019t do was sleep there, but that could be arranged if they bought a couch. I laughed, but felt pride warm my heart at how hard he worked and loved the business.</p><p>Melissa, on the other hand, had convinced her mom to let her open a small extension of their public relations firm in Orange County. She informed her mother that over half their clients lived in the OC, and it didn\u2019t make any sense to force them to drive out to LA for in-person meetings. Their current clients were thrilled and word of mouth spread quickly about the new office location. Melissa found herself understaffed and her mom couldn\u2019t have been more proud of her only daughter. I always knew Melissa would run that place, so nothing she did surprised me.</p><p>Things with Jack and me had improved tremendously since he first got injured. He refocused all of his energy into working out and doing strength exercises in his opposite hand. When the team was on the road, he spent most of his time at the ball field with the team trainers. And when the team was home, he played pranks on all the guys during the games. They actually begged me to start keeping him home so he\u2019d stop fucking with them.</p><p>I asked Jack over dinner one night what he was doing to torture his teammates and he couldn\u2019t stop laughing. He said, \u201cI kept moving the new kid\u2019s gear in front of Newman\u2019s locker.\u201d I remembered that Newman was a veteran ball player, and if there was one thing that any first-year player had to do, it was respect the veterans. They weren\u2019t supposed to talk to them, let alone go anywhere near their stuff.</p><p>Jack leaned back and chuckled. \u201cNewman was pissed and the poor kid had no idea how his shit kept getting there, but he couldn\u2019t say anything. Because, you know, he can\u2019t talk to a veteran player, and he certainly can\u2019t defend himself. Newman would take out all the crap in his bag, throw it across the locker room, and threaten the kid. I just kept doing it the whole weekend. Poor kid was about to lose his mind until someone told him, \u2018Welcome to the big leagues.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid they tell him it was you?\u201d I smiled, happy to hear Jack laughing.</p><p>\u201cFuck no! No one tells him who is fucking with him. It\u2019s a rule. You play pranks, but you don\u2019t rat anyone out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re having fun with your teammates, babe.\u201d I smiled, reaching my hand across the table and touching the stubble on his cheek. I loved his scruff.</p><p>I will admit that having Jack home for dinner was really sort of nice. He\u2019d never been around this much, and while his mind was definitely preoccupied with his injury, his physical presence was a welcome change. It made me realize how little he truly was home. And how rare it was for us to sit and have dinner together every night. That almost never happened.</p><p>Even during the off-season, Jack was always focused on what was to come. His mental state was all about working out, staying fit, eating right, and doing whatever had to be done to stay relevant and needed for the upcoming season. I honestly didn\u2019t mind the amount of his time that baseball took, but some moments, like the ones right now, it was nice to have him around.</p><p>Staring over at my sexy man, I stifled the urge to crawl across the table and eat him for dinner. I knew he wouldn\u2019t mind, but didn\u2019t want to stop the current conversation that flowed between us. Watching Jack smile and laugh had been the highlight of my day.</p> <p>\u201cSo, tell me about the rookie they brought up to pitch for you,\u201d I said and his eyebrows lifted.</p><p>\u201cDid I tell you he won\u2019t be staying?\u201d He smirked and a dimple appeared. I wanted to get lost in that dimple.</p><p>I reached for my wineglass and took a sip. \u201cWhere\u2019s he going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s temporary,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWho told you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me. Just walked up to me one night during a game and said, \u2018They told me not to get too comfortable here, you know.\u2019 Which, of course, I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Jack fumbled with his fork. \u201cFuck. I\u2019ll never get used to trying to eat with my right hand.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSo, what did you say to him after that? Anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck no, I didn\u2019t say anything. I just looked at him. I don\u2019t owe that kid anything. He\u2019d take my position in a heartbeat if they let him. And I know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, he\u2019ll get sent back down to Triple-A when you\u2019re off the disabled list?\u201d I asked before filling my mouth with a large helping of Caesar salad.</p><p>\u201cI assume so. He\u2019s good, though. And I hate how much I hate that he\u2019s good. Makes me feel like a dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a dick. You worked your ass off to earn that position and you don\u2019t want it taken away from you.\u201d I understood that feeling. I knew how much baseball meant to Jack and how much he\u2019d been through personally and professionally to achieve his goals. No one wanted to have one stupid incident be the catalyst for your entire career changing. Or for its loss.</p><p>\u201cExactly. But I want the team to win. And he helps them win. But then I\u2019m pissed that he helped them win because sometimes I don\u2019t want him to be that good.\u201d He dragged his good hand through his hair, his mood suddenly shifting.</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense,\u201d I said encouragingly, trying to reassure him as his eyes lifted to meet mine. It was the team\u2019s job to win games at all costs. Jack was terrified he\u2019d lose his position to a younger kid who threw faster than him. Every player\u2019s fear when they were injured was that they\u2019d be replaced. Baseball made it known that there was a long line of younger guys waiting to take your spot the moment you screwed up. That was a lot of pressure.</p><p>My voice rose in pitch as my thoughts spilled from my mouth, my adrenaline kicking in. \u201cYou love your team. You don\u2019t ever want them to lose. But you don\u2019t want this kid to be better than you are because you want to be missed. You want to be needed. You want the goddamn Mets to be affected by your absence!\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes flew open wide and a huge smile lit up his face. \u201cThat\u2019s it! That\u2019s exactly fucking it. God, I love you.\u201d</p><p>The sound of his chair screeching across the tile floor hit my ears as quickly as Jack\u2019s hot mouth did. \u201cYou. Naked. Now.\u201d</p><p>My heart raced and the space between my legs ached with want. It never ceased to amaze me how easily Jack could turn me into a hot puddle of desire. One second we were laughing, and the next all I could think about was having him inside me.</p><p>I turned my head toward him as his mouth crushed against mine. He kissed me hard once, twice, then when I parted my lips, his tongue took advantage and searched for mine. The moment our tongues touched, my body ached and throbbed in unison.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hot,\u201d I managed to get out as he lifted me into his arms and carried me to the bedroom. I started to protest, concerned about his broken hand, but he silenced me with his mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d he demanded and I obeyed. I\u2019d do anything he asked right now, I was so turned on. \u201cGod, Cassie, I want you. You\u2019re so smart.\u201d</p><p>He kissed my neck and the feel of his lips made me dizzy. \u201cAnd beautiful.\u201d He licked his way down my neck to my shoulder, where he bit gently and nibbled. I breathed out a heady moan and felt him twitch against me.</p><p>\u201cAnd talented,\u201d he continued as he reached for the bottom of my top, lifting it up over my head and tossing it to the floor. He instantly moved his mouth to my bare stomach, where he kissed and licked around my belly button, the skin so sensitive there that I shivered.</p><p>\u201cAnd made for me.\u201d His head lifted as his brown eyes met mine. \u201cYou know that, right?\u201d His eyes narrowed as his right hand moved to unclasp my bra. \u201cThat you were literally fucking made for me? This body,\u201d he said, discarding my lacy bra onto the floor with my top, \u201cthis body was made for me. And only me. Tell me you know that.\u201d</p><p>Jack reached his hand toward my cheek and I closed my eyes, letting the heaviness of his words settle inside me. The space between us filled with so much love, lust, desire, and want, I felt like I could literally cut a piece out of the air and consume it. This moment could fill me ... complete me ... satisfy me. I could live forever from the emotions I felt in this one moment.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Cassie. Tell me you know this body was made to fit with mine. And only mine. No rookie can take my place. No one else can have this position. You\u2019re my fucking wife and no one else\u2019s. Ever. I worship you. I will always worship you.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know why, but his words filled me with so much emotion, I almost started crying. Maybe it was the way he said them, or what was being said, but my chest heaved with each laboring breath I took. Overwhelmed, I looked at my husband. My sexy as hell, overly confident, amazingly beautiful husband. Looking at him now, like this, I felt reassured at just how lucky we were to have each other. I\u2019d never want anyone else as long as I lived. It was Jack Fucking Carter for me, or no one.</p><p>\u201cSay it, Kitten. Tell me you\u2019re mine,\u201d he demanded, his voice almost purring.</p><p>I sucked in a deep breath and watched as my exposed breasts rose and fell. Tangling my fingers in his dark hair, I tugged slightly, forcing his eyes to stay locked on mine. \u201cI\u2019m yours. There will never come a time when I don\u2019t belong to you. It\u2019s you for me, or no one. You hear me? Only you. Only yours. Forever.\u201d</p><p>Our feelings spilled out, replacing the oxygen in the room with something else entirely. Jack\u2019s words were like my own personal aphrodisiac, each one burning hotter between my legs than the last. I was a puddle of want, so completely turned on by everything he\u2019d just confessed, I was surprised I didn\u2019t spontaneously combust and melt into the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cForever,\u201d he concurred before he moved his mouth to my chest. His tongue was frenzied as he flicked my pebbled nipple, before sucking it into his mouth and holding it between his teeth. I whimpered and he shivered. He sucked and licked before moving to the next one, giving it the same treatment.</p><p>I writhed underneath him, raising my hips to meet his, telling him with no words that I was ready to have him inside me.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said to my silent plea. He moved his good hand toward my jeans, but fumbled with the button. \u201cYou gotta get these off, Kitten. I\u2019m fucking useless with this hand.\u201d</p><p>I unbuttoned my jeans and lowered the zipper. Shimmying out of them, I watched as Jack did the same with his before discarding them on the floor. He paused for only a moment, but it was long enough for me to see him in all his naked glory. I wanted to freeze-frame this second and burn it into my memory. Naked Jack Carter was truly a sight to behold. From his chiseled shoulders and chest all the way down to the manhood that jutted from between his muscular thighs. This man\u2019s athletic body did a number on me.</p> <p>I pursed my lips together and reached for his length, but he shook his head. His eyes met mine before he lowered his head between my legs. My lips parted as he kissed my inner thigh, slowly, methodically. He teased me until I felt like I didn\u2019t know how to breathe on my own. Every breath felt wrong, filled with too much effort. Who the hell has to think about breathing? Apparently I do when my husband is positioned between my thighs.</p><p>His tongue left a trail of wetness up my thigh and close to my sex before moving to the opposite leg. I wriggled and grabbed his head, trying to force him to focus his attention where I desperately wanted him to. He laughed. \u201cAlmost, Kitten,\u201d he said, his words hot against my skin.</p><p>Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t take any more and I considered actually killing him with my legs, his tongue found my sweet spot. My chest heaved as I released the air building within me. He licked me in soft strokes before becoming more focused, more feverish. The flicks of his tongue caused my frenzy to build as he moved from one area to another. One moment his tongue lapped at me, and the next it was diving inside of me, moving in and out in rapid succession.</p><p>I squeezed my eyes so hard I saw stars. Or maybe it was his mouth that made me see them. Who knew? All I knew for sure was that it was fucking magical. My husband was a magician with a wand for a tongue and I didn\u2019t care who knew.</p><p>\u201cJack. Oh God, Jack. Don\u2019t stop. Don\u2019t ever stop,\u201d I shouted. \u201cYou\u2019re like Harry Potter, oh God!\u201d</p> <p>Instantly, he stopped. Midlick, he lifted his face from between my legs to stare at me, and I swear I felt my vagina curl up and die a little.</p><p>\u201cDid you just call me Harry Potter?\u201d Jack\u2019s face twisted with humor and confusion.</p><p>\u201cI just meant that you were magical. Your tongue is fucking magic. Get down there and perform a spell. Shut up, Jack. Just get back down there.\u201d I pushed his head as he laughed.</p><p>\u201cHe might be magic, but he\u2019s not real. I\u2019m real. This is real.\u201d His tongue resumed its magical licking as he pushed two fingers inside me. My climax continued to build with each flick of his tongue and every thrust of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cJust like that, Jack. Oh yes,\u201d I yelled as my hips twisted and jerked, my orgasm tearing through my body with force.</p><p>He pulled his head away from me slowly, a dimpled smile on his face. \u201cAre you going to start calling me Harry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if you want me to,\u201d I panted as he positioned himself on top of me and pushed inside. The size of him filled me up and I moved my hips in time with his.</p><p>\u201cFuck, Cassie. Always. You always feel so good.\u201d He pushed himself hard against me, reaching deeper with each thrust.</p><p>\u201cDeeper, Jack. Go deeper,\u201d I begged as he grabbed my shoulders and rolled underneath me, never pulling out. I pushed my body on top of his, taking him in as deep as I could. Moving up and down, I leaned toward him, kissing his chest and licking around his nipple.</p><p>My hips continued to move, pumping him in and out of me as his erection grew with each stroke against its length.</p><p>\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d he asked, referring to his growing size. His voice was tight, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough air. \u201cI\u2019m gonna come, Kitten. I\u2019m almost there.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as my own climax built within me. As I worked myself up and down along him in a hurried pace, he stiffened, reaching a place in me only he ever had, and I began to shudder. Jack\u2019s eyes closed as he exploded inside me, filling me up. I reveled in the thrill of his orgasm as another one of my own ripped through me. My body pulsed as my heartbeat throbbed in my ears. I collapsed onto Jack\u2019s chest and lay there panting as he ran his fingers through my hair, his breathing fast and his body slick with sweat.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d was all he said as he kissed my forehead. \u201cForever.\u201d</p><p>Traded</p> <p>Three weeks later ...</p><p>Today marked six weeks since I\u2019d broken my fingers. Cassie wanted to come with me to meet with the team doctor for moral support, but I told her I needed to do this alone. It had nothing to do with me wanting her there or not, but more to do with the fact that she couldn\u2019t do anything about the diagnosis.</p><p>If my fingers were healed, then that was great. But if they were still fucked up, she couldn\u2019t make them better, and I needed time to process that. This was the kind of thing a man went into alone and then thanked God, or whoever, that he wasn\u2019t alone when he came out. Cassie was great about it, completely understanding. But then again, my girl always had been.</p><p>She wished me good luck as she walked out the door for work, and I promised to call her as soon as I knew anything.</p><p>Nerves twisted inside my gut as the possibility of my career being over hung above my head like some sort of metaphorical rain cloud. I could barely eat or think of anything else as I hopped up on the exam table.</p><p>\u201cHow you feeling?\u201d the doctor asked, all nonchalant, and I wanted to strangle him for attempting small talk with me at a time like this.</p><p>Unwilling to respond, I gave him a curt smile and a head nod instead. It was immature and unprofessional, but if he didn\u2019t get this cast off my arm and give me a prognosis, I was going to throw up all over his stupid shiny shoes.</p><p>He grabbed a weirdly shaped contraption and started to cut through my cast. Peeling away at the layers, he gently removed it. Waving off the rank smell that accompanied it, I grumbled an apology.</p><p>\u201cComes with the territory, Jack. No one can go six weeks without washing an area of their body and have it smell like roses,\u201d he explained.</p><p>He clearly didn\u2019t know my wife. I\u2019d bet she could. She could do anything.</p><p>I looked at my arm, which was wrinkled and pale from being holed up for the last six weeks. I had to stop myself from hitting it to get the natural coloring to return. Holding my arms up side by side, my normally strong arm looked diseased and wasted.</p><p>\u201cHow long until it looks like my hand again?\u201d I asked the doctor.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all normal too. Now, let me see how your fingers look.\u201d He reached for my hand and asked me to straighten it. They were sore and underused.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, now make a fist.\u201d</p><p>I did as he asked, fisting my fingers into the palm of my hand. Every movement felt foreign. And weak.</p><p>I was not used to being weak.</p><p>\u201cIt all looks good. The bones healed nice and straight. With about a week or so of rehab, Jack, you should be back on the mound, depending.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on what?\u201d I asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cNo, no.\u201d He waved a hand in apology. \u201cI just meant depending on how you feel, strength-wise. Everyone heals differently,\u201d he said and I exhaled.</p><p>\u201cCan I throw today?\u201d I asked, determined to heal as soon as possible and get back on the mound where I belonged.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. Just take it easy.\u201d</p><p>I fired off a quick text to my girl.</p><p>Hand looks good. Everything healed well. Off to see how it feels.</p><p>My phone beeped out a response before I could put it down.</p><p>So relieved. And so thankful. Good luck, babe. I love you.</p><p>I walked into our private indoor batting cage and grabbed a ball. Palming it, I slowly wrapping my fingers around the seams in a curve-ball grip. I couldn\u2019t hold it as tightly as before, but I wasn\u2019t worried. One hundred percent healing would come with time. With my heart in my throat, I pulled my arm back and released the ball, not trying to pitch it, simply warming up.</p><p>It didn\u2019t feel the same. My grip was weak and my fingers lacked the sheer strength they had a mere six weeks ago.</p><p>After winding my way back into the doc\u2019s office, I asked him, \u201cShould I do strength exercises first? Get my finger and hand strength back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said as he tossed me a sponge-like ball. \u201cSqueeze this.\u201d I did as he asked and he smiled. \u201cGood. Now do that multiple times a day, but don\u2019t overdo it. No more than ten reps and no more than five times each day. I know it doesn\u2019t seem like much, but trust me. Also, make sure you flex your fingers and press them against something flat, like your table at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, Doc. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>For the next week, I did as the doctor ordered, and each time I threw the ball at the field, I felt more and more like my old self. My hand felt good and when Coach clocked me, I threw between ninety and ninety-one consistently. Not as fast as before, but still fast. He removed me from the disabled list and told me I\u2019d be closing out the next home series.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wait to throw again. Or get in my full uniform. While I was hurt, I only had to wear my sliding pants and a pullover. I wanted to be dressed in full gear again.</p><p>Sunday afternoon, the stands of Shea stadium were packed, an almost sold-out crowd, I was told. There was something about an afternoon game in the summer. Everyone wanted to be there, watching our nation\u2019s favorite pastime.</p><p>When I took the mound, the cheers were deafening. I\u2019d been missed. Thank God I\u2019d been missed; I missed them too. The fans, the cheers, the stadium, the smell of the food cooking and the freshly mowed grass around me.</p><p>Stepping onto the mound, I scooted the dirt away from around the front edge with my toe, making a small divot. I kicked my cleat hard against the white rubber before turning to stand on it. It was crazy, but I\u2019d missed the way my feet felt on the springy step.</p><p>The knowledge that I\u2019d lost velocity on my pitches did little to soothe the anxiety that swirled inside me. I wanted to throw harder, pitch faster, get right back to where I was, but my hand wouldn\u2019t cooperate. My fingers weren\u2019t capable of gripping the ball as tightly as they once did. And when the baseball left my fingertips, the same force I once had, had lessened. I knew it because I felt it. From my arm all the way to my toes, my body reacted to the way my pitches had changed.</p><p>After sucking in a deep breath, I aimed at the catcher waiting for my warm-up pitch, and threw. The ball flew right down the center, a perfect fast-ball right down the pipe. My hand felt good and I wanted to keep it that way, so I stretched my fingers and threw ten more pitches before the first batter stepped up to the plate.</p><p>Aiming for the glove and agreeing to the catcher\u2019s call for a first pitch fast-ball on the outside corner, I pulled my arm back and threw. The batter swung and missed. I glanced at the scoreboard behind me to check my speed as I walked back to the mound. The numbers nine-zero showed on the screen under the strike one count. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Shit.</p><p>I could only imagine what the announcers were saying about me right now. A first-pitch fast-ball at only ninety miles an hour? Send this kid back to the minor leagues. Doing something I rarely fucking do, I stole a look toward where the players\u2019 wives sit and locked eyes with mine. Then I tipped my hat twice, my sign for my girl, and I could see the outline of her smile spread across her face.</p><p>Looking at her gave me the extra strength I needed to get through this. Then I remembered the necklace, and gave it a squeeze through my jersey. Taking a deep breath, I squinted toward the catcher. He flashed two fingers before tapping the inside of his thigh. I prayed my curve ball was still dirty as I fumbled with the seams of the ball to find my fingering. I lifted my knee into the air and hurled the ball toward the waiting batter, who swung and hit it right past me. My body arced out of the way of the incoming ball, the memory of being hit in the hand still fresh in my mind.</p><p>I kicked the dirt, and cursed in my head. Six weeks ago, that guy couldn\u2019t have hit my curve ball with a fucking Chevy. Now he hit it like I served it up on a platter for him. His timing was fucking perfect and mine was off.</p> <p>The rest of the five innings I pitched were more of the same. I struck out four guys, and got most of the rest to ground out. But I was frustrated. I battled with myself, happy that I hit all my spots and threw a decent game, but angry that I couldn\u2019t throw faster. I tried and pushed myself as hard as I could, but I never threw over ninety-one.</p><p>When Coach pulled me, he patted me on the back and told me not to worry about it. But I worried. In this sport, you always worry. Nothing was set in stone; you could always be replaced.</p><p>After the game, I walked through the familiar doors and into the hallway where Cassie waited for me. My girl calmed me. Her presence made everything okay. I could win any battle with her by my side. I\u2019d go to fucking war if I knew I got to come home to her.</p><p>She leaned up on her toes and planted a wet kiss on my lips. \u201cYou did great. How do you feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kitten. I feel okay. I know I can do better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your first game back. You\u2019ll get stronger every outing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery outing? Aw, you sound like a ball player already,\u201d I teased, throwing my arm around her back.</p><p>\u201cBut really, I mean it. No one expects you to be perfect right off the bat.\u201d</p><p>I knew she only tried to help, but I questioned her words. My coach, the team\u2019s manager, they did all expect that. Whether they said it to my face or not, they expected it, and they talked about it behind closed doors.</p><p>\u201cFeed me, woman. I\u2019m starving,\u201d I said to change the subject, and kissed the side of her head as we headed out of Shea.</p><p>The next month was more of the same as far as ball was concerned. I pitched every few games on rotation, but couldn\u2019t gain any speed or velocity in my pitches. Everyone kept talking about all the time I needed to get my full strength back, but I could see the disappointment in their eyes. And even though my teammates never admitted it to my face, they were all happy this wasn\u2019t happening to them. I couldn\u2019t blame them, though. If the situation were reversed, I\u2019d be feeling the same way. Thankful it wasn\u2019t me.</p> <p>From the outside, people probably thought of baseball as a simple sport. The general public thought that any athlete who made a living playing a sport should never have any cause for complaints. How lucky would we all be if we got paid a ton of money to play a game every day?</p><p>But life was rarely as simple as people imagined it was. Baseball was so much more than that. It was a business. And it was ugly sometimes. One of the most frustrating things to a player was when the business side of baseball came into play and messed with your desire to simply play the game.</p><p>All of us ball players just wanted to play the game. None of us wanted to be involved in the business side of it, that was why we had agents and managers. We were desperate for them to handle all of that so we could simply concentrate on playing our game.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t how baseball worked. You played on their terms. You were a fucking pinball that could be hit, bumped around, knocked into a holding pen, good for some extra points, or go down the gutter when the flippers couldn\u2019t reach you. But you were still just a tiny ball on their playing field.</p><p>\u201cJimmy wants to see you,\u201d Coach told me after I\u2019d showered. Nerves shot through me; it wasn\u2019t good if our team manager wanted to talk to me. I knew my game wasn\u2019t the same as it used to be, but I\u2019d just gotten back. I wasn\u2019t a hundred percent yet and they knew that. I needed more time.</p><p>\u201cClose the door, Jack,\u201d Jimmy\u2019s gruff voice demanded.</p><p>My stomach in knots, I closed the door and stood in front of it.</p><p>He waved me forward. \u201cCome sit.\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019d rather stand. If you\u2019re going to give me bad news, I\u2019d rather not be sitting.\u201d I reached for my pitching hand and stretched my fingers back.</p><p>Jimmy nodded and looked me straight in the eye, his voice all business, no emotion. \u201cFine. Jack, look, we\u2019re going to be trading you. Two teams are asking for you and I wanted to ask your preference.\u201d He sat back and watched me, obviously waiting for a response.</p><p>Did he just say they were trading me?</p><p>My first instinct was to fight, but this wasn\u2019t the kind of thing you fight. It didn\u2019t work like that. Being traded wasn\u2019t a negotiation with your agent or your family or anyone. It was purely a team-to-team deal and you were usually left out of it. There was no contract to write up, since whatever team got you, also got your current contract. Usually players had no say in the matter. It was the rare case that they asked your opinion at all.</p><p>Like this one.</p><p>I wanted to fight, but I was too shocked to respond at first. The word \u201ctraded\u201d kept banging around inside my head.</p><p>\u201cBut I love New York. And this team,\u201d I said, sounding so much like a child I immediately wanted to kick myself as soon as the words were out.</p><p>\u201cWe know you do, kid. But your pitches have lost something and it\u2019s in the team\u2019s best interest to make a trade.\u201d</p><p>The team\u2019s best interest.</p><p>Baseball is a business.</p><p>Baseball is a business.</p><p>Baseball is a business.</p><p>No matter how many times I reminded myself of that fact, it didn\u2019t lessen the sting.</p><p>Pressure built up in my chest as I looked away, struggling with what to say. Finally, I pulled myself together and stared steadily back at him. \u201cI\u2019m not healed a hundred percent yet. I just need more time. I\u2019ll get back to where I was, you know I will.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s already a done deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do I get to choose where I go?\u201d I felt a little dizzy as the room spun, or maybe it was my head, still reeling from the news.</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s an even trade. Both teams are offering the same things, so I figured I\u2019d do you the courtesy of asking if you had a preference where you went.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said with a nod.</p><p>\u201cBoth Toronto and Anaheim are asking for you. You let me know which team you\u2019d prefer, and I\u2019ll do my best to make it happen for you.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a breath. It was a no-brainer. \u201cAnaheim. Definitely Anaheim.\u201d If I had to get traded and move, the least I could do was take Cassie back home.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Cassie was going to kill me.</p><p>My mind whirled with all the ramifications of this move. Cassie had a job she loved. We\u2019d made a home here in New York. We were Matteo\u2019s only clients. We had friends, and responsibilities, and suddenly I felt like the weight of the world rested on my shoulders.</p><p>Jimmy cleared his throat. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ll let them know.\u201d He gave me a nod of dismissal and waved me toward the door.</p><p>I moved to leave but paused for a second, then turned around and asked, \u201cWhen will it go through?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe deadline\u2019s in a few days, so not before then.\u201d</p><p>A few days?</p><p>\u201cWill I throw any more for the team?\u201d I asked. It was probably a weird question, but I liked knowing when something this momentous was going to be my last time. I wanted to be able to say good-bye, knowing I was kicking the mound for the last time, putting on the uniform for the last time, walking onto the field for the last time. I\u2019m a baseball player; we\u2019re fucking mental, okay?</p><p>\u201cProbably not. You\u2019re a good pitcher, Jack.\u201d</p><p>A few months ago I was a great pitcher.</p><p>\u201cYou still have some years left in you, so don\u2019t let this get you down. This is all part of the game.\u201d</p><p>I saw red for a second as emotions welled up within me at the injustice of it all. Fucking easy for you to say.</p><p>Lucky for me I didn\u2019t voice that thought out loud, but settled for muttering, \u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Jimmy slammed his pen down on the desk and eyed me, his face slowly turning red.</p><p>\u201cThis,\u201d I said tersely, then paused. \u201cThis isn\u2019t part of the game at all. It might be part of the business, but it\u2019s not part of the game.\u201d Then I opened the door and walked out.</p><p>Still had a few years left in me? I\u2019d show them. My hand wasn\u2019t fully healed yet, and I could still come back just as strong as I was before. The Mets organization might have just quit on me, but I refused to. I\u2019d play my best years for the Anaheim Angels. At least I would still be playing.</p><p>Matteo drove me home in silence. It had been like that since I\u2019d gotten hurt. He let me take the lead when it came to my wanting to talk or not, and most days lately, I\u2019d been silent. I felt like a shitty person because we were friends; I just didn\u2019t always act like one lately.</p><p>\u201cSee you later. Thanks for the ride,\u201d I said as I hopped out of the car before he could, and headed into my building.</p><p>Upstairs, I walked through our front door, desperate for my girl. \u201cCassie?\u201d I yelled into the silence and waited. No response. She didn\u2019t go to the game this afternoon because she had to work and I wasn\u2019t pitching.</p><p>Glancing at my cell phone, I realized she was probably still at her office. I couldn\u2019t wait; I\u2019d go fucking insane if I didn\u2019t talk to her. She needed to know what was happening and I needed to tell her sooner rather than later.</p><p>There was no later. We\u2019d have to leave New York in just a few short days.</p><p>I dialed her phone and paced the floor as I waited for her to pick up.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d she said, her voice a soothing balm on my shattered nerves.</p><p>\u201cKitten, what time will you be home tonight?\u201d I tried to hide the urgency in my tone, but failed.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she asked sharply, immediately on high alert. \u201cAre you okay? I can leave right now if you need me to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I need you to,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cIs everything okay? Are you okay?\u201d she asked, the worry in her tone heartbreaking.</p><p>I tugged at my hair as I paced. \u201cI\u2019m fine, I promise. I just need you to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>I paced a fucking hole in the floor the fifteen minutes it took Cassie to walk through our door. The second she did, I practically sprinted to her and pulled her into my arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Jack, you\u2019re scaring me,\u201d she confessed, her face draining of color.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting traded,\u201d I blurted out.</p><p>Any of the remaining pink in her cheeks instantly vanished. \u201cW-where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey asked me if I had a preference and I said yes, but I won\u2019t know until the trade goes through.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere?\u201d she asked again, her tone more demanding this time.</p><p>\u201cEither Anaheim or Toronto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Okay.\u201d Her eyes lost focus for a second, then the rapid-fire questions began. \u201cSo then what? We have to move, right? And get rid of this place. Do you help me move? Of course you don\u2019t. How does this work?\u201d She paused, the wheels in her head clicking and turning clear as day, then realization set in. \u201cI have to quit my job. Oh my God. I love my job.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to fix it. Fix every single thing for her. Tell her she never had to quit anything for me. Or move for me. Or change her life in any possible way for me, but I\u2019d die without her. I needed this girl the way plants needed oxygen. So I could tell her all of those things, but I\u2019d be lying through my teeth. And she\u2019d know it.</p><p>Cassie looked at me, her green eyes bright with tears. \u201cHow does this work? Tell me what this means.\u201d</p> <p>The look on her face broke my heart. I pulled her toward the couch and onto my lap, then wrapped my arms around her. I\u2019d tell her anything she wanted to hear, but first I needed to feel her close to me. I needed to be touching her while I did it.</p><p>I pressed my head against her rib cage. \u201cI have to leave the night the trade goes through. Whenever that is and wherever we are. The game will end and they\u2019ll hand me a plane ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re on the road?\u201d she asked, playing with the strands of my hair.</p><p>\u201cThen I leave from there. I don\u2019t get to come home and see you or pack or anything like that. If we\u2019re on a road trip, I leave straight from the road to meet up with the other team, wherever they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s harsh,\u201d she said and I laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt is kinda harsh.\u201d</p> <p>She sucked in a deep breath. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t get any time off, right? I mean, you guys only get forty-eight hours when your wives have babies, so you wouldn\u2019t get time off for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t get any time off. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to do all this alone. You can talk to your boss, and make a plan. You don\u2019t have to come with me right away. If we wait until the off-season, I can help you pack and we can move together.\u201d</p><p>Cassie thought for a moment, then said, \u201cJack, look at me,\u201d her voice soft and comforting as I glanced up. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stay here without you. You get traded, I get traded. We\u2019re a team, remember?\u201d</p><p>Hugging her tight, I spoke against her hair. \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to feel like you\u2019re all alone in this. I completely understand if you want to wait until I can help. And if you need time to transition from your job to our new home, take all the time you need.\u201d And I meant every word. It would fucking kill me to be without her, but she had a life here too. It was only fair she left it on her own terms.</p><p>She sniffed, then snuggled in closer to me. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to worry about me. I can handle moving and everything else that goes with it. You just worry about getting on that new team and showing the Mets that they screwed up by letting you go. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re trading you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Kitten. I can\u2019t believe it either. Good thing I still have this necklace. I think I\u2019m gonna need it.\u201d I pulled the key from under my shirt and stroked the letters stamped on it before letting it fall against my chest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s yours. Until you don\u2019t need it anymore,\u201d she said with a smile as she reached her hand out to touch it. \u201cI feel betrayed by the team, in a way. Why do I feel like that? Do you feel like that?\u201d</p><p>What I did feel was fucking stupid for having hurt feelings over this. What was I, a twelve-year-old? No, I was a man and grown men weren\u2019t supposed to get butt-hurt over shit like this.</p> <p>But truth be told, I was hurt. And I hated to admit it, but I vowed to never lie to my wife again and I took that seriously. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I feel betrayed as much as I feel let down. Like, I guess I stupidly thought they\u2019d fight for me. Just because my pitching isn\u2019t up to par right now, that they would know it would be back eventually. I feel like they quit on me. And it hurts because I\u2019d never quit on them. They\u2019re my team and I always give a hundred and ten percent when I\u2019m on that mound. It hurts knowing it\u2019s not a two-way street. Is that stupid?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, I felt stupid admitting all this to her. Even though I knew she understood me more than anyone else in this world, it still sucked saying it all out loud.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid at all,\u201d Cassie said loyally. \u201cYou love this team. And it\u2019s like you just got told they don\u2019t love you the same way back. They broke up with you.\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI got dumped.\u201d</p><p>Then she looked up at me with those big fucking green eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ll never dump you.\u201d</p><p>My heart full of love for her, I reached for her left hand and kissed the diamond I\u2019d bought her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, her body shaking against mine. \u201cYeah, I know. Been there, done that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd look how well that turned out,\u201d I teased playfully, knowing damn well she was the best thing to ever happen to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it turned out better than well, Mr. Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor me, maybe. I don\u2019t know about your end of the deal.\u201d</p><p>Slightly Emotional</p><p>Jack got the news he\u2019d been traded to Anaheim two days later. The Mets were in St. Louis and just like he said, he had to fly straight from there to Texas to meet up with his new team, the Anaheim Angels. Of course they went by some other name now, but growing up in Southern California, they\u2019d always be the Anaheim Angels to me.</p><p>We really lucked out that the Angels were one of the teams fighting for Jack. That meant we got to move home, and it also meant that Jack didn\u2019t have to try to find a place to live in his downtime. Grateful we had family in the area, he moved straight in with Gran and Gramps until I got there.</p><p>If he had been traded to Toronto, the team would have put him in a hotel for the first home stand only. It would only be for a few nights, then he would have had to find permanent accommodations on his own. That was just another harsh reality of playing professional baseball. No one helped you when you needed help the most. If Jack didn\u2019t have me, I couldn\u2019t imagine what he\u2019d do. The players didn\u2019t have time to find places to live, and deal with other necessary issues like that, when their entire days were spent at the ball field trying to maintain their position.</p><p>Of course I hated the idea of leaving work and the home we\u2019d created in New York, but I hated being away from Jack\u2019s home base even more. So I knocked on Nora\u2019s door the morning after the trade.</p><p>\u201cHmph. I know why you\u2019re in my office,\u201d she said, momentarily pretending to be offended with me. Then real indignation took over. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they traded him!\u201d</p><p>Taken aback, I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI feel the same way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really going to miss you,\u201d she said, her face solemn. Nora was a smart woman; she\u2019d obviously put two and two together to figure out why I\u2019d come to meet with her unannounced.</p><p>\u201cAnd I can\u2019t believe I have to move back to California. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love my home, but I\u2019m not ready to say good-bye to New York yet. Is that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. New York\u2019s in your blood, Cassie. Plus, I have a proposition for you.\u201d She rubbed her hands together and a devious smile appeared.</p><p>My mood immediately lifted. \u201cWhat is it? Please let it be something that means I can still work here but not physically be here,\u201d I practically begged.</p><p>She huffed and glared at me, shaking her head. \u201cYou ruin every surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as you can deal with being an independent contractor instead of an employee, I can hire you on a project-by-project basis. And darling, your work more than speaks for itself, so I have no problem in doing just that.\u201d</p><p>I stood up from my chair and ran to the other side of Nora\u2019s desk, then reached down and squeezed her hard. \u201cThank you so much, Nora! Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d I exclaimed into her hair. \u201cThis means everything to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, we\u2019re lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m lucky to have you,\u201d I practically shouted. \u201cWhen should I do the switch? And how will it work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assume you need to move as soon as possible, am I right?\u201d she asked and I shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you work all the time, but I will get you whatever I can. It won\u2019t be like it is now, but it\u2019s better than nothing. And since you\u2019ll be an independent contractor, you can charge me per hour or a flat fee, that\u2019s something you\u2019ll need to figure out on your own. But the money can potentially turn out to be the same for less work, technically speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now, go type up your letter of resignation and hand it in so I can let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me cry,\u201d I said, wiping at the tears threatening to fall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to make your life easier, Cassie, not make you cry.\u201d She tormented me with a knowing glance.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. And I love you for it. I can never thank you enough, Nora. You\u2019ve been the best boss in the world.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and admitted with no shame, \u201cI am pretty amazing.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing. \u201cI had no idea what I was going to do, or how I was going to leave. Thank you for making this so easy for us.\u201d</p><p>Nora let out a little huff. \u201cIt\u2019s your own fault for being so damn talented. Now go,\u201d she said with a dismissive wave, \u201cbefore you mess up my mascara.\u201d</p><p>I gave Nora another hug, kissed the side of her cheek, and turned to walk out of her office for the last time in the foreseeable future.</p><p>\u201cBy the way,\u201d she said, \u201cthe photos you took of Trina are incredible. You still want to shoot her post-pictorial, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely! Trina would kill me.\u201d Inside, I reveled at the fact that I\u2019d get to come back here in the near future to work. I wasn\u2019t even gone yet, but I already longed to be back. New York City had definitely left its mark on me.</p><p>Closing Nora\u2019s door behind me, I walked to my desk for the last time. I sat down and spun my chair around to stare at my computer screen, looking over the letter of resignation I\u2019d already typed out for two seconds before e-mailing it over. If I looked at it for too long, I might be tempted to press DELETE.</p><p>Thankfully, or oddly, depending on how you looked at it, I had only acquired a small amount of personal belongings over the years. I scooped them up and slipped out of the office, then pressed the DOWN elevator button without making a fuss. Just the thought of leaving was hard enough; I didn\u2019t want to make a spectacle out of it. I planned on sending a good-bye e-mail to the office once I was settled back in California. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I know, I know, it was sort of a chicken-shit move, but the reality was that co-workers didn\u2019t let people leave easily. They had a habit of creating chaos and parties and celebrations that never ended. It was all with good intentions, but I didn\u2019t have time for that. I needed to get our belongings packed and moved out to Los Angeles as soon as possible. Jack and I needed a new home, and it was my job to find us one. Because that was what the wife of a major league baseball player did. She took care of her man.</p><p>As I walked up the street toward the subway station, I thought I\u2019d be more emotional. I actually braced myself for the tears and soul ache that never came. I\u2019d fought so hard with Jack about having my own career, and had taken such a strong stand when it came to what I dreamed and wanted. But right now, all I truly wanted was to be home with my husband. I knew I told Jack exactly that the other night, but that was before I\u2019d quit, before I\u2019d actually resigned from my job.</p><p>Passion was a fickle thing. It could make you think you\u2019d die for something one minute, then force you to realize you\u2019d be just fine without it the next. A year and a half ago, I would have sworn on my life that I couldn\u2019t survive a single moment if I didn\u2019t have my career. Take away photography, and I assumed my soul would wither and die on the spot, leaving nothing but a memory of what once was.</p><p>But life had a way of changing your priorities. Or maybe it was me that had changed, because I\u2019d never felt more full of life than I did right now. And none of it had to do with my career.</p> <p>It was in this moment of truth, as I stood in a darkening subway station surrounded by strangers and lonely musicians, when I realized that my home was wherever Jack was. And he was no longer in New York, so I no longer belonged here. It was a simple truth, yet utterly profound in its message. I was meant to land wherever he settled, like the ocean washing seashells onto the shore. Jack was the shell, in constant motion and movement, being tossed around from place to place by the ebb and flow of something more powerful than he. And I was the sand, gripping and holding on to him, comforting his tumble with each push and pull of the tide, yet always constant.</p><p>When I walked into the waiting subway car, I had a smile plastered on my face. This understanding ... this awakening ... filled me with more joy than I\u2019d ever considered possible. The best part was the acute awareness I had been given. It was like a gift. My heart wanted to burst with the sheer happiness I felt in this moment.</p><p>Before, I\u2019d honestly never thought that following Jack\u2019s career would ever feel okay to me. I had figured that I would always be fighting to keep hold of something that I felt defined me in ways that were separate from Jack. But the thing was, Jack was a part of me, and choosing to keep our family together was an okay priority for me to have.</p><p>Not only was I the wife of a major league baseball player, but I was the wife of Jack Fucking Carter. And I wanted to take care of my man, the same way he chose to take care of me. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind that Jack would do anything for me if I asked him to. The thing was, I had nothing I wanted to ask. Not anymore.</p><p>My fears in our relationship had been settled long ago. The point I tried to prove to him, to myself, had been proven. It wasn\u2019t giving up on my dreams to be there and support Jack. Somewhere along the line in our relationship, Jack and his life had become a part of my dreams too. Being with him fulfilled me in ways I\u2019d only fought against before.</p> <p>The simple truth was that it hurt a lot more to be away from Jack than it did to walk away from work. No one was more surprised by this revelation than me.</p><p>About an hour after I arrived home, the doorman called to let me know the packing boxes I\u2019d ordered had arrived. Thankfully, he hauled them up for me and brought them in, stacking them higher than my kitchen table.</p><p>\u201cDo you need packing tape, Mrs. Carter?\u201d</p><p>I looked around and tapped the side of my head. \u201cProbably. Do you have any I can borrow?\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and his bushy eyebrows squished together like a giant gray caterpillar. \u201cWe have plenty. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Thomas! Just walk back in,\u201d I yelled.</p> <p>Jack had been right. Trying to do this all alone royally sucked. I looked around at all the things we\u2019d acquired over the years, and realized there was no way I could do this alone, and in a short time frame.</p><p>How did the other wives do this, especially when they had kids? They had to have hired help, right? An idea forming, I dialed Trina\u2019s number and waited.</p><p>Thomas popped his head back in, dropped two tape guns on the table, and waved before letting himself back out. I mouthed \u201cthank you\u201d to him as Trina answered.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe you\u2019re leaving me,\u201d she said without preamble, her accented voice startling me as she dove right in without saying hello.</p><p>I sighed. \u201cI know. I\u2019m trying not to think about it.\u201d Leaving Trina and Matteo was going to be hard. Maybe I could convince them to move with us? After all, we could use a driver in LA. As wonderful as it would be for us, I shook away the absurd idea.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the matter? I know you\u2019re not just calling to chat this chubby girl\u2019s ear off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrina, you\u2019re seven months pregnant! You\u2019re not chubby! You can\u2019t even tell you\u2019re pregnant from behind. Which, by the way, is why girls hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls hate me?\u201d she scoffed, horrified at the very idea.</p> <p>\u201cI mean. If they did. That would be why,\u201d I said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s up, lovie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I move, can I call you anytime I want so you\u2019ll talk to me? You can read me the phone book, I don\u2019t care. I am going to miss hearing your voice so much.\u201d</p><p>Trina\u2019s British accent was absolutely precious; I might have developed a girl crush on her for that alone. Plus, the words she used were adorable. Everything was \u201cbrilliant\u201d or \u201clovely;\u201d when she was really sad or upset, she was \u201cgutted;\u201d and I was still trying to figure out what she meant by \u201cgobsmacked.\u201d I thought it meant \u201cshocked,\u201d but I\u2019d never been sure.</p><p>\u201cOnly until the baby comes and then I\u2019ll probably put a hit on you if you wake me,\u201d she said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cDeal. So, the real reason I\u2019m calling is because I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to pack up this entire apartment by myself. I\u2019m literally freaking out here, because there\u2019s no way I can do this alone. How do the other wives do it? What do people do? Help me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be joking. Cassie, tell me you aren\u2019t sitting at home surrounded by a bunch of empty boxes wondering where to start?\u201d</p><p>Turning my head slowly, I scanned our beautifully decorated apartment, looking at everything with a newly critical eye. Suddenly everything I\u2019d carefully purchased and placed there with so much love looked like the bane of my existence. \u201cActually, I\u2019m staring at a stack of boxes that still need to be built. Then I can surround myself with them and wonder where to start.\u201d</p><p>She tsk-tsked me before adding, \u201cThat will take you months to do by yourself. You have to hire movers, luv. They\u2019ll come pack your things and then drive them across the country for you. You just tell them where to deliver it all.\u201d</p><p>I sat up straight, excited at the very thought. \u201cThey\u2019ll pack for me? Shut the front door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut the front door? I\u2019m going to remember that one,\u201d she teased. \u201cBut yes. You should call your contact in the Mets office and ask if they have anyone they recommend. They really should help you with this, Cassie, but I know that they sometimes won\u2019t. If you hit a dead end with them, get the number for your contact person in Anaheim and beg them for help. One of the goddamn teams should help the poor wife who gets stuck doing all the shit work.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, even though she couldn\u2019t see me. \u201cI know, right? It\u2019s really insane to me that Jack gets traded while he\u2019s on the road. He can\u2019t come home. He has to leave with whatever he has packed, and then I\u2019m supposed to handle moving our entire house across the country because he still has eight more weeks of baseball to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was one of the things that always killed me with Kyle. I know that I was on the road a lot, but I didn\u2019t have to take every modeling shoot that came my way. But those guys,\u201d she paused, as if disappointed somehow. \u201cThey don\u2019t get any time off for anything. Kyle used to tell me how sad the players on the team would get who were dads, you know?\u201d</p><p>Huh? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just that the dads on the team were always really sad. He said they felt like absentee fathers all the time because of everything they missed. You know, like birthdays and holidays, and all the things that are important to little kids they always miss out on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard a few of the wives say things like that before. It\u2019s a brutal business. You have to really love the sport to want to play it that bad.\u201d</p><p>My eyes landed on a mason jar filled with quarters sitting on a shelf. I stared at it while Trina\u2019s voice filtered into my head, as my attention wandered slightly.</p><p>\u201cAnd you have to really love the man playing it to want to stay with them through it all,\u201d she offered, giving me a compliment.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s either love or all the wives are crazy. Probably the latter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably.\u201d She yawned, which forced me to yawn in response. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m exhausted. This last trimester is kicking my ass. I\u2019m tired all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go. Thank you for the advice. I\u2019ll figure out what I need to do tomorrow. I\u2019m really tired too. I\u2019ll blame you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSympathy tiredness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! I\u2019m tired for you and your baby through the phone,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cLove you,\u201d she said, then yawned again.</p><p>\u201cYou too. Night.\u201d</p><p>Once you\u2019re no longer a part of an organization, you cease being their responsibility, or their problem. The Mets offered me nothing in the form of help or suggestions, and when I finally got off the phone with my contact there, I wanted to cry. The fact that I\u2019d left a message for her that morning, then sat around all day waiting for a response and she didn\u2019t return my call until late that evening, probably had a lot to do with it.</p><p>I was so emotional lately, everything had me on edge. Of course, I blamed my overly delicate nature on Jack being gone all the time. But when a freaking tissue commercial caused me to burst into tears, I was convinced I\u2019d gone crazy.</p><p>My cell phone rang and Jack\u2019s dimpled grin flashed across my screen. \u201cHello,\u201d I whined, wiping my nose with the back of my hand.</p><p>\u201cCassie? Are you crying? Why are you crying?\u201d Jack\u2019s warm tone instantly turned protective.</p><p>\u201cNothing, babe. It\u2019s just this stupid commercial where this guy comes home from the war and sees his family and they don\u2019t know he\u2019s coming and he surprises them\u2014\u201d I cut off, tears falling in full force again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crying because of a commercial? Did I hear you right?\u201d</p><p>I sniffed. \u201cShut up, Jack. I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m emotional. You\u2019re not here and I miss you so much. Our apartment is huge and we have a lot of shit and no one is helping me and all I want to do is be with you. But at this rate, I\u2019ll be here until next season.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhhhh, Kitten.\u201d He started to laugh and I swore I\u2019d kill him if he didn\u2019t stop. \u201cDo you want me to send someone there to pack our shit? I\u2019ll fly you out to Seattle right now and I\u2019ll get someone to handle all that. You just say the word and it\u2019s done. You don\u2019t need to be doing that all alone. I told you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so hot,\u201d I mumbled through my whimpering.</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe way you protect me and want to take care of me. I love youuuu,\u201d I told him, my declaration dragged out with my sobs. I couldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said. \u201cStop packing or not packing. Whatever you\u2019re doing, just stop. We\u2019ll figure it out later. But right now, we need to book my kitten a flight to come see me.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a shaky breath. \u201cOkay. That sounds good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe really don\u2019t have to move out right now, you know. Hell, we can keep the apartment in New York for all I care. We\u2019ll just never use it as often as we\u2019ll want to. But if you want to keep it, we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do want to,\u201d I said. \u201cBut then again I don\u2019t. It\u2019s not realistic and it\u2019s a waste of money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour decision. I\u2019ll support whatever you want, okay? I just want you to be happy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am happy,\u201d I cried out.</p><p>\u201cI can tell,\u201d he said, his voice all funny like it was when he tried not to laugh. \u201cOkay, babe, I have a ticket for you to fly out to Seattle first thing tomorrow morning. It\u2019s real early, so you need to go to bed. I\u2019m e-mailing you and Matteo the itinerary now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you do that already? We\u2019re still on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Harry Potter, remember? I\u2019m fucking magic!\u201d</p><p>I laughed and he chuckled into my ear. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Now, go get some sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I miss you,\u201d I confessed with my whole heart, wishing he could feel just how deeply I meant the words. My love for Jack felt like it filled my body to bursting at every seam that held me together. I was overcome with emotion on every level.</p> <p>\u201cI miss you too. I hate being away from you. I\u2019ve always hated it, but this is different. You\u2019re not home when I get there and it makes me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop crying, please. It fucking kills me to hear you crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve finally cracked. I always knew you were crazy. I mean, I did get you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>I wiped my eyes, and couldn\u2019t stop the smile that formed on my face. \u201cI\u2019m in bed. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood girl. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d</p><p>My plane landed in Seattle a little before eight the next morning. We disembarked via air stairs and walked across the paved runway before entering an annexed building. I glanced up at the clouds hovering in the sky. They threatened to drown me with the raindrops they carried. The air held a gentle chill that New York lacked this time of year. Even in a summer rainstorm, the East Coast air was hot and sticky. Not so in the Pacific Northwest. It was quite a change for me.</p> <p>I walked through the small building, took the escalator down, and waited patiently for the shuttle that would take me to baggage claim. Within seconds, the double doors opened and I stepped inside. My stomach flipped as nervous energy surged through me at the idea of seeing my husband. I missed him so much.</p><p>Following the signs that pointed to baggage claim, I realized that I\u2019d walked in a circle. Somewhere along the line, I wasn\u2019t translating the arrow directions correctly. Passing by the women\u2019s bathroom one more time, I decided I couldn\u2019t hold it and stepped inside. My stomach ached and fought against the urge to puke.</p><p>I must be hungry.</p><p>I splashed some cold water on my face before patting it dry with a paper towel. Stepping into the oncoming foot traffic, I decided to follow the herd of other travelers, convinced they would lead me straight to my destination. And they did.</p><p>When I was halfway down the escalator, I saw my husband standing at the bottom with a dimpled smile on his face, holding a sign that read:</p><p>I covered my face with my hands and burst into tears. My mind flashed back to Jack in the airport when we first dated, holding the sign that read:</p><p>I bolted from the escalator and straight into his waiting arms. His body was warm and comforting as he held me close.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t supposed to make you cry.\u201d He kissed my head and patted my hair.</p><p>\u201cThe sign, Jack. The sign,\u201d I blubbered into his T-shirt. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve really missed you.\u201d</p><p>Holy hell, I need to stop crying all the time lately. Something is seriously wrong with me. I feel so out of control and unbalanced.</p><p>Jack\u2019s thumb reached across my cheek and wiped my tears away. He leaned down, pressing his lips against mine, and my body melted into his. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you too. Let\u2019s get your bag and get out of here.\u201d</p><p>I nodded as he linked his fingers with mine. \u201cHow\u2019s your hand feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Real good.\u201d While we waited at the baggage claim carousel, he flexed and stretched his left hand before reaching for my small suitcase. \u201cThis it?\u201d he asked as he pulled it off the spinning track.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just that.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I checked it when it was small enough to carry on board. Occupational habit, maybe. Whenever I traveled for work, I always checked all my equipment and bags, so this routine was second nature to me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting stronger, you know,\u201d he said, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>I flashed him a smile and squeezed his hand. \u201cI knew you would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I gained another mile per hour on my fast-ball yesterday.\u201d He grinned from ear to ear and my body heated with pride.</p><p>\u201cJack, that\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kitten.\u201d His face beamed with pleasure, the light brown rings closest to his pupils nearly glowing.</p><p>By the time we arrived at his hotel, my stomach betrayed me. I could barely stand up straight, it hurt so badly. I couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. I hadn\u2019t seen Jack in almost two weeks and now that we were together, I was sick?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\u201d I looked at him apologetically as we waited for the elevator.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, just get better. Did you eat breakfast this morning?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, the very idea of food making me want to hurl. \u201cNo. No food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll order\u2014\u201d he started to respond before I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want anything!\u201d I fought to keep the nothing I\u2019d eaten inside my body as the elevator rocked to a stop. I wrapped my arm across my tummy and attempted to walk.</p><p>\u201cI got you,\u201d Jack said before scooping me into his arms and carrying me down the long hallway. The last time he held me like this was after I\u2019d gotten mugged in college. Some guy had come out of nowhere and stolen my camera and beat the crap out of me. When Jack finally found me, he picked me up and walked all the way to my apartment without stopping to catch his breath or slow his pace. It was the most romantic thing ever.</p><p>He was doing the same thing now. I leaned my body into his, listening to the sound of his heart beating against his muscled chest. It seemed like we walked for hours before we arrived at his hotel room door.</p><p>\u201cI have to put you down,\u201d he warned before placing my feet gently on the ground. \u201cCan you stand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I responded, my body doubled over in pain.</p><p>He swiped his keycard, the light turned green, and the lock made a clicking sound. Jack turned the handle and held the door open with his foot as I trudged inside. I rounded the corner and fell on top of his bed, pulling my knees to my chest.</p><p>\u201cKitten, what happened?\u201d he asked as he sat down next to me on the bed. He propped pillows up behind him before pulling my head on top of his legs. His fingers ran through my hair and I could feel the intensity of his stare on me.</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m not sure. I just don\u2019t feel good all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to leave in two hours for the field, but I don\u2019t want to leave you like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be fine after I nap or something. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>He let out a loud huff. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about you? Okay, Kitten. Sure thing. Never gonna fucking happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just meant that I\u2019ll be fine. I probably just need sleep and food.\u201d I hesitated. \u201cAt some point.\u201d</p><p>He stroked my hair, then stood up to walk over to the windows and pulled the curtains closed.</p><p>A moment later, he pressed a kiss to my cheek. Then he was gone.</p><p>My eyes opened in the darkened room, and when I turned my head to look for the alarm clock, my neck stiffened under the weight of my twisted sleeping position. How long had I been asleep?</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>I moved my arm and the sound of paper crinkling drew my attention toward a piece of paper lying on the bedspread. It was a note from Jack.</p><p>Didn\u2019t want to wake you. I hope you feel better. Your tickets are at will-call, but please don\u2019t come if you don\u2019t feel good. I mean it, Kitten. If you feel like shit, stay here! I\u2019ll be back before you know it.</p><p>Determined to attend his game, I pushed myself to my feet. My head spun and I pressed my hand against the wall for balance. I needed water, and I knew Jack\u2019s mini fridge would be filled with it.</p><p>Opening a bottle, I took a sip before immediately bolting to the bathroom. The water I\u2019d just swallowed came surging back up with a vengeance. Okay, I was definitely sick. There was no way I could go to the game like this; I\u2019d never make it through a single inning.</p><p>Reaching for my cell phone, I typed out a message to Jack, letting him know I wouldn\u2019t be at the game. He wouldn\u2019t get to read it until after, but at least he\u2019d know not to look for me and would come straight back to the hotel. Hopefully by then I\u2019d be feeling better.</p><p>I set my phone on the bed beside me just as it rang. Melissa\u2019s singsong ringtone filled the room and I pressed OKAY to answer the call.</p><p>\u201cHey, girly,\u201d I whined into the phone line.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, you sound like death. Where are you?\u201d Her chipper tone was almost too much for me to take in my current state.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Seattle with Jack. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh,\u201d she stuttered. \u201cI\u2019m at home. Where else would I be?\u201d</p><p>I reached for a pillow and tucked it in front of my hips and tummy. Leaning my body against the coolness of the pillowcase helped settle my upset belly. \u201cI don\u2019t know. So, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you sound so bad? Are you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. My stomach is killing me and I threw up right before you called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPregnant,\u201d she stated in her typical teasing tone, but something in that one word caused my breath to hitch.</p><p>When the hell was the last time I had my period? Was it over a month ago? I can\u2019t remember.</p><p>\u201cCass?\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice rang in my ear. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry, I\u2019m here. Shit, Meli, you might be right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was totally joking.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued by the idea, I sat up and leaned back against the plush headboard. \u201cI know you were, but I\u2019ve been really tired lately. Not to mention, stupid emotional. Like, I cry at everything!\u201d I complained.</p><p>\u201cEverything?\u201d she droned, mocking my confession.</p> <p>\u201cEverything!\u201d I said forcefully. \u201cCommercials. A fucking tissue commercial wrecked me the other day. I had to go to bed to stop thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>Melissa laughed hysterically on the other end of the line. I wanted to reach through the phone and smack her. \u201cOh, holy shit. You totally are pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMeli, I have to go. I\u2019ll call you back.\u201d I hung up before she could respond and forced myself out of bed.</p><p>I needed to find a drugstore of some sort and buy some home pregnancy tests. Unless the hotel sold them, which I highly doubted. And the last thing I wanted was to run into a player\u2019s wife or girlfriend while I was buying something like that.</p><p>Like an idiot, I talked to my stomach, telling it to settle down enough to let me find a store. And then I promised it that if it let me not be sick until I got back to the hotel room, I\u2019d let it make me sick all night if it wanted. I really needed to be able to find a store, buy some tests, and not puke while doing it.</p> <p>Luck was definitely on my side because there was a drugstore right across the street from the hotel. I\u2019d never purchased a pregnancy test before, so was surprised to find an entire aisle filled with shelves of them. I decided right then and there that there was definitely such a thing as too many options. There were plus signs, pink or blue, one line or two, yes or no, results before your first missed period or after, and more. My head spun and I had no idea which one was the best to buy. So I purchased four.</p><p>I raced back to the hotel, my ridiculous amount of pregnancy tests stuffed into a paper bag. Closing the door behind me, I removed the first box. I read the directions twice before attempting to follow them. The first time, instead of peeing on the damn stick, I peed all over my fingers. I wondered what kind of woman could control the direction of her pee the way the directions seemed to expect we could.</p><p>After washing my hands, I hurried into the living area and found my bottle of water. I chugged the whole thing to give myself plenty of ammunition before scooting back into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try this again,\u201d I said out loud, giving myself a pep talk.</p><p>Miraculously peeing on the proper part of the stick instead of my hands, I set the test on top of the sink counter and poured the rest of the tests out of the bag. They all informed me that they weren\u2019t one hundred percent accurate, so I should take more than one before going to a doctor for final confirmation.</p><p>Cell phone in hand, I stared at it, willing the minutes to go by faster. Unable to wait any longer, I wandered back into the bathroom and glanced down at the test, which was changing as I watched. The first window darkened and two lines appeared. It stated on the test that one line meant you were not pregnant and two lines meant you were. But it said nothing about a faint line. What did a barely there second line mean?</p> <p>I scanned the directions and focused on the Frequently Asked Questions. It stated that the appearance of a second line meant that you were pregnant, no matter how faint or dark the line.</p><p>Pregnant.</p><p>Not willing to trust the one test, I took two more. All three yielded the same results:</p><p>PREGNANT.</p><p>Oh my gosh. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell Jack. He\u2019d wanted to knock me up since the night he proposed. I fought the urge to call Melissa back and tell her, dying to share my news with my best friend. But Jack deserved to be the first person to know.</p><p>I laughed out loud when I realized why I\u2019d been such a crazy freak lately. Thank heaven I had a reason for my incessant sob fests. I wasn\u2019t going insane, I was just pregnant.</p><p>With a baby.</p><p>In my belly.</p> <p>Holy shit.</p><p>What if I turn out to be a crappy mom? I wonder how far along I am?</p><p>I hid the tests in the closet and fell asleep waiting for Jack to come back. When the door burst open, I jumped, the sound scaring me half to death.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten! My hands are full, that\u2019s why I kicked the living shit out of the door here.\u201d Jack appeared, his arms filled with what looked like grocery bags.</p><p>\u201cWhat is all that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got you ginger ale for your stomach, plus a bunch of other stuff in case you don\u2019t feel well. And then I got you a bunch of munchies and snacks in case you do. Do you feel better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch. How was the game?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cWe won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you throw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until tomorrow, you know that.\u201d He narrowed his eyes, looking at me closely before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re acting weird.\u201d</p><p>Jack couldn\u2019t possibly know anything. I wasn\u2019t acting weird; I was acting just like I always act.</p><p>Forcing an innocent look on my face, I asked, \u201cHow am I acting weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have this look on your face. And your eyes ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about them?\u201d</p><p>He ran his thumb down the side of my face. \u201cThey\u2019re hiding something, but they want to share,\u201d he said as he lifted his eyebrows at me.</p><p>That\u2019s it. He is magic. I knew it.</p><p>About to burst with excitement, I couldn\u2019t stall any longer. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you knew that, but I do have something to tell you. It has to do with why I wasn\u2019t feeling well earlier.\u201d I pulled him toward the closet. \u201cThe reason\u2019s in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a guy in the closet?\u201d He stepped back, his hands balling into fists. \u201cThere better not be a fucking guy in this closet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No? I just hid something in here.\u201d I rolled the door open and pulled one of the tests down from the shelf. Unfolding the washcloth from around it, I presented it to Jack like a crown jewel on a display pillow.</p><p>He peeked down at the test stick, his brow furrowing. \u201cWhat is tha\u2014\u201d He stopped midsentence, his eyes huge. \u201cIs this? Are you?\u201d He looked at me, his face full of wonder, and I nodded.</p><p>Jack fell to his knees and pressed his head against my belly. He wrapped his arms around me and held on to me without saying a word, his breath hot through the fabric of my shirt. I\u2019m not sure how long we stood like that, but it felt like hours. When he finally pulled his head from me, tears were falling down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having a baby?\u201d He covered my stomach with both of his hands.</p><p>\u201cThree tests said yes, so I think so.\u201d I smiled down at him as he moved to sit on the floor.</p><p>He reached for me and when I linked my hands with his, he pulled me down across from him. \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding, Kitten? I\u2019ve wanted to knock you up since the day I met you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLiar!\u201d I laughed out loud.</p><p>\u201cOkay, maybe not the day I met you. But pretty soon after.\u201d He reached for my face, palming it with both his hands. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you have our baby in your belly right now. He\u2019s just in there chilling.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cOnly you would call it a he already. And say that it\u2019s chilling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d He scooted closer to me, his lips frantic as he kissed all over my face. \u201cI love you so much. Thank you. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for marrying me. Thank you for becoming a part of my family. And thank you for growing our love child in your belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur love child?\u201d I snickered. \u201cJack Carter, you never cease to amaze me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the amazing one. I fucking love you. More than anything else in this world.\u201d He lowered his head back to my stomach and planted a kiss over my top. \u201cAnd I promise I\u2019ll be a good dad.\u201d</p><p>I reached for his hand and caressed it. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>He looked up at me and smirked. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking to you.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, I swatted his shoulder and said, \u201cWell then, it knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling our son an it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stop calling it a him! What if it\u2019s a girl, Jack?\u201d My eyes widened at the thought. \u201cHoly shit, Jack. What if it\u2019s a girl?\u201d</p><p>His head tipped back as he laughed full and hard. \u201cThen I\u2019ll kill any guy who comes near her until she moves out of our house.\u201d He took a breath before continuing, \u201cWhich will be, never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I said, knowing damn well that if we had a girl, Jack probably would go nuts every time she left the house. He reached for my hand and pressed it against his lips.</p><p>\u201cAnd if we do have a girl, Kitten, I hope she looks just like her mom.\u201d</p><p>My eyes filled with tears. \u201cStupid pregnancy hormones. I\u2019m going to spend nine months crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll spend nine months wiping your tears.\u201d</p><p>I sniffed, wondering how in the world I\u2019d gotten so lucky. I knew we\u2019d been through hell and back, but all of those times felt so far rooted in the past in this present moment. We were going to have a baby, and I couldn\u2019t think of anything more amazing or wonderful.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d Jack\u2019s hands burrowed into his hair as he tugged at it. \u201cYou think I\u2019ll be a good dad?\u201d</p><p>I pressed my hand against his cheek. \u201cI know you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo doubts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d I said softly, longing with all my heart to reassure his worried mind.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I get to live every day surrounded by your love. It\u2019s deep, it\u2019s passionate, and it\u2019s intense. But it\u2019s honest and true. I know you\u2019ll love our baby the same way. No matter what sex it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight!\u201d he proclaimed, rubbing my belly as if it were a Buddha. \u201cThere\u2019s a little Carter in there. And I\u2019ll do anything to keep you both safe, protected, and provided for. That\u2019s my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Right there. What you just said. That\u2019s how I know.\u201d I placed my hand over his and squeezed lightly.</p><p>Jack pushed himself from the floor before reaching for my hand and pulling me up with him. He wrapped his arms around me and held me so tight, I could literally feel the love radiating between us. With a firm grip on my hand, Jack pulled me toward the bed and sat down before making room for me between his legs. I sat on the bed in front of him and settled in, feeling the muscles of his chest press against my back as he spoke.</p><p>\u201cWhen are you planning on moving, Kitten? I can\u2019t have you all the way across the country. I\u2019ll go fucking crazy knowing you\u2019re alone. I need you with me.\u201d He planted soft kisses along my neck and shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ll hire movers as soon as I get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your work? Does Nora know you\u2019re leaving?\u201d</p><p>I turned my body to glance at him. \u201cShit! I forgot to tell you. Nora told me I could work on an assignment basis. I had to give her a resignation letter and everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, what does that mean? Do you still get to do the shoot with Matteo and Trina after the baby\u2019s born?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, I just have to fly back to New York to do it. And whenever an assignment comes up that I\u2019m qualified for and interested in, I just accept the offer. But I don\u2019t have to accept anything, or I can accept everything.\u201d I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cNow that I\u2019m pregnant, though, I\u2019m not sure what I want to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Kitten? You want to stay home with our son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, stop!\u201d I giggled and rolled my eyes even though he couldn\u2019t see, then turned my body around to face him. \u201cBut I think I do. Want to stay home, that is. Plus, I really want to be there for you and travel together as much as possible.\u201d</p><p>Looking deep into his eyes, wanting to be sure he saw the sincerity in mine, I said, \u201cYou see, I had this epiphany on the train home the other day. You\u2019re my home. I don\u2019t want to be where you\u2019re not. And I know those feelings are only going to magnify once the baby comes. I\u2019ll want to keep our family together as often as possible. So, if my career sits on the back burner for now, I\u2019m totally okay with that.\u201d</p> <p>Jack held a hand in the air to stop me. \u201cAre you sure? You\u2019re okay with not working? I know how much you love photography, and I don\u2019t want you to resent me or hate me somewhere down the line. I\u2019m in this for the long haul, Kitten. I\u2019m not planning on ever letting you go, so I can\u2019t have you hating me in five years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to do this. It\u2019s my choice. I want my family to come first, and you,\u201d I choked back a sob, \u201cyou\u2019re my family. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll never work again, I just don\u2019t want to work for now. Priorities, babe. These are my new ones.\u201d</p><p>Jack sighed. \u201cGod, Kitten, I want to fight you on this right now. I want to tell you that you\u2019re wrong and stupid and should never quit working because you love it so much, but I\u2019m too busy feeling so happy with everything you just said. Not because you\u2019re giving up something you love, but because there\u2019s no one else on earth I\u2019d rather have raise our son than you. And if that means I get to spend more time with you at home, on the road, wherever\u2014I\u2019m thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Then he cupped my cheek with his hand, looked deep into my eyes, and said, \u201cEvery moment with you is never enough; I always want more. And I always will.\u201d</p><p>Hearing that, I broke out into tears again.</p> <p>Fucking hormones.</p><p>Moving Home</p><p>One Month Later ...</p><p>The following week, I\u2019d hired movers to pack and move our apartment. Saying good-bye to not only the view, but the city and our friends, was extremely hard. I knew we\u2019d keep in touch, but the reality was that it wasn\u2019t the same once you didn\u2019t get to see one another whenever you wanted.</p><p>Plus, I had fallen in love with New York City. It was harder to leave than I anticipated. I mourned the loss of my second home, a city that was so opposite from where I was from, but filled my heart in much the same way. Tears were shed, and not because I was pregnant.</p><p>Well, maybe a little.</p> <p>The movers drove all of our belongings to a storage unit near Gran and Gramps\u2019 place, where we all took turns stacking boxes into the rented space. Except Jack had everyone on strict orders that I wasn\u2019t to move or carry much of anything, unless it was super light. So I ended up spending the majority of the day watching them do all the work. I felt like an ass.</p><p>Since Jack was already staying in his old bedroom at Gran\u2019s, I joined him there until I could find us a house to live in. It was hard looking for a place while I traveled with Jack and attended all his home games at a new stadium.</p><p>I had to learn new faces, meet new wives and girlfriends, remember what it was like to drive in LA traffic again, all while battling morning sickness that usually turned into afternoon sickness, followed by night sickness. Aside from that, everything was great. When I told Jack that I needed to stay back from the team\u2019s last road trip to look at houses, he begrudgingly agreed.</p><p>Jack claimed to understand, but said he didn\u2019t like it. The only way he\u2019d accept my staying away from him was if I finally found us a home to live in. As much as we loved Gran and Gramps, we desperately needed our own space. And with the baseball season coming to a close, I wanted to find one soon. We had such a limited amount of time before the season started back up again, that I longed to be as comfortable as possible as soon as I could. Plus with the baby coming, I needed to be settled.</p><p>What could I say? I\u2019d always been a planner.</p><p>Jack hated not being near me while I was pregnant and had insisted I come with him on every road trip. He made sure I was catered to constantly, with whatever I was craving at the moment waiting for me when I checked into our hotel room, along with extra pillows, crackers, and a mini fridge chock-full of ginger ale.</p><p>Truth be told, I loved the way Jack doted over me and protected me. I felt safe with him; I always had. My thoughts drifted back to the night of the mugging when we were still in college. I remembered how scared I was, my body filled with shock, confusion, and sadness at everything that had transpired that evening. The emotion that impressed itself on me the most was the feeling that took over my entire being the moment I saw Jack. When he pulled me into his arms, I knew everything was going to be okay because he was there. I had relaxed instantly, allowing Jack to do what Jack does best: protect what\u2019s his.</p><p>I loved traveling with him, but I was exhausted. And begging off that last road trip was worth it. So worth it. Because ... I found this house.</p> <p>Oh God, this house.</p><p>Swoon.</p><p>I felt lucky enough being able to move back home knowing that all our family would be here when the baby was born, but the house we just bought was another blessing altogether. The one thing we had missed the most while we lived in New York was the SoCal beaches. There were plenty of beaches in New York, but it wasn\u2019t the same.</p><p>Hanging out with friends, surfing, and bonfires were part of growing up in Southern California. Not to mention the fact that the Pacific Ocean was one of my earliest photography obsessions. Looking for a place close to the baseball stadium, our families, and with a good school district for the baby, the Newport Beach area seemed like the best answer. Not to mention the fact I\u2019d have daily photographic inspiration to keep my soul satisfied.</p><p>The price tag deterred me initially. I made great money in my job at the magazine, and Jack\u2019s baseball contract was more than most people would ever make in a lifetime, but I still liked to be smart when it came to our finances. And dropping millions of dollars on a house scared the ever-living shit out of me. Plus, Jack could get traded again at any time and then what? We\u2019d have a crazy-expensive house that we never lived in?</p><p>But then Jack reminded me that we\u2019d always want our home base to be in Southern California. Even if he did get traded again, we should still have a house where we wanted to end up in the long run. And he was right. So after weeks of home shopping without Jack, I found the perfect one in a gated community, which I knew Jack would love.</p><p>The house was two stories with four bedrooms, an office, and a gorgeous backyard with a swimming pool and a lush lawn. The master bedroom had a wraparound balcony and the moment I saw it, I instantly longed for a telescope. I\u2019d asked my dad for one as a kid, but like many others, that promise never materialized. The tipping point was the house had a view to die for\u2014you could see the ocean from every room in the house. When I walked through the front door for the first time and saw the ocean view from the windows, I was stunned. And sold.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes lit up when I brought him to the property. Luckily, the previous owners had modernized the home, so there was nothing I wanted to change, not a single thing. And the best part was that the owners desperately wanted to get rid of it, so we got it for a \u201csteal.\u201d</p><p>On moving day, I watched as Jack wiped his brow, sweat dripping from him in beads. He and Dean stacked boxes from the moving truck we\u2019d rented into various rooms in the new house while I worked on unpacking and setting things up. I wanted our house to look like home as soon as possible, so while they unloaded, I unpacked.</p><p>I was amazed at everything we accomplished this way. The truck that just hours prior had been filled to the gills, was now almost empty. And the walls of our home that were bare a few hours before, were now filled with artwork and framed photographs. It was as if we\u2019d lived here for years.</p><p>\u201cKitten, you don\u2019t have to do that. I can hire someone,\u201d Jack shouted from the garage.</p><p>\u201cStop being crazy. I\u2019m perfectly capable of hanging artwork and unpacking our stuff.\u201d</p><p>Jack sauntered into the house and grabbed me by the backside, then spun me around. \u201cI worry about you,\u201d he said before leaning over to plant a kiss on my barely-there tummy. \u201cDon\u2019t we?\u201d he told my belly in a high-pitched silly voice. \u201cWe worry about Mommy. She needs to just sit down and look pretty while we do all the work.\u201d</p><p>I burst out laughing and ruffled his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d</p><p>He looked up with a grin. \u201cYeah. But I\u2019m your idiot.\u201d Jack kissed my stomach again before walking into the kitchen. He opened the fridge, reached in, and tossed Dean a beer. \u201cHeads up,\u201d he shouted as Dean jumped and moved to catch it.</p><p>\u201cDick.\u201d Dean popped open the can and took a long gulp. And then almost spit it right back out at the sound of my best friend\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cAh, I can\u2019t believe you guys are back here! I\u2019m so happy.\u201d Melissa bounced into the house and straight into my arms. She glanced at Dean and Jack, giving them a curt smile before pressing her ear against my stomach. \u201cHow\u2019s my little baby?\u201d she cooed, then rubbed my belly like it was a fucking good luck charm.</p><p>Why does everyone do this?</p><p>Jack and Dean scuttled out the sliding glass door to the backyard. The cowards.</p><p>When they\u2019d left, I folded my arms over my chest and said flatly, \u201cStill not talking to Dean, I see?\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to one side. \u201cHe\u2019s not talking to me, not the other way around.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou broke his heart. What do you expect?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you, of all people, not to take sides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I take sides?\u201d I said with a huff. \u201cYou never even tried.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s face fell as tears filled her eyes. \u201cThat was harsh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand you. At all. You\u2019re the one who told me to fight for Jack, to not give up on him. You pushed me to love him and give him a chance,\u201d I pointed out, then took a deep breath in and out to fight the nausea I felt growing. \u201cMore than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cSoooo,\u201d I said pointedly. \u201cYou never follow your own advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you even know I want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can see it in your eyes. You miss him. And there\u2019s something you\u2019re not telling me. Come on.\u201d I grabbed her hand and yanked her toward the garage.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d She tried to tug her hand away, and I only pulled her harder.</p><p>\u201cGet in the car.\u201d I opened the passenger door and shoved her inside. \u201cI\u2019m sick of this and we\u2019re going to the only place where you\u2019ll listen to reason.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh my God. No.\u201d She pressed the button to unlock the door and I hit it again, just as fast, using the child safety locks to trap her in the car. \u201cYou cannot Gran-ify me!\u201d she screamed out, pounding on the side window.</p><p>\u201cStop beating up my car! And seriously? Gran-ify you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah!\u201d she cried out. \u201cWhere you bring me to Gran and Gramps and they say the most perfect things and I leave there in tears because you were right all along and I was an idiot.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to laugh, oh so badly, but stopped myself. \u201cLet\u2019s just see what they have to say. Maybe they won\u2019t be on my side?\u201d I offered, silently knowing that they would.</p> <p>I mean, I hoped they would. They\u2019d better.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying they\u2019re actually neutral? Ha! I\u2019ll believe that when I hear it.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later I pulled into their driveway, hoping they wouldn\u2019t be upset at our unannounced arrival. Giving a quick knock, I didn\u2019t wait for a response before opening the front door and shouting, \u201cGran? Gramps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie? Is that you, dear?\u201d Gran shouted from the kitchen.</p><p>Of course. They\u2019re always in the kitchen.</p> <p>\u201cIs that our Kitten?\u201d Gramps called out and I stifled a laugh.</p><p>We walked through the entryway, Melissa\u2019s hand firmly in mine as I pulled her through. \u201cSit,\u201d I demanded and she did as I asked, but folded her arms over her chest and put on that stubborn face I know so well.</p><p>\u201cOh! Hi, Melissa.\u201d Gran smiled. \u201cAre you two okay? What\u2019s going on? Is the baby all right?\u201d She eyed my belly and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cEverything\u2019s good, Gran. I just needed to bring Melissa here.\u201d</p><p>Gran\u2019s brow furrowed, but I knew it was part of her act. \u201cWhatever for, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause for some reason she won\u2019t date Dean. And I know it isn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t like him, or miss him, or any normal reason. I figured that only you and Gramps could get to the bottom of this. So, go on. Work your magic. Use your granny voodoo on her.\u201d</p> <p>Gran and Gramps laughed, full-out belly laughs. \u201cGranny voodoo. That\u2019s great, Kitten,\u201d Gramps said between fits of laughter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not kidding! She\u2019s broken,\u201d I shouted, pointing at my now terrified best friend. \u201cFix her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I will admit that I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s taken this long for the two of you kids to get together,\u201d Gran began. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what the problem is, Melissa?\u201d</p><p>Melissa inhaled deeply, her gaze shifting between the three of us all staring at her. \u201cThere is no problem. Maybe that\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gramps scratched his head, completely taken aback by her answer.</p><p>\u201cGo on,\u201d Gran prompted, her tone sympathetic. It\u2019s how she always sucks them in.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. There\u2019s no problem,\u201d Melissa said, obviously trying to sound confident.</p><p>\u201cDo you like Dean?\u201d I asked the most obvious question of them all and watched as her face softened the way it had when she first mentioned him back in the student union when we were in college.</p> <p>All eyes fixed on Melissa, waiting for her answer. She looked down and wiped at her eyes. \u201cOf course I like him. I\u2019ve never liked anyone so much before.\u201d</p><p>I stood there, shocked. This made absolutely no sense at all to me. I shook my head and said, \u201cSeriously? Then what the hell are we doing here? Why aren\u2019t you with him?\u201d</p><p>Gran huffed out a breath before pulling a bottle of wine from the cupboard. Opening the bottle, she poured three glasses, then filled a fourth with cold water. \u201cSorry to drink in front of you, dear,\u201d she said in apology, handing me the glass filled with water.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Wine doesn\u2019t sound good anyway.\u201d I patted my stomach.</p><p>She placed one of the glasses in front of Melissa. \u201cDrink. Let\u2019s discuss this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou girls make everything so complicated. Don\u2019t you know us men are simple folk?\u201d Gramps asked as he sipped his wine.</p><p>Gran held a hand in the air to stop him, then asked Melissa, \u201cYou\u2019re scared, aren\u2019t you, dear?\u201d</p><p>Gramps nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s so obvious.\u201d</p><p>My head swiveled back and forth as Melissa\u2019s tears fell. \u201cWhat is? What\u2019s obvious?\u201d I asked, completely confused.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s afraid it won\u2019t work. That they won\u2019t last,\u201d Gran said softly as she watched Melissa.</p><p>Gramps smacked the kitchen counter with his hand. \u201cKitten, what\u2019s wrong with your girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s just scared. That\u2019s all this is. Pure fear,\u201d Gran said.</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d I asked Melissa. \u201cBut you\u2019re like the most fearless person I know. You\u2019re always telling people what they should be doing. Always encouraging and always telling them to take risks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easy to tell other people what to do,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to apply your advice to your own life, especially when you don\u2019t see it as clearly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Melissa sighed. \u201cI knew that you and Jack were meant to be together. I could see it, you know? I always told you that. So it\u2019s easy for me to push you to go for something that\u2019s so obvious to me and everyone else around you. But I don\u2019t see myself or my situation with the same kind of clarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I said with a snort. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I believe you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I can tell you what I think you should do, but I never know what I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we all know what you should do! You should do Dean! Um ...\u201d I stopped, feeling the heat on my cheeks rise. \u201cI mean, we all know you and Dean belong together, so what aren\u2019t you telling me? Spit it out,\u201d I insisted.</p><p>Melissa sucked in a deep breath and blurted out, \u201cFine! I like Dean. I really do. But if something happens between us and we don\u2019t work out, I\u2019m the one who loses, not him. You\u2019re my best friend,\u201d she reminded me, glancing in my direction. \u201cBut he\u2019s your husband\u2019s brother. If we hook up and it ends badly, one of us loses you guys.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes pleaded with me for understanding. \u201cAnd it sure as shit isn\u2019t going to be Dean. I\u2019m pretty sure he can\u2019t stop being Jack\u2019s brother. But I can stop being your best friend.\u201d Tears spilled freely down her face, and she reached up to swipe them away. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop being your best friend. I don\u2019t want to be the one who loses everything.\u201d</p><p>My heart aching for her, I stood up and walked over to Melissa, then wrapped my arms around her and squeezed. \u201cI\u2019ll never stop being your best friend. No matter what happens between you and Dean.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou say that now, but you don\u2019t know that. You can\u2019t be sure, if you had to choose. I mean, if you were forced to choose. There\u2019s no way you could choose me over Dean. He\u2019s family now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve always been my family, too.\u201d I caught Melissa\u2019s gaze, trying to show her how sincere I was, but she shook her head.</p><p>Gramps added, \u201cI can guarantee you that Dean isn\u2019t thinking about everything he\u2019s going to lose if you guys break up. He probably isn\u2019t thinking that you guys will break up at all. Why are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, hon, why are you so convinced that you two won\u2019t last?\u201d Gran added.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Melissa, you\u2019re the one person in the world who pushed for me to not give up on Jack. Even after everything we went through, you still said he was the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he was. I was right,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cAnd so am I. You and Dean are meant to be together too. You\u2019re the only one who doesn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>Her head lowered as she whispered, \u201cI feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen, Melissa.\u201d Gran reached over and took my friend\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cLove is the one thing in this world worth taking a risk for. When you\u2019re older and you look back on the life you lived, you won\u2019t regret the fact that you took the chance to love someone. But you will regret the chances on love you didn\u2019t take. Especially the ones rooted in fear. They\u2019re only scary because you have the most to lose. You feel the most for them. Don\u2019t let the fear of losing love stop you from having the experience altogether.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s right, you know.\u201d Gramps smiled warmly. \u201cShe usually is, though, so that\u2019s not surprising. But if you walk away, you will regret this, darlin\u2019. Maybe not right now or not a few years down the road. But eventually you will regret this moment. And every other moment you had with our grandson that could have led to more. Life is filled with many things. You don\u2019t want regrets to be one of them.\u201d</p><p>Gran stood up and planted a sloppy kiss on Gramps\u2019 cheek, and he slipped his arm around her. \u201cHe has a point, dear. Live without regrets. It\u2019s very easy to, really. You just listen to your heart, follow it, and take chances. Always take chances. And take risks, especially when it comes to love. Because love is the one thing in this world that\u2019s worth risking everything for.\u201d</p><p>Melissa nodded, her expression more relaxed and open, her stubborn face a thing of the past. The conversation had been simple, but effective.</p><p>After thanking Gran and Gramps and promising to bring them to the new house soon, I practically sprinted to the car. I wanted to fly back to the house. Getting Melissa there so she could work this bullshit out with Dean was my number one priority. I couldn\u2019t wait for them to finally be together. We made it home in record time while I kept conversation to a minimum, not daring to mess up the magic that Gran and Gramps had worked on Melissa.</p><p>I pulled the car into the driveway a little too fast, and pulled the emergency brake before hopping out.</p><p>Jack walked into the garage as Melissa got out of the car. \u201cWhere\u2019d you two run off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had some business to take care of. Where\u2019s Dean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cHe left. He has a date tonight or some such shit,\u201d he said, looking at Melissa as he said the damning words.</p><p>Melissa caved in on herself then; she almost crumbled. If a person could break into little pieces and fall to the ground like glass, I knew I was about to witness it.</p><p>\u201cHe has a date?\u201d I shouted. \u201cWith who? Call him! Stop him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Where have you guys been?\u201d Jack narrowed his eyes.</p><p>I placed a hand on my hip, and said pointedly, \u201cI took her to see Gran and Gramps. We needed to talk it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, did you? Talk it out, I mean?\u201d Jack\u2019s gaze drifted to Melissa, and his eyes widened a little as he noticed her bloodshot eyes and reddened nose.</p><p>\u201cShe did,\u201d I answered for her. \u201cBut we need Dean here. Right now. He can\u2019t go on a date without hearing this first. He has to know!\u201d</p><p>I was losing it. My control, my patience, all of it. If Dean went on this date and we allowed Melissa to sleep on everything she\u2019d learned today, she might wake up tomorrow and decide not to ever tell him. And all this progress would be for nothing. I needed these two to finally get together. Not only because she was my best friend and he was my brother-in-law, but because they were well suited for each other and we all knew it. I wanted more than anything for them to at least try. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you want me to call my brother?\u201d Jack asked, his voice filled with confusion. \u201cAnd tell him to cancel his date and come back over here? Am I getting this right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget it!\u201d I said with frustration. \u201cI\u2019ll call him myself.\u201d I reached for my phone, pressed Dean\u2019s name, and hit the CALL button.</p><p>Nerves shot through me as I pushed Melissa into the house and pointed at the vodka. Jack shrugged his shoulders and I rolled my eyes. I grabbed a shot glass from the cabinet as Dean picked up. Slamming the glass on the granite countertop, I glared at Jack as I pointed at the vodka and then at my trembling best friend.</p><p>\u201cDean, hey! Thank you so much for all your help today, but you left something here. Can you come back and get it?\u201d I had no idea why I lied, but it seemed right at the time.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did I leave there? I didn\u2019t bring anything.\u201d</p><p>I scrambled, waving my hands in the air silently begging for help, but no one moved or made a sound. \u201cI, uh, had a gift for you. But it will go bad if you don\u2019t come get it.\u201d My face twisted with each lie that spilled from my mouth.</p><p>\u201cSis, I\u2019m getting ready to pick up a date. I\u2019ll be late if I come by there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to me right now, Dean. I\u2019m pregnant, emotional, and out of control. If you do not get over here in the next ten minutes,\u201d I paused for half a second to think it through before clarifying, \u201cwithout your date, I will hang you by your balls the next time I see you. Understood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019m on my way.\u201d</p> <p>I ended the call without saying another word. Glancing at Melissa, I noticed the empty shot glass and smiled. \u201cGood girl. A little liquid courage never hurts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, Cass,\u201d Melissa breathed out on a moan. \u201cWhat am I gonna say to him?\u201d</p><p>Jack cleared his throat. \u201cIs anyone going to tell me what the hell is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d I said with a smirk toward Jack before looking into Melissa\u2019s bright blue eyes. \u201cAnd as for you. You will tell him everything we talked about at Gran and Gramps\u2019. Just be honest.\u201d</p><p>Pouring myself a glass of water, I sat on one of our new barstools and waited for the sound of Dean\u2019s Mustang to pull into the driveway. If it felt like forever to me, I could only imagine how Melissa must have felt.</p><p>The rumble of his engine alerted us to his arrival. I opened the large garage door as Dean rushed through it and into the house through another connecting door. I closed the large garage door behind him and stepped back into the kitchen where we had all gathered. His eyes scanned quickly over the three of us, all but skipping Melissa\u2019s face.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m here,\u201d he huffed out, the smell of his cologne filling the kitchen area as I silently thanked the pregnancy gods for not making it nauseate me. Dean looked hot in his dark blue jeans. He had on a fitted black T-shirt underneath a dark blue and black button-down shirt that wasn\u2019t buttoned. \u201cIs anyone going to tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>I waited for Melissa to speak up, move, or do something. Her fingers tapped out a noiseless tune on the rim of her glass as she stared at the floor and refused to look up.</p><p>Tired of waiting, I snapped my fingers in front of her face, forcing her to acknowledge me. When her broken eyes met mine, I wanted to take her into my arms and comfort her. She opened and closed her mouth a couple of times, as if she wanted to say something, but no words came out.</p><p>You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.</p><p>Never in all the years I\u2019d known Melissa had I ever seen her like this before, and I wondered if it were a side of her she\u2019d always kept to herself. She\u2019d obviously clammed up, so I guessed it was up to me to poke her with a sharp stick.</p><p>\u201cI called you back here, Dean, because I thought Melissa had something to tell you. But I guess I was wrong.\u201d It was a little harsh and I knew it, but game time was over and I only wanted to help.</p><p>Dean\u2019s gaze snapped to Melissa and I saw what looked like hope flash in his eyes. He raised his eyebrows in her direction, but neither spoke a word.</p><p>I glanced at Jack, who had leaned against the wall, his arms folded and his feet crossed at the ankle. He kept his mouth shut and pinged his gaze between Dean and Melissa, clearly fascinated by what was unfolding. I had to laugh a little to myself, thinking that he was probably partially thankful that the drama had nothing to do with us for once.</p> <p>Dean nodded slowly, and said to Melissa, \u201cSo, is that true? Do you have something to tell me, or are we just going to stand here all night? Because if it\u2019s the latter, then I have a date to go apologize to.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s face paled and tightened as her stubborn defensive nature took over. She narrowed her reddened eyes and snapped, \u201cGo then. You shouldn\u2019t keep her waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Dean shouted. \u201cIs this a joke? Goddammit, woman, if you have something to say to me, just say it already!\u201d</p><p>She stomped across the kitchen to stop in front of Dean and glare up at him, her tiny frame dwarfed by his. Then Melissa grabbed his shirtsleeve and dragged him out of the kitchen and into the garage without shutting the door.</p><p>Knowing I should grab Jack and walk away to give the couple their privacy, I planted my feet on the kitchen floor and leaned toward the open door instead. Eavesdropping might have been a crappy thing to do, but I had a lot invested in this conversation and was dying to hear it.</p><p>My husband obviously felt the same, because he wrapped his arm around me and pulled me against his body as he leaned toward the garage as well. \u201cI\u2019m not moving, so don\u2019t even ask. I want to hear this shit,\u201d he whispered against my ear.</p><p>I turned my head and planted a kiss on his soft lips. That single peck fanned the embers of lust inside me, causing them to erupt. Instantly, I wanted to drag him to the bedroom and christen it right the fuck now, but I shook my head to douse the flames, and concentrated on what was happening in the garage.</p><p>\u201cSo, what is this big news you have to tell me?\u201d Dean attempted to sound tough, but I knew he had to be dying inside.</p><p>\u201cI need you to stop being so mean right now,\u201d Melissa begged. \u201cPlease? This is really hard for me.\u201d</p><p>I wished I could see Dean\u2019s face. Or at least his hazel eyes. I imagined them instantly softening with her words.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stop,\u201d he replied.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She sucked in a long breath before letting it out slowly. \u201cFirst, I just want you to know that I do like you, Dean. I always have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou like me, like me?\u201d he interrupted, his tone surprised, and I had to stop myself from giggling at his word choice.</p><p>\u201cSo much,\u201d she said, then paused as it sounded like she was pacing across our garage floor.</p><p>Jack poked me in the shoulder, his eyes wide with excited shock. I nodded with a tight-lipped grin as Melissa continued, \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry for everything. The way I acted and pretending like I didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you pretend? You fucking crushed me in New York. Why would you do that?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice was pained as he referred to their trip to visit us several months before.</p><p>\u201cI just got scared,\u201d she said in a small voice.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I squeezed Jack\u2019s arm as I waited for her response. Pressing my lips against his face, I whispered into Jack\u2019s ear, \u201cThis is killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>Minutes of continued silence passed, deafening us all with the possibilities not yet spoken.</p><p>\u201cMelissa,\u201d Dean said, his voice finally breaking through the quiet. \u201cScared of what? You have to tell me. Please. Don\u2019t close off now.\u201d</p><p>Footsteps shuffled outside our line of vision and I held my breath.</p><p>\u201cPlease. I want to know,\u201d Dean pleaded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Jack\u2019s brother and I\u2019m Cassie\u2019s best friend. We\u2019re going to be in each other\u2019s lives forever. I was afraid that if we tried to be together and it didn\u2019t work out, it would ruin everything. That everything would be awkward and uncomfortable. And one of us would eventually have to leave, and well, it\u2019s not going to be you, because you\u2019re freaking related to Jack. So it would be me. I\u2019d get kicked out of the group because you and I tried to love each other and it didn\u2019t work out. So then I wouldn\u2019t have only lost you, but my best friend and her baby too.\u201d</p><p>Jack caught my eye and whispered angrily, \u201cWhat am I, chopped liver? She\u2019d lose me too!\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head at his narcissistic view of the world, I shot an elbow into his ribs to shut him up.</p><p>Back in the garage, Dean laughed. \u201cIs that it?\u201d he said to tease Melissa, and I couldn\u2019t stop the small laugh that escaped my lips.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, is that it? That\u2019s everything, Dean. Cassie\u2019s my best friend. Do you know how important that is to a girl? I can\u2019t lose her. I can\u2019t lose you both.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my best friend crying pained me. Jack knew I wanted to go in there and comfort her, so he tightened his grip on my body. \u201cLet them work this out,\u201d he reminded me with a soft kiss to the back of my head.</p><p>Dean\u2019s voice was soothing as he said, \u201cI know how important your friendship is to both of you. I\u2019d never come between you. You know I\u2019d never want that.\u201d When he finished, more shuffling sounds filtered through the open door.</p><p>\u201cOf course you wouldn\u2019t want it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. Even by just talking about this, we\u2019re opening up something we can\u2019t take back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to take it back,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cYou say that now.\u201d Melissa sniffed, sounding so pitiful my heart broke a little more for her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say that always. I want to be with you. I\u2019ve always wanted to be with you. Why are you so convinced we won\u2019t last?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not convinced,\u201d she replied. \u201cI\u2019m just worried. I\u2019m a planner. Us not working out can\u2019t be part of the plan because it ruins the rest of my plans.\u201d</p><p>Jack gave me a questioning look and I shrugged. I honestly had no idea what plans she referred to.</p><p>Dean laughed and Melissa sobbed a little louder, then whined, \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you. I\u2019m in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re,\u201d she paused, her voice catching, \u201cin love with me? Even after everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d eventually come around,\u201d he said confidently. \u201cI just got really tired of waiting and getting shot down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hoped. I hoped a lot,\u201d he admitted and I smiled at the sound of it. \u201cSo, can we do this now? You and me? Can we make this happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do I have to tell you the same thing? I want this. I want this now. I\u2019ll want this tomorrow. I\u2019ll want this forever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t be sure.\u201d</p><p>Dean sighed. \u201cMelissa, I\u2019m so convinced we\u2019ll last until we die, that I\u2019d bet money on it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh yeah? What kind of money?\u201d she asked in such a normal voice that I couldn\u2019t stop my laughter from bursting free. \u201cHey!\u201d she called out to us. \u201cI hear you in there. Eavesdroppers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTakes one to know one!\u201d I shouted in response before hearing the familiar sounds of kissing.</p><p>I smacked Jack\u2019s shoulder again and pulled from his grip to creep toward the door that separated the kitchen from the garage. Peeking around the door, the sight I saw made me cover my face with my hands. The sight of them actually kissing in public, well, at least in front of other people, was bizarre after the history they\u2019ve had.</p><p>I resisted the temptation to light off fireworks, or hire a band. We\u2019d all waited so long for this to happen, I wanted the whole world to know it finally had. When I turned to walk back to Jack, neither one of us could stop grinning. He opened his arms and I fell into them, kissing each dimple once before finding his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cI am so happy for them! My God, can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>His tongue teased my bottom lip before begging for entry into my mouth. I complied, letting the beer-flavored taste of him consume me.</p><p>\u201cJeez, you two, get a room,\u201d Melissa teased, and I pulled away from my husband to see her wrapped in Dean\u2019s arms.</p><p>I gave a little huff. \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk. You two need the room. You have a lot of make-up sex to have,\u201d I teased as Dean perked up.</p><p>\u201cI like that idea. I think she\u2019s right.\u201d Dean looked down at my fun-sized best friend and kissed her.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a date to get to?\u201d Jack asked pointedly, like a smartass.</p><p>Dean winced. \u201cI think I\u2019m late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you at least canceled and the poor girl isn\u2019t sitting at home wondering where you are?\u201d I pinned him with the \u201cmom\u201d look I\u2019ve been practicing lately in the mirror, and he chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWho do you think I am? Jack?\u201d</p><p>Melissa shook her head, then sucked in a breath before admitting, \u201cI hope you\u2019re done dating other people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re done dating anyone. Ever. \u2018Cause it\u2019s never happening for you again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d she fired back, my little spitfire reemerging, which made me very happy. A meek and broken Melissa was so not the girl I knew and loved.</p><p>\u201cDeny it all you want,\u201d Dean told her. \u201cBe scared all you want. I\u2019ll be here to remind you. This is the real deal right here. Me and you?\u201d he said, drawing a finger between the two of them. \u201cThis is gonna last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is really happening? The two of you are finally a flipping couple! Am I dreaming?\u201d I walked over to Melissa and hugged her before doing the same to Dean.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not, but I think I am,\u201d Melissa said dryly.</p><p>Jack opened the fridge and pulled out two beers. \u201cTime to man up. Drink,\u201d he said, tossing a can at Dean. \u201cFun-Size, you need another shot of liquid courage? Not that it helped.\u201d</p><p>Dean looked down at her, a playful smile on his face. \u201cYou did shots before I got here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCorrection, I did a shot. One. And yeah. I thought I was going to throw up on your shoes if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He wiggled his right foot. \u201cI like these shoes.\u201d</p> <p>I hopped up on the counter, my legs and feet dangling over the side. \u201cHey, I have a question.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s perfect little eyebrows drew together as she asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile Jack was eavesdropping on you guys, and I couldn\u2019t help but overhear because I refuse to leave his side,\u201d I said innocently as Jack poked me in the ribs. \u201cWhat did you mean about all your plans? Or the rest of your plans or something?\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together before blurting out, \u201cIt\u2019s all wrapped up in the same thing. The breakup. I lose him first,\u201d she said, pointing at Dean before continuing. \u201cThen I lose my best friend. And then I lose her kids. And so that means that I don\u2019t get to have kids with you and our kids won\u2019t be best friends and we won\u2019t move next door to each other or raise our babies together or do any of the things that I completely plan on doing with you. Because that\u2019s what best friends do. We have kids together and shop together and our families grow up together.\u201d</p><p>I tried to kick her, but my foot wouldn\u2019t reach that far and I refused to hop down from the counter. \u201cYou\u2019re a dork. Just marry Dean and then we can do all those things, \u2018kay?\u201d</p><p>Dean looked down at Melissa and squeezed her shoulders. \u201cYeah, just marry me. Problem solved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d she practically screamed.</p><p>\u201cSo am I!\u201d Dean yelled back.</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Jack pressed his hands around each side of my stomach as if the baby\u2019s ears were there. \u201cYou\u2019re going to stress out my baby. And I\u2019ll fucking kill both of you if you do that. Don\u2019t shout around my kid,\u201d he said forcefully, and I rolled my eyes. \u201cIf our baby comes out rolling his eyes, Kitten, so help me God\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? So help you God, what? What are you going to do?\u201d I shot back playfully.</p><p>Jack slammed his fist against the granite. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I\u2019ll think of something to torture you with!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou two are ridiculous,\u201d Melissa said as she snuggled closer into Dean\u2019s arms.</p><p>I stuck my tongue out at her and she did the same. \u201cYou,\u201d I pointed at her, \u201care not ever allowed to say that to anyone. Ever. You\u2019re the most ridiculous couple I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gonna let her talk to us like that, Melis?\u201d Dean taunted.</p><p>Melissa narrowed her eyes playfully. \u201cYou want me to hit a pregnant chick?\u201d She made a fist and punched her other hand with it.</p><p>Jack stepped into the space separating us. \u201cI will hurt you, Fun-Size. No one messes with my baby mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, how long have you been waiting to use that line?\u201d I doubled over laughing, along with everyone else.</p><p>\u201cWeeks,\u201d he admitted with a dimpled smile before stepping between my legs.</p><p>I love those dimples.</p><p>I hope our baby has those dimples.</p><p>\u201cI almost forgot, I have something for you.\u201d Jack perked up and disappeared into the garage. I heard one of the car doors open and close, then Jack walked back into the kitchen.</p><p>He tossed a small package at me and I caught it with both hands. \u201cWhat in the world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust open it.\u201d</p><p>I peeled back the wrapping paper to reveal a small cardboard box. When I opened the top and looked inside, I gasped with surprise, then pulled out a miniature mason jar filled with quarters.</p><p>Jack beamed at me. \u201cThose are for all the belly touches. I\u2019m going to be touching your belly a lot. I figured I oughta pay up.\u201d</p><p>Shaking my head in amazement, I glanced around the room at some of the various jars proudly displayed, each jar filled to be brim with quarters, and representing different times in our lives. The original jar he gave me in college sat in our bedroom, untouched.</p><p>I\u2019d taken the jars of quarters from when he asked to be traded to the Mets and placed them in my new home office. They reminded me of everything he sacrificed to win me back, and looking at them made me happy. There were other various-sized jars from throughout our years in New York, when we refused to spend them. We collected every quarter that came into our possession. And now we\u2019d be starting our California collection. I knew right where this miniature mason jar would be displayed: our baby\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cI think you still have a few touches left from the other quarters,\u201d I reminded him, waving my arm in the direction of one of the jars in the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou can never be too safe. Can you, baby?\u201d He pressed his lips against my stomach and I rubbed the top of his head, feeling more content than ever.</p><p>Happy Birthday</p><p>Jack and I finished moving into our Newport Beach house without any issues, and I found myself stunned every morning when I opened my eyes and could see the ocean from our bedroom window. The beauty floored me and I prayed I\u2019d never get used to it or take it for granted.</p><p>Matteo and Trina had their baby girl in November. They named her Adalynn, and I flew to New York in January to photograph them for the magazine. The pictures turned out stunning, but it didn\u2019t hurt when all three of your subjects were gorgeous. They were set to be the featured article online, as well as in print in one of the summer issues.</p><p>Trina was thrilled to see me and my growing belly, and she couldn\u2019t wait to give me all sorts of tips and tricks to stay comfortable and fit during the pregnancy. She was obsessed with pillows and told me I needed at least eight. Who needed eight pillows to sleep? I laughed, but she made me promise to buy more.</p><p>She also talked about maternity yoga and prenatal massages, and basically refused to acknowledge the fact that I wasn\u2019t a freaking supermodel before the baby and I sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to be one after. But I missed her. And I made her promise she\u2019d come visit.</p><p>Matteo squeezed me and rubbed my belly when he saw me at the airport. He was happy to see me, but he admitted he wished that Jack could have come too. It was too close to spring training for the pitchers and catchers, so Jack stayed behind to pack and get ready. \u201cIt\u2019s like old times,\u201d Matteo said while driving me to their apartment, and I almost started crying. It felt amazing to be in the city, but so much had changed in such a short amount of time.</p><p>As hard as it had been to leave, I knew without a doubt that I didn\u2019t belong there anymore. At least, not right now. Plus, I couldn\u2019t see raising a kid in Manhattan. Being in the city as an adult felt like one thing, but raising a child in a city that busy and bustling seemed like another. I supposed when it came down to it, I was a California girl through and through. I liked the suburbs, with their front and back yards, and neighbors you actually came to know.</p><p>I walked through the sea of red-clad Angel fans, my stomach protruding like I was smuggling in a beach ball under my maternity top. Silently, I cursed Jack, wishing that I had been smart enough to time my pregnancy with an off-season due date. But then again, we hadn\u2019t really planned it anyway.</p><p>Making my way into the players\u2019 wives section, I smiled at my new companions and forced my growing body into the tiny green stadium seat. I looked down the aisle at Ashley, the ridiculously cute blonde wife of one of the veterans. She was the queen bee of the wives on this team, their Kymber, but minus the horrible attitude. Every team probably had their own Kymber, but I never wanted to be her. At least Ashley hadn\u2019t treated me badly when I first arrived. I wasn\u2019t sure if it was because Jack had already paid his dues in the organization, or if it was because we were married and I didn\u2019t work, but I didn\u2019t care. Whatever created less drama and stress in my everyday life was good enough for me.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling, Cassie?\u201d Ashley smiled from behind her oversized sunglasses.</p><p>I rested my hands on top of my huge belly. \u201cLike a whale,\u201d I huffed out. This kid was heavy. My lower back hurt and my ankles were swollen. Not like I could see my ankles anymore, but I could feel them.</p><p>How come no one ever warned you that one day you\u2019d look down for your feet and they\u2019d be gone? One day out of the blue, my feet disappeared beneath the oversized growth in my stomach and I freaked out. No matter how hard I tried to see them, I couldn\u2019t. It was scary to lose your feet. I decided right then and there that the next time someone I knew got pregnant, I would warn them, One day you\u2019ll wake up and your feet will be gone. Do you need a pedicure? Are your feet dry? Who knows, because you can\u2019t see them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The freakiness of losing my feet was one thing, but losing the private part of me was another. That had disappeared earlier, but it was still traumatic. Jack laughed at me when I told him I had no idea what was going on down there. He promised to keep an eye on it for me. How comforting.</p><p>The sound of someone shuffling to the seat next to me stopped me from feeling sorry for myself. I turned to see a girl I didn\u2019t recognize. The poor thing, she looked terrified.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said softly, her long brown hair falling in front of her brown eyes as she directed her gaze toward the field in front of us.</p><p>\u201cHi. You must be new.\u201d I hesitated, wondering if this girl was actually the girlfriend of someone on the team, or just a weekend fling. I\u2019d seen enough girls come and go over the years that I finally understood why the other wives tended to keep their distance, but it still didn\u2019t explain the outright nastiness once they knew the girl belonged to one of the players. There was no acceptable reason for that kind of behavior.</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cMy boyfriend just got called up from the Salt Lake City team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat position does he play?\u201d I hoped he wasn\u2019t a pitcher. Don\u2019t ask me why, since I knew the team\u2019s roster carried more pitchers than any other position on the team. I think it boiled down to my being scared for Jack. The whole thing with the Mets had scarred me. I\u2019d learned the hard way how disposable and replaceable the players were once they no longer fit the team\u2019s long-term goals.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a catcher,\u201d she said, and I recognized the pride beaming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you guys been dating?\u201d I asked. She looked so young. A lot younger than I knew I looked when Jack was called up.</p><p>\u201cA few years. We\u2019re high school sweethearts.\u201d A breath escaped as she glanced down at my belly. \u201cAnd you? Who\u2019s your husband?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m Cassie,\u201d I answered, extending my hand toward hers. She grabbed it for a firm shake. \u201cJack Carter\u2019s my husband. And he did this to me.\u201d I looked down at my monstrosity with chagrin as she giggled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Shawna. It\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie? Cassie!\u201d Ashley\u2019s voice interrupted our conversation and I turned my sunglass-covered face toward hers.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come sit next to me,\u201d she said coyly, patting the empty seat to her right.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, thanks,\u201d I told her. \u201cI probably won\u2019t stay the whole game.\u201d I\u2019d stopped sitting for Jack\u2019s entire games as soon as it got too uncomfortable to stay in those chairs for almost three hours. A few times I\u2019d snuck downstairs into the tunnels, where it was cool, to wait for Jack. Even if the weather hadn\u2019t warmed up entirely, this baby kept me plenty heated.</p> <p>\u201cAre you going to switch seats?\u201d Shawna asked.</p><p>\u201cNah. I\u2019m fine right here. A word of advice\u2014don\u2019t take it personally if the other wives don\u2019t go out of their way to play nice at first. It\u2019s just what they do until your boyfriend has paid his dues to the team.\u201d I wanted to warn her that the other women wouldn\u2019t be as kind as I was. And since she and her boyfriend had been together since they were kids, I feared she wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to handle it.</p><p>She glanced past me at the rows of other women and shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with worse. The girls that tried to come on to Bryce while he was playing in the minor leagues were disgusting. They were relentless and disrespectful. At least these women aren\u2019t trying to take him away from me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded in understanding. \u201cOh, Shawna, you have no idea. Remind me one day to tell you our story. But not now. I\u2019m way too tired.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a pretty smile at me. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d</p><p>During the seventh inning stretch, I stood up and walked around the stadium. My aching feet were no match for my lower back; I needed to walk it off. Heading down the stairs, I marched through the concrete hallway toward the locker room. Hoping that Jack would shower quickly and not leaving me standing out here for long, I rubbed my back and concentrated on breathing. Robert, the security guard, sat on a metal folding chair, watching me.</p><p>\u201cAny day now, right, Mrs. Carter?\u201d he asked as he removed his ball cap and scratched the top of his balding head.</p><p>\u201cWith any luck,\u201d I said, smiling.</p> <p>He nodded. \u201cWell, you look fantastic. Absolutely glowing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Robert. That\u2019s kind of you to say.\u201d I continued to smile, but doubted his words. I knew I looked like a freaking cow, and who knew what my feet looked like since I\u2019d lost them.</p><p>The quiet tunnel became noisy as the rest of the wives and girlfriends started to file in around me. A moment later, Jack burst through the doors and headed right for me.</p><p>\u201cHello, Kitten,\u201d he purred in my ear before falling to his knees and kissing my belly. \u201cHello, baby.\u201d He had started doing this after every game and I loved it; we didn\u2019t care who watched.</p><p>\u201cDid you shower? The other wives just got here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need, since I didn\u2019t play today, and I know how uncomfortable you are. I don\u2019t want you sitting out here waiting for me when I can shower at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d I said with relief, sincerely happy with his thoughtfulness.</p><p>\u201cAnything for my girl. And my boy.\u201d He smiled, his dimples appearing. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy back hurts, but otherwise I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed my hand in his and I waddled a step behind him. Yes, I waddled; my new form of locomotion could no longer be considered walking. Once we entered the parking lot, Jack slowed his pace before popping the trunk of our black BMW and unlocking the doors. He opened the passenger door for me and helped me inside before tossing his bag into the back of the car.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to stop anywhere on the way home?\u201d he asked, referring to my frequent late-night cravings.</p><p>Lately, I\u2019d become obsessed with a very specific kind of Popsicle. I think I started eating about ten a day. And then there was the phase where I had to have cereal for every meal.</p><p>I reached for his leg and placed my hand on his thigh. \u201cWe have a freezer full of popsicles and a pantry full of cereal. I think I\u2019m good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d he said before stepping on the gas.</p><p>Jack\u2019s free hand moved from holding mine to resting on my giant belly. He rubbed in slow, circular motions and the heat that radiated from his hand to my stomach soothed me. A swift kick caused Jack to pull his hand away.</p><p>\u201cHe kicked me!\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI know. I felt that.\u201d I glanced down and noticed the baby inside me moving parts of his body. He twisted and turned as my stomach took on odd shapes to accommodate his growing length. \u201cI know it\u2019s supposed to be miraculous and stuff, but seeing a body part poke out of my stomach is weird. And kind of creepy. I feel like there\u2019s an alien inside me.\u201d</p><p>Jack glanced at me before turning onto the freeway. \u201cI think it\u2019s awesome. Do you have any idea how cool it is that you get to grow a person inside you? Guys can\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit, they can\u2019t! Guys couldn\u2019t handle it,\u201d I teased.</p><p>He nodded and raised his eyebrows meaningfully as he said with complete seriousness, \u201cNo guy wants to birth a bowling ball out of his penis.\u201d</p><p>I muffled a giggle. \u201cDid you just say the word penis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to watch my language in front of the alien baby, okay? No guy wants to birth a bowling ball out of his dick. Better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMuch.\u201d I sighed, and angled my body toward his as the car raced toward home.</p><p>I must have fallen asleep on the short ride home because when I opened my eyes, Jack was carrying me up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBabe, you\u2019re going to break your back.\u201d Embarrassed, I tried to wiggle out of his arms but he tightened his hold.</p><p>\u201cCan you not try to jump out of my arms while I\u2019m walking up the stairs? Jesus, Kitten.\u201d Once we reached the top, he gently placed me on my feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I attempted to wrap my arms around him, but couldn\u2019t reach anymore. The size of my stomach had grown so large, it stopped me from getting close to anyone.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s cock-blocking me already,\u201d Jack said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last time,\u201d I teased.</p><p>Jack smacked my ass and I yelped. \u201cGo get in bed. I want you off your feet. Carter\u2019s orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes sir.\u201d I gave him a snappy salute before disappearing into the bedroom.</p><p>I woke up with Jack\u2019s hand firmly on my side. The last few weeks I\u2019d been sleeping fitfully, waking up every few hours to pee and adjust the plethora of pillows stacked around my body. Trina had been right about them and they were lifesavers, tucked underneath my stomach, between my legs, and behind my back.</p><p>Standing to walk to the bathroom, I felt water dripping down my leg.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>I tried to hold my bladder, but I couldn\u2019t. Shuffling into the bathroom, I sat down on the toilet and the water gushed. My heart started to race as I realized that I wasn\u2019t peeing at all\u2014my water had just broken.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d I yelled from behind the bathroom door. I heard him rustling in the bed, but he didn\u2019t respond. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten? Where are you?\u201d His voice sounded groggy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the bathroom, Jack. It\u2019s time. I\u2019ll be out in a second.\u201d I waited for the water to stop flowing as thoughts of this is really happening flooded my mind. When I walked out of the bathroom, I found Jack dressed and sitting on the bed, waiting for me.</p><p>He immediately hopped up and rushed toward me. \u201cAre you okay? Are you sure it\u2019s time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy water just broke. We should go. Can you grab the overnight bag?\u201d At my doctor\u2019s insistence, I had a bag packed for weeks now that included some clothes for me as well as clothes to bring the baby home in.</p><p>He lifted an arm and proudly displayed the packed bag, \u201cAlready grabbed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seriously impress me,\u201d I said as a contraction tore through my insides. Bending over and grabbing at my stomach, I groaned and breathed through the pain.</p><p>Jack was instantly behind me, rubbing my back. \u201cKitten, are you okay?\u201d He dropped to his knees to look up into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll be okay. I promise. What can I do?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like to see me in any kind of pain, and the hurt it caused him to be unable to help made me feel even worse. When the contraction passed, I stood up straight and nodded at him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to change. They\u2019ll make me get out of all this anyway.\u201d I waved a hand over my pajamas.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful. Let\u2019s go as soon as you\u2019re ready.\u201d He tugged at his hair like he always does when he\u2019s nervous, pulling at it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d I forced a smile to help ease his nerves.</p><p>Jack\u2019s hand found my stomach as he whispered, \u201cPlease stop hurting your mommy. Daddy can\u2019t take it and it\u2019s making him crazy.\u201d His lips found mine and he pressed the softest kiss against them. \u201cLet\u2019s go have this baby.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He walked me to the garage and around the side of our Jeep Grand Cherokee before opening the door for me and helping me in. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we taking the Bimmer?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I like the idea of being in an SUV instead of a car right now.\u201d</p><p>When he scooted into the driver\u2019s seat, he reached for my seat belt first, fastening it around my stomach before putting on his own. I focused on my breathing, paranoid that another contraction could come at any minute.</p><p>I pulled out my phone, which I\u2019d managed to grab on my way out the door, and typed a group text to my mom, Gran, Dean, and Melissa.</p> <p>On our way to the hospital. Water broke. Text you when I get settled and know our room number.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is really happening. I mean, of course I knew it would happen eventually, but it\u2019s weird.\u201d I breathed slowly in and out as Jack drove through our gated neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d he asked, resting a hand on my knee.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like I got so used to being this enormous beast that I guess at some point I figured I\u2019d always be this way. Like I\u2019d be pregnant forever. But now that my water broke, it\u2019s like holy shit, we\u2019re going to have a baby! I don\u2019t know what to do with a baby,\u201d I squeaked out, starting to freak out. Jack laughed at my irrationality. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh at me, damn it. It\u2019s not like you\u2019ll even be around.\u201d</p><p>That stopped Jack\u2019s laughter immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me to quit baseball? I\u2019ll fucking quit tomorrow,\u201d he offered, his tone serious.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t want you to quit baseball. But don\u2019t make fun of me when I\u2019m freaking out, Jack. \u2018Cause I\u2019m freaking out,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to do with babies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be great, Kitten. You\u2019ll be amazing. And if you end up needing help, we\u2019ll hire a nanny. Hell, I\u2019ll hire you one for every day of the week if it helps. Whatever makes you happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not want someone else raising our child! Are you crazy?\u201d I started to yell. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m working anymore, so there\u2019s no reason I should need a freaking nanny to help me be a mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. No nanny.\u201d He glanced at me and then focused on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how things work out, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so unhappy about the trade at first, you know? But look at how it all worked out. You ended up being pregnant and we got to move home. Most of the guys aren\u2019t that lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the guys don\u2019t want to be that lucky. They like having their wives and kids in other cities. That way they can cheat without getting caught,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cWhoa. Pregnancy\u2019s changed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth.\u201d He glanced at me with a raised eyebrow, surprised that I was completely in agreement, and I laughed. \u201cI feel like a crazy person. Get this thing out of me.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed my thigh. \u201cYou have Gran and your mom,\u201d he said, then paused and added, \u201cAnd Melissa. And my brother. We have a whole team here ready to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d I said, starting to settle down. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be okay. I\u2019m just freaking out \u2018cause I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure hope not.\u201d</p> <p>Another contraction ripped through me, causing me to gasp.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice pleaded for a response, but I was too busy counting and trying not to hold my breath. When it ended, I unclenched his hand and he shook it out; apparently I\u2019d been crushing his fingers. \u201cI really don\u2019t like when you get those.\u201d</p><p>He fidgeted behind the steering wheel, his left knuckles almost white from his grip on it. \u201cHow bad do they hurt?\u201d he asked, and then quickly changed his mind. \u201cNo. Don\u2019t tell me. I can\u2019t fucking handle hearing how much pain you\u2019re in.\u201d He huffed as he shook his head, changing his mind. \u201cNo. Tell me. What kind of man doesn\u2019t want to know how much pain his wife is in? The kind who can\u2019t do anything about it!\u201d He slammed his hand against the wheel, his seesawing emotions clearly torturing him.</p><p>\u201cJack, stop. They aren\u2019t that bad, okay? They\u2019re just like sharp cramps. It\u2019s mostly uncomfortable,\u201d I lied. The contractions were getting stronger and longer, but Jack was right. There wasn\u2019t anything he could do for my pain and I didn\u2019t want him flipping out about it. It hurt me to see him react so defensively when it came to me. I reserved the right to protect my man the same way he wanted to protect me. And this was how I could do that, by avoiding the truth.</p><p>Jack glanced over at me, his face full of love and concern before he looked at the road again. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit here next to you while you\u2019re gasping in pain and do nothing. It goes against everything I feel for you. It\u2019s my job to keep you safe and protected. I know it\u2019s illogical for me to think I can stop your labor pains, but my heart fucking feels like it\u2019s going to explode when I hear the sounds you\u2019re making. You being in pain doesn\u2019t fucking work for me, Kitten. It rips me in two the second it starts. It goes against every fiber of my being to sit there and pretend like I don\u2019t want to save you. I\u2019d rather break my own hand again than know you\u2019re hurting.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, comforted by the depth of this man\u2019s love for me. \u201cI understand completely and I love you for it. It\u2019s sexy as hell the way you love me, Jack. But I promise, I\u2019m okay.\u201d</p><p>He pulled our car into the hospital parking lot, grabbed my overnight bag, and helped me out. \u201cI\u2019ll carry you in if you want me to,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really,\u201d I huffed as I waddled slowly. \u201cI can walk.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped a protective arm around me and guided me toward the emergency room doors. Once we were all checked in, Jack demanded a room as quickly as possible, telling anyone who would listen that I was hurting, about to give birth at any second, and I needed to lie down. The nurses tried to calm him while I mouthed an apology to any of them who looked my way. They didn\u2019t seem fazed in the least, as if this type of behavior were an everyday occurrence in their department.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mrs. Carter. My name is Jane and I\u2019ll be your nurse for today. If you\u2019ll follow me, we\u2019ll get you all set up.\u201d The nurse\u2019s hair was meticulously pulled into a tight bun, not a hair out of place, and I found myself mesmerized by this fact. Jack was right. Pregnancy had made me weird.</p><p>\u201cPlease call me Cassie,\u201d I said, waddling behind her tiny frame down the long white corridor.</p><p>She paused in front of a wooden door and waved an arm. \u201cWe\u2019ll be in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one else is in here, right? She has her own room? I asked for a private room.\u201d Jack fired off the questions without taking a breath.</p><p>\u201cYes, Mr. Carter. She will have her own delivery and postnatal room per your request.\u201d</p><p>Jack walked into the room first and looked around, checking it carefully before heading back toward me.</p><p>\u201cSorry, he\u2019s a little, um\u2014\u201d I paused, searching for the right word.</p><p>\u201cNervous?\u201d She smiled. \u201cMost of the first-time dads are,\u201d she said, her voice gentle and comforting as she ushered us into the oversized hospital room.</p><p>Jack\u2019s strong arm guided me forward once again. \u201cIt\u2019s huge in here,\u201d I said, glancing around at the spacious room. The hospital bed was small in size, but the rest of the room was elegantly decorated much like a hotel would be, with bedside tables and a desk.</p><p>A light green couch with a hideaway bed sat under the only window. An oversized brown leather chair sat in one corner of the room, and all I could think about was how cold it looked. I\u2019d never been a big fan of leather. It always creaked and moaned whenever anyone first sat in it.</p><p>Across the room in the other corner rested the most comfortable-looking rocking chair I\u2019d ever seen. It complemented the decor of the room with its neutral tones, entirely covered in thick cushioning. I wanted to sit in that.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you changed and hooked up to the monitors,\u201d Jane said as she pulled back the curtain suspended from the ceiling that surrounded the bed. \u201cThe bathroom\u2019s right through that door behind you. Your gown is folded up on the counter. Remember, the opening goes in the back.\u201d Jane smiled and pointed to the doorway before walking toward one of the machines.</p><p>I entered my private bathroom and changed as quickly as I could. Folding up my pajamas, I brought them out and handed them to Jack. He tossed them onto the couch into a messy pile, and I rolled my eyes.</p><p>Men.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help into the bed?\u201d Jack offered and I waved him off, climbing into it on my own.</p><p>Once I was lying down, I noticed the walls were painted a seafoam green color and it soothed me to look at them. Above my head was a stuffed mock headboard nailed to the wall, flanked by art glass pendant lights on each side. For a hospital room, this was pretty nice.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Jane said efficiently. \u201cI need to get the IV started first.\u201d She poked a large needle into my hand and I winced as soon as the fluids hit my bloodstream.</p><p>Looking up at her, I asked, \u201cIs it normal for that to hurt?\u201d</p><p>Jack tensed and looked hard at Jane, who said quickly, \u201cSome patients report a burning sensation at first. But it should fade in no time.\u201d</p><p>I nodded with surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It\u2019s already gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Now I need to wrap this band around your stomach. It\u2019s a bit uncomfortable because it\u2019s tight. It measures your baby\u2019s heart rate so we can monitor it during labor, as well as your contractions\u2019 length and strength.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d It pinched as she tightened it around the top of my belly.</p><p>\u201cIs that all right?\u201d she asked, cocking her head to one side.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. See the monitor here?\u201d She pointed at the green machine with several small LCD screens to my right. \u201cYou can see when your contractions hit right here. And your baby\u2019s heart rate right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re having?\u201d she asked, looking between Jack and me.</p><p>\u201cWe do.\u201d I smiled at her before turning my head toward Jack, my eyes beginning to tear up. I didn\u2019t subscribe to the whole \u201cwe don\u2019t want to know the gender of our baby\u201d way of thinking. My mind was far too organized for that sort of nonsense and I needed to be prepared for this little person entering our lives. Especially with the chaos that was Jack\u2019s baseball schedule, the idea of any more surprises did not sound appealing.</p><p>Jane continued to hook me up to various things, another monitor on my arm for my heart rate, as well as the prepping for an epidural if I wanted. Just a few days ago, I\u2019d felt like a beached whale. Now I felt like a science experiment with wires coming out of me from all sides. I couldn\u2019t even walk to the bathroom without having to wheel the IV support with me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I looked at Jack, who had moved the leather chair right next to my bed, and smacked my forehead with my hand. \u201cShit. I forgot to text everybody with the room number. Can you send them a text and tell them please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He reached for my phone and stood up. Leaning down to give me a kiss, he whispered, \u201cI love you,\u201d before kissing my belly and telling our baby the same. Then he walked around the curtain and out of my view, and I heard the door open and then pull to a close.</p><p>Two seconds later he was back in the room, a huge dimpled smile lighting up his face. \u201cThey\u2019re already out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d I asked, completely confused.</p> <p>\u201cAll the knuckleheads. They want to come in. Can they?\u201d Jack directed his question toward our nurse, Jane.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cThey can come in until it\u2019s time to deliver. Or,\u201d she pointed at me, \u201cuntil you want them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWarn them that I look like ass!\u201d I shouted toward Jack\u2019s back.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>Our families wasted no time filling up the room, all nervously beaming at me in expectation. My heart filled with love as I looked at them all and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re all here. What if it takes me a hundred hours to have this kid?\u201d</p> <p>My mom walked over to me first, looking incredibly happy as she leaned down and squeezed me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. I\u2019m so excited,\u201d she admitted, and I wanted to cry.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201d I asked, only half-surprised that he wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s traveling for work,\u201d Mom said without meeting my eyes. \u201cHe said he\u2019ll try to get here as soon as he can.\u201d</p><p>I wondered briefly if she believed the lies my dad told. I knew he most likely wouldn\u2019t show up at the hospital, so I assumed she had to know this as well. Maybe she chose to live in denial? I couldn\u2019t care anymore. I had my own family to worry about and take care of.</p><p>My eyes locked on to Melissa\u2019s blue ones, then my gaze traveled down the length of her tiny frame to where her hand intertwined with Dean\u2019s. She made a face at me and I laughed. \u201cGet over here,\u201d I insisted and she dropped Dean\u2019s hand and ran over.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re having a baby,\u201d she said into my hair as she hugged me awkwardly.</p> <p>\u201cI know! I can\u2019t believe it took you ten years to hook up with Dean. You guys look really happy.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back and made a face at me. \u201cHow could you let me be such an idiot for so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, you\u2019re sorta stubborn. And you don\u2019t listen.\u201d I puckered my lips at her.</p><p>\u201cI know. But to think I could\u2019ve been this happy that whole time? I just want to kick myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, you are happy?\u201d I asked, reaching for her hand.</p><p>\u201cThe happiest. I never knew,\u201d she said, then paused to gain her composure. \u201cI just never knew it could be like this.\u201d Her eyes began to glisten, then a few tears spilled over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you. Don\u2019t screw it up,\u201d I whispered, my voice playful.</p><p>\u201cMy turn.\u201d Dean\u2019s voice cut through our whispers. He bumped Melissa out of the way with his hip and leaned down to hug me.</p> <p>Everyone wanted to hug me but I could barely move, so it turned out to be this awkward grab thing that happened instead of a real hug. \u201cHurry up and make me an uncle, would ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to the kid in the belly,\u201d I told him sarcastically. \u201cClearly, I\u2019m ready.\u201d I opened my arms to point to all the machines and monitors attached to my body.</p><p>Dean leaned down to speak directly to my protruding stomach. \u201cCome out, kid. We\u2019re all ready to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Jack faked a cough and Dean stood up straight. \u201cUh-oh, I think I\u2019m pissing off the big guy. How shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStep away from the belly that doesn\u2019t belong to you, little brother,\u201d Jack said in a booming voice.</p><p>\u201cAre you serious?\u201d I called out with attitude, and Jack instantly appeared at my side.</p><p>\u201cVery. Don\u2019t put your lips on my girl\u2019s stomach again unless you want to lose them,\u201d Jack said, and if I knew him, he was only half teasing.</p><p>\u201cYou have issues. You know this, right?\u201d Dean joked back.</p><p>Gran and Gramps joined the Carter family party at my bedside and I finally did cry. \u201cThank you for coming. You didn\u2019t have to get up in the middle of the night to sit around for who knows how long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know we didn\u2019t have to, dear,\u201d Gran said. \u201cBut we wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Gramps added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we have anything else going on. It\u2019s boring at the house without you kids there.\u201d</p><p>I felt bad that everyone I loved was up at this ungodly hour. They couldn\u2019t do anything but wait, but they all assured me there was nowhere else they\u2019d rather be. Honestly, I felt loved and special. It was a wonderful feeling.</p><p>Jane came into the room, glanced at my monitor, then shooed everyone back into the waiting room. And wait they did.</p><p>Jack and I sat alone, hand in hand, as we waited for the doctor to arrive. We watched the monitor, which gave us a heads-up that a contraction was beginning before I could even feel it, then he coached me through the breathing to help me relax so the contractions wouldn\u2019t be quite so painful.</p><p>Eventually the doctor swept into the room, making a grand entrance with a pudgy nurse in tow, and once he took over, the real fun began. After two hours of pushing and panting and a lot of cursing Jack\u2019s existence, our baby was finally born.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a boy!\u201d the pudgy nurse announced. \u201cWould you like to cut the umbilical cord?\u201d she asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d He stood and took the scissors from the nurse, then cautiously snipped where she instructed him to.</p><p>I wanted to act surprised by her words, but I knew he was a boy and had the pictures to prove it. I remembered laughing during one of the ultrasounds our doctor had ordered, when the technician took her stylus and drew an arrow to what was obviously the baby\u2019s penis on the screen, then wrote, I\u2019M A BOY! YAY!!!!!!! When she handed me the photo of the screen capture, I stuck it in my purse and hid it away from our family and friends so they wouldn\u2019t know the sex of the baby. Later that night when I\u2019d called Jack to tell him, I kept waiting for an \u201cI told you so\u201d since he\u2019d been insisting the baby was a boy all along. But he was smart enough to keep that thought to himself.</p><p>Jane took over from there, closing the freshly cut cord with a clip. \u201cThis will turn black and fall off on its own. Don\u2019t freak out when it does.\u201d She placed our wailing bundle of joy onto a tiny scale before swaddling him tightly and putting him into my arms.</p><p>She then grabbed a pen and started to write on a blue-trimmed bassinet card as she said out loud, \u201cApril tenth. Happy birthday to\u2014\u201d She paused and glanced my way, waiting for me to reveal the baby\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cChance. Chance Thomas Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh, I like that,\u201d she cooed. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any Chances yet.\u201d</p><p>Turning my head to the left, I noticed that Jack\u2019s eyes were misty. He tried hard to fight off the tears, his gaze pinging between his newborn son\u2019s face and my own.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I love you so much. You\u2019re amazing. And he\u2019s incredible,\u201d Jack said as he planted soft kisses against my forehead and gently touched the baby\u2019s tiny hand.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s perfect. Aren\u2019t you, Chance?\u201d I tipped his eight-pound-three-ounce body toward my face and I breathed in his sweet baby scent.</p><p>\u201cChance Fucking Carter,\u201d Jack breathed out. \u201cIt has a nice ring to it.\u201d</p><p>I smacked Jack\u2019s shoulder with my free hand as I stared at Chance\u2019s perfect little face. The baby yawned widely, then opened his big blue eyes with incredibly long lashes and grabbed hold of my finger, grasping it firmly in his little hand.</p><p>Holding our baby in my arms for the first time was the most amazing feeling; the enormity of it almost took my breath away. We were parents. Jack Carter and I were officially someone\u2019s mom and dad.</p><p>\u201cWe did this. We made this,\u201d Jack said softly as he stared with pride at his son, no longer concerned with the drops that fell from his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe did. He\u2019s perfect. I love you.\u201d I smiled, my heart filled with so much love I felt like it could burst at any moment and paint the room with it.</p><p>\u201cAre his eyes going to stay blue?\u201d Jack asked as he stared at the baby, and I giggled.</p><p>\u201cProbably not. They could turn brown like yours, or green like mine. We\u2019ll know in a few months,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cMost babies\u2019 eyes are blue when they\u2019re born.\u201d</p><p>I knew I\u2019d felt lucky before, but in this moment, I\u2019d never felt luckier. It was one thing to be blessed enough to actually find the love of your life, when so many people never do. It was something completely different to go through the fiery pits of personal hell with that person, then come through it on the other side and still get to marry them. Nevertheless, it was a blessing on a completely different level to create a whole other person with them. There was no doubt in my mind that nothing in our lives could ever be more beautiful than this moment.</p><p>Before today, I thought I loved Jack with all my heart, but having a child with him changed things. The kind of love I felt for Jack now was more than it ever could have been before today. It was as though my heart instantly multiplied in size and filled itself with more love for the very person I didn\u2019t think I could possibly love any more. Jack and Chance equally held my heart in the palm of their hands.</p><p>I looked at Jack and tears were rolling down his face. Expecting them to be tears of joy, I was surprised to see that he looked somewhat sad. I reached to touch his cheek, wanting to fix whatever was bothering him in this perfect moment. \u201cJack, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>He wiped at his face before staring at me, his chest rising and falling. \u201cI love you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I responded as he put a hand up to stop me.</p><p>\u201cThe moment I looked at our son,\u201d he said with anguish, \u201csomething inside me snapped. Like a light switch turned on or something and filled my heart up completely. It\u2019s a kind of love I don\u2019t know how to describe. See, Kitten, I love you with everything that I am, but it\u2019s like I love him with who I am. Does that make any sense?\u201d He started to fidget and gripped at his hair.</p><p>Smiling, I nodded. \u201cI get it completely, because I feel exactly the same way. I love you both so much, but it\u2019s not the same kind of love. The difference is that I choose to love you, but loving our son isn\u2019t a choice. It simply ... is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. That\u2019s exactly it,\u201d he breathed out, but continued to fidget. Something was hurting him and it killed me to see him in any kind of pain. We were supposed to be celebrating, consumed by happiness, but something was wrong.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and shook his head, as if fighting off personal demons. When his eyes opened, another tear fell. This time he didn\u2019t move to wipe it off. I watched as it traveled the length of his cheek and passed his jawline before falling from his face completely. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Finally, he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t understand. I mean, one look at our son was all it took for me to feel completely consumed by love for him. The need to protect him, fight for him, kill for him, it filled me up the moment he took his first breath.\u201d</p><p>I watched as he talked, not sure the direction his thoughts were taking him. Before I could form a coherent thought, he went on.</p><p>\u201cBut not once have I thought about leaving him. Or walking away. And I just don\u2019t understand how not one of my parents, but both of them, could see me and my brother, have these feelings for us, and then leave us alone. I\u2019d rather die than leave him. Or you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>My heart broke in that moment for my man. Always so strong and determined, it was times like this when Jack\u2019s hidden vulnerability shone through and we both realized how battered his soul truly was. \u201cBabe, I don\u2019t know what to say. Maybe they left because they loved you guys too much?\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head violently. \u201cNo! My dad left and never came back. He didn\u2019t even say good-bye; he just left. And my mother specifically told me it was because we were bad. She made sure I knew damn well why she was choosing to leave. The two of us were so bad, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. That\u2019s not love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she was the bad one?\u201d I ventured. \u201cMaybe she thought once you boys got old enough, you\u2019d see that she wasn\u2019t worth loving? I don\u2019t know, Jack. I don\u2019t know why people do the fucked-up things they do. But I will tell you this\u2014your parents leaving might have been the best thing in the world for you and Dean.\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a disgusted sound and I continued. \u201cJust hear me out. When they left, you got to be raised by two of the best people I\u2019ve ever met in my life. And I know right now, in this beautiful moment, you can\u2019t ever imagine feeling anything other than absolute love for our son, but there will probably come the time when you\u2019ll want to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Jack shot me a glare and I laughed. \u201cNot literally, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be a pain in the ass at some point and it probably won\u2019t be very much fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d still never want to leave,\u201d he insisted. \u201cNo matter how bad he is, I\u2019d never give up like that. I\u2019d never fucking walk away. Not from either of you.\u201d His head lowered as he stared at the floor.</p> <p>\u201cBaby, I know that. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to be such a good dad. He\u2019s lucky to have you as his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand how anyone can just leave. How do you walk away from this feeling and not have guilt consume you piece by piece?\u201d He laid his head on my stomach, his tears wetting the thin sheet between us.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d I reached for him, twisting my fingers through his dark hair, and tried to comfort him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never do that to you. To either of you. I promise,\u201d he said fiercely, his breath hot on my stomach.</p><p>Stroking his hair, I said, \u201cI know that. I believe you. I wouldn\u2019t have married you if I thought you would ever leave.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head to glance up at me. \u201cYou have a lot of faith, Kitten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. I know my man. And I love and trust him. He\u2019s nothing like his parents. He\u2019s not built to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that. Not built to leave. Except when I left you before. I left you before.\u201d His hands covered his face as his past ate away at his happiness.</p><p>I wanted to stop him from reliving all of the nightmares. Especially about Chrystle and the things we\u2019d already gone through. In my opinion, those things were dead and buried and held no meaning anymore.</p><p>\u201cJack,\u201d I said sternly, \u201cthat was a different time and place. You were doing the right thing. Even then, you were trying to do the right thing. None of that matters now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll never leave you again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Okay? I know.\u201d I patted his head, longing to bring him peace.</p><p>\u201cExcept for work,\u201d he said, his words muffled against my stomach. \u201cShit. I\u2019ll be gone all the fucking time for baseball.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a long breath. \u201cI know that too. I knew that when I chose to marry you as well. Stop worrying about all these things, Jack. We\u2019ll make it through.\u201d</p> <p>Jack lifted his head, pinning me with a resolute gaze. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to let either of you down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Stop being so hard on yourself. Look at our baby. He\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s going to worship you and look up to you and want to be a baseball player just like his daddy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m someone\u2019s dad,\u201d he breathed out, his eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d I smiled at Jack with love and longing, wanting nothing more than to be in our new home with our baby. It felt like our lives together, as a family, were just beginning.</p><p>And I couldn\u2019t wait to get started.</p><p>Hard to Have a Family on the Road</p><p>Being a mom was hands down the best thing I\u2019ve done in my life so far. I loved being home with Chance, but it was hard trying to travel with Jack\u2019s team the way I used to when it was just me. It wasn\u2019t easy to pick up and leave for a weekend when you had a baby or a toddler to pack for. So Chance and I pretty much stopped traveling with Jack on his road trips altogether. It was too much for me to have to book our separate travel, rent a car, find the hotel, and then figure out how to get to the ball field, all with a screaming kid in my arms.</p><p>Jack and I began to argue more, until I realized that it was all the traveling that stressed me and made me lash out. Once I stopped trying to be everywhere at once, I felt myself calm down. I realized that I couldn\u2019t be everything to everybody all the time.</p><p>Jack, on the other hand, started to flip out more. He hated that we weren\u2019t on the road with him, but he claimed to understand. I knew, though, that it bothered him more than he let on, he just didn\u2019t want me to feel guilty. It wasn\u2019t that Chance and I weren\u2019t at the games with him that bothered Jack, but the fact that our not going meant that Jack wasn\u2019t around Chance as much as he wanted.</p><p>Being an absentee father was Jack\u2019s worst nightmare. He really struggled with being gone so much, and said on more than one occasion that he felt like he abandoned me during the season. I reminded him that it wasn\u2019t true, but it still ate at him.</p><p>In the meantime, Chance and I tried to make every home game. Thankfully the team provided a day care for the players\u2019 kids during the games, which made attending Jack\u2019s games a lot easier for a few of those years. I could watch him pitch and not be concerned that Chance was bored or hot or not having a good time. He usually didn\u2019t want to leave when the game was over, not until he saw his dad\u2019s face waiting for him at the door. Then our little boy\u2019s eyes, which had turned chocolate-brown just like his father\u2019s, would light up as he sprinted toward his dad\u2019s open arms.</p><p>It was in those moments that I felt my heart melt into a ball of goo. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get tired of watching Jack interact with our son.</p><p>Dean and Melissa got married a few years ago. He proposed to her exactly one year after that night I took her to Gran\u2019s and they finally worked it all out. I secretly worried that Melissa might have doubts and think it was too soon, but she had been smitten with Dean since the second she let him into her heart. Once she had fully committed to him, there was no going back for her. She knew he was the one.</p><p>They got married in December the next year with a lavish ceremony at the Four Seasons. Between her career and Dean\u2019s, it was a celebrity-filled affair, with guests ranging from professional athletes to A-list movie stars. It could not have been more opposite from my wedding with Jack, which is why it took so long to plan. Of course, they planned the ceremony during the off-season so Jack could be in the wedding. In fact, all three of us were in it.</p><p>Chance was the cutest ring bearer I\u2019d ever seen, not to mention a little naughty, but he was a little young for the job. At almost two years old, he toddled over to Gran instead of walking down the aisle. He plopped the pillow onto Gramps\u2019 lap before hopping straight into Gran\u2019s arms and burying his face. When she tried to point at me or Jack and tell him to bring us the pillow, he refused and wrapped his tiny arms around her instead. Gramps met me at the front of the church and handed me the rings.</p><p>I knew my face had turned beet red by that point as I glared at Jack and mouthed, \u201cHe\u2019s your son.\u201d</p><p>Jack mouthed back, \u201cI know,\u201d as I handed the minister the rings.</p><p>Melissa got pregnant almost immediately following their honeymoon, and when they had a little boy they named Coby, another Carter boy had joined the world. I feared for the girls who would have the pleasure of knowing them in the future. Since Chance and Coby were only two and a half years apart, the chances of them going to school together were high. I braced myself for those teenage years and tried not to think about it too hard or I\u2019d never sleep again.</p><p>I thought I would miss working a lot more than I have. We\u2019ve been so blessed to be in the position where I not only don\u2019t have to work, but I could most likely pick right back up from where I left off when I did decide to restart my business.</p><p>Not that I\u2019d be working in New York, of course, but since I was a professional photographer with one hell of a portfolio, I could freelance when I was ready. But that wouldn\u2019t be for quite a while. Nora offered me a one-month gig in France recently, but I turned it down. She said she knew I would, but she wanted to offer it to me anyway.</p><p>Jack encouraged my going to France for the shoot since it was during his off-season, but I refused to leave my boys during those rare months we actually got to be a family unit. Being away from Chance and Jack for that long by choice wasn\u2019t something I was comfortable with. And since I didn\u2019t want to take any work during Jack\u2019s baseball season, I spent my time taking silly pictures of Chance and the ocean outside my office window. Maybe once Chance got older, I might consider traveling for shoots, but maybe not. Only time would tell.</p><p>I still woke up every morning feeling blessed for the opportunity to live in this house. There\u2019d been more than one occasion where I\u2019d walked the beach for hours, allowing my thoughts to get lost in the sand between my feet.</p><p>Chance fell in love with the ocean as soon as he could walk. He would spend all day playing in the sand if I\u2019d let him, and I\u2019ve stopped him from running straight into the water more often than not. No one told me how difficult it was to reason with a child. They simply don\u2019t have the understanding of fear the way we do.</p><p>In some ways I envied Chance\u2019s state of mind. I knew he was a child, but he was fearless and did things that adults would never do simply because he wanted to. The mom in me attempted to balance instituting some fear in him to keep him safe, while also encouraging his desire to try new things and be brave. Being a mom meant that each day I was challenged in a new way. It was the toughest, yet most rewarding job I\u2019d ever have.</p><p>Jack was still playing for the Angels, although there was one year when talks of a trade scared us half to death. The thought of Jack moving to another state for eight months out of the year didn\u2019t sit well with either of us. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Thankfully they were just rumors that were reported nonstop on ESPN and the news, but weren\u2019t based on any facts. It was funny how often that kind of thing happened. So many things got leaked and talked about on the sports channels that had no factual basis at all. Not surprisingly, the mention of \u201ca reliable source\u201d was all those shows needed to give them the leeway to report whatever they wanted.</p><p>One day Jack\u2019s coach pulled him into his office, and Jack told me later that he\u2019d braced for the news, terrified to have to tell me he\u2019d be leaving again. But the coach only called him in to tell him that the rumors were false and they had no intention of letting Jack go.</p><p>\u201cI was so scared when Coach called me in, Kitten. You have no idea,\u201d Jack confessed as we lay in bed that night.</p><p>\u201cOh, I can imagine,\u201d I breathed against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so glad it was only rumors.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be able to say shit like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, bad word.\u201d Chance\u2019s tiny voice surprised us, coming from the doorway of our bedroom.</p><p>Jack and I immediately sat up. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Jack told him. \u201cThat was a bad word. What are you doing up, bud?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had a bad dream,\u201d he confessed, dragging his tattered blue blanket behind him as he walked toward Jack\u2019s side of the bed. \u201cCan I sleep with youse guys?\u201d</p><p>I smiled and scooted away from my husband to make some space between us. \u201cYou bet. Get in here.\u201d Jack reached for him and helped pull him up onto our bed.</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Mommy. Thanks, Daddy.\u201d He scrambled under the blankets and in no time fell back to sleep.</p><p>Jack stared lovingly at our little boy and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m away from you two enough already. If they traded me I would have quit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No, you wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d I insisted. Not because I didn\u2019t want Jack to be home more, but because I didn\u2019t really believe him.</p><p>\u201cThis is my tenth season, Kitten. Full pension after I complete it. I\u2019ve been thinking about it anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking about what? Quitting?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t imagine Jack not playing baseball. All I\u2019d ever known was him being a ball player three hundred sixty-five days a year. It wasn\u2019t something he could turn off when he wasn\u2019t playing. He was always prepped, prepared, and working toward new goals.</p> <p>All his hard work paid off. The amazing thing was, Jack actually did come back as strong as he once was. He was right when he\u2019d insisted that he just needed time to fully heal. These days he consistently threw between ninety-three and ninety-four mile-per-hour pitches, just like before.</p><p>\u201cI think this might be my last season.\u201d</p><p>I sucked in a shocked breath. Hearing those words from him both excited and terrified me. I didn\u2019t want Jack to go back to being who he was when he got hurt. That fear remained, even as I responded, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ll support whatever you decide to do. Just be sure, okay?\u201d I smiled reassuringly and rubbed his arm before turning out the light and snuggling next to our bed-hogging son.</p><p>But my eyes stayed open as my mind whirled, and it was nearly dawn before I fell into a fitful sleep.</p><p>You Miss Out</p><p>It had been five years since Cassie and I extended our family, since the birth of our amazing son, Chance. I loved Cassie more today than I did yesterday. And there was no doubt that I\u2019d love her more tomorrow than I did right now. There seemed to be no end to my love for this girl.</p><p>She made me a better person. She was the mother of my child. There was no way I could explain how this made me feel about her. I only knew that my heart felt like it expanded daily to fit in all the love I had for her.</p><p>Cassie started missing the majority of my games; even the home ones as Chance got older. She did her best to attend every game I was scheduled to pitch for, whether she brought Chance or not. And she only traveled with me if Melissa and Dean watched Chance, but now that he was starting school, she felt extra guilty about leaving him at all.</p> <p>I tried to convince her to bring him to more away games, but it was just too hard for her during the school year. And even when we played at home, it was usually on a weekday and that didn\u2019t fly with her. She insisted on giving Chance as much structure as possible, with a schedule that didn\u2019t include growing up at a ballpark.</p><p>Weekends were a different story, though. Thank God for weekend games. Although now that Chance had started playing Pony baseball, I wasn\u2019t sure how many of my games they\u2019d be able to make.</p><p>I definitely played second string to my son. And you know what? I didn\u2019t mind at all. What I did fucking mind, though, was the fact that I missed out on all these things. My entire life had revolved around being at a baseball stadium, or traveling to one.</p><p>There was no need for anyone to tell me how good I\u2019d had it, because I already knew. But no one ever told you how hard it really was to balance family with a baseball career. You know why they didn\u2019t tell you?</p><p>Because it was impossible.</p><p>There was no balance.</p><p>Baseball won every time.</p><p>Never getting days off to plan or celebrate anniversaries, holidays, or birthdays was one thing when it was just me and Kitten. It still fucking sucked and I felt like a dick, but Cassie never complained. Not once. But it was another thing entirely to miss out on your own kid\u2019s birthday. Every year since he\u2019d been born, I\u2019d missed his party. Sure, I got to relive each one in a series of photographs Cassie had taken. But it wasn\u2019t the same as actually being there.</p><p>Chance was getting ready to start kindergarten the next day. It was his first day of \u201cbig kid\u201d school, as he liked to call it, and I was stuck in some swanky hotel in Arizona. I knew Cassie was fine without me, but I hated missing out on everything. Dialing her number, I couldn\u2019t help but smile when he answered the phone instead of her.</p><p>\u201cHello? Daddy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, bud. Getting ready for school tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh huh. We\u2019re shopping right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I see. Can you put Mommy on the phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, why not?\u201d I stopped myself from laughing.</p><p>\u201c\u2018Cause it\u2019s my turn to talk to you. She always gets to talk to you,\u201d he said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. But I need to tell her one thing and then she\u2019ll give you back the phone, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d His voice sounded deflated as he handed the phone to his mom.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d she said with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you shopping for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my gosh, the school gave us a list of supplies he needs for his class. You should see the size of this thing. I\u2019m walking around the store trying to find all this crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad word!\u201d Chance shouted in the background and Cassie apologized to him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how weird it is to look at him and see you? He has your eyes, Jack. They make me miss you so much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too. I wish I were there. Take pictures of his first day and send them to me. Don\u2019t forget.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d insisted that Cassie do that with everything I missed. My phone\u2019s photo albums were filled with pictures of events and parties that I didn\u2019t get to see in real life, but got to experience via photo text message.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t forget. Chance is pulling on my shirt. He wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Kitten. Miss you,\u201d I said before hearing the fumbling of the phone being passed over.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, guess what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He sucked in a big breath. \u201cI start school tomorrow and Coby is mad because he can\u2019t come with me. He has to be in the baby school still and I get to go with the big kids.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cSo, you\u2019re excited?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep! \u2018Bye, Daddy. I love you,\u201d he said out of nowhere before hanging up on me. I sat on my hotel bed with my jaw slack.</p><p>The little shit.</p><p>My phone immediately beeped with a text.</p><p>Sorry. Guess he was done. LOL. I\u2019ll call you later. Love you.</p><p>Knowing that the list of shit he needed for school fell on Cassie\u2019s shoulders made me feel like a complete asshole. I started to feel like my heart was made of kite string, unraveling into a heap of nothing inside my guts. My dad walked out on me and my brother and never came back. My mom chose to leave us too. I would never leave my family, but how was I any better than my parents? I may not have left, but I was still never home.</p><p>I tossed and turned all night, trying to fall sleep. Instead of being focused on tomorrow\u2019s game, all I could think about was the fact that it was my five-year-old son\u2019s first day of school and I was going to miss it. The same way I missed everything else in our lives. Tugging at my hair, I had to force myself to stop from crying at the mere thought that I had a five-year-old already. Where had the time gone? How had five years flown by so fast?</p><p>I fucking hated being away from my family and I especially hated missing important days like this. It made me feel like a worthless absentee father with each event I continued to miss out on. Cassie never made me feel bad about it. No one did. Everyone claimed to understand, but I was the one who stopped being so forgiving.</p><p>The next morning my phone beeped, and I was greeted with a picture of Chance. He was looking at the phone with a crooked smile on his face, his dimple showing, his hair all spiked up, and an oversized backpack on his back. Or maybe the backpack was normal-sized and he just made it look big because he was so little.</p><p>Another beep and I clicked on my phone to open one more picture message. Cassie and Chance took a selfie together and my fucking heart squeezed inside my chest. I felt it contract and release as I stared at my beautiful wife and son. Her eyes looked so green and her smile was so big, I wanted to reach into the phone and pull her image right out of it. Chance\u2019s beaming face was pressed against hers as he gave me a thumbs-up.</p><p>Another big day missed. Another lost moment in time I\u2019d never be able to get back.</p><p>Life was making me hate the one thing I\u2019d always loved the most. Kitten excluded.</p><p>After our game that night, I called Cassie as we waited at the airport to catch our flight back. \u201cHow was it? Did he have a good day?\u201d</p><p>She yawned. \u201cHe did. He made so many new friends and he told everyone that his daddy plays for the Angels. To be honest, I think his teacher has a crush on you. She was super googly-eyed when I picked him up today.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cSounds like a smart chick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you\u2019d say that. He has homework already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Since when did they start giving kindergartners homework?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, but he has this ginormous packet that\u2019s due on Friday.\u201d A packet I\u2019d never get to help with because I was never fucking home. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? You sound upset.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good, Kitten. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen will you be home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate. I won\u2019t wake you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. Wake me,\u201d she said in a soft voice. \u201cI mean it.\u201d</p><p>At her words, I instantly started to harden, so I glanced around to be sure no one was looking as I adjusted my pants. Half-tempted to hop into our plane\u2019s cockpit and fly myself back home, I paced the area of the private lounge instead. I didn\u2019t want to be here anymore, away from her. I needed to be home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, Carter? You okay?\u201d our starting catcher, Frank, asked me midstep.</p><p>I glanced at him sideways before blurting out, \u201cI\u2019m just tired of being gone all the time. Do you ever get like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, man. I hate being away from Christina and the kids. It\u2019s hands down the worst part about being a ball player.\u201d He downed the rest of his shot. \u201cWell, aside from the politics and all the business bullshit that ruins this sport for us. Missing the little things like making lunches, helping with homework, science fair projects, and all their games completely sucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight? I feel like I\u2019m coming apart at the seams. Like I can\u2019t live through another day missing all those firsts. Chance started kindergarten today and all I got was a picture. I missed his first day of school. It fucking kills me,\u201d I admitted.</p> <p>\u201cYou need a drink.\u201d He waved the bartender over. \u201cScotch on the rocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink scotch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do tonight,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>I shrugged, willing to try anything to help settle my soul.</p><p>\u201cHow many seasons is this for you, Carter?\u201d</p> <p>I knew what he was getting at. He wanted to know how close I was to the elusive tenth season. It was an unspoken thing we all reached for, that tenth season, which equaled full pension benefits. \u201cTen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do when it\u2019s over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d I lied. I knew exactly what I\u2019d be doing when this season ended, but I wasn\u2019t telling my teammate before I informed my wife.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t get easier. Just so you know,\u201d he said after finishing another drink. \u201cIt\u2019s always the same thing. Our wives are sitting at home raising our kids without their fathers. The absolute worst part is when Christina needs help disciplining the boys and I\u2019m not there. They fight her and there\u2019s no one to help her keep them in line, you know? I feel like complete shit whenever she calls me crying.\u201d</p><p>That thought killed me and it wasn\u2019t even my family Frank was talking about. I wondered how he could be so calm about this. If Chance ever gave Kitten shit like that, I\u2019d be on the first plane out to beat his ass. Or probably not. Because I\u2019d get benched.</p><p>Fuck.</p> <p>\u201cYet here we sit.\u201d I waved my arm around the darkened space. \u201cIn a private airport lounge waiting to fly home, instead of working a normal job like the rest of the world so we could be home with our families.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cEh. The rest of the world isn\u2019t lucky enough to get to do this for a living. And you know damn well that if they could do this, they would. No real man would walk away from this opportunity.\u201d</p><p>The hairs on my neck bristled as I formulated my response. \u201cI don\u2019t think playing baseball makes you a real man. I think taking care of your family and being there for them is what being a real man is about.\u201d</p><p>He looked me directly in the eye. \u201cBut we are taking care of them, Carter. We\u2019re providing a life for them that most can\u2019t. I know we aren\u2019t home all the time, but there are plenty of men who travel for work for a living. And trust me, their jobs are nowhere near as cool as ours.\u201d</p><p>Frank was definitely a glass-half-full kind of guy and I was drowning in a glass-half-empty kind of night. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the life I wanted to provide,\u201d I said. My thoughts turned fuzzy as the scotch filled my head.</p><p>\u201cWell, this is the hand you were dealt. A million other guys would gladly take your spot.\u201d</p><p>His comment pissed me off, but he was right. I couldn\u2019t have it both ways. I could either be a baseball player until I couldn\u2019t throw anymore, or I could be home with my family. Either way, I needed to stop bitching like a little girl. I sounded like Dean.</p><p>As soon as I got home, I turned off the light over the stove that Cassie had left on for me. I punched in my security code and dropped my bag to the floor before I crept up the stairs. Peeking in on my little stud, I leaned down to give him a peck on the cheek. His eyelids fluttered, but he didn\u2019t wake up.</p> <p>Walking down the hallway into the master bedroom, I kissed my sleeping wife, then slipped my hand under her pajama top. She turned over and groaned. \u201cJack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expecting someone else?\u201d I teased as her eyes opened.</p><p>\u201cMaybe. What day of the week is it again?\u201d She chuckled and I silenced her with my mouth. I nipped at her lips before she parted them so I could kiss her more deeply. Her tongue stroked against mine in a frantic dance. \u201cI missed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m always gone.\u201d I rolled on top of her and leaned on my elbows, so I could look down at her beautiful sleepy face.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t apologize, Jack. I\u2019ve told you a hundred times that I knew what I was getting into.\u201d Her hands cupped the sides of my face and I wanted to freeze this moment.</p><p>\u201cBut did you know I\u2019d leave you alone when we had a kid? Did you sign up to be a single mom forever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a single mom,\u201d she huffed out before nudging me to move over. \u201cWhat do you want to hear, that it sucks sometimes? That I hate it when you aren\u2019t here? Because some days I do, Jack. I really do. Like when Chance does something so cute or says something super funny and I wish you were here to share that moment with me. And it\u2019s not just because you\u2019re missing the things that Chance does, but because I\u2019m missing sharing them with you. I want to turn and look at you and laugh about how crazy our boy is, but when I look, you\u2019re not there. And those are the parts that make me sad.\u201d</p><p>If she wanted to break what little resolve I had left, she was doing a damn good job. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut most of the time, I\u2019m okay.\u201d She rolled onto her side to face me. \u201cWe\u2019re okay. And those moments when I get sad, they don\u2019t happen all the time. Of course I always wish you were here, but the really hard parts, they\u2019re just a flash. All right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was marrying a superhero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t? Who else would Harry Potter marry?\u201d She laughed at the nickname she\u2019d given me all those years ago. I couldn\u2019t believe it had stuck after all this time. I\u2019m way hotter than Harry fucking Potter.</p><p>The End of a Dream</p><p>I\u2019d never planned on keeping things from Kitten, but this was something I needed to do on my own. I mentioned to her at the beginning of the season about how I was thinking about this being my last one. She smiled and patted my arm as if to fucking placate me.</p><p>She definitely didn\u2019t think I was serious. But I was.</p><p>I am.</p><p>Lately I had begun to hate myself. I knew what I needed to do to save my family and my sanity; I had to make a choice. And there was really only one choice for me.</p><p>This whole season I\u2019d been playing like it was the last time I\u2019d be doing it. I said good-bye to every stadium and field as though I knew I wouldn\u2019t be playing on it ever again. I laughed more, enjoyed the game more, felt less stressed. It was so liberating to know in my heart that I was making this decision on my own terms.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told anyone yet. Not my agents, not even Dean.</p><p>I\u2019d reached that elusive tenth season and my pension was fully vested. It was a shit thing to make it about the money, but it wasn\u2019t really about the money, per se, it was about the security for my future. My family\u2019s future. I couldn\u2019t play this game forever, and as respected as I was, snot-nosed little rookies who threw faster than I ever did were being born every day. Who knew, maybe one day that would be my boy. Or my nephew.</p><p>I was finally ready to say good-bye to the one thing that had owned me almost my entire life. My mind flashed back to the day I got hurt and the weeks that followed. I\u2019d come so far from where I was then. I remembered fighting within myself and the feeling of utter dread that my career might be over. But I didn\u2019t feel anything like that now. This decision, this moment, it felt right.</p><p>I fucking couldn\u2019t wait to tell my girl. And my boy.</p><p>What the hell was my family going to do when Daddy was home all year long? I\u2019d probably drive them both crazy; Cassie would probably kill me in my fucking sleep. I was sure I\u2019d deserve it, but I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to be there.</p><p>Heading home after the game, my mind reeled with a sense of freedom. Admittedly, I dreaded letting my agents know I wouldn\u2019t be playing anymore, but this was my life and I needed to finally live it. I\u2019d been an active participant only parts of my life, but the other parts I\u2019d been more like a distant cousin you only saw once or twice a year.</p><p>Throwing open the entry door from the garage, I was met with the sound of laughter coming from upstairs. \u201cWhere\u2019s my family?\u201d I shouted toward the sounds.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Chance screamed and hopped down the stairs two at a time. When he got to the bottom, he ran straight into my arms.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. How was your day?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood! Mommy and I made chocolate chip cookies and I ate the dough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d I said as my mouth watered. \u201cDo you think Mommy saved any cookie dough for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d His head nodded rapidly up and down, and I placed my hand on top of it to slow it down. \u201cShe put some in a box for you,\u201d he added slyly.</p><p>\u201cA box?\u201d I gave him a funny look as Cassie walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHe means a container. It\u2019s in the fridge. Hey, babe.\u201d She pressed her mouth against mine and I almost forgot we had an audience until he tugged at my shirt.</p><p>\u201cDaddy, will you swim with me? Mommy said I had to wait until you got home to swim. But now you\u2019re home. Let\u2019s swim. Please. I wanna swim.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened as he talked a hundred miles a minute. \u201cSure thing. Just let me talk to Mommy for a second, okay?\u201d</p><p>His shoulders slumped as he said dejectedly, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>Cassie kneeled down so that she was eye to eye with him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you run upstairs and go put on your swim trunks and grab your floaties, okay?\u201d</p><p>Chance\u2019s lip jutted out into a pout. He had Cassie\u2019s mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t need my floaties, Mom!\u201d</p><p>She stood up and put her hand on her hip. \u201cChance. If you don\u2019t get your floaties, you can\u2019t go in the pool. You know the rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever go in the pool without floaties or an adult,\u201d he recited in a monotone voice, and I suppressed a smile as I realized I had a lot of rules to learn.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Now, go get changed. Daddy will meet you in your room as soon as we\u2019re done talking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d His mood instantly improved, Chance took off running up the stairs, leaping with excitement from the left side of one stair tread to the right side of the next, just for the sheer joy of it.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, babe, he\u2019s exhausting,\u201d Cassie said. \u201cHe\u2019s like the Energizer bunny. He\u2019s never tired. Ever.\u201d She blew out a breath and wiped her forehead with the back of her hand.</p><p>I took her hand and pulled her close as I reconsidered what I was about to tell her for two full seconds before blurting it out. \u201cI\u2019ve officially decided that I\u2019m not playing after this season.\u201d Holding her against me, I prayed she\u2019d be excited as I waited for her response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cassie\u2019s eyes lit up, but she held back a smile as she asked cautiously, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cI told you at the beginning of the year that I thought it would be my last. I went into this season thinking that and I\u2019ve mentally said my good-byes to everything and everyone. I\u2019m ready to leave,\u201d I said, and was happy to realize that I really meant it.</p><p>\u201cJack, if you\u2019re ready to leave, then I can\u2019t wait to have you home.\u201d She smiled as the tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>Sighing with contentment, I pulled her closer and buried my face in her hair, inhaling the fragrance of her shampoo. The feel of her body pressed against mine not only aroused me, but comforted me as well. This girl was my life. I was holding my life in my arms and as long as I had her, I knew I\u2019d be okay without baseball.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to be home, Kitten,\u201d I said into her hair. \u201cI\u2019ve missed so much. I don\u2019t want to miss any more. And the nastiness of the business, it\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d</p><p>Cassie knew what I meant. The business side of the baseball industry had the potential of souring your entire experience if you allowed it to. I wanted to leave on my terms, before I not only hated myself, but the sport as well.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure? One hundred percent certain this is what you want?\u201d She tilted her head back and looked me in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cWithout a doubt. And you know what the best part is?\u201d I asked, and watched as her long blonde hair swayed as she shook her head. \u201cI feel relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you know it\u2019s right.\u201d Her smile grew as she pushed her lips to mine and pulled me hard against her. When she broke the kiss she asked, \u201cDoes Dean know? Or Marc and Ryan? Do they know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet. They\u2019ve been fielding offers from other teams lately since my contract\u2019s up. There\u2019s been some pretty great offers, but I haven\u2019t even considered them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I\u2019m ready!\u201d Chance shouted from the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cBe right up. Give me two seconds,\u201d I shouted back and watched as he kicked at the railing. \u201cDon\u2019t kick the railing please, buddy.\u201d He stopped and dropped to his butt, his legs folded Indian-style as he waited for me.</p><p>\u201cYou should probably tell Dean in person,\u201d Cassie suggested. \u201cWant me to invite them over for dinner? Coby loves swimming in the pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, that sounds great. Can we invite Gran and Gramps too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll call everyone. You go swim with your boy.\u201d</p> <p>Giving her a quick kiss, I bolted upstairs to change.</p><p>Cassie handled everything while I swam in our saltwater pool with Chance. He splashed and kicked, but mostly he wanted me to throw him around. Playing in the pool with this kid was almost a better workout than the gym. My shoulders ached by the time Dean and Melissa arrived and my little nephew jumped in the water, begging for me to throw him too.</p><p>\u201cFrow me, Unckie Jack. Frow me!\u201d Coby screamed out in excitement, his cheeks turning bright red.</p><p>I grabbed him and tossed him into the air as he squealed. His little face popped right back out of the water as soon as he entered it. \u201cThat vest thing you\u2019re wearing is pretty cool,\u201d I said to Coby, impressed with the floatation devices kids these days had to wear.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for little kids. I\u2019m wearing big kid floats,\u201d Chance informed me as he touched one of the inflatable bands he wore around his arms.</p><p>My brother, Dean, appeared out of nowhere and dove straight in, splashing everyone in the pool. He swam over to where the three of us were and gave me a nod.</p><p>\u201cAre kids always this competitive?\u201d I asked him after I tossed our kids into the water again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know about all kids, but ours sure are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t like that,\u201d I insisted as I tried to remember being that way with Dean growing up.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cNo, what you mean to say is I wasn\u2019t like that. You were definitely like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll ask Gran then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk me what?\u201d Gran\u2019s voice caught our attention and I hopped out of the pool before drenching her in a wet hug. \u201cJack! Stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran\u2019s all wet!\u201d Chance shouted. \u201cDaddy, you got Gran all wet. I wanna get Gran all wet.\u201d He clambered out of the pool and ran into Gran\u2019s legs, soaking her pants.</p><p>\u201cChance, no running!\u201d Cassie called out from the open window.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Mommy!\u201d Chance yelled as he ran/walked back to the pool and jumped in.</p><p>Gran eyed me like she was going to kill me and I played innocent. \u201cI can\u2019t help it that all the boys love you. You should really blame yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try.\u201d She waved a finger at me. \u201cNow, what were you boys talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran, Jack seems to think that we weren\u2019t competitive growing up,\u201d Dean said in a mockingly shocked tone as Gran giggled.</p><p>\u201cObviously Jack has a selective memory. Honey, you were extremely competitive with Dean. But he wasn\u2019t competitive back. He just wanted to be like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you.\u201d Dean splashed me before diving under the water.</p><p>\u201cUncle Dean, throw me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrow me too, Daddy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe first, Uncle Dean!\u201d</p><p>I watched as Dean tossed our kids into the air one at a time before they splashed into the water below. Their excited squeals filled the air and I wondered if there were any greater sound than the sound of your family laughing together.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve built a beautiful life for yourself, Jack,\u201d Gran said softly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud.\u201d My grandmother leaned against me and slipped her arm around my waist.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Gran. I wouldn\u2019t be half the man I am today without you and Gramps. Thank you for all you\u2019ve done for me. And for Cassie. I don\u2019t know where\u2019d we be right now if it wasn\u2019t for you two.\u201d</p><p>She wiped at her eye. \u201cOh, stop. You\u2019d be exactly where you are right now. It just might have taken you both a little bit longer to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. You two were made for each other. You would have found your way there eventually. You\u2019re like magnets, each one pulling at the other until you connect, unable to pull apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about that knucklehead and his wife?\u201d I pointed at Dean and she whistled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure those two would have ever got their stuff together if Cassie didn\u2019t drag the tiny one over to our house that night. We\u2019d probably still be waiting for them to work it out.\u201d</p><p>I had to agree. \u201cSo you\u2019re to blame,\u201d I teased and gave her a slight nudge.</p><p>Cassie and Melissa walked into the backyard side by side, whispering and laughing about who knows what. Gramps followed close behind, his eyes searching for Gran. He walked over and staked his claim.</p><p>\u201cGet off my woman, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know where I get it from,\u201d I said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cGet what?\u201d he said innocently.</p><p>\u201cThe desire to piss all over my property,\u201d I informed him with half a grin.</p><p>\u201cI do not want to piss all over your grandmother, Jack,\u201d he started to say before Gran cut him off.</p><p>\u201cA woman can only take so much. If either of you need me, I\u2019ll be with the outnumbered gender in the kitchen, where we belong.\u201d She sauntered over toward the girls.</p><p>\u201cKitten, did you hear that? Get your ass in the kitchen where you belong!\u201d I hollered and she scowled at me.</p><p>\u201cBad word!\u201d echoed from the two tiny mouths in the pool.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I shouted at them before jumping back in.</p><p>The ladies didn\u2019t disappear for long before they were all demanding we leave the pool and come get ready for dinner. They promised that we could swim after dinner, but we needed to eat first.</p><p>Our dining room table was set for eight and I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d felt this relaxed and genuinely happy. Cassie set down separate bowls filled with pasta and spaghetti in the center of the table, before asking everyone what they wanted to drink. Melissa added a basket filled with garlic bread to the mix, and Gran followed carrying a huge salad.</p><p>I loved these women. Even Fun-Size.</p><p>Cassie steered Chance toward one of the middle seats and pulled back the other middle seat across the table for Coby. Coby sat in some sort of booster chair thing, while Chance grabbed a stack of books from his room. I laughed as he carried them down, stacked them neatly on top of his chair, and then couldn\u2019t get up.</p><p>\u201cHelp me please,\u201d he asked in his raspy little voice.</p><p>I lifted him up and placed him firmly on the mountain of books. \u201cHe won\u2019t fall?\u201d I asked no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cHe might,\u201d Cassie answered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gonna fall,\u201d Chance insisted as I scooted his chair closer to the table.</p><p>Gran and Gramps sat at the head of the table while my son sat between my wife and me. I was forced to stare at my brother\u2019s ugly mug throughout the whole meal.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice of you to have us all here for dinner,\u201d Gran said in our direction. \u201cThank you for inviting us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I love coming here for meals. Especially if Gran\u2019s cooking,\u201d Melissa added, taking a huge bite of bread.</p><p>Cassie leaned forward to give me an encouraging look, and I nodded.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I began, \u201cwe wanted you all here because I have some news. And I wanted to share it with everyone at the same time.\u201d</p><p>All eyes focused on me as the room went silent. Even the boys stopped fidgeting for a second. \u201cI\u2019ve officially decided that this will be my last season playing baseball.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, several voices all rang out at once, each trying to talk over the other. Cassie raised her arms in the air to quiet them down. \u201cLet him finish.\u201d</p><p>I looked around and scrunched my face before clarifying, \u201cI was finished.\u201d</p><p>Dean\u2019s fork clanged against his plate. \u201cBut what about all the offers? You won\u2019t even consider them?\u201d He suddenly turned from a brother to an agent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the offers,\u201d I said, then my tone turned firm. \u201cI\u2019ve made up my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut these are major league, starting rotation offers, Jack. Really solid contracts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, Dean.\u201d</p><p>Melissa reached over Coby and settled her hand on top of Dean\u2019s arm. It seemed to bring him back to reality and remind him who he was; my brother, not my agent.</p><p>\u201cWhy now?\u201d Gramps asked, and I felt it was a fair question.</p><p>\u201cHonestly? Because I think if I spend any more time playing, I\u2019ll lose it. I\u2019ll lose it all. The love I have for the game. The respect I have for the office that runs it. I\u2019m tired of all the bullshit that goes on behind the scenes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad word, Daddy!\u201d Chance yelled.</p><p>Coby giggled. \u201cBad word, Unckie Jack!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, guys.\u201d I really needed to watch my language around the boys. This was going to be an adjustment.</p><p>Shaking off my mental list of things to do once I retired from ball, I continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m mostly tired of not being around. These past five years have been the hardest ones for me. I might be a success on the baseball field, but I\u2019ve felt like a failure at home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJack.\u201d Cassie pushed her chair back and wrapped her arms around me from behind. She planted a kiss on the side of my head. \u201cNothing about you is a failure, do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>I wanted to believe her, but I knew it sucked handling everything alone. Whether she wanted to admit it or not. \u201cI appreciate you saying that, Kitten. I do. But it\u2019s hard not to feel like one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, knock it off.\u201d She smacked my shoulder before returning to her seat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Jack,\u201d Gran said sternly. \u201cDon\u2019t do that to yourself. You haven\u2019t done anything wrong. You\u2019ve been a good husband and a good father while you also juggled a demanding career. No one faults you for that.\u201d The wonderful woman who raised me looked at me, her eyes filled with an odd combination of pride and sadness, and I felt a little twinge in my gut.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Jack. I know you don\u2019t always believe that about yourself, but you are. I\u2019m proud of you, son,\u201d Gramps added and I almost fucking lost it. If my brother and Melissa hadn\u2019t been sitting at the table, I probably would have cried like a baby, but I refused to do that in front of them. Dean didn\u2019t need to witness what a complete pussy I\u2019d turned into.</p><p>\u201cI want to be a better husband and a better father. And this is what I need to do it. I hope you all understand.\u201d I chanced another glance at my brother.</p><p>\u201cPlaying baseball on a professional level is intense, bro. You\u2019ve given up so much to do it, you always have. If you think about it, you\u2019ve never really had a normal life. You\u2019ve always been busting your ass to make your dreams come true. And once they did, the work didn\u2019t stop, it only got harder.\u201d Dean nodded thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s your career and I think it\u2019s pretty awesome if you end it on your terms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. Do you think Marc and Ryan will be pissed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah.\u201d He waved me off. \u201cSurprised, maybe, but not pissed. They\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCongratulations, Jack,\u201d Melissa chimed in. \u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019ve been missing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Not really. Do you even know what summer is? Aside from prime-time ball-playing season?\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI have a vague recollection of this thing you call summer.\u201d</p><p>Cassie squeaked as she inhaled sharply. \u201cOh my gosh! You\u2019ll be here for the fourth of July. And we can have barbeques all summer long! And swim parties! Jack, do you know what this means?\u201d Her eyes practically glowed as she stared at me.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kitten. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to tell you. I\u2019ll get to have a life with you. An actual non-baseball-driven life. Better get used to me being around, because I plan on stalking you for quite a while.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDad, what\u2019s stalking?\u201d</p><p>I shot Cassie a freaked-out look. \u201cUh, it\u2019s when you follow Mommy around the house all day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh,\u201d Chance said with wide eyes. \u201cI stalk Mommy all the time.\u201d</p><p>Everyone at the table laughed and I felt like the luckiest guy in the world, surrounded by family and the people I loved. I couldn\u2019t wait to start the next chapter of my life.</p><p>Our New Lives</p><p>I kept asking Jack if he was sure and he continued to insist that he was. If he changed his mind, I wanted him to know it was okay. The truth was, I hadn\u2019t gotten my hopes up super high, just in case he decided at the last minute that he couldn\u2019t retire. I would have understood. It seemed almost harder for me to grasp the concept that Jack was truly okay with quitting baseball, than it was for me to be mad at him if he reversed his decision.</p><p>But after he sat me down and told me he had officially decided to quit, his entire demeanor changed. It seemed like some virtual weight neither of us even knew existed had been lifted from his shoulders. He smiled more and got excited at the simplest things, like going to the movies. He couldn\u2019t remember the last time we\u2019d done that. And sadly, neither could I.</p><p>Even during those few months of the year when it was considered the off-season, Jack was never truly off. A real baseball player couldn\u2019t be. This sport demanded so much of one\u2019s time and mental energy. He was always focused and that put everything else on the back burner, especially having fun with no consequences or guilt. I\u2019d never realized it really ... until now.</p> <p>Jack played his last game at Angel Stadium to a screaming, sold-out crowd. My parents showed up for the first half of the game before my mom complained about a migraine coming on and needed to leave. My dad offered to stay, but I told him that someone needed to drive Mom home and I wasn\u2019t leaving. He nodded before taking her by the hand. It was nice to share this moment with them, however briefly, and I thanked them for coming.</p><p>Chance gave them both huge hugs and kisses on the cheek. He loved my parents and that honestly made me happy. No matter how they\u2019d disappointed me in the past, I wanted my son to have a good relationship with them. They weren\u2019t bad people at heart and I knew that. My dad seemed to be making an effort, and had been a man of his word lately. I figured now was as good a time as any to start mending those parental fences.</p><p>When the game ended, every single person in the stands rose to their feet and gave Jack a standing ovation. They chanted \u201cCarter\u201d throughout the innings and I was in tears pretty much the entire night.</p><p>Chance didn\u2019t understand why I was crying, but he loved watching his dad pitch. His eyes were so focused and intense and I recognized that gleam. I was certain we had a future ball player on our hands. Although every time the crowd screamed for Jack, Chance covered his ears and exclaimed, \u201cIt\u2019s too loud!\u201d</p><p>Knowing this was the last time I\u2019d ever be in this stadium watching Jack play made me want to throw up. The life we\u2019d always known up until now was ending and I had no idea what to expect.</p><p>I\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t nervous. It wasn\u2019t that hard to think back to the time when Jack broke his hand and how mean he\u2019d become. There was a part of me that was terrified to even entertain the idea of him acting like that again. What if he completely changed after tonight? What if he hated being free from baseball and didn\u2019t know what to do with himself?</p><p>I worried.</p><p>But all I could do was hope he\u2019d made his decision for the right reasons and that he never blamed or resented me or Chance for them.</p><p>Melissa reached over and grabbed my hand. \u201cIt will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking. You\u2019re worried. Your face always does this little crinkle thing right here,\u201d she pointed at the bridge of my nose, \u201cwhen you\u2019re worried. It will be fine. Jack will be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he hates me and thinks I ruined his life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you hate him and think he ruined your life?\u201d she fired back.</p><p>I frowned at her hard. \u201cNo. Why would I think that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you had to quit your job and move out here to be with him. You haven\u2019t worked in almost five years. Do you blame him for that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t either.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes and knew she was right. \u201cThanks, Melis.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you don\u2019t just talk to me in the first place. You\u2019d save yourself a lot of brow-furrowing.\u201d</p><p>I chuckled. \u201cRemind me next time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to remind you. Hell, if you don\u2019t know how smart I am by now, you\u2019ll never learn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably true,\u201d I admitted with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go get that husband of yours,\u201d she said as she tugged me out of my seat and led the way to the tunnels.</p><p>The seven of us walked down into the corridor and waited for Jack to come out of the locker room. I worried that it might be a long night since it was his last. His teammates would want to tell him good-bye, and I knew that there were reporters waiting to interview him as well.</p><p>I stood in the corridor, holding my son\u2019s little hand. At five years old, he still let me hold his hand in public, and I loved that. I dreaded the day he\u2019d pull his hand away from mine and tell me he wasn\u2019t a baby anymore.</p><p>\u201cThink he\u2019ll be long?\u201d Dean asked, carrying his two-and-a-half-year-old son in his arms.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cProbably. It\u2019s the last time he\u2019ll be in there, so we might be waiting all night.\u201d</p><p>Chance tugged at Dean\u2019s shirt. \u201cUncle Dean. Uncle Dean.\u201d</p><p>Dean glanced down at his nephew. \u201cYeah, little guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut Coby down. I wanna play with my cousin,\u201d he demanded and Dean leaned over to do exactly that.</p><p>\u201cBe careful, he\u2019s wobbly,\u201d Dean warned.</p><p>\u201cWhat does wobbly mean?\u201d Chance asked with a frown.</p><p>Melissa leaned down so she was eye to eye with him. \u201cIt just means that sometimes when he runs, he\u2019ll fall down. So don\u2019t chase him too fast, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Aunt Lissa.\u201d</p><p>Chance and Coby ran around in circles between the other players\u2019 wives and relatives. The other families gave us sad smiles, each probably convinced that Jack didn\u2019t get any offers worth taking and that was why he was leaving. I smiled back, a huge, happy smile, which seemed to puzzle them. They didn\u2019t get it. But they didn\u2019t need to. This wasn\u2019t about them. It wasn\u2019t about anyone other than Jack and our family.</p><p>When the door swung open, I found myself shocked to see Jack waltzing through it, carrying a large duffel bag.</p><p>\u201cDaddy!\u201d Chance pulled his hand from mine and ran toward Jack.</p><p>\u201cHey, you.\u201d He planted a big kiss on Chance\u2019s cheek. \u201cDid you like the game? We won.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was too loud and it hurt my ears. And Mommy cried.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes were instantly on mine. \u201cWhy\u2019d you cry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was moved, Jack. The way the crowd reacted to you. It was really emotional for me to watch.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in and kissed my cheek. \u201cIt was emotional for me to watch too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you cry?\u201d I asked a little too loud and he looked around.</p><p>\u201cNo. Who do you think I am, Dean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that,\u201d Dean called out as he chased his son around. Melissa snuck up behind Coby and grabbed him as he screamed.</p><p>\u201cI got you!\u201d She held on to the wiggly toddler as Dean bent down to kiss her. She reached for his hand and leaned into him, which made me smile. I loved seeing them so happy.</p><p>Gran and Gramps sidled up next to me, tears in their eyes. I nodded their way, saying, \u201cSee, I\u2019m not the only one who was moved to tears tonight,\u201d doing my best to divert the attention away from me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re just so proud of you, Jack,\u201d Gran said as she allowed the tears to fall. Jack pulled her in for a hug.</p><p>\u201cThank you for being here. It means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>Gramps slapped Jack on the back. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world, kid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to go, babe?\u201d I asked my husband and he nodded. \u201cJack\u2019s ready,\u201d I announced to our small group. \u201cWe\u2019ll see you all at the house.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll bring Chance with us,\u201d Melissa offered and I enthusiastically agreed. Sometimes it made life easier to get a little break.</p><p>After another round of hugs, Jack and I walked hand in hand out of the underground tunnels for the last time. Passing by a lone reporter, Jack stopped to shake his hand, and dropped his duffel bag on the ground.</p><p>\u201cJack, do you have a comment? Something to leave your fans with?\u201d the familiar reporter asked.</p><p>\u201cHey, Casey. You remember my wife, Cassie.\u201d Jack introduced me to the reporter, but I couldn\u2019t place him exactly.</p> <p>\u201cNice to see you again, Mrs. Carter. I bet you\u2019re excited to have Jack home full-time now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea.\u201d I squeezed Jack\u2019s arm and smiled.</p><p>\u201cSo, how about that quote, Jack? Anything you want to say to memorialize your career?\u201d</p><p>Jack grew silent and I knew he was deep in thought. He took a deep breath before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s one hell of a sledgehammer to the chest when your baseball career comes to an end. It\u2019s like you finally realize that baseball never loved you back. All the sleepless nights, the hours spent at the gym trying to stay fit, the conditioning, the training, the mental preparation, the holidays missed, the birthdays passed, the memories you didn\u2019t get to make with your family ... all for what? It\u2019s not like baseball lost any sleep over you. She didn\u2019t stay awake for nights on end, trying to figure out how to make you a better player. She didn\u2019t care. Baseball\u2019s a business. A sport. A game. And as much as my entire life has been wrapped up in it, it\u2019s time to let it go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is it safe to say that you\u2019re quitting for your family?\u201d</p> <p>Jack squeezed my hand. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say that I\u2019m quitting for me. I want to know what it\u2019s like to have a life outside baseball while my body can still do the things I want it to, knock on wood. I want to experience a weekend that isn\u2019t filled with hitting, pitching, fielding, working out, or meetings.\u201d</p><p>He flashed me a big smile, and said, \u201cI want to wake up in the morning and not worry about whether or not my hand is going to tighten up today or if I\u2019m still playing well enough to stay on the team that I love. I\u2019ve given so much time and energy to this sport, but now it\u2019s time for me to give the same attention to my wife and son. I\u2019m ready to have a life that includes them all the time, not just three months out of the year.\u201d</p><p>My heart squeezed inside my chest as the blood started pumping wildly in my veins. Every single thing this man did filled me with pride and love.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jack. And congratulations. You\u2019re a hell of a player.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Casey. That means a lot coming from you.\u201d</p><p>The two men shook hands before Jack led me away from the stadium. I fought the urge to cry as we pulled out of the parking lot for the last time.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so weird to think of you without thinking about baseball.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cYou think it\u2019s weird for you, how do you think I feel? I have to figure out who I am all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know who you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man in love with his Kitten?\u201d</p><p>I gave him a mock frown. \u201cJack, be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPart of my identity for as long as I can remember is being a baseball player. If I\u2019m not that anymore, then who am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you want to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he teased.</p> <p>I laughed out loud and grabbed his hand. \u201cMission accomplished.\u201d</p><p>Two Months Later ...</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself with all the free time Jack\u2019s help gave me. It made me realize that I had been living a sort of single mom life, although I\u2019d never admit that to Jack now. It served no purpose. I simply made sure to thank him for everything he was doing to help.</p><p>Longing to make up for lost time, Jack refused to let me help with Chance\u2019s homework, and woke up every morning to drive him to school. He even called Nora behind my back and told her I was ready to start taking on assignments. I had to tell Jack to \u201cslow his roll.\u201d Yes, I wanted to work again someday, but not the second after he had stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to get me out of the house,\u201d I said after learning that he reached out to Nora.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to waste any more time not working now that I\u2019m home,\u201d he confessed. \u201cI can handle everything here just like you did. You put your dreams on hold for me, and now it\u2019s time you go chase them again.\u201d</p><p>My hand flew to my open mouth and covered it. Jack never ceased to amaze me when it came to how thoughtful, caring, and loving he was. Lowering my hand, I said, \u201cStaying home with my son isn\u2019t a waste of my time. And now that you\u2019re here too, I\u2019m in no rush to be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure? You\u2019ve given up so much,\u201d he started to say.</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI\u2019ve given up nothing. My dreams aren\u2019t gone. They\u2019ll still be waiting for me when I\u2019m ready to pursue them again. But that\u2019s not now. Especially not now.\u201d I couldn\u2019t imagine focusing on a job now that Jack was finally home. I wanted to take the time to enjoy actually being a family in a two-parent household.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s good to hear because I\u2019ve been gathering all these quarters, you see, and I can\u2019t really use them if you\u2019re not here to use them on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so,\u201d I asked as I pressed my body against his chest and felt the need between my thighs.</p><p>\u201cI have. I think I\u2019ll spend this whole jar right now. Knock you up again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Jack. If you give me another boy, we might need to adopt something female. Like a girl dog or something. All the testosterone around here is killing me. Between you and Dean and the boys, there are way too many Carter males running around.\u201d</p><p>He laughed hard. He does that a lot lately, thank God.</p><p>Touching his cheek, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll never get tired of hearing that laugh or seeing those dimples.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter get used to it, Kitten. \u2018Cause I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on it.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down and pressed his lips against mine, then deepened the kiss in that way that always made me want to tear his clothes off. I always assumed that if Jack changed after quitting baseball, it would be for the worse. It never occurred to me that post-baseball Jack might actually be better. There was a whole other person who lived inside him that neither of us knew existed. This guy was much happier, much friendlier, and a hell of a lot less stressed.</p><p>Not that Jack wasn\u2019t any of those things before he left, but like I said before, a weight had been lifted from my man\u2019s shoulders. He finally felt like he could let loose and have fun, actually go out on the weekend and not be wracked with guilt over it.</p><p>Quitting baseball had been one of the best decisions Jack ever made. And leaving the sport didn\u2019t make him miss the game, it made him love his life and the choice he made to finally have one. I loved my husband with every fiber of my being, and slept in his arms each night knowing he felt the same for me.</p><p>He\u2019d promised to have me knocked up again by the end of winter. \u201cIt\u2019s my new goal,\u201d he said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cConsider it met.\u201d I chewed on my bottom lip as he pulled back from my arms.</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d he stuttered. \u201cDo you mean what I think you mean?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head to the side and smiled. \u201cIf you think I mean that we\u2019re pregnant again, then yes.\u201d</p><p>Jack wrapped his arms around my middle and lifted me off the ground, the world spinning beneath my feet. \u201cOh my God, Kitten! Yes! I love my swimmers!\u201d</p><p>I laughed, pulling out of his grip and touching my toes to the floor. \u201cYour swimmers? You love your swimmers?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, he added, \u201cI love you too. But you know that. I\u2019ll always love you. Always.\u201d He lowered himself to his knees and pressed his lips against my belly. \u201cAnd I love you too, little man.\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I whined. \u201cNot this again.\u201d</p><p>Jack rose to his feet. \u201cYes, this again.\u201d He placed a gentle kiss on my lips. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen us Carter men in action. We breed boys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gonna be in a lot of trouble, mister, when you find out we\u2019re having a girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever going to happen,\u201d he responded overconfidently, and I smiled.</p><p>Heaven help me.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Eleven Years Later ...</p><p>All my life, I\u2019d heard Uncle Dean\u2019s stories about what a stud my father was in high school, and how the girls all fawned over him. To be honest, not much was different with me. People always patted my back like I was a fucking champion or something as I walked through the school campus, and this afternoon\u2014a game day\u2014was no different.</p><p>Once I reached the locker room, I changed into my baseball gear, ignoring the rest of my teammates while I prepped mentally. Every game day, I followed the same routine: I changed into my gear in silence, refusing to say a word, while I listened to the \u201cwarm-up\u201d soundtrack I downloaded blasting in my ears.</p><p>Heading out toward the baseball field, I spotted my dad in the bullpen, working with our starting pitcher. Since my dad started coaching the varsity baseball team at my high school, it became the school to attend ... especially if you were a pitcher. Which I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>My dad had coached all my baseball teams except one since quitting the major leagues. To be honest, I only had vague memories of my dad playing baseball for the Angels. My childhood memories consisted mostly of my dad always being around, not him being on the road playing ball.</p><p>I decided when I was just a little tyke that I wanted to be a catcher. Maybe it was all the years of catching for my dad while he pitched balls at me? I didn\u2019t know for sure, but what I did know I was a great catcher. I had an arm like a cannon. Base runners didn\u2019t steal on me, I\u2019d throw them out quicker than shit. Like a rocket launcher was attached to my arm, I\u2019d fire that ball from behind home plate to second base and get them out nine times out of ten. My parents worried about my knees, but I worked hard to keep them strong and flexible. I knew all about what my dad went through when he got hurt in the majors.</p><p>Before I stepped into the dugout, I made a visual sweep of the stands and saw my mother was sitting alone on a stadium chair among the growing crowd. Since my cousin Coby was the only freshman who made the junior varsity team and our games overlapped, Uncle Dean and Aunt Melissa missed almost all of mine. Poor Gran and Gramps were forced to split their time between games, meandering back and forth between the two ball fields.</p><p>I scanned the crowd for my little sister, Jacey, only to see her talking to some boy who looked a year or two older than her.</p><p>Hope to God Dad doesn\u2019t see that.</p><p>Dad already had enough heart attacks with Jacey to last a lifetime, starting with her trying to wear makeup like she was twenty instead of ten, and coming down the stairs to go out wearing short shorts and little tank tops. Every time it happened, Dad would stand there with his face all red and his hand over his heart as he ordered her to march right back upstairs to change, while my mom just stood there and laughed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My parents always got along really well. Every fight I\u2019d ever seen them have always ended with a kiss and my father calling my mother by her pet name, Kitten. I\u2019d find it kind of cute if it didn\u2019t make me want to fucking barf watching my parents make out like teenagers. There were some things you could never un-see.</p><p>No one knew why my dad called her Kitten, even though I\u2019d asked about a million times. I couldn\u2019t even look at a kitten without thinking about my mom, which was pretty fucked up, if you asked me. And don\u2019t get me started on the deal with the quarters, either. I blocked out the real reason they collected them and chose to think about the stupid cutesy stories instead. Do you have any idea how weird it was to grow up thinking that quarters were meant to be put into jars and not spent? I almost had a coronary the first time one of my friends pulled a quarter out of his pocket and deposited it into a vending machine. As a matter of fact, I got a little hysterical, and the principal was forced to call my mom because I refused to calm down. She had to come get me and take me home. To this day, I ask for my change in dimes and nickels. No quarters for me.</p><p>No girls either. Unlike my dad, who was apparently some grade-A womanizing badass, I tried to steer clear of girls. They were distracting, and a pain in the ass. I had no idea how my dad got them to leave him alone, but if I so much as kissed a chick, I couldn\u2019t shake her for months. Didn\u2019t fucking need that.</p><p>\u201cChance! Get out here and warm up that arm, son!\u201d</p> <p>I headed out of the dugout and started tossing the baseball around with a teammate while my mind wandered briefly wandered back to my family. My dad never missed a game once his career ended. My mom, on the other hand, missed some here and there due to her photography jobs. She accepted work when my dad forced her to. He told me he could see it in her eyes when she wanted to cover a story and that we needed to encourage her to go.</p><p>More than once, Dad and I had sat on the couch together and informed her that the house wouldn\u2019t burn down, I wouldn\u2019t flunk out of school, Jacey would have her lunch packed and homework done, and we\u2019d eat three meals a day if she left us for a week. We basically had to convince the woman that we would survive in her absence.</p><p>Compared to other moms, mine was rare. More often than not, my friends\u2019 moms couldn\u2019t wait to leave the house and not be held accountable for what happened there while they were away. My family, on the other hand, practically shoved my mom out the door every single time. She never wanted to leave us. And to be honest, my dad wasn\u2019t the same when she was gone. He always seemed a little sad, no matter how happy he was with me and my sister.</p><p>When both games finally ended, the group of us always gathered at either our house or my uncle\u2019s for dinner; tonight it was our turn. Whenever we\u2019d get together, Gran would rave about how much she loved being surrounded by family, but sometimes I wanted to kill my little cousins. Tonight Uncle Dean\u2019s nine-year-old twins were running around like they were possessed by demons, wanting to put makeup on me and paint my nails.</p><p>What was it with chicks? Why did they always want to mess with your nails? My sister encouraged their behavior, even after I warned her I\u2019d throw her in the pool with her clothes on.</p> <p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t!\u201d She narrowed her green eyes at me.</p><p>\u201cI would. And I will. Try me,\u201d I dared her.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Mom chided from the kitchen. \u201cCome in and eat. Girls, leave Chance alone. He doesn\u2019t want his nails painted today, but I bet your dad does.\u201d She smiled at Uncle Dean, and Aunt Melissa burst out laughing.</p><p>My dad walked over to my mom and planted an embarrassing kiss on her lips before giving my sister and me a squeeze.</p><p>When dinner was ready, we all sat at the table as the conversation flowed and the noise grew so loud it could probably rival an Italian family gathering in New York. About halfway through the meal, Dad calmed the table down, asking for silence.</p><p>\u201cI have some important news I want to share with you guys,\u201d he said, leveling his gaze with mine. \u201cEspecially with Chance.\u201d</p> <p>Once everyone had piped down, Dad announced with a big grin, \u201cFullton State has had a scout at the last few home games. They like what they see with Chance.\u201d</p><p>The whole table erupted into cheers, while my heart beat rapidly in my chest. Fullton State was the only place I wanted to play ball. I might not be a pitcher like my father, but going to the same college where he had started his career, and where he and my mom had met? To say it was my number one choice would be the understatement of the year.</p><p>\u201cOne of the coaches is retiring soon, which means they\u2019re looking for a new coach. So, if things work out all around, looks like you\u2019ll have to deal with me for another four years, Chance,\u201d he continued, winking at me.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way, Dad.\u201d I shrugged, elated that my father would be there to continue molding me until I was ready for the major leagues. Some kids might resent their father micromanaging their sports participation, but I knew I was lucky. There was no one better than my dad when it came to baseball.</p><p>\u201cYeah, just stay away from all the, uh ...\u201d Uncle Dean paused, glancing around the table at all the young girls before continuing. \u201c... distractions out there. Make sure you get a background check on every slut who tries to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean!\u201d Gran shouted from across the table.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! Don\u2019t listen to him.\u201d Aunt Melissa smacked his arm. \u201cI mean, listen to him, but ...\u201d She grunted and stopped short of finishing her sentence.</p><p>Uncle Dean smirked. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to warn him. Someone needs to.\u201d</p> <p>Mom came around the table and patted me on the back. \u201cChance has his head on straight. He isn\u2019t a Little Jack. Don\u2019t you worry, he\u2019s focused. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope I get to go to Fullton State too,\u201d Coby interjected and my mom audibly sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I could live through history repeating itself,\u201d her widened eyes met my Aunt\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cTwo generations of Carter boys? Lord help us all,\u201d Aunt Melissa shook her head.</p><p>Before I could say anything, Dad scooted his chair back and pulled on my mom\u2019s hand, causing her to fall straight into his lap.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think using me as a bad example is really working here, folks.\u201d My dad frowned at the rest of the family while wrapping his arms around my mom\u2019s waist. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t be like Jack,\u2019\u201d he said in a mocking falsetto voice. \u201c\u2018Focus. Don\u2019t be like your father.\u2019 But as far as I see it, being like me will get you the best wife in the world, the coolest kids, and a great family. Yeah, son ...\u201d He glanced at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be like me. Wouldn\u2019t want that.\u201d</p><p>My mother practically melted as she gave him another less-than-appropriate kiss, no matter how many times I groaned. I watched, shaking my head, as my dad pulled two quarters from his pocket and tucked them into her hand. \u201cFor later,\u201d he whispered, but I heard and he knew it.</p><p>Damn it, Dad. I was ruined forever. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.</p><p>I eventually wanted what my parents had ... just not anytime soon.</p><p>Later.</p><p>WAY later. </p> </body></html>"]
