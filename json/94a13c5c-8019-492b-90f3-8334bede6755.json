They\u2019d both been wounded in the attack, but luckily they\u2019d sustained only flesh wounds. The silver bullets had missed all the vital organs, and wolves healed with a supernatural quickness. One of the Hunters had been captured and was in a basement cell, recovering from his injuries and being interrogated.</p><p>Marco glanced at Ian, his beta. Ian knew he relied on him for advice and a cool head. This was a dangerous time for the Dark Hollow Pack. Members of The Hunters, a shadowy, mysterious group of monster hunters at war with the wolves for more than a hundred years, had been spotted again in the woods the day before by scouts. The council, made up of Marco, Ian, various gamma leaders and Casey, their newly named battle leader, had called an emergency session.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to put everything else off and concentrate on this. The mines can work themselves with the supervisors, so I don\u2019t have to make any more trips for a while.\u201d He sighed before getting into it. \u201cOur friends in the valley have reported a great increase in Hunters in Brevard, in the valley, walking around the streets of town. They\u2019re not trying to hide their presence there in the least, and the word is they\u2019re gathering, maybe for a concerted attack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet \u2019em come,\u201d said one of the younger gamma leaders. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for them.\u201d The a lpha thinned his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt they\u2019ll come. The question is when and in what force? They have an advantage over us in that they don\u2019t have mates and pets to protect, as we do.\u201d</p><p>Casey spoke up. He was in the process of settling his Sapphire Pack, or the Ridge Pack as the mountain clan usually called them, at the stronghold, Mountainwood, foregoing his position as their alpha to take over as battle leader for the combined group. Marco had suggested the merger after Casey mated with Rory. Casey had agreed, recognizing the safety in numbers, and the extra strength the merger gave both groups.</p><p>\u201cWe have a plan for that, Alpha. If The Hunters attack, the pets and mates will all be taken to the safe rooms downstairs. We picked the rooms up from the manufacturer and brought them back here two days ago. The safe rooms are fireproof and have an armor-hard plate for resistance against both low and high caliber projectiles. We\u2019ll have trained gammas inside with the pets to provide extra protection. In the case of total destruction of our forces, the wolves have their orders. No one will be taken alive for experimentation or torture.\u201d</p><p>A tense silence fell over the room, and the a lpha nodded shortly. \u201cGood. We can\u2019t be worried about them while we\u2019re fighting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Casey replied. \u201cThat\u2019s why Rory will be one of those gammas inside with the pets.\u201d</p> <p>Marco nodded. Rory, Casey\u2019s mate, another wolf, had provided them with an unusual situation they were all still adjusting to. Wolves mating wolves had never happened before in any of their lifetimes. After a rough start, the mating was settling nicely, and Rory seemed to be happy with the relationship.</p><p>\u201cAny reports of the leaders being in town?\u201d Ian was worried about the unusual escalation of tensions. The Hunters had been attacking with increasing regularity. Though the group remained mysterious and shadowy, the wolves had managed to glean a little intelligence over the years. They knew, for instance, the names of several of the top leaders and had a description circulated to all their sources and humans friends of the pack. If the leaders were in town, the threat was even more serious, and an attack could be imminent.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m afraid so,\u201d replied Casey. \u201cElias Winters, their equivalent of alpha leader, arrived a week ago and was seen three nights ago in Brevard at a restaurant downtown. He was in the company of several young Hunters, probably bodyguards. He\u2019s not hiding his presence in the least.\u201d</p><p>The alpha nodded thoughtfully. \u201cSo he wants us to know he\u2019s around. Why is that, I wonder,\u201d he said with a frown, deep in thought for a moment before he continued.\u201cHow\u2019s the interrogation of the prisoner going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not talking. He\u2019s well trained to resist any methods we use. He might break under torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich we won\u2019t use. We\u2019re not the monsters they believe us to be. Any ideas on other waysto break him?\u201d</p> <p>Casey smiled. \u201cOne. We choose a wolf to change him to Werekin.\u201d</p><p>Ian spoke up for the first time. \u201cI\u2019d only be comfortable with that as an absolute last resort. Until now our laws only permit turning humans into Werekin if they\u2019re blood matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Marco said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about using him as a bargaining chip?\u201d one of the gammas asked.</p><p>Casey shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent word and been ignored. The Hunters have never bargained with wolves before. We could keep trying, but the way I see it, we have three options. We can release him,kill him, or change him.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cUnless they would agree to a truce in trade for him, no release. He\u2019s seen too much and can identify too many of our leaders now.\u201d</p><p>Casey frowned and clenched his fists. \u201cBesides that, he shot my mate and almost killed him. Not to mention shooting you, Marco.That alone is punishable by death.\u201d</p><p>Ian shifted in his seat. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure which of them did the actual shooting. We\u2019re at war, after all. He\u2019s no more than a soldier following orders.\u201d</p> <p>Marco looked thoughtful. \u201cIf it comes to a choice between killing him and changing him, I think we\u2019d have to change him, even though he wouldn\u2019t thank us. With the mindset he\u2019s in now, he\u2019d probably prefer death than beingWerekin if we asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s only because he doesn\u2019t know the truth,\u201d Ian insisted in frustration.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his choice, anyway. We have to protect our people. Like you said, we\u2019re at war.\u201d Casey slapped a hand on the table. \u201cI say go for it. Once he\u2019s turned, he\u2019ll be more pliable and might be able togive us some valuable information.\u201d He looked around the table slowly. \u201cThe question is,who do we get to do it?\u201d</p><p>Marco seemed puzzled. \u201cWell, any of us could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a braver wolf than I am,\u201d Casey said with a laugh. \u201cRory would kill both me and the Hunter and take great pleasure in doing it. I don\u2019t even like to think about what Nicky would do if you took another mate.\u201d</p><p>Marco got a blank look on his face. \u201cMate? No, I could change him, but I can\u2019t mate with anyone else. My mate is Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Ian said. \u201cOnce you change the Hunter, he\u2019ll be in heat. You, better than anyone else, know how a human can get when they\u2019re in heat.That\u2019s why we\u2019ve never changed any but blood matches before and always followed immediately with a mating. You know how Nicky was until you got to him after Rory had to bite him to save his life. He had to have sex and only with his blood mate.They\u2019re insatiable at first. We\u2019d have to keep the Hunter locked up without a mating,and then we don\u2019t know what could happen if he weren\u2019t able to satisfy the urges until they passed. The only way we know to get them through it without adverse reactions is a complete mating with frequent sex until they come out of it. We know in the old days it was done without mating, but we have no experience at it, and nothing in the old books I could find gave us any more information on why they did it, or how.\u201d</p><p>Casey added, \u201cSomehow, I don\u2019t see Nicky going along with it\u2014even for the good of the pack. No, whoever changes him would have to mate with him.\u201d</p><p>The look on Marco\u2019s face as he pictured Nicky\u2019s reaction was priceless, and though Ian contained his mirth with a smile, Casey convulsed in laughter. Everyone knew Nicky, Marco\u2019s gorgeous human male pet, totally ran Marco, no matter how much Marco thought he was in charge.</p><p>Ian tried to bring the subject back to their primary focus. \u201cVery funny, Casey, but that doesn\u2019t solve the problem. We also don\u2019t know, for certain, if once he\u2019s changed, even with the mating bond, he won\u2019t still hate us and everything we stand for, putting him in constant conflict with the compulsions the bond creates. It could drive him mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but at least, a mating would have the most chance of turning his beliefs around,\u201d Marco said.\u201cIt would have to be someone who isn\u2019t already mated or likely to be. If we mate a wolf to the Hunter andthe wolf\u2019s blood match comes along later, he\u2019d want to be released to be with the blood mate, which would be a situation unfair to both wolf and Hunter, especially if they develop a love match.\u201d</p><p>Casey snorted over the last statement as if no wolf could ever love a Hunter. Ian could see another problem developing if they did succeed in turning the Hunter, an undying animosity in some of the wolves, who would have difficulty accepting a Hunter among them.</p><p>\u201cYes, but who would that be? Who has no mate or is not likely to have one?\u201d one of the gammas asked.</p><p>Two sets of eyes swung toward the beta. \u201cNo!\u201d Ian held up his hands to ward Marco and Caseyoff. \u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Ian, it does make sense. Maybe it\u2019s time you took one for the team.\u201d Casey laughed heartily at his own joke, while everyone else smiled at Ian in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another mate. My mate is dead.\u201d Ian folded his arms across his chest. He still grieved for his wife and always would. Still, what they said made sense, even if in talking them out of changing the Hunter, he\u2019d talked himself into a corner.</p><p>The alpha spoke up quietly. \u201cIan, I can certainly sympathize. I thought I lost Nicky last year, and the idea doesn\u2019t even bear thinking about. You\u2019ve been so strong, and we all admire you for that, but you\u2019re too young to climb into the grave. Your blood match passed away, so there won\u2019t be another for you, and you haven\u2019t expressed interest in anyone else for all this time. Perhaps you should think seriously about this. I\u2019d never order you to, of course, but it would help us. Think about it. If we can\u2019t find any wolf willing to mate with him, we\u2019ll have to execute him. We can\u2019t just let him go or keep him locked in a cell forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Silent, Ian studied his hands on the table thoughtfully. Maybe he should go look at the prisoner, see what he was like. He did owe that much at least to the pack. \u201cI\u2019ll go see him.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded and stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s leave it at that for now. Bring me the scouting reports as soon as they come in and keep the guards on high alert. We\u2019ll meet again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>The alpha turned to Ian. \u201cIn the meantime, why don\u2019t we go have a look at the prisoner? His name is Logan. Whether that\u2019s a first name or a last, I can\u2019t tell you. That\u2019s all he\u2019ll give us. He\u2019s hostile and, I think, pretty frightened though he does a good job of not showing it. Maybe he\u2019ll tell you more, but I think he\u2019s too deeply into his dying for the cause mode right now. He sees all of us as monsters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go see him, but I can\u2019t promise anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d Marco moved toward the door and turned to Ian when he got there. \u201cHe refuses to eat or drink anything besides water. Thinks we\u2019re going to poison him, I guess. C\u2019mon, you can let me know what you decide.\u201d</p><p>As they walked, Ian thought about the gravity of what he considered. Once a wolf took on a mate, human or Werekin, the mate became their responsibility forever. There would be no going back. Wolves mated monogamously for life, usually to a blood match. Awolf\u2019s blood sang out when the wolf encountered his true mate. For Ian, it had happened with his wife, Maria. They\u2019d known each other since childhood and mated as soon as their parents allowed. They\u2019d had five blissful years together before Maria and their baby died in childbirth. Since that time, he\u2019d had no interest in anyone else for anything other than casual sexual gratification.</p><p>Mates for a wolf could be either male or female. No stigma was attached to same sex matings, with wolves having little control over who their blood chose for them. Once the choice was made, they were totally attracted to the other person; even their scent called to them. If the blood match died, a wolf could still mate again, and the match was another lifetime bond, but it was a more natural, human attraction. As with humans, the attraction could be very strong and powerful. For Ian, it hadn\u2019t happened. This match he was contemplating might not even be compatible, let alone contain any affection other than simple lust and the compulsion for obedience the mating bite created. A loveless match could be miserable even with the bond the mating ritual would form.</p><p>He sighed. He\u2019d said he\u2019d go look at the man. It probably was a good solution, all things considered, and he was the only young widower in Mountainwood. He squared his shoulders and prepared himself to do what Casey had joked about\u2014take one for the team. * * * *</p> <p>Marco went with Ian as far as the corridor and motioned for him to go in alone . \u201cI don\u2019t want to influence you in any way. Go see him and make your decision.\u201d</p><p>The prisoner was lying on the cot against the back wall when Ian went in, his army issue camo clothing in rags, no doubt from the struggle when he was captured. His face, streaked with dried blood and dirt because he\u2019d refused to bathe in the pails of water they provided for him, still bore dark bruises and scabs.</p><p>\u201cGet away from me, you stinking animal. I told the others I\u2019m not going to talk about anything, so you\u2019re wasting your time.\u201d The young Hunter glared at Ian through the bars, practically spitting the words at him.</p><p>Ian stood quietly outside the cell with his arms folded, gazing in at the prisoner. Logan, the alpha said his name was. Logan was young, probably about twenty-five or twenty-six. His dark hair was curly, but he kept it cut short, so the curl barely showed. Ian guessed he nearly shaved it military style most of the time, probably becausehe didn\u2019t like the curls. If Logan was his, he\u2019d make him grow it out longer. Ian was momentarily startled at the thought. Where did that come from?</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyes were blue, heavily fringed by black lashes. Blue was Ian\u2019s favorite color for eyes. All the wolves had dark brown or hazel eyes, inherited from their Indian ancestors, so blue eyes were very exotic to him\u2014exotic, beautiful, and damn sexy, judging by the unexpected growing bulge in his jeans.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me, wolf?Get the hell out of here! I\u2019m not talking to any of you!\u201d</p> <p>Logan jumped to his feet and rushed up to the bars. Ian had to smile. The strongest human didn\u2019t have a quarter of the strength of a wolf in his human form. It would be the same as an adult human fighting a five-year-old child. The Hunter must know that, and still, he was posturing. Ian admired his courage. Logan bared his teeth at him and growled. Very nice teeth they were too, white and straight. He licked his lips afterward, and a hint of pink tongue showed between his full, sensuous lips. Ian found himself wanting to taste that tongue. A strange thought and as unexpected as his spontaneous erection. He hadn\u2019t experienced much physical desire for anyone since his mate passed away years ago. This human made his cock stir.</p><p>All in all, definitely a beautiful young man, muscular and well built. Ian knew Logan thought he abhorred the wolves as monstrous aberrations of nature. Of course, he only knew the lies and exaggerations he\u2019d been fed by the fanatical Hunters. Ian liked the idea of introducing him to the true nature of the wolf clan.</p><p>With the Werekin bite, he would go into an aroused state, commonly known as being in heat. Being a male, he wouldn\u2019t secrete any fluids other than pre-cum, but he would be in a state of hyper-arousal and want sex desperately. Rory had been very careful not to give the deeper, longermating bite when he bit Nicky to save his life, knowing he was Marco\u2019s blood mate. Marco arrived before Nicky progressed far enough for them to truly know what would happen if he had not been mated. Through the ages, they knew of warnings against a Werekin bite without a mating. The reasons why had been lost over time.</p><p>What they did know was that once bitten everything would change for him. He would undergo a supernatural change. His body would become stronger, faster, and even more beautifully muscled. Not as strong as a wolf, of course, but much stronger than normal humans. Not only would he have an insatiable appetite for sex during heat, but once given the mating bite and receiving the wolf knot, he would be driven to do or say anything to please his mate, to always be near him, to obey, and please him. He would also need to drink wolf\u2019s blood in order to survive for the rest of his life.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, wolf?\u201d Logan yelled, jerking Ian out of his considerations and the possible repercussions of the step he contemplated taking. No, he knew he would do this. Almost from the first moment he laid eyes on Logan, he\u2019d known he would go through with it. This man was his.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to kill me, go ahead and do it! Do it now! I\u2019m ready!\u201d He banged the flat of his hand against the bars.</p><p>Ian took a step toward him, and Logan jumped back, startled by the quick movement. He quickly recovered, though, and tensed his body, ready for a fight. Ian managed not to smile. The young man really was entertaining. Undeniably handsome too. He would probably be a handful to any wolf who took him on. To me. He\u2019ll be my handful from now on.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say something? Why are you just staring at me like that?\u201d Ian made up his mind and spun, walking away. He needed to speak to Marco. He found him leaning against the wall, speaking softly to the guard. He turned when he heard Ian coming.</p> <p>\u201cWell? Have you decided?\u201d Ian took a deep breath. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll turn him, but I won\u2019t mate without his agreement after the Werekin bite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreement?\u201d Marco shook his head. \u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t agree?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll find out what happens when the heat isn\u2019t satisfied. I know it\u2019s not traditional, but I won\u2019t force him any further than the Werekin bite. If he\u2019s forced, he\u2019ll never accept me or our people. He\u2019s too stubborn.He\u2019s also brave and very handsome. He has a lot to learn, for sure. If he agrees, I think he\u2019ll make a good mate for me once he adjusts, and we have an opportunity here to learn a great deal about the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Marco put his hand on his shoulder. \u201cA good beta to the core. Always thinking of the good of the pack.\u201d He drew Ian to the side and lowered his voice. \u201cDon\u2019t do this if you\u2019re not attracted to him, Ian. I\u2019m not about to make you sacrifice yourself. There are other young wolves impatient for a mate we can try, or we can do as you said, turn him and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Ian surprised himself at how quickly the word came from his mouth. \u201cThe boy is mine.\u201d Ian dropped his gaze, not wanting to challenge his alpha, but he\u2019d made his decision. \u201cI-I mean, no, Alpha. He belongs to me.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cOf course, if that\u2019s your decision. When do you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince he\u2019s not eating and making himself unwell, I think we should go ahead right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. Let\u2019s go get him.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Logan paced back and forth across the small cell. Since he\u2019d been captured by these fiends, he\u2019d resigned himself to a fast and painful death, but things weren\u2019t working out quickly at all. He\u2019d been captured over a week ago in a reconnaissance operation turned terribly wrong.</p><p>He and the other operatives, four H unters in all, had ventured too close to the wolves\u2019 compound and been spotted by an alpha wolf and another young man. One of the Hunters panicked and shot at them, wounding them, but not enough to incapacitate the big wolf. He\u2019d shifted into his wolf form\u2014the first time Logan had witnessed such a thing, and it still brought shivers to his spine\u2014and attacked them. They should have withdrawn then with the informationthey\u2019d gathered. They had identified the alpha. The squad leader refused, wanting to kill the alpha and weaken the pack before they returned to the compound. On the second attempt, wolves had run up out of nowhere. As he was about to take aim at one of them, he was knocked to the ground and surrounded. The memory of being surrounded by the bristling wolves, with one standing on his chest, fangs snapping at him, ripping his clothes to shreds,was something he\u2019d have nightmares about forever. Why none of them actually bit him he still didn\u2019t understand. His most severewounds hadn\u2019t come until they transformed to their human shapes and beat the hell out of him to subdue him when he refused to surrender. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They took him alive, though he knew the others had been killed in a brief but fierce skirmish. The wolves had never taken a captive before to his knowledge, and they had questioned Logan relentlessly, stopping only to give his wounds some basic treatment after he fainted from loss of blood. He fell back on his training and refused to answer any of their questions, even though they threatened him without end.</p><p>Refusing to eat or drink anything they gave him, other than water, he was growing weaker, but he was afraid of being drugged. Of course, they could overpower him easily and inject him with drugs, but so far they hadn\u2019t resorted to that. He\u2019d been storing up knowledge of what he\u2019d seen and heard, in case he was somehow rescued. His father might try if he had any indication he was still alive, though knowing his father, he held little hope of that. The wolves had held onto him so long, he even hoped some kind of trade was being worked out. After the stare down he\u2019d had with that big wolf, he thought it more likely they\u2019d execute him soon. He and the other members of his squad had shot their alpha, trying to kill him, not to mention the other young man.</p><p>One of his guards taunted him with the knowledge the other young man they shot was the mate of the main interrogator, Casey, a big mean wolf they\u2019d known about since Logan\u2019s rotation for recon duty started a few months before. Casey had been the one who\u2019d interrogated him with the most determination too, and Logan had expected him more than once to bust into the cell and rip him apart. No wonder since he\u2019d been blamed for almost killing his mate. He knew the wolves often mated with other males, one thing his father used as proof of their debauchery and animalistic nature. What was more important to Logan than their unnatural mating habits was the fact they hadn\u2019t known Casey was another alpha. The clans were joining, information they needed at headquarters.</p> <p>Logan had mad e a mental map of what he\u2019d seen of the inside of the compound, matching the locations up with what they\u2019d seen from the outside, just to pass the time in his cell. If he could escape or was, by some stretch of his imagination, traded, all this would add to their knowledge of the wolves and possibly aid in their eventual destruction, of this murdering, thieving clan at least.</p><p>The new werewolf may not have been doing anything more than trying to intimidate him. He\u2019d stepped up close to the bars and stared in at him. He was a little older than Logan, probably around thirty. Dark hair and eyes like all the wolves, and like all of them, supernaturally attractive, with sculpted muscles like a bodybuilder, and a handsome face. His dark eyes were particularly intense as he stared at him. He never spoke a word even though Logan challenged him, tired of the cat and mouse game the creatures seemed to be playing, and then the guy had turned on his heel and left abruptly. If he was trying to intimidate him, he\u2019d succeeded. Logan was pretty sure they were done screwing with him even before the door opened again.</p><p>The new werewolf was back with two others, all three of them huge and imposing, including none other than the alpha, Marco. They came over to the cell door and opened it. This is it, Logan thought, tensing his muscles, though he knew struggling would be futile against these giants. He just hoped he would die well and not embarrass himself or his father. The one who\u2019d been staring at him came in and picked him up as if he were a child. He threw him over his shoulder, despite his struggles, and strode out of the cell with him. The others followed silently.</p><p>Logan was anything but silent. He cursed them and yelled himself hoarse until the one carrying him slapped his ass hard. Pain exploded across his butt cheeks and shot through his body. He was stunned into silence.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet!\u201d the wolf said, his voice authoritative and firm, but strangely not angry. Logan stopped struggling, a useless effort anyway. He was too fucking weak from the beating he\u2019d taken and from not eating to put up more than a token fight. He couldn\u2019t get away from the arm locked around his legs, and he only caused himself more pain by trying. Better to save his strength for the final moments. The wolf carried him to a sort of bedroom, a little like a hotel room, with a huge bed in the middle of the room. It seemed a strange place for an execution, but he tried to prepare himself for whatever was coming.</p> <p>\u201cI have to wash him first,\u201d the wolf holding him said to the others. \u201cHe reeks.\u201d He put Logan down on his feet, and all three ripped his clothes off. He was helpless in the face of such a concerted attack and stunned to find himself flat out on the floor, stripped naked in mere seconds. The first wolf grabbed him again, hauling him up to his feet. He pushed him into the bathroom while another one turned on the shower, adjusting the spray. They threw him inside. He fell back against the tiled wall, feeling vulnerable in his nudity, knowing it would be stupid to even try to cover up. Logan was horrified to see the first wolf removing his own clothing to step inside with him. With an inkling of what might be about to happen, he backed away as far as the tiny space would allow, cringing against the sides of the shower, trying hard not to look at the wolf\u2019s muscular body, after one frightened glance.</p><p>The big wolf poured a quantity of liquid soap in his hands and rubbed the creamy liquid all over Logan\u2019s body, despite Logan\u2019s efforts to push his hands away or get out. He screamed, cursed, and yelled, but nothing stopped the wolfman. He tried to throw himself against the door in a panic, but the wolf pulled him back and spun him around. He batted his hands away as if Logan was no more than a child, and to stop him from fighting at all, he simply locked Logan\u2019s arms down to his sides with one arm wrapped around him. He was helpless against the wolf\u2019s strength. Bracing his feet against the wall and pushing accomplished absolutely nothing. The wolf simply picked him up and shook him like a rag doll until he stopped struggling.</p><p>Holding him in one arm, the wolf soaped him well from head to toe. He released each arm, one at a time, and used the soap liberally on his underarms, Logan strained away, pushing on his chest as hard as he could. The wolf spent way too much time on his groin area for Logan\u2019s peace of mind. As much as he hated it, the treatment was giving him a damned hard-on. Most humiliating of all, the wolf put up one foot on a seat in the shower, picked Logan up as if he weighed nothing and draped his body over his knee. With one hand holding Logan down at the neck, he scrubbed hard at his ass, shoving a soapy finger all the way up inside. Logan kicked and screamed his outrage and anger. What the hell could be happening? Was this some kind of ritualistic killing where the victim had to be cleaned and purified first? Or was the beast preparing him for what he feared the most?</p><p>The wolf ignored his struggles, set him down, rinsed him off and stepped out of the shower, dragging him along with an arm around his waist. The other two attacked him with towels, drying him off, roughly but efficiently. The wolf who\u2019d bathed him picked him up again, carried him back to the bedroom, and threw him on the bed.</p><p>Logan scooted back up to the headboard. \u201cStay away from me! What are you doing?\u201d he screamed at the still naked wolf.</p><p>Advancing toward the bed with a determined look on his face, the wolf told the other two, \u201cHold him, so he doesn\u2019t hurt himself.\u201d</p> <p>They captured his arms and legs, ignoring his shouts, and finally his pleas. He was a brave man, and being killed was one thing. Being raped by one of these monsters was quite another. Two of them dragged him to the foot of the bed and sat him up on the edge, holding him firmly on either side with hands locked on his shoulders and arms and their legs locked over his to prevent him from even kicking. Logan got one terrifying glance at a mouth full of extended canines before the naked one took hold of his head, pushed his chin to his chest, and bit him on the back of the neck.</p><p>Logan screamed. Sharp fangs sliced cleanly through his tender skin causing excruciating pain. A burning fire flared through him, lancing his spine with agony. He thought he could literally feel the hot poison from the fangs racing through his veins. He wanted to claw at his neck, but he was held down too firmly to do more than shake with rage and pain. The pain reached his groin, and the burning centered there, setting him on fire.</p><p>He screamed even louder and writhed in agony. Just when he thought he\u2019d pass out from the pain, it morphed into a searing rush of pleasure. He screamed, and his body arched with an incredible sensation rippling through him. Helpless, Logan could only moan as the pain faded away and wave after wave of sexual bliss took its place. He tried to reach for his cock, no longer burning, but throbbing and aching for a touch. The wolves on either side of him kept his arms imprisoned relentlessly. He yelled out some mindless sound and had a fucking climax, spurting his hands-free orgasm across the room. He arched his back and screamed one last time before the stars exploded behind his eyes. Blessed darkness fell down like a curtain.</p><p>He came awake slowly, first aware of the soft bed beneath him after days spent on the hard cot of the cell. He felt\u2014wonderful\u2014warm and strong, yet he wanted, no, he needed desperately, his hips twitching with his cock rigid and aching. He opened his eyes to three wolves staring down at him in what he could swear was no more than curiosity. His eyes passed over the first two and came to rest on the one who had bathed and bitten him. He jerked in surprise and recognition, and his cock got even harder. The presence of the other two faded from his awareness in comparison. They could have been statues craved of granite for all the attention he paid them.</p><p>The wolf who had bitten him, standing over him so gloriously naked, was simply the most beautiful, delightful, delicious creature he\u2019d ever seen. He\u2019d noticed before the wolf was handsome, but how could he not have noticed how gorgeous he was. Truly gorgeous, like a freakin\u2019 movie star. He looked down at the wolf\u2019s big cock and could swear a whimper came out of his own throat. Huge and thick, it was in partial erection, so Logan could see he was uncut, with an odd, round thing around the base of it, like nothinghe\u2019d ever seen before. The monster cock leaked pre-cum, flowing down in a dribble from the head, just peeking out from the foreskin.Logan had never seen a man who hadn\u2019t been circumcised before. Some tiny part of him was a little repulsed at the sight of the uncut cock and the thought of the animalistic nature of it touched his mind. Both only lasted for a moment, as he stared in admiration and lust. It was beautiful, really, natural and wild and primitive. When the wolf saw him staring at his cock, it suddenly began to swell into a huge, full erection. Logan, the conscious, aware part of him, wondered if it was for him, sprawled out naked on the bed. He hoped so, then flushed with shame, a whisper of disgust coming at him from the back of his mind. What was happening to him? Another whimper came out of his throat, and his hand reached for the wolf. All three of them smiled down at him and back at each other. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan didn\u2019t care. He couldn\u2019t stop himself from reaching. He didn\u2019t want to stop. He wanted the man\u2019s beautiful cock, standing up so long and thick from a mass of dark curls. He wanted nothing more than to taste it, lick it, and suck it like an ice cream cone, and shuddered. Where were these thoughts coming from? He shook his head as if to clear it, but it didn\u2019t help. He still wanted nothing more than his fingers around the man\u2019s cock. He touched, and the big man smiled down at him. He even patted him on the head. Would he let him taste it, too? Not even caring if the others watched, Logan put out his tongue and licked the enticing cock from the strange donut of flesh at the base to the tip. The big man gasped aloud and the pat on his head went to a clench, pulling his hair. He didn\u2019t pull Logan away, and Logan went back for more.</p><p>He spoke softly to the others. \u201cI can handle him from here.\u201d His voice sounded hoa rse. \u201cThanks for your help. I think I need to take care of him right away.\u201d</p><p>They nodded and moved away, leaving them alone together. Logan was desperate to get to his cock and thrilled when his beautiful man lay down beside him and gathered him in his arms. His man?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d the voice in the back of his head whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s wolf, an animal. You want nothing to do with it.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t want to hear. He wanted to listen to the man beside him.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Ian, and I want to mate you now. Do you understand?\u201d He held Logan\u2019s face between his hands and shook him slightly. \u201cConcentrate. You aren\u2019t too far gone to say no if you don\u2019t want this. I\u2019m going to mate with you. Sex. You\u2019ve studied our customs. You know what that means. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded his head. He understood and though he\u2019d never before wanted another man, he wanted this one. Wanted him so badly his hips already moved, his own cock rigid with need. He put his hand down to it and stroked himself, pulling at it as he gazed at the man. Ian, what a beautiful name. He tried it on his tongue. \u201cIan,\u201d he said softly, and the big man smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. Last chance before we start. Do you agree to mate with me?\u201d Logan nodded again. \u201cYou can stop it if you want to, but only to a certain point. Once we reach that point, I won\u2019t be able to stop. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s head bobbed up and down eagerly. \u201cYes. I want you. Your body is...\u201d He licked his lips and tried to express what he was feeling. \u201cI think your body is amazing.\u201d Puzzlement nagged at him. \u201cI\u2019m not gay. I never wanted this before, but...\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled at him tenderly and kissed the tip of his nose. Logan\u2019s doubts melted away.</p><p>\u201cYour body is amazing too, and sometimes the body knows better than the conscious mind. You want me, you want this, or your reaction wouldn\u2019t be so strong,\u201d Ian told him. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cL-Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan Winters,\u201d he murmured, cuddling closer to Ian, trying to get his nose up in Ian\u2019s neck. He vaguely remembered there was some reason he never wanted to tell these men, these wolves, his full name, but he no longer cared. This man-wolf smelled so damn good.</p><p>Logan\u2019s mind seemed to be almost split, with one large part of him trying to practically climb inside this beautiful man, and the other minuscule part standing back in amazement and confusion, telling him again he wasn\u2019t gay and reminding him that this was a wolf, a monster, his enemy, and not a man.</p><p>All he could think about was sucking the big man\u2019s cock. He\u2019d always believed in the past that wolves were bad. Wolves were freaks, abominations of nature, evil. The confused part of him didn\u2019t care, not anymore, not with the way the man looked into his eyes, not with what he saw there. He trusted this man with his life. It was unreasonable, and he knew that with a distant part of his mind, but the feeling was also true and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cYour name is Logan Winters? Are you any relation to Elias Winters, baby?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, frowning. His voice turnedbitter. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, still trying to get closer. \u201cHe\u2019s my father.\u201d</p><p>Ian drew back and smiled down at him. \u201cYour father? Really?\u201d</p><p>His voice had a surprised tone. Why was that? God, did he know his father? He pushed the idea away. He raised his gaze and saw the gorgeous man waiting patiently for his answer, his warm, dark eyes approving of him, admiring him, encouraging him, and he felt a little thrill run through him. He wanted to please him more than anything.</p><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s my father.\u201d He hated his father, didn\u2019t want to think of him. He wanted the man lying next to him and put a hand around the back of his neck to pull him down.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, let me explain something to you. Once we mate, you will belong to me. We\u2019ll be together forever. You\u2019ll never be alone. It will be my job to take care of you, protect you, and make sure you\u2019re happy. Can you focus on that for just a minute?\u201d</p> <p>Logan nodding vigorously again. \u201cSure.\u201d Belong to him. Protect him and make him happy. How nice it would be to belong to someone who cared.</p><p>Ian chuckled softly. \u201cYou\u2019re in heat, honey. I\u2019m going to make love to you now and that should ease you some. Lie on your back, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Eagerly Logan lay down, though he couldn\u2019t pull his hands away. His hips moved in anticipation, and he pulled again at his own cock. Ian gently pushed Logan\u2019s legs apart and knelt between them. He tapped Logan\u2019s hands and smiled teasingly.</p><p>\u201cUh-uh. That\u2019s mine, baby. Let me take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s hand fell away, and his breathing quickened. He clutched at the sheet beneath him, grabbing handfuls of it and thrust his hips upward. Ian bent and took the head of his cock in his warm mouth, swirling his tongue over the broad tip, licking at the drops of precum, before sticking his tongue right down into the slit. Logan\u2019s hips almost bucked off the bed. Ian caught him and pushed him back down. Holding him effortlessly, he bent again and took the whole length of Logan\u2019s cock into his mouth, made his cheeks hollow and sucked him right to the back of his throat.</p><p>Logan couldn\u2019t hold back and shot his load, his hips straining against the big hands holding him down, driven to fuck hismouth. Ian sucked his cum down, sucking until he\u2019d milked him for every drop and licking up the softening shaft to drop a kiss on the head.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, darling, you\u2019re responding beautifully.\u201d He moved his hands so they stroked up and down his sides. \u201cRoll over on your stomach, baby.\u201d</p><p>Logan eagerly rolled over, still breathing hard but hoping against hope Ian would put that magnificent cock up inside him. He had no experience with cocks in his ass, either big or small, but he was so eager to have Ian\u2019s he squirmed and twisted his ass in invitation.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to take this slow, baby. It will hurt because you\u2019re so tight, but just keep pushing out, and if you need me to stop, tell me. I\u2019ll be able to stop for a little while, but probably not for long, okay?\u201d</p><p>Something cold spread up the crevice between his cheeks and on his virgin entrance. Looking back over his shoulder, he watched Ian caressing him with some kind of oil, pushing in and out of his hole with his fingertip.</p><p>\u201cThis oil will help you, sweetheart. It has a numbing ingredient so this won\u2019t hurt so badly.\u201d</p><p>Logan sucked in a breath and hunched at the unaccustomed sensation when the thick finger slid inside him, then relaxed, pushingback against it. Ian\u2019s finger reached inside his ass and explored gently. The new sensation set his hips pumping the mattress. Ian chuckled and put a hand on his lower back to hold him still. His finger, when a second joined the first, burned at first, and then Ian hooked his fingers and touched a spot. Logan squealed in surprised delight. What the hell was that? It almost made him come again, and he\u2019d never been able to come again so quickly or have his cock spring back up so soon after he had. He looked back over his shoulder and Ian smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cThat was your prostate, baby. Did you like that?\u201d</p><p>He touched it again. Logan moaned even louder and fought to hump his hips. Ian\u2019s big hand wouldn\u2019t let him. Nothing larger than a doctor\u2019s finger sheathed with a rubber glove had ever been inside him, and despite the desire running through his body, he felt a momentary unease. He\u2019d never felt anything like it before, and tensed again when a third finger slipped inside him. Too much, yet he seemed to want what was happening desperately. Still he was frightened whenthe tip of Ian\u2019s huge cock nudged up to his hole and Ian pushed slowly, steadily against the barrier of his tight hole\u2019s ring of muscle.</p><p>\u201cUp on your hands and knees, sweetheart. It\u2019ll make it easier. Push out, Logan. It will help you take me in.\u201d</p><p>Did he want this man, this wolf, inside him? God, yes, he wanted him! Was it wrong? Yes, the distant voice in his head cried. It\u2019s unnatural. Logan ignored the voice, casting it away.</p><p>Logan pushed out as directed and soon the crown of the big cock slid through, easing the pressure somewhat. Deeper and deeper the cock went, filling Logan until he thought his ass would rip wide open. Still his insane body wanted more. Ian moved gently, back and forth, in and out, deeper each time, all the way in. The last time his heavy balls grazed Logan\u2019s ass. Logan\u2019s groans filled the room, half pain, half pleasure. Stretched to receive Ian as far as he thought he\u2019d ever be able to go, it burned terribly. Still the discomfort eased as his body adjusted.Even more, Ian thrilled him, satisfying a need he hadn\u2019t even known he\u2019d had. A rhythm set up, driving Logan wild. Every time the man\u2014wolf, the inner voice cried\u2014Ian, the stronger voice countered\u2014came close to the special spot and touched it, Logan was swept away in rapture. His own dick went rigid again, painfully so, and he moved his hand to clench it, give it a fist to fuck. Ian blocked his hand.</p><p>\u201cNo, sweetheart. That\u2019s mine, now. I\u2019ll take care of you. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded, accepting the idea, making him feel so helpless yet so owned. His own body didn\u2019t belong to him anymore. He was Ian\u2019s. Why was that exciting to him? He thought he might come anyway, but Ian squeezed the base of his dick between his forefinger and thumb. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>Logan felt the huge knot at the base of Ian\u2019s penis nudge him. Strange, the sight of the knot hadn\u2019t bothered him even when the voice at the back of his head whispered it was a mutation. Nothuman at all, yet he\u2019d accepted it as just another exotic aspect of the man-wolf. For the first time, he wondered about it. What was Ian going to do? He couldn\u2019t be thinking that huge knot of flesh would fit up inside of him. Could he? The idea made him panic a little, and he whimpered.</p><p>Immediately, Ian stoppedand kissed the side of his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, baby. It will hurt, but you can do this. Your body will stretch to take me. Once it\u2019s inside, we\u2019ll be mated forever.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s fingers worked around Logan\u2019s hole, massaging with the oil and pulling his cheeks apart to open him more. It hurt again. Logan squirmed and moaned.</p><p>\u201cSorry, honey, I know it hurts. Try your best to relax and push out as it goes in.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the baseball sized knot at the base of his penis against Logan again, working it in and pullingLogan\u2019s hole wider with his oiled fingers. Logan whimpered, moaned, and tried desperately to crawl away. Ian\u2019s weight bore him face down flat on the bed effortlessly, not allowing him to move away an inch, spreading his legs wide. Pressing the knot of flesh, pulling his hole up and out, Ian forced the knot halfway in. Logan screamed with a flash of agony spearing through him when the knot popped through and his hole clenched tight, holding it in. He sucked in a breath and then moaned in pleasure from the pressure against his prostate.</p><p>A climax started, rippled, and rolled through him. Moaning, he barely felt Ian pumping hard and fast into his ass, Ian climaxing,filling his ass with cum, or Ian\u2019s sharp fangs piercing the flesh of his neck a second time, going deeper than before. A sharp spear of pain followed by pleasure swept down his body, mingling together with the agonizing ache of his ass, the ecstasy of the pressure on his prostate, building, consuming his entire body in a huge seizure of delight. His arms flailed above his head. Ian caught his hands and held him still while he screamed.</p><p>Wave after wave of orgasm wracked every nerve, every muscle. He couldn\u2019t breathe, and he couldn\u2019t stop until the last ounce of pleasure had been wrung from him, leaving him weak as it faded, and gasping for breath. He lay absolutely still for all of thirty seconds, just panting for breath as Ian held him, pleasure subsiding, pain rebuilding when the pleasure of another climax started up. He screamed as it came on. Ian kissed the sides of his neck and licked at his nape as long as it lasted, speaking soothing words to him even when he went limp again.</p><p>Time moved in slow motion for what seemed hours with climax after climax ripping through him. When it faded, he was exhausted, almost incapacitated. He\u2019d had too many to count, and had a wild thought of this being the way they were going to kill him. If it was, it was certainly a humane way to go. He would be glad to highly recommend it.</p><p>Logan turned to look over his shoulder at the man, the wolf, sprawled over his body, his cock buried in Logan\u2019s ass, and the knot, crowding his insides with pain and pleasure. Ian\u2019s penis was still hard inside him. Shivering, he asked, \u201cIs it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot quite, baby.\u201d</p><p>The beginnings of another orgasm started, and Logan arched his back. How much longer could this last? How much more could he take? \u201cW-will I die soon?\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled in his ear. \u201cNo, darlin\u2019. I\u2019ve got you. You belong to me now, and nothing will ever hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, no more. Please pull out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Logan. Once I gave you my knot, there was no stopping. My gland won\u2019t allow it until we\u2019re finished and the swelling goes down. Not much longer now.\u201d</p><p>An orgasm began. Once more, Logan was filled with the mindless pleasure, jerking his body until everything went black. He awoke a few minutes later, to discover he was finally free, stretched out on his back, Ian beside him. He was so relieved; he smiled at Ian with exhaustion.</p><p>Ian bit into his wrist and opened up a bloody wound.</p><p>Logan cried out in horror. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d He grabbed the wrist and put it to his mouth, startling Ian, who stared down at him with a strange expression on his face. Logan sucked at his wrist. He\u2019d been taught somewhere\u2014he couldn\u2019t quite remember where\u2014to suck at a werewolf\u2019s bite and spit out the venom. Even as he lowered his head to Ian\u2019s wrist he realized he was acting irrationally, but he only wanted to protect his mate and keep him safe. He acted on instinct, but instead of spitting it out, he found the taste incredible. He swallowed, sucking harder, not needing the encouragement of his head held still with one strong hand and the bloody wound pressed tightly to his mouth.</p><p>\u201cFeed on my blood, baby.\u201d</p><p>Feed? Yes, feed. The taste was indescribable. Logan gripped Ian\u2019s arm with both hands, fastening onto it with his mouth. He couldn\u2019t get enough. He sucked the blood in and swallowed in gulps, his eyes rolling back into his head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, honey. Feed on my blood. It will make you stronger, faster, even more beautiful. The more you drink, the faster you\u2019ll change to full Werekin.\u201d</p><p>Logan heard what he said, and a very small part of him rebelled against the idea. He tried to pull away, but Ian held his head. \u201cSuck, Logan. This is the last step. You\u2019re mine now. There is no going back.\u201d</p> <p>Logan wondered if he should feel bad about that, but he didn\u2019t. He belonged. He belonged to Ian, and the idea didn\u2019t freak him out at all. He\u2019d wanted to belong to someone his whole life. He kept sucking. The taste was heaven in his mouth, and it was making him stronger, even stronger than the surge of strength from the first bite. He could feel strength building in him and at the same time, he could deny Ian nothing. He belonged to him body and soul, and Ian was right. There would be no going back for him. He didn\u2019t want to go back. He loved him so much.</p><p>Sated, and too drowsy to stay awake, Logan could do no more than watch Ian tuck him under the covers. He was aware of Ian getting up and dressing, leaving Logan alone in the bed. Logan wanted to stay awake, but was dragged down by sleep, almost unconscious with the need for it, and he was hot, so hot he wanted to throw the covers off.</p><p>Ian bent over and kissed his lips. \u201cNow, little Hunter,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re my sweet pet. Will you like that role, I wonder? I hope so, darlin\u2019. Sleep tight.\u201d He moved his hands caressingly over Logan\u2019s cock, only half hard, and gave it a final pat before going to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for you later. Stay in bed until I get back.\u201d</p><p>Ian knocked on the a lpha\u2019s door, smiling when Nicky swung it open. Nicky looked gorgeous, as usual. He was lean, but his body was perfect, with well-defined muscles rippling down his naked chest and arms. His face had been so downright pretty when he first came to Mountainwood,he\u2019d sometimes been mistaken at first glance for a girl. Nicky had hated that, and over the past year, as his body changed more to Werekin, some of that prettiness had faded, leaving a strikingly handsome face. His golden-blond hair was shot through with natural platinum highlights, so pretty Marco had him keep his hair long. Ian had always greatly admired him and thought if Nickybelonged to him, he\u2019d keep him in his bed most of the day. The idea led him to the pleasurable thoughts of his own beautiful mate. He would have Logan wear his hair long too, so he could run his hands through it. He would keep him in bed all day long anytime he chose. The idea made his crotch tighten. He tried to focus his attention more on Nicky.</p><p>Apparently, Nicky hadn\u2019t been out of bed too long himself. His lovely hair was tousled, and his eyes were still sleepy and heavy-lidded. Ian couldn\u2019t help glancing at his watch. It was oneo\u2019clock.</p><p>\u201cCome in, Ian . It\u2019s good to see you. Marco\u2019s over there, and if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll go finish my breakfast. Marco\u2019s being mean to me \u2019cause I slept a little later than usual.\u201d</p><p>Marco rolled his eyes heavenward and called out to Ian. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came by, Ian. Have you had a chance to speak to the prisoner yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo Logan,\u201d Ian corrected, not liking his mate referred to as a prisoner.\u201cNo, we\u2019ve barely finished the bonding. But he did tell me his name, and I had to come to tell you as soon as he slept for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree hours?\u201d Marco questioned.</p><p>\u201cHis response was intense,\u201d Ian answered blandly.</p><p>Nicky whirled around from the nearby kitchen counter. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d His pretty eyes narrowed suspiciously. \u201cIs something going on with the Hunter? Bonding?\u201d He turned an accusing, outraged gaze to Marco. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me anything!\u201d</p><p>Marco sighed. \u201cNicky, please stay out of this, honey. I\u2019m talking business here with my beta. We\u2019ve talked about this interference of yours before.\u201d</p><p>Nicky narrowed his eyes, the look promising retribution later for the dismissive attitude. He turned instead to Ian, giving him a sweet, flirtatious smile. His tone changed from accusatory to teasing. \u201cIan, you\u2019ll tell me, won\u2019t you? What\u2019s going on with the Hunter\u2014oh, you called him Logan, right?\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled, unable to resist Nicky when he turned on the charm. \u201cYes, Nicky. I\u2019ve taken him for my mate. We decided at council meeting this morning we only had a few options where he was concerned. We could either kill him or turn him. Once I saw him, I couldn\u2019t let him be executed. I not only turned him, I mated with him.\u201d</p><p>Nicky\u2019s mouth fell open in shock and pleasure.\u201cIan, that\u2019s so amazing. Was it love at first sight? Is he handsome?Can I meet him?\u201d</p><p>Marco rolled his eyes.\u201cNicky, you sound like a teenage girl.\u201d</p><p>Nicky narrowed his eyes and gave Marco a look that would have dropped a lesser man dead in his tracks. He turned back to Ian.\u201cI\u2019m only curious, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled good-naturedly. \u201cI know, Nicky, and yes, I guess so, to all of the above, but give him a chance to settle in a little first. He\u2019s deep in heat and still reacting to the change. Once that wears off, I\u2019m afraid he might be a bit of a handful.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy do you say so, Ian? Did he resist the mating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all.\u201d He chuckled, proud of his little mate. \u201cIt\u2019s just considering who he is, I think he may have some trouble settling in.\u201d</p><p>Marco glanced at Nicky. \u201cYeah, good luck with that,\u201d he said ironically. \u201cNow Nicky, if you\u2019re quite through with your questions, may Ian and I talk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead and talk. I\u2019m not stopping you.\u201d He turned back around to face the counter again, but Ian knew he was shamelessly eavesdropping.</p><p>Marco turned his attention back to Ian. \u201cYou said who he is. Is he someone we should know about?\u201d</p><p>Ian turned back to Marco with a smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to interrogate him, as I said, but he told me his name. It\u2019s Logan Winters. Elias Winters is his father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God! Are you certain?\u201d Marco jumped to his feet excitedly, and Nicky turned back around curiously.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean, Marco? Ian?Who is Elias Winters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cElias Winters is the leader of the Hunters, Nicky,\u201d Ian said quietly.</p><p>Nicky\u2019s mouth fell open in shock again. \u201cYou made their leader\u2019s son Werekin?He\u2019s your new mate?Oh my God!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need to call another council meeting right away to decide how we should proceed.\u201d Marco paced up and down the room. \u201cThis could change everything. It might even explain why Winters is in the valley.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to rush him too much, Alpha. He\u2019ll be in a very vulnerable state once he recovers from the mating, and Iwon\u2019t have him abused in any way.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked surprised. \u201cAbused? Me? No, of course not. Why would I want to abuse him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want to, but you might push him too hard for information and scare him to death,\u201d Nicky said with a sideways glance.</p><p>Marco looked surprised. \u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you. I know you\u2019re a big pussycat, but you don\u2019t look like one. You can be very intimidating.\u201d Nicky walked past Marco and patted his cheek, leaving Marco looking after him in outrage.</p><p>\u201cPussycat?\u201d Marco repeated and growled at Nicky, who ignored him. Nicky stood by Ian. \u201cTake your time, Ian, and don\u2019t let the council rush you. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be scared to death and wants only to be with you right now. As a matter of fact, go back to him. He\u2019s probably frantic without you.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked a little worried, but Marco grabbed Nicky\u2019s arm from behind and turned him around. \u201cWhose side are you on, anyway?\u201d His tone was gruff, but he pulled Nicky into the shelter of his arm, tucking him against his side.</p><p>Nicky smiled up at him. \u201cYours, darling. Always yours. But I remember all too well how frightened I was at first when you weren\u2019t with me. I\u2019d have been frantic if you\u2019d left while I was still in heat. Loganwill settle down in a little while, but don\u2019t rush him, Ian. Since he was a Hunter, he\u2019s going to have a lot to get used to once he can think straight again. He\u2019ll be terribly conflicted.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded and began to ease his way toward the door. \u201cI\u2019d better get back to him, Alpha. I\u2019ll see if I can get him to talk later and let you know. Nicky\u2019s right\u2014he has a lot to get used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Marco said. \u201cWe can talk to him later. Try to calm him as much as you can. I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d He turned to Nicky. \u201cAs for you, we need to have another word about involving yourself in council business.\u201d</p><p>Nicky whirled around with blood in his eye.\u201cOh really? Why is that, Marco? Because I\u2019m just your mate, and nothing I have to say is import...\u201d Whatever Nicky was about to say was lost as Marco jerked him into his arms and covered his lips in a passionate kiss.</p> <p>Ian let himself out, glancing back to see Marco having a word with Nicky, his hands roaming over his body, while trailing kisses down the side of his neck. He closed the door softly on the sounds of Nicky\u2019s pleasure-filled moans.</p><p>Logan turned on his side, his eyes fluttering open. He looked up at Ian sitting on the side of the bed and frowned uncertainly.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, Logan?Do you feel okay?\u201d Ian asked.</p><p>\u201cII don\u2019t know exactly. Strange, hot.\u201d He sat up in bed, swaying unsteadily.\u201cI have to take a piss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you.\u201d Ian helped him to stand on his own two feet and pushed him gently toward the bathroom. Standing at the door, Ian watched him as he made his way to the toilet with dragging stumbling steps, still hot with the fever from the changes his body was going through and still in heat. Even watching him relieve himself his magnificent body turned Ian on. Once the Werekin changes completed, he\u2019d truly be something to see.</p><p>Logan swayed and his legs buckled under him. Rushing to grab him before he hit the tiled floor, Ian picked him up effortlessly in his arms and looked down at him. Logan\u2019s eyelids fluttered again, and hetwisted in Ian\u2019s arm to lick Ian\u2019s nipple.</p><p>Smiling, Ian carried him back to the bed and laid him down gently, pulling the sheet back over his naked body. Logan threw it off and reached for Ian with one hand. The other hand reached down between his own legs, and Ian\u2019s gaze followed his hand. His erection was large and standing straight up. Logan put his hand on his dick and moved his hand up and down while looking up at Ian seductively.</p><p>Ian pushed his hand away and replaced it with his own. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to break you of a bad habit, baby. This is mine from now on, and only I get to play with it.\u201d He gazed down at Logan with mock seriousness, and Logan blushed, pushing frantically intoIan\u2019s hand, until Ian stood up, pulled his shirt over his head and pushed down his jeans.</p><p>\u201cI know what you want, baby, and I\u2019m the one to take care of you.\u201d He lay down beside him and pulled Logan up to straddle his body, making a back rest with his legs.Logan\u2019s legs spread automatically, straddling him as Ian lifted him and sat him down on top of his cock. Logan\u2019s asshole, still well lubed and stretched from their earlier lovemaking, slid down, taking Ian in quickly, coming to rest against the knot. He gasped aloud, a shocked expression on his face, and Ian chuckled.</p><p>\u201cYou never ridden a wolf before, baby. I think I can promise you a wild ride. I\u2019d better hang on to you, though, so you don\u2019t fly off. Wouldn\u2019t want my little man to get hurt.\u201d He enclosed Logan\u2019s cock with his hand and squeezed it around the base until Logan yelped. \u201cHang on darlin\u2019! I\u2019m not going to let you come for a long time. Your first lesson in obedience. You\u2019ll come when I tell you to and not before. I think I\u2019d like to hear that sweet voice begging me just a little bit. C\u2019mon, honey. Show me how you beg for it.\u201d</p><p>Logan whimpered. \u201cPlease, Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s sweet. I like that a lot. Say it again.\u201d Ian bounced him up and down on his rigid shaft, teasing him, holding him in place with one hand on his ass and the other on his dick. He was balls deep inside Logan, and Logan\u2019s breathing was labored.</p><p>Logan closed his eyes and begged for all he was worth. \u201cOh, please, please, let me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince you asked me so nicely, I might consider it.First tell me if you\u2019re ever going to touch yourself again without permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no. I promise.\u201d Ian rammed into his ass, raking his dick back out across Logan\u2019s prostate, and Logan screamed. \u201cOh my God. Please!\u201d</p><p>Ian released his grip on Logan\u2019s penis and tugged it in his fist, fast, hard pulls that first lifted Logan up and then slammed him back down onto Ian\u2019s cock. \u201cCome for me, baby.\u201d</p><p>Logan shut his eyes and yelled again, as his cock shot cum into Ian\u2019s hand and spilled over onto Ian\u2019s stomach. At the same time, Ian arched his back and shot his load into Logan\u2019s ass, so much cum it dripped back out onto his own groin.</p><p>Logan collapsed on top of his chest, sobbing for breath. Ian bit into his wrist and held it to Logan\u2019s lips. He fed him as he lay almost senseless with fatigue against his chest. When he\u2019d had enough, Ian pulled his wrist away and allowed him to lie where he was, still straddling his body and half glued toIan\u2019s belly by his cum, his cock still in his ass. When Logan tipped over after a few minutes, Ian pushed him back up.</p><p>Helping him to sit back up was all Logan needed to ride on his own again, shoving his hips back and forth, driving Ian in, pulling himself off and driving on again.</p><p>\u201cRiding is something you have to practice, and if you fall off, you have to get right back on. So sit up straight and ride \u2019em cowboy. Time for lesson number two.\u201d</p><p>Logan didn\u2019t need any encouragement, not in the state he was in. He braced his hands on Ian\u2019s shoulders to drive himself harder, on and off, deep and hard.</p><p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re finished,and you\u2019ve rested, I\u2019ll suck your cock and let you suck mine to keep you satisfied and give your little ass a rest,\u201d Ian promised.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s going to be a long day for you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Logan came back in the bedroom from the toilet, stopping in the doorway to look at Ian. He\u2019d slept really late that morning and woke up feeling grouchy and out of sorts. He remembered vividly, he thought, everything that had happened between him and Ian with shame and humiliation. He thought of what his father would say and flushed a deep red. He stood there and stared at Ian with resentment mixed with a desire to drop to his knees and suck him off. The last he stubbornly ignored.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you did to me last night, but it can\u2019t happen again.\u201d Ian raised his eyebrows and smiled. \u201cOh really? You seemed to be enjoying it well enough for the past two days and nights.\u201d Logan \u2019s flush heated his skin all the way up to his hair. \u201cYou\u2019re a damn liar. You forced me! Understand?\u201d</p><p>Ian stood up, towering over Logan. Logan stood his ground. He defiantly raised his gaze to Ian\u2019s even though images of all the ways he had fucked Ian over the past two days came flooding back to him. The images of all the different positions Ian had taken him in, with him crawling all over him, begging for more as soon as one round was finished, tormented him. His ass was sore, his insides tender and the skin on his cock felt raw. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo one forced you, Logan, and don\u2019t ever call me a liar again. Is thatunderstood?\u201d</p><p>Logan dropped his gaze and stared down at his shifting feet. \u201cWell, maybe not forced me...but something you did made me act that way. I would never have done all that in my right mind. Never!\u201d</p><p>Ian dropped his hand down to graze against Logan\u2019s cock. Instantly, it started to rise up to meet his hand, and Logan\u2019s legs trembled so hard, he almost sagged to his knees.</p> <p>Logan looked down at himself and groaned. \u201cOh, God. What\u2019s happenedto me?\u201d</p><p>Ian let his fingers trail down to Logan\u2019s balls. He squeezed them and fondled them gently.</p><p>Logan\u2019s knees buckled, and his hands flew out to cling to Ian\u2019s shoulders. \u201cStop. Please stop. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Werekin now, and you\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>Logan pulled back, leaning against the doorframe, gazing at Ian solemnly. \u201cWhat exactly does that mean\u2014Werekin? What does all of this mean? I know you bit me. Am I going to turn into a werewolflike you now?\u201d</p> <p>Ian chuckled.\u201cNo, honey.Forget everything you\u2019ve been told about us, Logan, or seen in movies. None of it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Logan backed away a little. \u201cI remember being in the cell and hating all of you. Then you bit me, and all that hatred just drained away. I think I should feel embarrassed standing here naked, but\u2014I don\u2019t. I know I\u2019m not gay\u2014I\u2019m not! Really!\u201d He ducked his head for a moment and then looked back up directly into Ian\u2019s eyes. \u201cAt least I never knew I was. God, what\u2019s happening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerekinmeans you\u2019re one of us now. I\u2019ve had other humans who changed tell me that with the first bite, they feel a sense of relief. Old prejudices and inhibitions disappeared, and many things bubble up from their sub-conscious. For instance, when you mentioned your father, there was bitterness and anger in your voice, and when I told you you\u2019d never be alone, your expression told me you wanted that. You can remember the time before you took my knot clearly if you concentrate. Think about what your subconscious wanted that you\u2019re denying now. Admittedly the Werekin bite sends your libido into overdrive, but it doesn\u2019t kill your free will. It helps lower your inhibitions, though. It allows you to do what you really want.That\u2019s why I gave you a choice.\u201d Ian bent down and kissed him tenderly on his lips, sucking for a moment on his lower lip before releasing him.</p><p>Logan dashed the back of his hand against his lip. \u201cStop! I don\u2019t want this!\u201d</p><p>Ian folded his arms and sat back down on the bed. \u201cYes, you do. When I saw you in the cell, I made the decision to save your life. I didn\u2019t want you hurt in any way. I felt as if I had to protect you. If someone hadn\u2019t changed you into Werekin, they were going to have to execute you. We had no other option since the Hunters ignored our offers of making a deal with them to return you. I had a choice in taking it further and mating with you, and I gave you the choice of accepting.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head even if he did remember being asked. He refused to talk about it, instead focusing on his father.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t even consider a deal?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe never answered, Logan. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have done anything else, I guess. You don\u2019t negotiate with the enemy.\u201d He parroted the words and hated his father even more.</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t pursue the subject. \u201cYou were so brave coming up to the cell door and challenging me, little as you are. I thought it was amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle?I\u2019m six feet tall and weigh one hundred ninety-five pounds. For a human, I\u2019m considered pretty large.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled. \u201cNot to me. I\u2019m six feetfive, and I don\u2019t even know how much I weigh, but a lot more than you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not gay!\u201d He cast a worried glance up at Ian. \u201cAm I? Is there something in the blood you made me drink that makes me a fag?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Settle down and stop being offensive.I didn\u2019t make you drink. I didn\u2019t have to, and if you don\u2019t want me to touch you again, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p> <p>Ian shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t force you before. I won\u2019t force you now. You do have to feed from me though. Or from some other wolf from now on. Mine will taste better to you, but if you don\u2019t want me, then there might be other options. You have to feed though. That\u2019s not an option. If you don\u2019t it could cause you to become very sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFeed from you? From your blood?That\u2019s disgusting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNevertheless, you\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>Logan blushed again. He hated the idea of being forced to do anything. Never one to enjoy being ordered around, he knew this big wolf could make him do whatever he wanted, and the thought made him uneasy. It also made him hard as a rock. Did he like being ordered around by this man?</p><p>He looked down at his throbbing cock in fear and confusion. \u201cNo more sex!\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until you want it.\u201d He smiled into Logan\u2019s eyes. \u201cMake no mistake, Logan. You will want it. Maybe even beg for it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say! Don\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d Angrily, Logan crossed over to the bed and grabbed a sheet to wrap around him. He wanted badly to wipe the smug smile off the big wolf\u2019s face.</p><p>Ian nodded toward the door. \u201cOkay then. We\u2019ll see. If you\u2019re ready, let\u2019s go to my quarters. I need to show you where your new home is. It\u2019s time to get you settled in as my pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is a pet?Like a dog or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all. We call our mates and natural-born Werekin pets. As a mate it means you\u2019re mine. I will feed you my blood and care for you from this day forward. You\u2019ll do what I tell you to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I will?\u201d Logan stirred uneasily. \u201cBullshit! Am I supposed to be some kind of slave now? Is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re my mate. I take care of you. What\u2019s so difficult to understand?\u201d</p><p>Loganfelt uneasy at Ian\u2019s sharper tone. He still wasn\u2019t comprehending, and he definitely didn\u2019t like the words pet or mate. He wanted more information. Again, he remembered the bite this big wolf had given him before fucking him. His logical mind remembered from somewhere the bite was poisonous and caused humans to change into monsters. Had that happened to him? In a sudden panic he ran to the mirror. All he saw was his usual face looking back out at him. He turned in confusion to Ian, wanting his comfort, being drawn to him, and not understanding that either.</p><p>Ian held out a hand to him. \u201cCome here, Logan. I told you to forget all of what the Hunters told you.It\u2019s simply not true.\u201d</p><p>Logan backed up a step, shaking his head. \u201cNo, not till you explain to me what\u2019s going on.\u201d</p><p>Ian sat up straighter. His eyes glittered dangerously. His voice took on an authoritative tone. \u201cWhen I speak to you, Logan, I expect you to do as I say. Come over here. Now.\u201d</p><p>Logan dropped his head. A sharp pang went through him atIan\u2019s tone. Ian was angry with him. While a part of him was defiant and angry, another, more primal part made his feet start to move slowly toward Ian as if he were compelled to please him. He walked to stand in front of him.</p><p>Ian snapped out, \u201cOn your knees.\u201d</p><p>Flushing, Logan fell to his knees, keeping his head down, not daring to look up. He hated himself for his own cowardice. His body trembled all over. What was happening to him?</p><p>\u201cKnees apart and put your hands behind your back.\u201d Ian\u2019s tone was quiet, yet firm and unyielding.</p><p>Logan did as he was told, and long minutes ticked by while he remained on his knees. Unreasonably, as he knelt there at Ian\u2019s feet he began to feel calmer. Finally, Ian said softly. \u201cThis is the submissive position you will assume whenever I say, whenever I am displeased with you, or you\u2019re acting defiant. You don\u2019t question my orders, Logan, or make conditions. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced up, surprised. He lowered his gaze again quickly, unable to keep eye contact. \u201cI-I feel bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause-because, damn it, I don\u2019t like to make you mad at me. I don\u2019t understand why!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. I know you don\u2019t understand, but it will always make you unhappy to disobey me, Logan. The more defiant you are, the more unhappy you\u2019ll become.\u201d</p><p>Ian caressed the side of his face, and Logan experienced such a surge of relief it almost brought tears to his eyes. What was wrong with him when he cared so much for what this wolf thought of him?He didn\u2019t understand it, but deep inside he knew he cared very much. He turned his face into Ian\u2019s hand.</p><p>Ian bit into his wrist again and held it to Logan\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou obviously need to feed again. Suck, Logan. When you\u2019ve finished, I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Logan stared at Ian in a daze. He dressed in the black leather pants Ian handed him in the same way. He couldn\u2019t get his head to work and didn\u2019t have a clue why. During the night, he\u2019d been so fucking horny he was in agony, but Ian kept his word, staying on his side of the big bed. He woke Logan around eleven o\u2019clock the next morning, fed him, and buckled a leather collar around his neck, smiling at him proudly.</p><p>\u201cYou look as beautiful as I thought you would.\u201d Ian took him to what looked like a beauty shop. With orders to Logan to do whatever they told him and stern orders to them not to cut a bit of hair off his head, he left Logan there. He spent a painful couple of hours getting somethinghe didn\u2019t want but couldn\u2019t muster up enough energy to complain. A complete body wax, including his crotch and underarms, took off every single hair that wasn\u2019t on his head. The nagging little voice in the back of his head told him he should be embarrassed with a woman doing that to him. He didn\u2019t seem to care, and his penis stubbornly refused to be aroused even though the woman was bare from the waist up. He laid there like a lump of clay except for the grunts and groans from the pain of having his body hair pulled out by the roots. The women at the shop called Ian when Logan was ready to be picked up, making him soundeven more like a poodle who\u2019d just been groomed. He wanted to be angry over it, but couldn\u2019t summon up the emotion. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Afterward, Ian took Logan to a tattoo artist, who\u2019d inscribedIan\u2019s name on his backside, something else he rebelled against, deep inside, but couldn\u2019t bring it to the surface. Being permanentlybranded as Ian\u2019s property was demeaning and painful. Yet it gave him an erection when Ian told him about it, and he reached for Ian\u2019s hand like a damn kid, wanting him to make the pain of the needles stop. Ridiculous, when he was the one who ordered it done in the first place, but still he craved Ian\u2019s closeness. Soon his humiliation was complete, and he was dressed like a male whore in nothing more than tight black leather pants, collared, and tattooed, too apathetic to be angry.</p><p>Ian took him by the arm and led him to the council room. Outside the door, he\u2019d whispered to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Just tell them the truth and let me handle any problems that come up.\u201d</p><p>Problems? What the hell was going on? What was happening to him? Why couldn\u2019t he get mad? When it came to Ian, he was powerless to stop anything the wolf wanted. He tried to relax and let Ian handle the problems. Ian said he would, whatever they might be.</p> <p>\u201cAlpha, this is my new mate, Logan.\u201d Logan raised his gaze to meet the interested stare of the pack alpha. He immediately remembered him as one of the huge wolves who had held him down for Ian to bite him the first time and witnessed the sex-crazed weakling he\u2019d become afterward. He tried for a moment to return his challenging gaze, but after only a few seconds a tingling he took for a warning twisted in his chest, and he had to look down at the floor. Instinctively he leaned toward Ian, who put a comforting hand on his arm. He instantly felt more at ease, though he hated being so dependent. He could feel the interested stares of the other big wolves in the room, and one of them in particular, loomed close to him, Casey, the big wolf who had interrogated him in his cell with such intensity.</p><p>Coming right up to him, Casey pointed at Logan\u2019s waxed chest and smiled at Ian. \u201cLooks very good, Ian. Does he have his tattoo?\u201d</p><p>Ian turned him around and put a hand on his upper back to make him bend over slightly, hooking a finger into his waistband, and pulling it down. Logan\u2019s entire body went red with embarrassment as his ass went bare. The big alpha called for order and motioned them all to sit down, saving Logan a measure of humiliation. Ian sat next to the alpha and pulled Logan down beside him. Logan was the only human at the table and leaned so his arm touched Ian\u2019s, while he studied the rest of the wolves covertly. They were gammas by what he knew of the pack rating system. Alphas always sat at the head of the table with their beta next to them. All the rest, no matter what their nature, were the gammas or the soldiers. Casey, the mean one, was by his nature, an alpha, but the pack could have only leader, and that most definitely was Marco.</p><p>Marco began. \u201cWhat\u2019s your full name, Logan?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Ian, he mumbled under his breath, but Ian squeezed his arm in encouragement. He cleared his throat, trying again. \u201cLogan Winters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cElias Winters is your father?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>A few gasps could be heard around the table. Logan glanced up and then quickly lowered his head again. He was grateful for Ian\u2019s hand on him. These huge men frightened him, though he couldn\u2019t quite remember why he was supposed to be so afraid of them. He was also felt a kind of antipathy for them. He had no idea where it was coming from, either.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d the alpha continued. \u201cDo you understand what has happened to you?\u201d</p><p>Glancing at Ian, Logan shrugged. \u201cNo, not exactly. I seem to be having trouble with my memory.\u201d</p><p>He was waking up though. Across the table, Casey snorted, and Ian growled low and menacingly, half-rising out of his chair.</p> <p>The alpha spoke firmly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Ian settled back beside him, and Marco turned to the wolf directly across from Ian. \u201cCasey, Logan is Werekin now, Ian\u2019s mate. Whatever he was before is irrelevant. The slate has been wiped clean.\u201d</p><p>Casey hesitated, showing his reluctance before he spoke directly to Ian. \u201cSorry, but it\u2019s hard to think of him as Werekin. He was a Hunter. He may have even killed some of our own.\u201d</p><p>Ian frowned at him, but Marco spoke up, interrupting them both. \u201cLogan is one of us now. Once Ian gave him the first bite, he became one of us, even more so when Ian mated with him. You\u2019ll treat him with the same care as you treat all of our pets, or you\u2019ll answer to me, personally.\u201d Marco turned toward Ian. \u201cMay I continue with him, Ian, or does Logan need a minute?\u201d</p><p>Logan wondered with irritation why they were asking Ian if Logan needed a break, but Ian shook his head, and the questioning continued.</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d Marco continued, \u201cYou were a Hunter, a member of a group sworn to kill all of us, including Ian. Your group thinkswe\u2019re all monsters, but you understand we\u2019re far from being monsters, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded slowly, not really sure of anything, but trying to be agreeable. Ian smiled, so Logan spoke up. \u201cI don\u2019t know about any of that.\u201d He put a shaky hand to his head. He did know yesterday, he thought, when he stood up to Ian. At the moment, he could hardly think. \u201cIt seems like I should know, but II can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need you to tell us everything you can remember. The memories will begin to come back stronger in a few hours or days. It\u2019s important you tell Ian all you know when they do. Ian\u2019s life, as well as ours, could depend on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I remember my father is a leader,\u201d Logan said with a rush of alarm. \u201cHe can be very\u2014 harsh. I don\u2019t think he would bargain for me or come for me if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWould he talk to you as a liaison for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t talk to anyone for you. He thinks you\u2019re animals.\u201d Confused, not sure where the information was coming from, he stumbled over the next words.\u201cHe-he would expect me to-to get myself out of any situation I found myself in. He would expect me to be-to be a man. If I couldn\u2019t escape, he\u2019d expect me to k-kill myself.\u201d</p><p>Casey smirked. Logan\u2019s irritation grew for the wolf, manifesting as an uneasiness in the center of his chest and a tenseness in his muscles.</p><p>\u201cIf that meant he wanted you to be brave, that\u2019s a joke,\u201d Casey taunted. \u201cHunters are all cowards. They use snipers and attack from the shadows, not openly like wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey,\u201d Marco said in warning.</p><p>Logan looked up and made eye contact with him for the first time. An invisible spark flashed between them across the table. Ian had turned to speak to the alpha, missing the look that passed between them.</p><p>Casey raised his eyebrows and smiled mockingly. He leaned across the table and spoke softly to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not acting much like a man now, are you, little Hunter?\u201d</p><p>With a sudden surge, all the anger he\u2019d been suppressing came back. Logan shot to his feet, pulling away from Ian\u2019s hand. \u201cFuck you, asshole!\u201d</p><p>Casey lunged, caught Logan by his bare arms and jerked him across the table. Instantly, Ian leapt across the table, threw Casey off Logan, and took him to the floor. Marco and all the gammas jumped forward, pulling the two apart and forcing Logan back by the bulk of their bodies.</p><p>One of the gammas herded Logan out into the hallway, not touching him, but crowding him back, looking at him solicitously. \u201cAre you injured?\u201d he asked him anxiously.</p><p>Logan shook his head in a daze. He had livid bruises already coloring his arms from Casey\u2019s hands. They felt like they had been squeezed to a pulp, but hecouldn\u2019t think of anything at that moment except Ian, terrified he was getting hurt. He tried to go back inside, but the gamma stood protectively in front of the closed door. After several tense minutes, the door opened, and Ian stepped outside. He stalked grimly toward Logan, took his hand, and pulled him from the hallway, down the corridor and up the stairs to their quarters. Logan had no choice but to run along behind him, sureif he\u2019d fallen, Ian would have simply dragged him along, like a caveman.</p><p>When they arrived at their quarters, Ian jerked open the door, slammed it behind them, and whirled to face him. \u201cDo you have any idea how badly you could have been hurt?\u201d Ian came toward Logan as he backed up. \u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-uh...\u201d Logan continued to back away until he hit the wall behind him. He held out his hands to ward off the blow he thought was coming. Ian walked up to him, slapping the hands down with contempt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d He took him by the wrists and looked at the bruises on his arms. His face tightened for a moment, but he pulled his gaze back to Logan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou deliberately baited that hot head. Damn it, Logan!\u201d</p><p>The baiting had been from the other side, but Logan didn\u2019t argue. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re stupid! He could break you in half!What if I hadn\u2019t been there?\u201d Ian pulled his fist back and slammed it into the wall beside Ian\u2019s head, shattering the sheetrock.</p><p>\u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been there, I could have handled it. I\u2019m not helpless, even if he is a big gorilla.\u201d Logan yelled back at him, even though a part of him rebelled against it. In the next minute hewas in Ian\u2019s arms, being carried to the bedroom. Ian threw him on the bed, pacing up and down in front of him, obviously trying to calm himself. He walked back and forth several times, then snarled, \u201cThe hell with it!\u201d Turning, Ian flung himself down beside him and took Logan\u2019s chin in his hand, forcing Logan to look at him.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea what it felt like when he put his hands on you that way? Do you? You\u2019re mine, damn it! He had no fucking right to touch you!\u201d He jumped back to his feet and paced again. \u201cI told you I\u2019d never touch you again unless you asked me to. Unless you wanted it. Tell me you want it, Logan, please.\u201d</p><p>Logan felt a hard shiver go down his spine fromIan\u2019s desperate tone.</p><p>\u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>Logan was drawn into Ian\u2019s dark gaze. His eyes seemed to glitter at him, and he smelled so damn goodLogan\u2019s body trembled. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me you want this, I\u2019ll let you go. I\u2019ll leave right now, and you won\u2019t have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Logan wasn\u2019t sure if he said it outloud or not, but the idea of Ian\u2019s leaving him slammed through him like a freight train. He hadn\u2019t realized until this moment how dependent he was on this big wolf, how much he needed him. More, how much he wanted him. Still, how could he say he wanted this wolf to fuck him? The idea was unthinkable. It was ludicrous. It was as exciting as hell.</p><p>He shook his head miserably. \u201cII can\u2019t-can\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><p>Ian made a harsh growling sound and paced back and forth again. His big, muscular body oozed sexuality. \u201cIf I can\u2019t make love to you, I\u2019ll have to leave tonight. I\u2019ll come back, but I can\u2019t...I won\u2019t be able to...damn it!I can\u2019t stay here and not claim you as mine.\u201d</p> <p>He stopped in front of Logan and tore off his own clothing, standing before Logan naked, his big body gorgeous as his tense muscles flexed. His huge hard cock dripped precum, jutting out in front of him, almost touching Logan\u2019s lips.</p><p>\u201cTell me you don\u2019t want me then. Say the wordsand I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d Logan dropped his gaze, shaking his head. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? Say the words, Logan, if you\u2019re so sure you don\u2019t want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I do want you, okay?I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I want you so much it\u2019s tearing me apart!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo say the words! Ask me to make love to you.\u201d Ian made another low growl in his throat.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2013I won\u2019t force you, now any more than I did before. I don\u2019t want to intimidate you into it either, damn it, but I love you, and I want you. If you want me, please say the words and put me out of this misery.\u201d</p><p>Logan fought against everything he\u2019d ever been taught, ever believed about himself, in a losing battle. He wanted this man, plain and simple. No matter how it had started, he loved him, and he needed him like he needed to breathe. He raised his faceto Ian\u2019s, bit his lip, and looked at his lap. \u201cIan, would you...would you make love to me?\u201d</p><p>In one step, Logan reached the bed and kissed him hard. Trembling with desire, he swiped Logan\u2019s pants off and tossed them.\u201cUp on your knees, honey.\u201d</p><p>Logan scrambled up as fast as he could, but before he could even get all the way up, Ian was on him, spreading his legs wide and putting one hand on his back to hold him in place. Taking his cock in his hand, he painted Logan\u2019s hole with his dripping pre-cum. Without another word, he buried his cock as deep inside as he could in a single, hard plunge. Logan tried to pull his forehead out of the mattresswhere the force of Ian\u2019s impalement drove him and catch his breath for the searing pain. Ian must have thought he was trying to get away. A slap landed on Logan\u2019s ass. The breath rushed out of Logan\u2019s lungs, his eyes opened wide. Still he found himself squirming within Ian\u2019s hold, desperate for even more. Did he like the pain? It had almost taken his breath away, but Ian inside him made him so hot, he was about to combust.</p><p>Buried deep inside Logan, Ian held still, allowing Logan to relax a bit and his body to accept his size before he rocked back and thrust hard inside him again and again. Logan grunted with each unyielding, punishing ram of the hard cock up his ass. This was about possession, pure and simple, and even rough, Logan reveled in it. He wanted to belong to this man, body and soul.</p><p>Ian pounded hard in him, yet with each stroke, Ian hit the spot inside him that was pure pleasure. Ian\u2019s hand closed on Logan\u2019s cock and stroked it hard. He yanked at his penis, pulling him forward, and pushed him back on the downward stroke, meeting the slamming from behind. Logan felt like a boneless rag doll being pulled back and forth, helpless, yet controlled. He was powerless against the orgasm ripping through him with such force he yelled out Ian\u2019s name. Ian continued to milk him for every drop until it became almost painful.</p> <p>Ian came too, surging in him and forcing him down even further into the covers. Ian\u2019s heavy body bore him down to the sticky mattress, totally covering him with rough skin and hard muscle. He whispered in Logan\u2019s ear. \u201cMine.\u201d He bit him again, not a mating bite, but a love bite, marking his territory. Logan knew when he looked in the mirror he would see a full set of teeth marks. Ian sucked on the side of his neck over and over, raising small blood blisters and further marking him as belonging to him. \u201cYou\u2019re mine,\u201d he growled again.</p><p>Without enough breath to answer, Logan nodded his head. Ian rolled off him, pulling Logan along with him on top of his body. Logan crawled up, nestling his nose into the hollow between Ian\u2019s throat and his shoulder. After a few moments, Ian began to breathe more evenly, and Logan tried to slip down beside him. Immediately, Ian pulled him back, growling at him softly. Logan settledhimself on top of Ian\u2019s body as comfortably as he could, since he apparently was there for a while. It was hard to go to sleep with his cock rubbing against Ian\u2019s hard abs. His cock refused to stay soft.</p><p>Sighing and settling down as much as he could, he contented himself with rubbing himself gently against Ian, as Ian idly played with his ass. Despite all the stimulation, he relaxed enough to follow Ian down into sleep.</p><p>Logan awoke alone the next morning, but he could hear the shower running, and Ian humming softly to himself. He swung his legs over the bed and padded into the bathroom. Almost timidly, he opened the door. \u201cI-I have to go to the bathroom. Mind if I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Logan relieved himself and, ducking his head, walked back toward the door. The shower door opened, blocking his way, billows of steam escaping out into the bathroom around him.</p><p>\u201cGet in, baby.\u201d</p><p>Not stopping to think, Loganstepped inside and was immediately enveloped in Ian\u2019s arms. Wordlessly Ian rubbed soap on his body, wiped away the sticky crusts of their love making and soothed the sore spots. Ian soaped Logan\u2019s cock gently and slowly, turned him around, and took care of the backside as well. With Logan\u2019s knees weakened and starting to bend, Ian put his arms around him and held him close. He kissed him tenderly, rubbing his hardness against him. His hands roamed over his body. He didn\u2019t make love to him, only washed him tenderly, and helped him dry off when he was done.</p><p>Afterwards, Logan wrapped a towel around his waist and followed Ian into the kitchen, watching him quietly as he made coffee.</p> <p>Ian smiled at him. \u201cWe missed supper last night, and I\u2019m starving. We\u2019ll go down in a minute, but first I want some coffee. I\u2019d like you to learn to do this. Do you know how to make coffee?\u201d</p><p>Looking at the old fashion percolator Ian used, Logan shook his head. \u201cNot with that. Why?Do I need to learn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea if we both know how. We can eat our meals downstairs in the cafeteria most of the time, but I\u2019m picky about my coffee. I usually have a cup up here before I go down. It\u2019s a ritual my wife and I started a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan. She died over five years ago. Her name was Maria, and she was beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019re gay?\u201d</p><p>Ian shook his head. \u201cLogan, wolves don\u2019t use that term\u2014at least it doesn\u2019t mean much to us, though we understand what humans mean by it. I\u2019m neither straight nor gay. Something in our blood usually picks our mates, males for some, females for others.\u201d</p><p>Logan was quiet for a long moment. He felt something gnawing at his mind, something he hadn\u2019t experienced before, jealousy, pure and white hot. He shifted uncomfortably on his chair. \u201cIs that what I was? Did your blood pick me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I picked you. We have only one blood match. It\u2019s strong, but it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t love someone else if our blood mate dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou picked me. Just like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never even saw me before you came down to the basement cell. How did you even know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco told me if someone didn\u2019t turn you, they would have to execute you. We couldn\u2019t let you go free, and it was obvious you wouldn\u2019t have stayed with us willingly because of the state of mind you were in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so I\u2019m a pity case, is that it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first time I saw you was in that cell, so brave and fierce, coming up to the cell door and baring your teeth. You weren\u2019t afraid of anything. I didn\u2019t feel pity for you, Logan. I wanted to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>Logan squirmed uncomfortably on the chair. Ian\u2019s eyes burned as they looked at him, and he was very aware of his bare body. Ian and the feelings he aroused confused him so much he didn\u2019t know if he was coming or going.</p><p>\u201cWhat about you, Logan? What did you think when you first sawme?\u201d</p><p>He lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cJust another big wolf coming to look at me like I was something to eat.\u201d He shrugged again, admitting, \u201cHandsome. I thought maybe you were picking out which part you wanted to eat first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was,\u201d Ian said with a smile, walking over to him and bending down to kiss him lightly on the lips. \u201cI definitely was.\u201d</p><p>Logan blushed, pulling away, and Ian laughed and pulled him up to stand beside him. He ran his hands down to cup his ass. \u201cDamn, if I wasn\u2019t so hungry,I\u2019d skip breakfast and just concentrate on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. I\u2019m not into all that.\u201d Logan felt himself blushing like a damn girl.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re into. You\u2019re so uptight about your sexuality. Why can\u2019t you just relax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been with a man before.I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m supposed to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any rules, baby. There\u2019s no one here to judge you. It\u2019s just you and me. I like you to walk around naked in our rooms, and I like looking at you. Get used to it, because I plan on making love to you often. Actually, every chance I get.\u201d He patted his ass fondly and went back to pour a cup of coffee. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan I ask you something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, what do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you came back out of the council room, you were furious at me. I know I shouldn\u2019t have said what I did to that jerk, but why did you get so angry? He taunted me, you know.\u201d</p> <p>Ian sat down at the table, motioning for Logan to join him. \u201cI know, and I was more furious at Casey than you. The one cardinal rule of the Wolf Pack is that we protect our pets and our mates at all costs. That rule is first and foremost and is never to be broken. The idea of another wolf attacking one of our mates is unthinkable. Our law forbids even touching another wolf\u2019s mate. When you said what you did to Casey, he totally lost his temper and attacked. Luckily, he retained enough sense not to seriously hurt you. When I saw those bruises on your arms, though, I got furious all over again. You have to watch what you say to the wolves, Logan, and never touch one. I can\u2019t stress that enough. It would be so provocative to him. Even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way, he might think you\u2019re coming on to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost my temper too. He sneered at me about being a coward\u2014said I didn\u2019t look so tough.\u201d His face flamed, and he touched his collar. \u201cProbably because of this.\u201d</p><p>Ian reached across the table and pulled down his hand. \u201cCasey has a smart mouth. He gave his own mate a hard time when they first got together. The collar is a sign to all other wolves that you belong to me. That you\u2019re my mate. It\u2019s there to protect you, not humiliate you. It should make you feel owned and cherished, because you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Casey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean after they pulled me off him?\u201d Ian smiled grimly. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2014they got me out of there, but I\u2019m sure Marco had more than a few choice words for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his deal, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCasey is a hot head, but Hunters have threatened us for years and too often they\u2019ve killed our kind without provocation. Tensions are running high, especially after the attack on Marco and Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shoot them,\u201d he said, knowing itprobably didn\u2019t make any difference. He\u2019d been with the group that did. \u201cI thought once I was bitten, I was this Werekin thing, not a Hunter anymore and the things I did before are forgotten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Casey was way out of line to taunt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it because\u2014because we\u2019re both men? Because I let you...\u201d His voice trailed off, and he shook his head in confusion. \u201cHis own mate is a male, right?\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled and shook his head.\u201cThe sex of our matesdoesn\u2019t matter to us,\u201d he said in reminder. \u201cYes, Casey\u2019s mate is a male. So is Marco\u2019s, a very colorful, beautiful young man named Nicky. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll meet both of them soon.\u201d He covered Logan\u2019s hand with his. \u201cLogan, I\u2019ve tried to tell you we don\u2019t have the same human prejudices here. Since our blood most often picks our mates,and we never know until we meet them what gender they\u2019ll be, we don\u2019t pay any attention to such concerns. Love is just love.C\u2019mon. Let\u2019s go down to the cafeteria to get something to eat. Go get dressed.\u201d</p> <p>Logan returned to the bedroom and opened the drawer Ian told him was his. It was filled with nothing but the tight leather pants. Sighing, he pulled a pair of them on and went back out to the main room. \u201cAny particular reason why I have to wear nothing more than these?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s traditional. Looks nice on you, with your body, but if you want to wear a shirt, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yeah, I would like a shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any for you. We can stop by the purser\u2019s downstairs and get you one.\u201d</p><p>Logan followed Ian downstairs, and they went first to a small room by the grooming shop. Ian disappeared inside, telling Logan to wait for him and returned a few minutes later. He threw a small black T-shirt at him. Logan held it up and looked up at Ian unbelievingly. The size had to be a small and would be super tight on him.</p><p>Logan pulled it on and looked down at himself.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><p>Ian shrugged, smiling. \u201cIt fits you well. Some of the boys...er...male pets wear jeans, but I like the way the leather looks. You\u2019re gorgeous in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we compromise, this when we\u2019re alone and regularclothes out here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like the way you look in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t argue with me, baby.\u201d he said softly, trailing his fingers down his side, but the look in his eyes said he was annoyed until Logan shut up and nodded.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Logan trailed behind Ian as they went into the cafeteria for breakfast. Wolves and their mates glanced up at them curiously as they came in, nodding respectfully to Ian. Their gazes raked over Logan with interest, the looks pausing at the bruises on his arms and, he was sure, the marks on his neck. Ian strode ahead of him and took a plate of food from the server, making sure, with a glance over his shoulder, Logan got one as well and followed him down the buffet table. Ian led him over to a table and sat down, speaking softly to the server who stood by their table and ordering drinks for both of them.</p><p>Thefood was delicious, but Logan didn\u2019t have much appetite. After moving his eggs around his plate for the third time, Ian put a hand over his. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You still think we\u2019re trying to poison you?\u201d</p><p>Logan flushed. \u201cNo, of course not. I just don\u2019t seem to have any appetite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because you fed from me earlier. You could live indefinitely off just my blood, but it\u2019s better if you eat regular food too. Try to eat something. It will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I could live off just your blood?What am I, a fucking vampire too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans and their legends.\u201d He laughed softly. \u201cNo, Logan, you\u2019re my mate, a high order of Werekin. When I mated with you, the combination of the bite, my sperm, and the secretions of my knot changed your body chemistry, your physical makeup. I\u2019m no doctor, so I can\u2019t explain it to you exactly, but, in a way, you\u2019re an extension of me now and live from my blood. It\u2019s the same for all the mates.\u201d Ian put a hand over his. \u201cI told you everything would be different. I\u2019m sorry, baby, but it was the only way to keep you alive. The Hunters put you in this position by coming after us so relentlessly.\u201d</p><p>Logan was silent, staring broodingly down at his plate.</p><p>Ian looked up at him curiously. \u201cWhat\u2019s going through your head?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the only way to stay alive is to become a bloodsucker, who gets fucked by wolves, and wears girly outfits. Trying to decide if it\u2019s worth it.\u201d</p><p>Ian roared with laughter. \u201cNot wolves\u2014just one wolf. Me. Only me. And I\u2019ll try very hard to make it worth it for you.\u201d</p><p>Logan glanced up at him shyly, willing to admit one thing.\u201cMaybe it does have some compensations at that.\u201d</p><p>Ian reached across the table and put a hand to the back of Logan\u2019s head, pulling him across for a kiss. Logan pulled violently away, his face flaming.</p><p>Ian let him go, looking puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did I hurt your neck?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s the kissing. In public.\u201d</p><p>Ian glanced around them and back at Logan. \u201cThey all know we\u2019re mates. They think nothing of it.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head, his face still red. \u201cWe\u2019re both men. Men don\u2019t kiss like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently they do. We do.\u201d</p><p>Logan shot him a fierce glare. \u201cYou know what I mean, Ian. It embarrasses me.\u201d At Ian\u2019s look of indignation, Logan tentatively put out a hand to touch Ian\u2019s on the table. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s taking me some time to get used to thiseven if you people don\u2019t think anything about it. I\u2019ve always believed\u2014been told...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to switch my thinking around, and I\u2019ve never felt like this for anyone, let alone another man.\u201d</p><p>A little smile played around the corners of Ian\u2019s mouth. \u201cLike this?Like what, Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I know, but I want to hear you say it.\u201d</p><p>Logan flushed angrily again, pressing his lips tightly together.</p><p>\u201cSay it. You know you want to.\u201d</p><p>Logan went hot with embarrassment. The worst thing was the compulsion to do whatever Ian asked of him. He tried biting down on his tongue to keep from saying the words fighting to come out of his mouth.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Logan, say it.\u201d Ian\u2019s tone became a little less teasing and a little more commanding. Logan was done. He sagged in defeat and mumbled a few words so low he knew Ian couldn\u2019t hear him.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that, baby? Speak up a little louder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said\u2014in love\u2014damn it.\u201d He looked up at Ian defiantly. \u201cI\u2019m in love with you. Are you satisfied?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m getting there, baby. Definitely getting there.I\u2019m in love with you too. Now let\u2019s go back upstairs where you can show me exactly how you feel.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>\u201cHis memories have pretty much come back to him.\u201d The next day Ian faced Marco over breakfast early in the morning. Ian had left Logan sleeping soundly after he\u2019d kept Logan up most of the night making love to him and feeding him blood. After a full day of the same with naps in between, Ian wanted him to sleep late and rest while he worked. He didn\u2019t have anyone to stay with him while he was gone. He knew he was being overprotective, but he couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>Logan was becoming more Werekin all the time in a lot of ways, but not as submissive as he should be. Ian was anxious for his progress to continue. Logan still was resistant to the idea of making love to another man. Though he couldn\u2019t resist Ian\u2019s advances, he made none of his own. The night before, however, he\u2019d cuddled up next to Ian before going to sleep. He\u2019d told him he was beginning to remember everything from his life as a Hunter. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to talk to him then,\u201d Marco said, leaning forward. \u201cYou know our attempts to work out an agreement for release for Logan were ignored. Yesterday one of our friends in town passed a note to one ofElias\u2019 guards in a cafe. He gave it to Elias. Elias wrote out an answer and tacked it to the bulletin board for everyone to see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t still thinking of letting him go? I won\u2019t let him go, Marco.I can\u2019t,\u201d Ian said firmly.</p><p>\u201cI know, but our friend didn\u2019t know we\u2019d given up on that or what\u2019s happened with Logan.\u201d He held a slip of paper out to Ian.</p> <p>\u201cBastard,\u201d Ian growled after reading both the offer and the answer. \u201cHow can any father do that to his own son?\u201d He growled again. \u201cLogan hasn\u2019t said much about him, but it was easy to tell he hates him and has had a damned lonely life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you tell Logan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually. Maybe not right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll talk to him alone\u2014no use getting Casey and the others involved at this point. Tensions are running too high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Caseytouches Logan again, I\u2019ll...\u201d</p> <p>Marco shook his head, a worried look on his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. I know how upsetting it was for you, for all of us. After the talk I had with Casey, I don\u2019t think anything like that will ever happen again. He knows how wrong he was. Still, it\u2019s best if we speak to Logan alone. Less traumatizing for him that way.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cLet him rest until this afternoon. Maybe around one o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Marco finished his coffee and stood up. \u201cIs anyone with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I fed him so he\u2019d sleep most of the day and posted a guard outside my quarters, in case he should wake up and try to wander around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Until he has time to settle in more, it\u2019s a good idea to keep an eye on him, just in case. See you this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Marco walked off, and Ian finished his breakfast, thinking of Logan. He was so strong willed it was difficult for him to be in love with Ian. It went against everything he\u2019d been taught since he was a small child, morally.He\u2019d been told all his life loving a man was wrong, and he\u2019d been taught wolves were monstrous creatures for probably just as long. Now that he knew the last to be untrue, it had made him question a lot ofthe other things he\u2019d been taught as well. He was having a difficult time.</p> <p>The mating bite and the subsequent feedings created a bond of caring, dependency, and obedience. Ian knew that. He was hoping in time, Logan would come to love him for himself as well. He\u2019d known when he saw Logan in his cell that, as deeply embedded as Logan\u2019s Hunter beliefs were, simply turning him to Werekin without the stronger bonds of mating wouldn\u2019t have been enough to overcome the brainwashing, which he believed Elias\u2019 training was. They couldn\u2019t have controlled him.</p><p>The lack of inhibitions while in heat would have subsided, and the stronger training of a lifetime would have come back to the surface. Ian knew that the moment he saw Logan standing in that cell challenging him. He knewhe didn\u2019t have a prayer of escaping and expected death any minute, yet he was defiant.</p><p>It would have been even harder for the pack to kill him as Werekin, but it would have had to be done if Logan turned on them instead of joining them. A stronger bond, the bond of mating, had to be done for it to work at all. Besides, at his first sight of him, as Ian told Logan, he wanted Logan for his own.</p><p>Maybe he should have left him alone after he came out of heat until he sorted out his feelings, but once Logan accepted mating and Ian gave him the mating bite and his knot, Ian had little choice. The mate wasn\u2019t the only one affected by the ritual and the bond went both ways. The problem was it would be hard for Logan to sort out the real natural feelings buried deep by the prejudices drummed into his head all his life from the feelings caused by the mating. He might never know for sure which was which. Neither would Ian. The only thing Ian knew was he had fallen in love with Logan, deeply and irrevocably.</p><p>He had loved Maria and always would. He still missed her every day, but Logan excited him in a way he\u2019d never experienced before. He wanted to be with him constantly. This morning he had to get up to go to work.The wolves from Casey\u2019s old pack needed living space, and Ian was the construction site foreman. He resented the time he\u2019d have to spend away from him. It may not be a blood match, but it certainly was a love match. At least it was for Ian. Maybe he could make it a little easier for Logan. He smiled grimly. Compromise, Logan had saidwhen he\u2019d given him the shirt. Maybe, after he was sure of Logan, he could let up a little.</p><p>Wearily, he stood up to head out to the construction site, experiencing unreasonable resentment over any of the time he would spend away from Logan. He\u2019d almost forgotten what it was like to be so much in love. So exciting, and so miserable at the same time.</p><p>Logan stretched as he came awake and reached out for Ian. Finding nothing but the empty covers, he felt alone and abandoned for a few moments. How had he allowed himself to feel this way about a wolf? The very idea appalled him. At the same time, he imagined Ian\u2019s big, muscular body wrapping around him. He rolled over and buried his face in Ian\u2019s pillow, breathing in the scent of him, themost delicious smell he\u2019d ever come across. Probably a trick of his mind since the mating bite. Still he wrapped his arms around the pillow and breathed deeply.</p><p>He thought about the wild lovemaking of the night and day before. Ian was insatiable, seeming to want to have his cock stuck in some part of Logan at all times. When he\u2019d finally worn Logan out, he cuddled with him the rest of the night, spooning him and caressing his balls and his cock until he went to sleep. He\u2019d made love to him so often it no longer seemed strange, at least not while they were doing it. Other times were when he questioned his own sexuality and masculinity. During the night, Logan woke up to Ian lying on his back, away from him. Missing his warmth, Logan snuggled up beside him, rubbing his face against his chest. Ian woke up and took him in his arms, kissing him over and over until it almost took his breath away. Did enjoying the attention make him less a man? Craving it? Needing it?</p> <p>The door to the bedroom opened, and Ian came in chasing doubts away. In the flesh, Logan\u2019s instant reaction stirred his cock. Ian walked over to the bed, bent down, took Logan in his arms, and kissed him thoroughly, sweeping his tongue inside his mouth and swirling it over his lips, stirring Logan\u2019s cock even more.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, sweetheart . Get up and take a quick shower. The alpha is here, waiting to speak to you.\u201d</p><p>Logan groaned, but Ian pulled him out of bed, put him on his feet, and gave him a pat on the ass. \u201cGo ahead. We\u2019ll be waiting for you outside. There\u2019s coffee.\u201d</p><p>Blushing, Logan went obediently into the bathroom to take a shower. He didn\u2019t quite understand how he felt compelled to do whatever he was told to do by Ian, and it embarrassed him at how easily controlled he was. Like a child. Ian kind of treated him like a child\u2014 except for the near constant demand for sex.</p><p>The worst thing was he had come to need the sex with Ian like he needed to breathe. He loved everything about the big wolf, and his whole world revolved around him. If only he could relax and enjoy the relationship, without feeling like he was pathetic and emasculated. He could only imagine what his father would say if he knew.</p><p>He took a quick shower, dried off, and dressed in the usual leather pants and black Tshirt. One thing about his new life, it took a lot of the decision-making away. He didn\u2019t seem to have to make any choices anymore. Every decision was made for him. Very different from what he\u2019d come to think of as his old life. Or was it?</p><p>For as long as he could remember his father had made all of the important decisions in his life\u2014once he acknowledged he had a son and that son was old enough to take his interest. Where to go to school, even who his friends would be. As Elias Winter\u2019s only son, he was constantly reminded he had certain standards to live up to. Hell, even in choosing his career for him, his father had dictated how Logan would dress. Joining the group his father led called The Hunters just as soon as he finished high school was expected. He\u2019d wanted to go to college but no college education was needed to be a soldier. He wasn\u2019t made one of the leaders either, but joined as one of the rank and file. His father demanded he learn things the hard way, from the ground up.</p><p>His training had been intense, worse than any boot camp. Six months of physical training, combat and infantry skills, survival skills, and rifle training. For the next year, he\u2019d gone out on reconnaissance with various groups, searching for rogue wolves and wolf clans. It was dangerous duty, and some teams never came back. Through all this training, his father never once contacted him, nor was he allowed to get in touch with his father. No way the general being his father was going to make things easier for him. The old man was tough, and he believed everything he did made Logan that much stronger and tougher too. In point of fact, it just made him feel alone and alienated, both things Ian had told him he\u2019d sensed after the first bite. Ian said the bite sometimes released a human\u2019s deepest secret feelings and their inhibitions.</p><p>His conflicting feelings about his father were nothing new to Logan. The possibility of being gay was. He wasn\u2019t a homosexual, or at least he\u2019d never thought of himself as gay even if he never really got the whole gay bashing thinghe\u2019d witnessed in others. He didn\u2019t see what two guys having sex did to hurt anyone else. He didn\u2019t think that made him gay, even if he\u2019d never had a girlfriend and had never been interested in girls, really. Not that interested in sex, actually. The schedule his father kept him on never left much time for it, even the hookers his father approved of. He liked being with guys and had sometimes admired their bodies in the shower after workouts, though he had always looked away. He didn\u2019t know if it was because hefelt guilty in admiring them and worried he\u2019d want more if he kept looking, or if it meant nothing at all. All he knew was he wanted as muchof Ian\u2019s body as he could get and felt guilty and dirty because of it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He wondered briefly what his father knew about his fate. Did he think he was dead? Would he prefer him to be dead than living as one of the wolf clan? Hell, yeah he would, and Logan shoved the thoughts out of his head for the meeting.</p><p>Ian and the big alpha sat together at the table talking quietly when he walked into the main room. They both turned to look at him. Ian smiled at him and held out his hand. Logan walked over to stand beside him, and let him take his hand, pulling him into the chair beside him. Marco, the alpha, smiled at him too.</p><p>\u201cHello, Logan. How are you feeling?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d He resisted leaning into Ian the way his body wanted to automatically. He may as well be a magnet and Ian steel.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell us about The Hunters?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know there are a lot of us\u2014them. Maybe a thousand throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains. More on the west coast. My father is the leader. It\u2019s been a kind of hereditary thing in our family for generations. The leadership always goes to the oldest son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you his oldest son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis only son.\u201d</p> <p>Ian and Marco gave each other a lookLogan couldn\u2019t read, making him curious.</p><p>\u201cWhat can you tell me about your training?\u201d Marco asked.</p><p>Logan began to talk, detailing the six months of physical and combat training, telling them everything he knew, including the scent dampeners the Hunters\u2019 scientists had developed and how long it lasted. He told them where the training took place, who conducted it, and when the next training was scheduled to begin. He told them where the nearest compound was and of the warehouse there the Hunters used to store their munitions, and gave them information on who the leaders were. In short, he told them everything they needed to know about the east coast operation, even drew them maps.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s closer than I thought it\u2019d be,\u201d Marco commented, looking at the map. \u201cLess than a two or three hour drive from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow we know why we\u2019ve been seeing more of them,\u201d Ian said, concern etched in his features.</p><p>Logan sagged, drained after talking for over an hour. The entire time he talked he suffered a split sensation, one part standing outside of himself, looking on in horror, watching in disbelief while this other part of him spilled his guts. Ian, always aware of his feelings, covered his hand and bent down to him.</p> <p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI-I think so. I just can\u2019t shake this feeling I\u2019m a traitor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey lied to you, Logan, about what we are,\u201d Ian said to comfort him.</p><p>Marco leaned forward. \u201cDon\u2019t think of it as being a traitor, Logan. The information you gave us is very valuable and may save many innocent lives. I can promise you we are not the aggressors here. We will do nothing to jeopardize our way of life and our secrecy from the general public. We only want to be left alone. We\u2019ll defend ourselves if necessary, but we don\u2019t attack humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the human pets like me?Where did they come from?\u201d</p><p>Ian spoke from beside him. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any like you, Logan. Yours was a special case. We did the most humane thing we could think of and that was to make you one of us. The other pets who are here are all blood matches to their wolves. There aren\u2019t many of them, really\u2014only about a dozen, including the alpha\u2019s pet. Each one of them wants to be here with their mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that because you bite them and cloud their minds? Make them believe they want things they don\u2019t want? Like me?\u201d</p><p>Marco spoke again. \u201cAre youbeing forced to do things you don\u2019t want, or are you free to do what you know is right? Are you unhappy with us, Logan? Do you not want to be here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d He glanced at Ian. \u201cI mean, no I want to be here, but I feel compelled to be and have to wonder if that\u2019s because of me or because of what you did to me? Why do I have to drink blood anyway?Can\u2019t I let my mind clear and see how Ifeel?\u201d</p><p>Ian and Marco exchanged another glance. Logan got the feeling he was hurting Ian and leaned into him. Ian immediately put an arm around him. His touch calmed Logan right away, and he sagged a little, suddenly tired after his tirade.</p><p>Marco stood up. \u201cWhen you\u2019re feeling stronger, I\u2019d like you to meet my mate, Nicky. I wasn\u2019t able to court him properly and give him the choice before the Werekin bite either. He was attacked by muggers and would have died without the bite. He felt very much like you do when he first came to us, confused and angry. He didn\u2019t understand why I made him do certain things, and he resented it. He\u2019s a very strong-willed person, and he went without feeding for longer than anyone has in recent history. It almost killed him, Logan. We don\u2019t want to put you at risk the same way. You\u2019re having a harder time because of your training and background, but we can\u2019t stop your feedings. Ultimately, they\u2019re for your own good and will help you be healthy and strong. You have to trust us, Logan. We have only your best interests at heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve heard that before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s true,\u201d Ian said firmly. He stood up and walked with Marco to the door. \u201cThanks for coming, Marco. I\u2019ll see you later at the council meeting.\u201d</p><p>Ian returned to Logan at the table. \u201cYou should eat something. Do you want me to take you downstairs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d He looked up at Ian. \u201cWhat will they do with the information I gave them? Will they attack the Huntersnow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really not sure what we\u2019ll do, but we won\u2019t attack. You heardMarco. We aren\u2019t the aggressors. You\u2019ve given us a lot to absorb. We\u2019ll talk about it at council and decide.\u201d He hesitated, his reluctant obvious.\u201cLogan, I have to tell you Marco has finally been in touch with your father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knows we have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say? Did you tell him what you did to me? Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Ian took the message out of his pocket. \u201cWe didn\u2019t tell him much of anything. It was delivered by a third party who didn\u2019t know we\u2019d given up on any negotiations, or that I\u2019d taken you for my mate.\u201d Heput a hand over Logan\u2019s while Logan read a scribbled note.</p><p>We have Logan. Release possible with terms.</p><p>Below that in a different handwriting, one Logan recognized as his father\u2019s, was the answer.</p><p>No man would allow himself be captured or stay alive if he was. He is dead to me. Dispose of the body as you will. Logan pulled his hand from under Ian\u2019s and stood. \u201cI\u2019m going to lie down for a while.\u201d \u201cThis has hurt you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck him!He wasn\u2019t there. How the hell does he know anything?\u201d He ran his hand</p><p>through his hair.\u201cShit, maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe I should have killed myself rather than let myself be captured.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make you less of a man, Logan. You fought fiercely. The wolves all spoke of it.Don\u2019t do this to yourself.\u201d He moved to enfold Logan in his arms.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Logansaid, pushing at his chest. \u201cJust leaveme alone for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you hurt, I hurt.\u201d</p><p>Ian wouldn\u2019t let go, and Logan erupted, pulling Ian\u2019s shirt open with one rip of his hands, buttons flying. He went after Ian\u2019s pants next, jerking them open, peeling them down his legs, and pushing him to his back on the floor, all in one action. Ian looked surprised, but didn\u2019t struggle against him, letting him do what he wanted with him. He had Ian\u2019s cock in his mouth before Ian\u2019s big body settled. Ian made no protests, not until Logan jerked his own pants open, twisting to line his cock up with Ian\u2019s hole.</p><p>\u201cLogan, I\u2019ve given you some leeway, knowing you\u2019re upset, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Logan begged, hooking his arms under Ian\u2019s knees. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>With only a moment\u2019s hesitation, Ian relaxed and let him push his legs up, raising his ass in the air. Logan\u2019s trembling fingers swiped pre-cum from both their cocks, smeared Ian\u2019s hole, and plunged in. His hips pumped into Ian with only one objective. Ian\u2019s cock was only half-hard, reacting to the unfamiliar position and pain.Logan put his hand on Ian\u2019s cock, pulling at it.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d he cried out\u201cCome for me, Ian.\u201d</p><p>He stroked at him harder and harder, causing Ian to moan and twist with pleasure. Ian came, shooting strong, thick streams of cum over his own belly and chest. Logan followed, groaning his release, grinding intoIan\u2019s ass, and ended in a sob. The frenzy finished, he crawled up Ian\u2019s body, nestled his forehead against Ian\u2019s neck and wept.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about how to take them out .\u201d</p><p>Ian looked at Logan in surprise. \u201cHoney, I know you\u2019re angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more than just angry. The bastard never wanted me in the first place.\u201d He snorted,</p><p>looking at his clenched fist. \u201cHis idea of sex was to fuck them and leave them, a lesson, he claimed, he learned after my mother slammed a paternity suit on him. He used prostitutes after that while he looked for the woman worthy of carrying his heir. I never saw him until I was ten, after he got himself infected with disease and found out he\u2019d never father another child. He tried to take me then, but my mother wouldn\u2019t let him near me. She died six months later in a car wreck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think\u2014?\u201d \u201cHe killed her? I wouldn\u2019t put it past him. I know once he got his hands on me, he swore he\u2019d train out all the soft weakness she\u2019d taught me. I don\u2019t want to talk about him anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, but it\u2019s a little soon for you to be switching sides and talking about taking the Huntersout, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Logan shoved up and stalked to the window to stare out at the woods beyond. Ashamed of his earlier break down, he was equally grateful Ian hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Once he quieted downafter learning he truly didn\u2019t mean anything to his father, Ian took them to the shower, bathed them, and helped him dress. Fully aware of the concession Ian made on his part to sootheLogan\u2019s shattered soul, itwasn\u2019t, as far as Logan was concerned, going to make their relationship any easier. Now Logan was indebted to him for even more. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always loved this forest. You can see the national park from here, can\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur land stretches from Nantahala National Park in Georgia near the North Carolina line to Asheville, North Carolina and into Tennessee, all pretty much wild land like you can see from the window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you afford it, all of this? I know now it\u2019s not from stealing, not the way they claim.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, we don\u2019t steal. We have mines, sapphire and ruby. Other packs and clans have other mines, farms, etc. Some work the stock market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mines arenear here, but you don\u2019t work them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we oversee them. We hire our friends in Brevard to work them. Many of them are working here now too, on the construction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains why they couldn\u2019t get anyone in town to talk to them about what goes on up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe employment we provide supports the town, and we support ourselves, Logan, and share equally.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot equally,\u201d he murmured, fingering his collar. He was silent for a long moment before he whirled to face Ian.\u201cI know I\u2019ve been fed a pack of lies all these years by the Hunters.\u201d Not just about wolves or by the Hunters.\u201cI want to help shut them down. I can lead a raid on them and put an end to this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? What the hell do you mean, absolutely not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean working in the field and combat are out of the question for you, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s mouth fell open,and he stared at Ian like he\u2019d just grown another head. He snarled at Ian.\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t.\u201d Ian folded his arms across his chest belligerently and glared at Logan. \u201cYou won\u2019t be leaving Mountainwood. Not just no, but hell no.\u201d</p> <p>Logan opened his mouth a time or two and stared at Ian, totally at a loss for something to say. He took in a couple of deep breaths and couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Ian! I\u2019m not a damned child, or your dog, or whatever it is you\u2019re trying to make me.\u201d He reached up, unsnapped the leather collar, and threw it on the floor.</p><p>Ian\u2019s face darkened, and he stood up and walked toward Logan. \u201cFuck me, huh? Fuck me?Yeah, you\u2019ll fuck me all right!I couldn\u2019t handle knowing you were in danger. If I was worried about you in combat, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do my job as beta effectively, and Marco relies on me. The good of the pack has to come first. I can\u2019t let you fight against the Hunters and that\u2019s final. End of fucking discussion!\u201d</p><p>Ian was intimidating as hell, but Logan took a deep breath and stood his ground. He was pretty sure Ian wouldn\u2019t hit him. Hadn\u2019t he said the wolves cherished their pets? Time to find out. He lifted his chin and folded his arms across his chest, mimicking what Ian had done earlier. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not the end of the discussion. I\u2019m an adult, and I\u2019ll do whatever I damn please. You\u2019re not going to control my entire life.\u201d</p><p>Ian narrowed his eyes. \u201cLogan, you\u2019re skating on very thin ice. If you continue with this disrespect and defiance, you\u2019ll leave me no choice but to discipline you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiscipline me?\u201d Logan\u2019s eyes squinted as he glared. \u201cDiscipline me? You\u2019re full of shit! I hate you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight,\u201d Ian said with a nod of his head. \u201cTime for you and me to get a few things straight.\u201d</p><p>He ripped Logan\u2019s T-shirt from his body in one powerful swing of his hands. Logan\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cThat was the only one I had! You asshole!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suggest you remove those pants,or you\u2019ll be walking around here naked, because they\u2019re next.\u201d</p><p>Logan took a step backward.</p><p>\u201cTake them off,\u201d Ian said softly, \u201cOr you won\u2019t be wearing clothes for a month.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook with anger, but he knew Ian would probably be a big enough asshole to make him walk around the compound naked. He unsnapped his pants and stepped out of them, throwing them on the chair. He stood naked in front of Ian, his whole body red with rage. \u201cI hate you, damn you! Fucking wolf!\u201d</p><p>Ian thinned his lips, but said nothing. He pulled out the wingback chair next to Logan. \u201cDrape yourself across the chair, Logan. Ass in the air.\u201d</p><p>Logan flushed again and shook his head. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not going to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not up for discussion, Logan.\u201d Ian pulled his belt off and held it in his hand thoughtfully. \u201cDrape yourself across the chair and I\u2019m giving you ten. Fight me and you won\u2019t sit for a week.\u201d</p><p>Between wanting to defy him and knowing with certainty he couldn\u2019t stop what Ian was about to do to him, Logan was torn.If he didn\u2019t cooperate, Ian would probably tie him down. Hating himself for giving in, hating Ian for making him, he bent awkwardly over the chair, suspecting the concession Ian had made earlier was as much behind what he was doing as being mouthed off to. Ian had to reassert his dominance. Ian stepped up behind him and put a hand between his legs, boosting him up on his toes by his balls to where one hand held him firmly in place across the chair. Doubling up the belt, he snapped it sharply againstLogan\u2019s ass, not holding back much. Logan hissed in a breath.He couldn\u2019t stop him, but he damn sure wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of seeing how much it hurt. Before he was ready, another came and another, crisscrossing his buttocks till he couldn\u2019t hold back the tears in his eyes. Almost choking, he endured it until Ian finished and pulled him to his feet. His hands went back to rub his ass, and he tried to stalk away, but Ian held him in place with a tight hold of his arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you learned, Logan?\u201d</p><p>Logan groaned and bit his lip. He struggled hard for a moment and mumbled something.</p><p>\u201cLouder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to talk back to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Are you going to do it again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you understand why you shouldn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. Sir.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighedat Logan\u2019s sarcasm. \u201cPut your pants back on, Logan.\u201d</p><p>Logan walked stiffly over to retrieve them and put them back on, forcing himself not to squirm over the pressure on his abused ass. He looked up to see Ian holding out his collar. \u201cPut it on.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed his eyes shut, but managed to avoid snatching the collar. Just barely. He put it back around his neck and fastened it.</p><p>Ian put his belt back on and walked toward the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to the council meeting. When I get back we are going to have a talk about your duties here at the compound. If you want so badly to assist against the Hunters, I\u2019ll consider it .\u201d</p><p>Logan gazed at him in disbelief. \u201cYou just whipped my ass because I suggested the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Logan, I whipped your ass because you were rude to your mate and more importantly, to your beta. You called me names and told me you hated me. The pack has a hierarchy. You should understand that as a military man. If you talked like that to a superior officer in the Hunters, what would have happened? There would have been punishment involved, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019d have lost a stripe, been on report, but I wouldn\u2019t have been humiliated by beingstripped naked and whipped like a dog. I\u2019m just curious, why is it you\u2019re trying to destroy everything you said attracted you? Is it because I fucked you in the ass?\u201d</p><p>Ian stared at him for a moment, obviously thinking about what Logan said, before he took a step back. He raised his head and regarded him directly.\u201cOkay, Logan. Decide what you want. Be very sure. You can\u2019t be my mate and talk to me like that or refuse to accept and acknowledge your submissive position. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re an adult, and you can decide what you want. I hope you decide you want me. I love you, and I never want to lose you, but if you want to reject me as your mate, you have the right.\u201d He turned and walked to the door, leaving Logan standing open-mouthed behind him.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute! What do you mean I can reject you?I can\u2019t leave here, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Werekin, Logan, and you have every right to stay here, with or without me. I can arrange separate quarters for you and someone else to give you the feedings you\u2019ll need. No doubt there would be plenty of volunteers.Like I said, you need to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>Ian didn\u2019t return until bedtime. Logan was already in bed, feigning sleep when Ian came in the front door to their rooms. Ian walked into the bedroom softly and sat down on the side of the bed, lowering his head in his hands. \u201cI know you\u2019re awake. You need to just say it and get it over with.\u201d</p><p>Logan was still angry. He kept his back turned against Ian. \u201cSay what? Are you expecting me to tell you I want out? We had a fight. I\u2019m pissed. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Unless you want me to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I mean, I love you too, sweetheart.\u201d Ian stood and paced around the room for a few minutes before falling heavily in bed beside him, taking a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cI know this is all hard for you to adjust to, but you sounded pretty positive about hating me. I thought you wanted to reject our mating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell would I go? It\u2019s not like the local drug store carries wolf blood.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019d have to stay in Mountainwood, but I told you other wolves can feed you. Don\u2019t stay with me only because of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want another wolf.\u201d Logan rolled over on his back and reached for Ian\u2019s hand.</p><p>Gripping it tightly, he spoke in the darkness. \u201cSo you can\u2019t handle the idea of me being in danger, huh? Guess that means you\u2019re pretty crazy about me.\u201d Ian squeezed his hand. \u201cYou have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, it\u2019s...it\u2019s kind of nice for a change, you know? That you want me safe. No one\u2019s felt that way about me since my mother died.\u201d Ian started to turn toward him, but Logan put out a hand to stop him. \u201cThat damned belt hurt though. My ass has welts all over it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll heal faster now than you ever did before.\u201d Ian turned and took him in his arms, ignoring his little sounds of protest. \u201cLet me kiss it and make it better.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Laughing and struggling, Logan rolled across the bed, pretending to try to get away.</p><p>Kisses soon progressed to the best blow job Logan had ever had, complete with Ian\u2019s fingers up his ass. By the time Ian\u2019s cock took the place of his fingers, Logan wasn\u2019t thinking of his aching ass cheeks at all.</p><p>The next morning, after a long night of lovemaking, Logan slept late, and got up to find Ian gone. He\u2019d left him a note to come and see him after breakfast. He\u2019d be working in the council room.</p> <p>After a hurried breakfast he made for himself in the small kitchen and a futile attempt to find a shirt that would fit him, he made his way to the council room dressed only in black leather pants and found Ian at work looking at maps.</p><p>\u201cHi, babe. I was looking over these maps you drew us of the compound layout. Which of these buildings isused to store munitions?\u201d</p><p>Logan leaned over the maps, standing beside him. Damn, Ian smelled good to him. He wasn\u2019t wearing cologne, but his natural smell drove Logan crazy. He caught Ian sniffing at him too, but he quickly turned to the maps when Logan pointed.</p><p>\u201cHere. This building.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cI think the best thing to do would be to take out the munitions warehouse. Get rid of their ammunition they use against us. That would give us some time. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>Logan glanced up in surprise. \u201cYou really want to know what I think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re the one most familiar with their operation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...most of the time you treat me as little more a kid.It\u2019s like you don\u2019t think of me as a man, Ian.\u201d</p><p>Ian regarded him for a long time before he cocked his head, saying softly, \u201cYou say that a lot, Logan. About being a man.What does that mean exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does it mean to be a man? You know exactly what it means!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t. Not if you\u2019re using it as a synonym for being strong or brave or fearless. My mother was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer when she was thirty-three years old.Our doctors couldn\u2019t do anything for her, and my father\u2019s blood only managed to help ease the pain a little bit. She was in intractable agony, Logan, for weeks before she died. She couldn\u2019t eat, and she could barely walk. Yet she got up somehow every morning, took care of me, and tried to keep going as long as she could, knowing there was no hope. That was courage, honey. Real guts and real courage.So I\u2019m not sure why you think being a man means you\u2019re something special. My father died two weeks after she did.He simply couldn\u2019t make it without her, because she was his life.\u201d</p> <p>Logan dropped his gaze.\u201cYou knew what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019ve told you before you\u2019re wrong about the way I treat you. We wolves are possessive, yes, and I suppose overly protective of our mates, but I love you and respect your opinion. I don\u2019t think of you as a child at all. I realize you must think that because I used a belt on you last night.I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve given you that impression. I didn\u2019t like hurting you and felt like shit afterward, but if you are too resistant, if you can\u2019t control your baser instincts, there\u2019s a chance you might become feral. Especially right after you\u2019ve been turned. I saw it happen oncewith the alpha\u2019s mate, and it scared the shit out of me. I guess that\u2019s why I used the belt on you last night.\u201d He rubbed his hand over Logan\u2019s hips and Logan stirred uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Feral? What exactly does that mean? Explain it to me.\u201d</p><p>Ian sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you. You\u2019ll be fine as long as you feed regularly or you aren\u2019t allowed to run wild. But you remember the old werewolf movies on TV? Sort of like that...the body starts to shift. You don\u2019t shift completely, but your body would change. Your face\u2014when Nicky changed it was horrible. He\u2019d stopped feeding because of a whole thing with Marco. Those two had a rocky start, Logan. The change that came over him was terrifying. His handsome face became something like awolf\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to explain, but he was vicious, attacking anyone that came near him. I think if we hadn\u2019t been close by and reacted so quickly he might have been lost to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn.\u201d Logan shifted uneasily. \u201cAnd why exactly did this Nicky not feed?\u201d \u201cNicky is very independent, like you. He hated the idea of being dependent on anyone, even Marco. He fought against the collar and the leash,which you won\u2019t see much of anymore, and against spankings and discipline, all the old traditional methods passed down to us. He was skeptical of our claims, I guess. Like you are.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled at Ian. \u201cOkay, maybeyou\u2019ve convinced me I have to keep feeding. Not so much the ass whipping though.I might have a bad temper, but I always have had. I\u2019m not changing into some kind of monster. Now, do you really want to know what I think about the warehouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a job for one or two men. Sneak in, plant the charges, and get out. They should have some kind of remote switch. Like I say, fast in, fast out. You and I could do it, easy.\u201d</p> <p>Ian frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d He made a short scoffing noise.\u201cHell, I guess I wouldn\u2019t trust me either if I were in your place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s dangerous. We\u2019ve already talked about me not wanting you in danger. I wouldn\u2019t want you hurt or killed, and we did discuss you not going out in the field.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you hurt, either, but if we do this right, neither of us would be. I know the layout better than anyone. I pulled guard duty there during my duty rotations before they sent me out here, and you\u2019d be with me to watch my back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are guards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerimeter guards. I remember the schedule. We\u2019d have about thirty minutes to plant the charges and get out.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you this interested in anything since you came. You like doing this kind of thing, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Logan shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s what I was trained for. I can\u2019t just sit around all day, Ian. It would drive me crazy.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded, chewing on the inside of his lip thoughtfully\u201cOkay, honey. I hate the idea of putting you in harm\u2019s way, but if I was there with you, maybe. Let me talk to Marco. It\u2019s worth a try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you serious? You\u2019d actually trust me to go with you?\u201d</p><p>Ian was silent for a long moment and then looked him directly at him. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll talk to Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. It\u2019s out of the question.\u201d Marco slammed his fist down on the table as he spoke, making Ian frown. \u201cWhy? It makes perfect sense.\u201d Ian stood up and paced around the room. \u201cLogan knows the layout and the operation better than anyone. He\u2019s been trained in munitions and knows how to set up a remote switch. I would go along, mainly as muscle in case we encountered any guards, but Logan said we could watch them and verify their schedule before we make the attempt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan says, Logan says.\u201d Casey stood up and addressed Ian. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he hasn\u2019t been turned long enough.He\u2019s barely had time to come out of the transition, and he was a Hunter. How do you know he\u2019s not saying all this just to get himself back to his people and get you captured?\u201d</p><p>Ian tried to hold onto his temper. \u201cI trust Logan with my life. He was a Hunter, past tense. He\u2019s Werekin now, my mate. You know how the mating bite works as well as I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s possible to defy it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t know it, he also despiseshis father!\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Marco ordered, furious atCasey\u2019s reminderof Nicky\u2019s defiance even if Rory had gone through some as well.</p><p>Suffering a stab of guilt, Ian knew it too. The defiance thing was something he hadn\u2019t included when he told Logan why Nicky had stopped feeding. He did tell Logan he could reject their mating, but he hadn\u2019t gone into details on how he had to defy the mating changes and compulsions to do it.</p><p>Marco shook his head. \u201cPlease, everyone sit down. Let\u2019s try to discuss this reasonably. Ian, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t trust Logan. I do. I still think it\u2019s too dangerous for just two men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen others can come along to guard the perimeter of the warehouse\u2014take care of any guards, but the operation itself is best for only two men.\u201d He slanted a look at Casey. \u201cActually, it would be better for two human-sized males to do. My size or any wolf\u2019s will stand out and draw attention. I thought the perfect wolf for the job would be Rory.\u201d</p><p>Casey jumped back to his feet, fury on his face. \u201cNo! Not just no, but hell no! Leave my mate out of this crazy plan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI anticipated you\u2019d feel that way. I simply said he would be perfect for the job. He\u2019s a wolf, but smaller than the rest of us.\u201d</p><p>Casey threw himself back in his chair. \u201cOut of the question!\u201d</p><p>Marco spoke up, looking concerned. \u201cIan, I understand how important this could be, but you can\u2019t ask any of us to risk our mates. It would upset the entire pack if something happened to one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Although I would like to point out I\u2019d be putting my own mate at risk. I\u2019m willing to do that, though, as long as I can go along to protect him, like I\u2019m sure each and every one of you would want to do.\u201d</p><p>Marco narrowed his eyes at Ian. \u201cUh-huh.I see what you\u2019re doing, Ian, but I still think it\u2019s too dangerous. Maybe if we sent a small group in, say, four wolves. Do you think it could be managedwith that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree wolves and Logan.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled and nodded. \u201cAll right. Agreed.\u201d</p><p>Casey spoke up. \u201cAs battle leader, I claim a place on the team.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go along too.\u201d</p><p>Casey and Ian both immediately objected. Marco held up a hand for quiet.\u201cIf this mission succeeds, it could mean the end to the fighting for years to come. We might even be able to forge a truce with the Hunters that could lead to a lasting peace. It\u2019s the job of an alpha to lead his people, and I want to do that. I\u2019m going.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He turned to the opening door, again signalingfor silence. \u201cI have Nicky and Rory coming in to meetLogan,\u201d Marco stated.</p><p>Logan arrived first, brought in by one of the gammas. He looked around the room in uncertainty until his eyes fell on Casey and the look of hostility on his face. He frowned, thinking nothing good was going to happen, but looked down, not challenging him by holding his gaze. Ian cleared his throat, and immediately Logan raised his head and started over toward him. Before he reached him, the door opened behind him. Nicky and Rory entered. Logan stopped and stared at the newcomers.</p><p>Recognizing who was who wasn\u2019t difficult. Nicky, dressed in tight black leather pants, had golden hair tucked in curls behind his ears. He gave everyone a big smile as he came in, looking around the room with interest. When he spotted Marco at the head of the table his smile grew even wider, and he sauntered over to him to plop down on the chair arm next to him and twined his arm around his neck. Marco laughed indulgently and leaned up to kiss him with a possessive air. Logan was shocked as he watched them. Rory followed in a more sedate manner, walking over to stand beside Casey\u2019s chair, as befit the dignity of a wolf. He did squeeze Casey\u2019s hand when he offered it, his only acknowledgement of their bond.</p> <p>Ian watched Nicky with a strangely wistful look. A sharp stab of some unfamiliar emotion ran through Logan. He didn\u2019t want Ian looking at anyone like that. Ever. Nicky was beautiful\u2014there was no other word to describe him. Oddly, though he hung all over Marco, he didn\u2019t look gay at all, if there was such a look. He was lean, but muscular and had a manly swagger with nothing feminine in his movements. Everything Logan had ever been taught on the subject of homosexual love was topsy-turvy. Watching the men openly express their affection only made him feel worse. He walked over to Ian and touched his shoulder. He was rewarded with a warm smile, but he still had a funny feeling in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>Marco gave Nicky a quick kiss as he stood and let Nicky slide down into his chair. He addressed the others at the table. \u201cI thought our mates could have a little talk together tonight over dinner. Nicky, in particular, has some insights he can share with Logan about the necessity for feedings. And Rory has some experience as a new mate who had some difficulty settling in. Nicky and I would like to invite you all over for dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled and nodded, as did Casey, and that seemed to be that, leaving Logan full of resentment. What if he didn\u2019t want to have dinner tonight with these two seriously gorgeous guys, one of whom Ian seemed to be more than a little interested in?Didn\u2019t matter apparently. It seemed to be a done deal.</p><p>As they left, Ian took Logan\u2019s hand and led him down the hallway and up the stairs to their apartment. \u201cI have some exciting news, Logan. Marco has agreed with our plan. He\u2019s made a few changes, like he and Casey want to goalong, but he\u2019s agreed to let me take you with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good.\u201d Logan\u2019s voice was low and uninterested.</p> <p>Entering their rooms, Ian turned to face him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, honey?Don\u2019t you feel well?I thought you\u2019d be excited by the news.\u201d \u201cWhy did you agree to dinner tonight with all of them? I have no interest in getting to know Nicky and Rory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Logan?They\u2019re both very nice and can help you a lot. Nicky in particular, is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Logan broke in, throwing himself down on the sofa. \u201cIs what?Oh, I\u2019m sure you think he\u2019s just great. Nicky is perfect, isn\u2019t he? I saw how you were looking at him. I\u2019ve noticed how your face lights up whenever you talk about him. You probably wish he was yours, don\u2019t you? All that curly blond hair, all that hanging all over his master like a dog begging for attention.\u201d</p><p>Ian laughed out loud.\u201cIt\u2019s obvious you don\u2019t know Nicky very well if you think he considers Marco his master.\u201d</p><p>Logan frowned.\u201cYeah, but he belongs to your alpha, so there\u2019s not much you can do about your obvious attraction to him, is there?Guess that\u2019s why you settled for me. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m your blood match, after all. But hey, any old port in a storm, right?\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s jaw dropped. He sat beside Logan on the sofa, twisting to face him. \u201cAre you crazy?Is that what\u2019s wrong, Logan? You\u2019ve lost your mind all of a sudden?\u201d</p> <p>Logan crossed his arms over his chest and turned his head away. \u201cI saw how you looked at him. You don\u2019t have to pretend.\u201d</p><p>Ian threw back his head and laughed. \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re jealous! You\u2019re jealous of Nicky!\u201d</p><p>Logan pressed his lips together and shot him a dark look. \u201cOf course not, don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ve never been jealous of anyone in my life. Certainly not another man!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you wouldn\u2019t mind if I sat next to Nicky tonight at dinner?\u201d</p><p>Logan gave him an evil look. \u201cIf you want to have to sleep with one eye open, go right ahead.\u201d</p><p>Still laughing, Ian lifted Logan over into his lap, and wrapped his arms around him to make him stay there. \u201cNot jealous, huh? Settle down, please! Let me talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Logan still tried to push away. \u201cI\u2019m not jealous! If you like Nicky and his girly blond curls, go ahead. Makes no difference to me.\u201d</p><p>Ian forced his head around and kissed him to shut him up. Logan fought, but Ian held him effortlessly until Logan was out of breath and gave up. Only then did Ian relax his hold and trail kisses down his throat and onto his chest. \u201cWhy would I want a blond when I\u2019ve got a sultry, sexy brunet? Do you ever look in the mirror, baby?You\u2019re gorgeous!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen why did you look at Nicky with that expression on your face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat expression?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you wished it was you Nicky was draped all over!I saw your face, so don\u2019t try to deny it!\u201d Logan almost spat the words in his anger.</p><p>Ian shook his head sadly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that, baby. It wasn\u2019t Nicky I wanted. It was to have that kind of relationship with you.\u201d</p><p>Logan shot up and walked into the kitchen. \u201cI can\u2019t be that kind of man, Ian. It doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t care about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d he said, turning around to look at Ian. \u201cDo you, really?Because you don\u2019t sound like you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you have strong feelings for me, Logan, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what, damn it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan, we\u2019re not a blood match. You have feelings for me because of the chemistry from the mating bite. It had to be that way. For me, it was different. I wanted you from the first minute I saw you. It\u2019s a love match for me. I hope that one day\u2014\u201d</p><p>Logan yelled at Ian, shaking with fury. \u201cSo now you\u2019re telling me how I feel? You think I would let you\u2014do the things you do, if I didn\u2019t\u2014damn it!I\u2019m not attracted to any man except you. I never have been.I don\u2019t want you looking at anybody else. Anybody else, you got that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got it.\u201d Ian held out his hand, but Logan pointedly ignored it and flopped in the chair opposite Ian. He kept his arms folded, but he unbent a little.</p><p>\u201cNow what were you saying about Marco allowing me to go with you to the munitions warehouse?\u201d Logan asked, all business.</p><p>\u201cUh, well, he said he and Casey wanted to go with us, but he will allow you to go too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. When do we leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t discuss that yet. I\u2019d like to try right away. We\u2019ll have to inform the council.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you do that tomorrow?We\u2019ve already wasted too much time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Marco and Casey tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let me know what they say, because I won\u2019t be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m not in the mood. Unless you think I\u2019m being feral and want to force me.\u201d</p><p>Ian considered his answer, long enough for Logan to think he was going to insist. He breathed out a small sigh of relief when Ian said, \u201cNo, Logan. Ifyou don\u2019t want to go, then you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019m going to turn in early and read. Wake me up when you get home. If you want to.\u201d Logan rose to his feet and walked with determination to the bedroom, leaving Ian gazing after him with a puzzled expression.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Ian and Marco discussed the matter with the council, and they reluctantly agreed. They were concerned about all of their leaders being captured at once, but finally accepted Marco and Casey\u2019s determination to go.</p><p>Two days later, they started out early in the morning. They drove to a safe spot as close to the isolated compound as they could and took a long hike in the rest of the way, certain the private road into the two hundred acres would be monitored. Ian carried Logan part of the way since he couldn\u2019t keep up with the wolves\u2019 supernatural speed. The compound, surrounded by a high chain link fence, was situated at the top of a flat crested hill close to the boundaries of the Nantahala National forest, the same forest which edged their land on a different side. At one end of the compound was the warehouse, a metal building approximately a hundred feet long and forty wide. At the other end, in a rough semi-circle, a long flat building comprised of quarters, cells, infirmary, interrogation rooms, and field offices. Other smaller buildings were for storage of supplies. A guard house, lit up on the inside by the dim flickering of a television, was located at the front next to a heavy steel gate..</p><p>When they arrived well after dark on the mountainside overlooking the compound, the wolves had a hurried conference. They separated into two groups. Marco and Casey went to the perimeter of the compound, watching for any stray guards or Hunters who might be wandering around in the area. Ian turned away with a nod and motioned for Logan to follow him down the rough terrain and thick forest.</p><p>Ian and Logan picked up their gear and moved down through the night toward the fence. With the wire cutters Ian carried, they were soon inside the compound. In silence, they kept to the shadows and joined in with the darkness. Ian was jittery. Things were almost too quiet. Ian tried to shake it off as his imagination. He knew in a tense situation, especially at night, and especially when he had to worry about another man's safety, his imagination could get the better of him. The fear factor multiplied until he could begin to see things really not there and hear things all in his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He squinted at the dark, but there was nothing to see. A lot of human scents surrounded them, but nothing close or fresh. A chill ran down his spine with the thought of the scent neutralizer, but he shook it off. There would be no reason for them to use it at their home base. Nerves. That's all it was.</p><p>They made it to a large, steel doorway and jimmied the lock without attracting any notice. Marco and Casey were stationed near the guard shack, watching for any movement of guards toward Ian and Logan's position. They had set up a signal on hisand Marco\u2019s cell phones, set to vibrate if they saw or heard anything out of the ordinary.</p><p>Moving quietly, using hand motions, Logan signaled Ian to follow him into the interior of the building. An anxious feeling in Ian's chest reminded him of his own training and night hunts with the pack, fluttery and tight at the same time. He tried to measure out his breathing, take it slowly. He\u2019d compromised his own principles in an effort to placate Logan. Nothing could happen to foul this up.</p> <p>Logan was busy setting the first charge. Six sticks of dynamite, taped together and attached to a detonator. Simple, but effective. He followed Logan to four separate locations where Logan quickly set the remaining charges. At the last location, he attached the radioactivated device to set off the charges.</p><p>They made their way back to the door and stepped outside. Moonlight sparkled on the wires of the fence, and a curious layering of shadows hung all over the compound yard. The darkness was absolute. As Ian took a step toward the fence, a low pop and then a sizzle cut through the dead silence. The night exploded with light. Flares went off all around them turning the night into instant daylight. Ian shoved Logan behind him, but before he could move to shift or run, Hunters dropped from the roof on top of him. At least six men drove him to the ground. They hit him over and over in the head and back of the neck with clubs, but he fought for consciousness. He had to somehow get to Logan. He tried again to shift, but darkness crowded his brain. He cried out for Logan as another blow came down on his temple, and he knew nothing more until he awoke in darkness of a different kind.</p><p>His head, neck, and shoulders ached like hell and blood, warm and wet, seeped from his scalp and moved like sludge. He hadn\u2019t been out long. He tried to sit up and a bright slash of pain knifed through him. Taking a deep breath, he tried again and managed to sit up in the darkness. He was on a cold, damp concrete floor. Windowless and damn near airless, and the only bit of light in the room was a small strip coming under the door. He still wore his shirt, though it was ripped into shreds around him. He tore a long strip from it to bind his head and stop the bleeding. He couldn\u2019t imagine how things had gone so desperately wrong. He also wasn\u2019t sure how or why he was still alive, but feared he knew the answer. More than once a wolf body mutilated by experimentation and torture had been found, usually those rogues who had refused to join a pack and lacked the protection of one.</p><p>His mind went to Logan and another, deeper pain slashed through his body. If they\u2019d hurt Logan he didn\u2019t think he could survive. He didn\u2019t believe they would have killed him\u2014 at least not until they had a chance to question him. Surely they wouldn\u2019t have harmed him out of hand. He was Elias Winters\u2019 only son, after all, even if Elias had literally thrown his son to the wolves.</p><p>As his eyes adjusted a bit to the light, he got unsteadily to his feet and, with a hand on the wall for support, managed to move slowly around the small room. By pacing it off, he found it was approximately fifteen feet square. As he thought, there were no windows and only one steel door locked from outside. A bucket stood in one corner and a large pan of water by the door. He smiled grimly. A pan of water for a dog. Perhaps the Huntersweren\u2019t quite as humorless as he\u2019d always thought. They did, at least, provide a bucket to piss in.</p> <p>He dipped his hand in the pan and tasted the water, finding it fairly fresh. By scent and taste it seemed harmless. He drank from his cupped hand, worried over what happened to Marco and Casey and hoped they hadn\u2019t been taken. He figured the Hunters would come soon to interrogate him or finish him off. Either way, he was impatient for something to happen.</p><p>He thought of Logan again and wondered what they\u2019d done with him . He wondered how Logan would handle his father. Had Logan seen his father? Did his father know yet he\u2019d been turned to Werekin and mated to a man? How would he take that? How would Logan take his father knowing he was in what they termed an unnatural homosexual relationship? Would Logan try to use his influence with the man to have himself released or returned to duty? Fuck, how would Logan live without a wolf to feed him? Too many questions and Ian had no answers.</p><p>He had no illusions about his release, either, no matter what Logan might say to his father. Hunters would never release a wolf prisoner alive. Torture them to death for information and kill them when they thought they had all they\u2019d get or use them for sadistic and brutal experiments, but never release them.</p><p>He thought back to the time of their capture. No signal of any kind had come from Marco and Casey to warn of their approach. The Hunters had been waiting for them, doused in their scent neutralizer. That would mean they had known they were coming, but who could have tipped them off? No one had known about the mission except the members of the council\u2014and Logan. His mind shied violently away from the idea of Logan having anything to do with a trap. Logan couldn\u2019t\u2014wouldn\u2019t\u2014have betrayed him. Would he? Had all their time together been a fucking lie?</p><p>Ian shook his head, trying to dispel his suspicions. Even if Logan had wanted to warn the Hunters of the attack, how could he have done it?He\u2019d been under close supervision the entire time he\u2019d been with the wolf pack. There weren\u2019t any landline phones in the compound. Only a few of the pack even had cell phones. Leaders like Marco\u2014and himself! The thought of Logan sneaking around to use his phone came into his head unbidden, and he forced it out. Logan wouldn\u2019t betray him, even if he hadn\u2019t kept his phone locked up, even if Logan had been in a room alone with it. He might not be desperately in love with Ian, but he cared for him, Ian knew he did.</p><p>With the throb in his head at an unbearable level, he stretched out, his head on his arm on the cold, concrete floor. He tried to relax and get some rest. He didn\u2019t know what lay ahead of him, but he knew it was bound to be unpleasant.</p> <p>Ian awoke to the sound of the door opening. He sat up quickly, tense and ready for whatever was coming. His head still throbbed, and he felt empty and drained. A light snapped on, blinding Ian for the few seconds needed for his eyes to adjust to the glaring brightness. Two men stood in the doorway with guns trained on him.</p><p>One of them spoke. \u201cGet on your feet, wolf. You\u2019re coming with us.\u201d</p><p>Ian did as he was told, anxious to be out of the small squalid space. He was ready for whatever was going to be his fate to go ahead and happen. He hated the waiting. As he passed the guards, one of them shoved him out into the corridor. A low growl escaped his lips, but he controlled his wolf. If much more stress was put on him, he might not be able to control it much longer.</p><p>They directed him down the corridor to a room at the end. As he stepped inside, he saw a doctor\u2019s examination table, covered with a white sheet. The guards pushed him toward it. \u201cGet up on the table. We\u2019re going to strap you down. Don\u2019t give us any trouble or we\u2019ll shoot.\u201d</p><p>Ian turned and gave them a narrow look. No one was going to strap him down. He tensed, as his wolf come close to the surface. From behind the guards, a new voice spoke up, one that was very familiar.</p><p>\u201cCooperate with them. They will shoot. No one is going to hurt you. I promise.\u201d Logan stepped from behind the guards, looking calm and collected. He wore clean clothes of his own, army camo again, and his hair was neatly combed. He nodded at Ian, and spoke to the guards. \u201cLower your weapons. He\u2019s not going to hurt anyone. Are you, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He said the name with what sounded to Ian like a stabbing twist, and was that a slight sneering lift of his lip? Ian said nothing, staring at Logan, so happy to see him looking well, yet devastated this might mean he had been in on this thing all along.</p><p>\u201cThat depends, Logan,\u201d he said, his voice sounding harsh even to his own ears. \u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee to your wounds, for one thing, and then the doctor wants to take a sample of your blood. My father\u2019s idea. He wants to lessen my dependence on you by coming up with a synthetic substitute for wolf\u2019s blood. I probably need to feed again.It\u2019s been several days now,if you\u2019ll allow it. Even if you won\u2019t. The doctor can take the blood from you, but it would be easier if you cooperated.\u201d</p><p>His voice was so cool, so indifferent and calm. Logan looked at Ian as if there had never been anything between them. As if he barely knew him. A sudden weakness swept over Ian, and he found he really didn\u2019t care much what happened anymore. He\u2019d been betrayed and made a fool of by this man, this human\u2014his Hunter, his lover. Ian had never been anything more to Logan than a monster. Everything he\u2019d ever said had been a lie. All the questions he\u2019d asked weren\u2019t with the innocent curiosity Ian had taken them for. Even the mating bond hadn\u2019t been strong enough to wipe out his hate.</p><p>Ian turned without a word and stretched on the table. The guards stepped up beside him and strapped him down. Logan stood watching with an unreadable look on his face. Was he happy to see him tied and helpless as he had been when they captured him? Would he make him suffer for what had passed between them?</p><p>A man in a lab coat came into the room and over to the table. He examined the wounds on Ian\u2019s head and neck, murmured about infection and began to clean them. The pain was bad, but Ian remained stoic and showed nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to put stitches in this one.\u201d He looked up at Logan with a questioning look on his face.\u201cI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m wasting my time doing this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I told you to.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged slightly, turned back to his cabinets, and took out a hypodermic needle. After swabbing an area with alcohol, he quickly shot something into the wound on Ian\u2019s head, causing him to clamp his jaw and clench his hands. When the doctor rolled his head for a better angle, Ian saw Logan staring at him, looking directly into his eyes. He still couldn\u2019t read any expression, but he figured Logan was happy to see him in pain. He closed his eyes, refusing to look at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Throughout the next fifteen or twenty minutes, they stitched his wound, cleaned the others and took a sample of his blood, a full pint. He kept his eyes closed. He couldn\u2019t stand to look at Logan again.</p><p>Only when Logan spoke to him did he reluctantly open them again. \u201cI\u2019m going to feed. The doctor will make a small incision on your arm. Just relax.\u201d</p><p>A moment of bright pain was followed by the sweet feel of Logan\u2019s lips on his skin. Logan looked down at his dark hair, streaked with lighter shades of brown. He wanted to caress his cheek, to hold him in his arms once more, but he knew that was over. Logan\u2019s eyes fluttered open, and his beautiful eyes sparkled at him. Pain clutched at Ian, and he had to close his eyes again.</p> <p>Logan finished and told the guards to release Ian so he could stop the bleeding on his wrist. Ian sat up on the table and brought his wrist to his mouth, thinking how Logan\u2019s lips had been there seconds before. He licked at it a few times to stop the bleeding, and stood, swaying a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhen did he eat last?\u201d Logan asked the guards. Ian gave a short bark of bitter laughter, and Logan turned his gaze back to the guards. \u201cFeed him at once, idiots. He won\u2019t be of any use to me if he dies of hunger.\u201d He gave Ian a strange look as he swept out the door, the doctor trailing behind him.</p><p>The guards took him back to the same cell, but they left the lights on. In a few minutes they brought back a big plate of some kind of stew and a huge chunk of bread. They threw in a blanket, too, and brought fresh water. Ian was so weak after he ate, he had to lie down. He closed his eyes and thought about Logan for the few minutes he had until the weakness took him under.</p><p>The next day, spent in the locked room, only seeing the guards when they brought his food, Ian tried not to think about Logan. The anguish of his betrayal was too great. He wondered again about Marco and Casey and cursed himself for not asking Logan about them. The guards opened the door, but didn\u2019t speak to him, just slid his food inside and quickly locked the door behind them.</p><p>The next day they put something in his food. He could tell by the smell and didn\u2019t care. He spent most of the following days sleeping. Two days later the guards came to take him out of the room again. He was taken into a small interrogation room a few doors down. Inside, sitting at a table, was an older man with very short white hair and Logan.</p> <p>Both men were expressionless, though Logan\u2019s eyebrows raised slightly when he caught his first sight of Ian. His gaze moved up and down his body as if taking stock of his condition. Ian knew he was filthy, bruised, and his clothes were in rags. He could only imagine how he must look. No doubt as bad as Logan had looked the first time he saw him.</p><p>The guards pushed him into a chair at the opposite end of the table and securely tethered his arms and wrists behind him, tying them tightly to the metal rails of the chair. Elias Winters got to his feet and walked around to him. The blow, when it came, was sudden. Ian didn\u2019t have time to brace for it. Elias struck him with his fist, in the middle of the stitches on the side of his head. The pain was stunning. Logan was on his feet in seconds, pulling his father away.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Logan pulled his father\u2019s arm around and pushed him away from Ian.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve wanted to do since I first heard what this filthy bastarddid to you!\u201d Elias\u2019 chest heaved with emotion, and he pushed back against Logan, to strike Ian again. Logan put both hands on his father\u2019s chest and pushed him hard enough that he hit the wall behind him.</p><p>\u201cEnough, damn it! Leave him alone!\u201d</p><p>Elias straightened up slowly, giving his son a poisonous look. \u201cIt seems to me you would hate him even more than I do. Or did you enjoy what he did to you? Turning you into some freakish abomination having to drink blood to live!\u201d</p> <p>Logan glared at his father. \u201cDon\u2019t be an ass! I hate his guts, but I need him\u2014just like you said\u2014to stay alive. Now sit down and let me handle this.\u201d</p><p>Elias gave Ian one more hate-filled look before going back to sit down. Logan turned to face Ian. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>From what Elias said, Logan had managed to hide their full relationship from his father. He didn\u2019t think Elias would have missed a chance to mention sex between them, in the most derogatory way if he knew. \u201cWhat do you care?\u201d</p><p>He was surprised to see a flush darken Logan\u2019s handsome face. He rubbed a hand over his jaw and sat down next to Ian. \u201cSo far the doctors haven\u2019t been successful in creating a synthetic substitute for your blood. It looks as if you\u2019ll be here with us indefinitely.\u201d</p><p>Ian stared at Logan and said nothing. Inside his heart beat hard in his chest from being so near, but he couldn\u2019t allow his feelings to show.\u201cAnd if I refuse to give you my blood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. If you won\u2019t allow it, we\u2019ll have to take it from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to Marco and Casey?Are you holding them too?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cThey escaped.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRan like the coward dogs they are,\u201d Elias interjected.</p><p>Ian sagged a little in relief, ignoring the old man. The only smart thing for them to have done was run. He would have hated to think he had been the cause of getting his friends killed. He\u2019d been foolish enough to believe in Logan. He should have known. He should have been able to sense his insincerity and deceit.</p><p>He turned his head to gaze directly into Logan\u2019s eyes. \u201cYour doctors better hurry with their experiments. Wolves don\u2019t live long in captivity.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s face registered surprise and alarm, worried about himself and how Logan would live if he died, no doubt. Ian turned his head back to stare straight ahead, trying to keep his expression neutral. The guards stepped up behind him, clamped a steel ring around his neck and steel cuffs around his wrists attached to the collar with short lengths of chain before they released him.</p><p>\u201cThat will ensure you don\u2019t change unless you want to strangle yourself,\u201d Elias sneered.</p><p>\u201cMake sure that collarisn\u2019t tight enough to strangle him otherwise,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>He gave the word a twist in reminder, Ian was sure, of the one he\u2019d made him wear.</p><p>\u201cLogan? Your father wants you in interrogation room threeright away.\u201d Logan gazed at the guard at his door in confusion. Interrogation room? He\u2019d never been assigned to interrogating prisoners, never been trained in it, and had no idea why he was being summoned. Interrogate who?Surely it wasn\u2019t Ian. Ian had nothing to tell them that Logan hadn\u2019t already told them, at least as much as Logan would tell them.Maybe they\u2019d picked up another prisoner. Logan nodded to the guard, hoping it was nobody he had ever met.What if they\u2019d managed to capture Marco or Casey after all?</p><p>He closed the door behind him, took a deep breath and headed for the interrogation room down the corridor. The general had put him in a room in this hallway, ones usually reserved for important visitors. Logan had always lived in the enlisted men\u2019s quarters in barracks with little to no privacy. He figured the new accommodations were so Elias Winters could keep his eye on him. No matter what he\u2019d told Elias, the general was suspicious of the relationship he had with Ian. From the second he woke up and realized what had happened, he\u2019d lied his ass off, saying Ian had bitten him, changing him to Werekin, making him dependent on him for his wolf blood, but nothing more. Not that the last mattered. The general hated him for even what he\u2019d admitted to.</p><p>When he found the door to the room, he hesitated, taking a deep breath. He had no idea what he would find inside, and dreaded whatever confrontation was about to take place. He swung open the door and froze.He\u2019d heard rumors from the other soldiers, but refused to believe them. The evidence was in front of him\u2014a torture room, plain and simple. Throughout the room were the instruments\u2014a flogging bench, a rack of whips, and an assortment of blades on one wall.Logan\u2019s mind registered them and shied away from what they meant. Yet only one thing grabbed his attention and held it. At the back of the room, a huge X-shaped affair was mounted to the floor. Ian hung from it, his chest raw with whip cuts, blood running to his knees. Naked, his skin filthy and covered with bruises, Ian held himself proudly erect as possible, his glorious body unbowed. His eyes went straight to Logan. The look of hate and anger made Logan\u2019s heart turn over in his chest.</p><p>His father startled him by laughing aloud. \u201cThe look on your face, Logan. Haven\u2019t you ever seen aSt. Andrew\u2019s Cross before?\u201d</p><p>Beside Ian, whip in his hand, was Dawson, his father\u2019s right hand man. He slapped the handle of the cat o\u2019 nine tails against his thigh, impatient to use it more.</p><p>Ian\u2019s breath caught in his chest. \u201cWhat? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might like a little payback for the bastard who tortured you. You look a little sick instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damned right I am,\u201d Logan snapped, going back into character. \u201cYou\u2019re killing him,and you know I need him to live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not killing him, not yet. A tradition from our ancestors to teach those bound to it humility.\u201d He tipped his head at Ian.\u201cThese animals can take a lot more punishment than this.\u201d Elias Winters stepped forward and looked Ian up and down with hatred and contempt. \u201cBastard. Let\u2019s see how you react to more pain and how long it takes you to heal. Sit down, Logan,and watch how a real man takes his revenge.\u201d</p><p>Ian was attached to the cross by the collar, his wrist cuffs, and additional cuffs at his ankles, his legs stretched apart obscenely. His heavy balls, the ones Logan had held in his hands and sucked into his mouth, were hanging low between his legs. His magnificent cock, that had been insideLogan\u2019s ass too many times to count, drooped limply. Logan had to hold onto himself tightly not to rip the fucking whip from Dawson\u2019s hand and use it on him.</p><p>Ian made no sound or struggle, waiting stoically for more of his skin to be ripped apart by the whip. Dawson drew back his arm,and Logan couldn\u2019t prevent himself from moving. He caught Dawson\u2019s arm and whirled him around to face him.\u201cStop it, damn it! Do you want to kill him?Look at the condition he\u2019s already in! He won\u2019t survive the beating you plan to give him and then what will happen to me?You\u2019ve made your point! End this!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That close, Logan saw something else, four cutsacross Ian\u2019s forearm, all festered to different degrees.\u201cAnd what the hell is this!\u201d Logan demanded between gritted teeth, not caring for the look on the general\u2019s face and in his eyes even though he answered him.</p><p>\u201cTo answer the last question, those are experiments, cuts made with the knife dipped in different substances to find one that poisons them. My revenge is also an experiment, to see how fast the animals heal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to fucking poison me? You know I have to have his blood. You poison it,you poison me. Leave him alone until you find a substitute.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSince when do you give orders, Corporal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince my life depends on it. Leave him the fuck alone.\u201d</p><p>His father\u2019s lips thinned and he barked at the guards,\u201cTake the wolf down. Put my son up there in his place.\u201d</p><p>The guards hurried over to unlock the cuffs holding Ian\u2019s ankles, leaving him hanging, using his arms to keep from choking, for the few seconds it took them to release the collar and the wrist cuffs. Ian staggered, but he stayed on his feet and stood straight, staring straight ahead.</p><p>\u201cStrip off your shirt, soldier.This is the second time you\u2019ve talked to me this way and countermanded my orders. You need a reminder of what happens for insubordination. Neither you, nor anyone else is going to talk to me that way.\u201d</p> <p>Logan narrowed his eyes, but he ripped at his shirt, filled with rage. He pulled it off and shrugged off the hands of Dawson and another guard.\u201cI don\u2019t need to be tied.\u201d He stalked over to the cross, and as he did, he passed Ian as they pulled him back to his cell. At least he had saved Ian from more torture from his psychotic father. He had spared him that much. As Ian passed him, he gave Logan a significant look, oneLogan couldn\u2019t read. What was he thinking? Was he happy Logan was about to suffer torture too?</p><p>Stepping up to the cross he vowedhe wouldn\u2019t give them the satisfaction of hearing him cry out or plead for mercy.Don\u2019t react in any way to the sadistic bastards. He spread his arms across the X frame and spread his legs wide, waiting.</p><p>He heard the door close behind him as they took Ian back to his cell. Feeling instantly alone with Ian no longer near him, even considering the way Ian felt about him, Logan gripped the chains, held on tightly and waited.</p><p>The first crack of the whip across his back, he did nearly scream, unprepared for the degree of pain. Hissing through his teeth, he asked, \u201cSince when did you start using the whip on your own men?\u201d</p><p>Dawson answered, \u201cSince they were stupid enough to give the general orders.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked over his shoulder. His father was gone.\u201cThat bastard.\u201d Nothing had ever brought home the fact of his father\u2019s cold indifference to him more clearly. His hatred for the man grew with each of the next four cuts of the cat o\u2019 nine tails across his back. How had Ian ever stood it and walked out of the room on his own two feet?</p> <p>Logan, alone in his room, paced up and down. He kept seeing Ian hanging from that cross the week before. It tore Logan apart to have seen him in that condition. His eyes were the worst. They were cold, frozen, and defeated.</p><p>Logan was being guarded too. More subtly, but carefully nonetheless. He knew there were security cameras all over the compound, and he strongly suspected one had been placed outside his door. He\u2019d tried desperately to convince his father he hated Ian and the wolves and he\u2019d wanted nothing more than to escape the pack. He\u2019d lied through his teeth, telling him he led Ian into the compound after giving them false information on the guard routine. What had really happened to expose them, he had no idea, and no one was talking. He couldn\u2019t very well press for details, not while taking credit for the successful capture. His father let him, and Logan suspected they both knew it was a lie.</p><p>So far, they\u2019d kept Ian alive to feed Logan but his father loathed Ianfor what he\u2019d done to his son even worse than he hated all wolves. Even though Eliashadn\u2019t mentioned it, Logan knew his father was aware of Ian asthe pack\u2019s beta. As far as he knew, in the past week, they hadn\u2019t returned Ian to the torture chamber and tomorrow he was due for another feeding. He was sorry he told his father he only needed the blood every two weeks. The last week, without seeing Ian at all had been his own brand of torture.</p><p>The tips of his fingers were raw from the stabs of a needle to take blood samples, but his back had pretty much healed in that time.Ian\u2019s would have healed even quicker. He worried about those cuts, though,and what kind of poison they\u2019d infected them with, not for his own sake the way he\u2019d shouted, but for Ian\u2019s.</p><p>If they could synthesize the blood, Ian would be expendable, and his father would have him questioned, punished, experimented on, fully intending to kill him in slow agony. From the look of loathing Logan had caught in his father\u2019s eyes more than once, he didn\u2019t know why either one of them was still alive. His father had something up his sleeve and, knowing how brutal and savagehe\u2019d gotten in his obsession to kill all the wolves, he feared what was in store for him as well as Ian before it was over.</p><p>From the looks of Ian, time was running out. What was it he said? Wolves don\u2019t live long in captivity. The words sent a shiver down Logan\u2019s spine. They sure as hell wouldn\u2019t while being tortured and experimented on, and Logan had no idea how much longer his father would play the cat and mouse game with him. If only he could get word to Ian somehow that he was still loyal to him and wanted to free him. The few times they\u2019d been together, Logan had been too closely watched. He\u2019d tried to send Ian a message with his eyes, but most of the time, Ian refused to look at him. He had no idea how he could get to him. He was about desperate enough to try to slip him a written message during his next feeding to hang on just a little longer. He even sat down and wrote one out, slipping it quickly into his pocket when someone knocked on his door.</p><p>A knock on his door at that time of night made his gut clutch. He answered, fearing the worst. Had something happened to Ian? Two guards stood in the hallway. He didn\u2019t place either of them at first though they looked familiar. Before he could recall where he knew them from, the guard standing closest to him pushed him backward into the room and followed him inside, clapping a hand over his mouth and spinning him to lock tight against his chest with the other arm. The other guard shut the door, poured some kind of liquid on a cloth and pressed it to Logan\u2019s nose. He had no choice but to breathe it in. The fumes were strong and pungent, and nomatter how hard he twisted his head, he couldn\u2019t break away from the one holding him. He knew what held him if not who and a bright slash of hope filled him. The wolves had come for Ian! As the edges of the room grew dim, he sagged to the floor, and they followed him down, stretching him out. He gazed up at his attackers and right into the eyes of the one holding the cloth so tightly over his nose. The eyes were a striking shade of blue, and his eyebrows were blond. The last time he\u2019d seen eyes of those color was at Mountainwood on Nicky, the alpha\u2019s mate. He tried to call out, but the sound came out a muffled moan, and the cloth was pressed more firmly down. All the lights went out.</p><p>Logan struggled to the surface and slowly opened his eyes. He was on his belly, his hands tied behind his back. Standing over him were the two guards\u2014no, that wasn\u2019t right. It was Nicky and someone else in guard uniforms. He tried to focus his eyes on the other guard. Rory. That was his name, Casey\u2019s wolf mate. He knew ithadn\u2019t been a human holding him down. The two of them whispered furiously together when Nicky noticed he was awake. They had obviously come to the same conclusion Ian had. He was a traitor in their eyes. Logan could imagine the accusations being shouted by Casey. He\u2019d never trusted him anyway.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s back. Ask him, Rory, before he makes a noise or something.\u201d Rory leaned down until his face was inches from Logan\u2019s. \u201cWhere is Ian? I\u2019m going to lower this gag and let you tell me, but if you yell, I\u2019ll shut you up again. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. Rory slipped the cloth gag down over his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cIn the basement. Third door on the left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d Nicky whispered behind him.</p><p>\u201cI guess so. How do I know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he\u2019s sending us straight to the guards\u2019 lounge or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the guards have a lounge, Nicky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean! What if it\u2019s a trap?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re taking him with us. We can use him as a shield if it becomes necessary.\u201d \u201cGood idea. Get him on his feet.\u201d</p><p>Rory pulled him up to stand between them. \u201cIf you make a sound, I\u2019ll break your neck. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded again, saying nothing. The young wolf was the same height as Logan and, though not nearly as muscle-bound as the other wolves, Logan knew he could do it in a heartbeat. Logan\u2019s own heart raced at the thought of releasing Ian, but he wondered if these two had thought of everything. He had to ask. He cleared his throat. \u201cDo you have the keys?\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other blankly. \u201cKeys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards carry all the keys. Look on your belt there. I assume you got that outfit from a guard you...uh...dispatched. There should be a set of keys.\u201d</p><p>Rory twisted and sure enough there was a ring with about a dozen keys, none of them marked. \u201cOne of these must be it . Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. There are security cameras in the halls. Usually there are men in the guardhouse who monitor them. Are they the ones you got these uniforms from?\u201d They glanced at each other before Nicky nodded. \u201cBetter move quickly then. Someone will be relieving them at four.\u201d</p><p>Rory slipped the gag over Logan\u2019s mouth again and pushed him ahead of them, out the door and down the corridor to the stairwell. It must be well after midnight, safe enough in these corridors, with no one out in the middle of the night. Logan quickly led the way into the basement and the third door on the left. Rory went to work, trying one key after another until one of them clicked, and the door swung open.</p><p>They went inside and flicked on the light, closing the door behind them. There, on a kind of straw pallet in the corner, lay Ian naked and without so much as the blanket Logan had ordered for him earlier. They made sure he lived like the animal they thought he was, sleeping naked and bare on straw like a dog. He sat up, blinking against the sudden light, his chains rattling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he mumbled, then his eyes adjusted a bit, and he saw Logan, his hands tied behind him and a gag in his mouth. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He took a closer look at the guards, and a huge grin lit up his face. \u201cMy God, Nicky! Rory! What on earth are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>Nicky and Rory both rushed over to him, pulling Logan along with them. Nicky, ignoring wolf law, hugged Ian, running his hands over his shoulders and arms, checking for injuries. Rory slapped him on the back. They were speaking in hurried, excited whispers.</p><p>\u201cWe came for you, Rory and me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood Lord! Marco and Caseyaren\u2019t with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They wouldn\u2019t have let us come. We\u2019re the only ones who had any chance of sneaking inside the compound. You wolves are much too big. We were extra lucky by findingLogan\u2019s room on the roster thing they had in the guardhouse to speed things up.\u201d</p><p>Logan hated to think how long it would have taken to locate either one of them without that and cringed even before Ian cut his eyes up at him, his face bitter and unsmiling. He looked away quickly as Rory continued the story and fumbled with the keys to find the one to take the collar, chains, and cuffs off Ian.</p><p>\u201cWe got him to tell us where they were holding you and here we are.\u201d</p><p>Ian chuckled, but he had a look of pure disgust on his face as he kicked the chains away from his feet where Rory let them fall.\u201cThat simple, huh? Well, I\u2019m impressed boys, I really am. Now what\u2019s your plan for getting us out of here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just walk out the same way we came in. If anyone stops us, we say we\u2019re taking you for interrogation.\u201d</p><p>Logan made a sound and shook his head. Rory impatiently pulled down the gag. \u201cWon\u2019t work. This is where prisoners are interrogated. Theydon\u2019t take them out of this building. They would know you\u2019re lying.\u201d</p><p>Nicky bit his lip and looked at Rory. \u201cThink he\u2019s telling the truth?\u201d</p><p>Rory shrugged, but Ian said, \u201cThe last time I saw him, his father ordered him whipped. Is his back marked?\u201d</p><p>Logan twisted away when Rory moved to work his shirt up, hurt that Ian wouldn\u2019t believe in him. He ordered Rory to put hands on him too, a sure sign he didn\u2019t consider him his mate anymore. What would it prove if he had been whipped? Only that the general didn\u2019t tolerate backtalk any better than Ian did.If they wanted to see his back, they\u2019d have to fight him for a look.</p><p>\u201cJust another game they played,\u201d Ian said with a snort, motioning Rory to leave him alone.\u201cDon\u2019t believe a word he says. He\u2019s a fucking liar.\u201d</p> <p>Logan knew his expression registered a direct hit before he could stop his reaction, and Nicky shuffled uncomfortably. He turned and looked directly at Logan. \u201cAre you telling us the truth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That\u2019s not the way out. The best way\u2014the only way is to take the tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat tunnel? You never mentioned a damned tunnel before!\u201d Ian\u2019s voice dripped with sarcasm and anger. \u201cYou\u2019re lying again. It\u2019s what you\u2019re good at.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot before.\u201d At Ian\u2019s scoffing noise, Logan insisted. \u201cI did. You know my memory was bad for a long time. I didn\u2019t think of it anyway until just now when I saw it as we came down. The tunnel is old, andwe didn\u2019t use it for fear of cave-ins. It\u2019s part of an old mine and not safe in places, but it\u2019s the only way out. It goes under the compound and comes out beyond the fence. I\u2019m telling the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust where is this tunnel?\u201d Rory asked.</p><p>Logan jerked his head. \u201cAt the end of the hall. The small door marked Danger\u2014Keep Out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s try it, Ian. It might be our best shot.\u201d</p><p>Ian considered for a moment and then nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky pulled Logan\u2019s gag back over his mouth and took his arm to pull him behind him, but Ian growled, \u201cLeave him!\u201d</p><p>Logan closed his eyes against the sound of hatred in Ian\u2019s voice. Nicky said, \u201cNo, Ian. He\u2019s your mate. No matter how angry you are at him, you have a responsibility to him. He has to feed. You\u2019re sentencing him to death\u2014and worse\u2014if you don\u2019t take him with us.\u201d</p><p>Ian hesitated, not looking at Logan and biting the inside of his mouth. \u201cBring him along if you want to, but I want nothing to do with him. Someone else can feed him.\u201d</p><p>Rory and Nicky looked at each other and pulled Logan along with them. They\u2019d both been on the receiving end of a wolf\u2019s rage at one time or another. Logan had only heard the stories but could believe how bad it was when each sympathized with Logan for the first time that night.</p><p>They moved quietly down the hallway to the door Logan had mentioned and opened it with one of the keys after a few minutes of fumbling with the large key-ring. They slipped inside and closed it behind them. It was utterly dark inside. Ian, the beta, took charge.</p><p>\u201cRory and I will shift. We see well in the dark. You can take hold of our fur and follow along.\u201d</p><p>Rory quickly stripped, and Nicky took his clothing. Rory turned to Logan, untied his hands and pulled off the gag. \u201cTake hold of me, Logan, and Nicky can grab onto Ian.\u201d</p><p>Logan heard some sounds beside him in the dark, then a wet muzzle pushed against his hand. He closed his handon the fur at the back of the wolf\u2019s neck and held on tightly. Beside him, he was aware of Nicky doing the same with Ian. From that point on, it was almost too simple. They followed the tunnel for what seemed like a very long time. It was dark and damp, and the air was stale. A couple of times Logan heard the scampering of rats by his feet, but the pathway was pretty clear of rocks and debris. The wolf beside him walked slowly so he could easily follow and catch himself whenever he stumbled. After about twenty minutes, Logan could smell fresh air. In another few minutes, they came out into the crisp, cold air and a bright moonlit night beyond the tunnel.</p><p>Before Rory and Ian shifted back into human form, Logan gaped at the huge black wolf that was Ian. He\u2019d never before seen him in wolf form, and in the moonlight with his Werekin enhanced vision he was fascinated by what he could see, and even more fascinated to see how quickly the two of them shifted back.</p><p>Ian stood quietly, getting his bearings. \u201cThis brought us out on the wrong side of the compound from the highway,\u201d he told Rory.\u201cI\u2019m assuming that\u2019s where you parked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInside the park at a camp area,\u201d Rory told him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to circle around then. Barefoot and naked, I\u2019m going to my wolf.\u201d</p><p>No one seemed to care anymore if Logan was tied. Whywouldn\u2019t he go with them? He still had to have wolf blood to live. Only Nicky hesitated to see if Logan was going to follow. As far as Logan was concerned, he didn\u2019t have any choice.</p><p>Ian transformed. The huge black and,to Logan\u2019s eyes, beautiful wolf silently and swiftly headed north, going down the mountain slope, from the compound, and then straight up the mountain on the other side of a gulley. Rory followed Ian\u2019s wolf trot easily.</p><p>Logan and Nicky soon found themselves struggling to keep up even as weak as Ian had to be.</p><p>They had to stop frequently for them to catch up on the climb up the steep and heavily forested mountainside. At one such stop, Ian turned, transformed to human form, and frowned at Logan. \u201cIf you can\u2019t keep up, you can stay behind. We can\u2019t afford to wait on you.\u201d</p><p>Logan tried his best to stay calm, but he\u2019d almost had enough.He wasn\u2019t any further behind than Nicky. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me. Look out for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ian took a few quick steps back, grabbed his shirtfront, and hauled him up on his toes. \u201cYou being smart with me, boy?\u201d</p><p>Logan held his ground. \u201cYou don\u2019t frighten me. If you got a problem with me, go ahead and bring it!\u201d</p><p>Ian snarled and tightened his grip, pulling back a fist, but Nicky pushed his way between them, shoving Ian away from Logan.\u201cIan, stop! You\u2019ll hurt him in a minute and never forgive yourself. Now stop it!\u201d</p><p>Ian gave Logan one more dark sneer, turned away, and took off up the mountain, transforming back to his wolf as he ran. Rory stayed back with Logan and Nicky. They climbed for another hour and Logan was ready to drop from exhaustion. Nicky seemed to be nearer the end of his resources than Logan. Even with Logan\u2019s training and their enhanced strength, neither of them could keep the pace the wolves set.</p><p>Finally, Ian transformed and called a halt. \u201cWe\u2019re far enough away now to stop for a while and get some rest.\u201d</p><p>He fell down in front of a huge, old oak tree and lay flat on his back, breathing hard. The long days of enforced captivity and the wounds had taken their toll on his body. From what Logan understood, the shifting had helped him heal, but he hadn\u2019t stayed in his wolf form long enough yet with the added exertion of the climb to completely recover.</p><p>\u201cNo fire,\u201d he called out. \u201cWe\u2019re still too close to their camp.\u201d</p><p>The cold night had Nicky and Logan both shivering. Rory sat down near Nicky, and they talked so quietly Logan couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying. He was cold, tired, and heartsick, and all he wanted to do was sleep. He fell down on his side, and tried to rest, but it was too cold. Miserable, he sat up and wrapped his arms around his knees, shivering.</p><p>Rory raised his head and sniffed the air. \u201cCasey\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Nicky gasped and even Ian sat up, paying attention.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Logan asked.</p><p>\u201cWolves can sense their mates. It\u2019s usually a one way communication, but Rory and Caseyare both wolves,\u201d Nicky explained quickly. \u201cRory, is Marco with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know he is, Nicky.\u201d Rory answered.</p><p>Nicky moaned. \u201cWe\u2019re both in for it. How did they get close enough to sense us so soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you put the maps up?\u201d Rory asked.</p><p>Nicky got one of those blank, oh shit looks on his face.</p><p>Rory tried to look disdainful, but Logan could see he was worried too. Nicky moved over to sit down close to Ian. \u201cDon\u2019t let him kill me, Ian.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For the first time in hours, Ian smiled. Jealousy jackknifed through Logan\u2019s body, but when Ian glanced over at him, he looked away.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s notgoing to kill you, Nicky, and don\u2019t try to hide behind me. I\u2019m not coming between you and Marco. You probably won\u2019t sit down for a week once he gets you home, but he won\u2019t really hurt you. He\u2019ll be too glad to see you alive and in one piece.\u201d</p><p>Sounds grew closer at a rapid speed and the small clearing filled with the big bodies of the wolves exploding from the brush. A big silver one shifted right in front of Logan and went straight for Nicky. Marco pulled Nicky into his arms and then plopped down with him in his lap, patting his body over carefully in between soulful kisses.</p> <p>A similar scene went on beside Logan with Casey and Rory. Rory tried to shrug away Casey\u2019s hands, embarrassed to suffer that kind of treatment, but Casey held onto him tightly. When he continued to struggle, he got a hard slap on the rear, and Casey whispered furiously in his ear. Rory stopped struggling and sat very still.</p><p>Things were a little confused for a while, with Marco talking in a low voice to Nicky, and Nicky nodding and saying, yes sir, over and over. Casey alternately shook Rory and kissed him. Logan thought for a moment he would throw him down right there in the clearing and have sex with him, but finally both Casey and Marco put their mates on the ground and went over to Ian, slapping him on the back and talking to him urgently. Logan was so muddled hecouldn\u2019t follow most of what they said. Exhausted and cold, he swayed as he sat beside an embarrassed Rory and a subdued Nicky.</p><p>Marco turned to the three of them and gave them all a stern look. \u201cWe\u2019ll stay here until morning and then go home. I know it\u2019s cold, but we\u2019re too close to the Hunters\u2019 compound for a fire. They\u2019ve discovered Logan and Ian are missing by now and will be searching. We have a lot to say to all three of you, but it can wait until morning.\u201d He turned to Ian. \u201cIan, keep Logan warm until morning, and we\u2019ll do the same for our mates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet him freeze to death for all I care,\u201d Ian said, his face a cold mask.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous, Ian. He\u2019ll die of exposure on a night like this.\u201d Casey said. \u201cIf you won\u2019t keep him warm, he can sleep with me and Rory. Come over here, Logan.\u201d</p> <p>Ian jumped to his feet, a low growl coming from his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t touch him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you do it, before he freezes to death, He\u2019s about to pass out as it is!\u201d</p><p>Ian stalked over to Logan with a snarl and jerked him up roughly by his arms. Logan didn\u2019t resist, allowing Ian to pull him over to the tree and hold him close, Logan\u2019s back to Ian\u2019s chest. Blessed warmth radiated through him, a gift from the wolf\u2019s higher body temperature. Ian felt so good, so right to Logan, he never wanted to move.</p><p>Ian growled softly in his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t think this means I\u2019ve forgiven your betrayal. I haven\u2019t. I never will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Logan said wearily in heartbroken acceptance. Nothing he could say would ever change Ian\u2019s mind. He\u2019d never trust him again.</p><p>Warmed against Ian\u2019s huge, warm body, he sank down quickly into a deep sleep and dreamed of wolves racing through the forest. Sometime later he awoke to a frosty morning. He shrank back against Ian\u2019s warmth and twisted in his arms to face him. Ian, deeply asleep, still shifted to make room for him. Logan put hisface up into Ian\u2019s throat and snuggled close. Unable to resist, hetucked his hand between Ian\u2019s legs near his crotch. Ian moaned softly but came awake with a snarl and flipped Logan to face away from him. Yet he spooned him tightly and pulled Logan\u2019s ass right up into his crotch and hard erection. Logan trembled a little with the cold, and Ian pulled him even tighter, almost tucking him underneath his body to keep him warm. Logan fell asleep again, half crushed, but feeling safer than he\u2019d felt since the horrible night they took him away from Ian.</p> <p>The next morning the wolves held a hurried conference. Their cars were about two miles away through some rough country, and Nicky was ill, or acted like he was, in no shape to make it the remaining distance after the long trek and cold night in the woods. Logan suspected he acted worse than he was to garner some of Marco\u2019s sympathy and put off the punishment he knew was waiting for him at home. Marco put him on his back to carry him.</p><p>Ian glanced at Logan. \u201cWhat about you?Are you going to have to be carried back too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk.\u201d Logan said, showing a little defiance.</p><p>They started out, but soon Logan lagged behind, not because he couldn\u2019t make the walk with the training he\u2019d had.He couldn\u2019t keep up to the superhuman pace even with the boost being Werekin gave him. An irritable Ian marched back and without a word, threw Logan over his shoulder. It was an uncomfortable, bumpy walk to the cars, but Logan dared not complain. After finally reaching the road, Ian dumped Logan at one car and went to the other. When they arrived back at Mountainwood, Ian came to Logan\u2019s side of the car, threw him over his shoulder again, and carried him inside and up to their apartment. Logan closed his eyes in humiliation as everyone stared at them, calling out to welcome Ian, no one seeming to mind in the least that Ian was naked.</p><p>Ian carried him inside and dumped him on the sofa, standing over him, glaring down at him. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower to wash off the Hunters\u2019 stench. Fix me something to eat.\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel and walked off, leaving Logan gaping after him. The shower turned on a minute later. Logan went into the kitchen. It seemed so strange to be back. Just two weeks after leaving, he already felt like a stranger. Most of the fresh food they\u2019d gotten because Ian knew he was more comfortable eating in the apartment than the common room was ruined, but rummaging through the pantry, he found some canned gravy. He put that in a pan and took out frozen biscuits from the freezer. Ian liked gravy and biscuits for breakfast. He put a pot of coffee on to brew and returned to the sofa to wait. Ian had made it clear he didn\u2019t want him anymore, so he didn\u2019t know where he would go. Maybe the alpha would tell him. He lay down on the sofa and closed his eyes for just a minute, pulling a blanket over him.</p><p>He woke up to see Ian sitting across from him, cleaned up, wearing jeans and a blue sweater, drinking a mug of coffee. Apparently Logan had been asleep a good while\u2014from the looks of the table, Ian had finished his breakfast. He must be on his second cup of coffee. Logan rubbed his eyes and tried to wake up. He blinked at Ian, wondering what he was thinking, afraid to ask. He looked big, handsome, and totally worn out.</p><p>Logan cleared his throat. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe go see Marco and the others. They\u2019re waiting for us. I was just trying to wake up a bit.\u201d He put down his cup and headed for the door. \u201cC\u2019mon,\u201d he called over his shoulder. \u201cWhile I\u2019m still on my feet.\u201d</p><p>Logan hurried along behind him to the council room, missing Ian holding his hand as he used to do. Nicky and Rory sat on one side of the table, facing Casey and Marco. Ian took his place beside them, and Logan sat beside Nicky.</p><p>Marco looked at the three younger men grimly. His voice was soft, but held a hint of anger. \u201cYou know why you\u2019re here. Two of you disobeyed the wishes of your alpha. Nicky and Rory, you deliberately sneaked out of the compound, stole a car, and put yourselves in extreme danger, knowingly going against my direct orders to stay out of the situation. Do you have anything to say before I pass judgment?\u201d</p><p>Nicky spoke up. \u201cMarco, be reasonable. You and Casey were planning a raid, and many of our pack would have been killed. Casey and I were able to go inside the compound, because we\u2019re not so giant-sized. They didn\u2019t suspect us. Nothing went wrong. We were able to get rid of the guards\u2014well, Rory did that\u2014and the rest was a piece of cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust whose idea was this harebrained scheme, or do I even have to ask?\u201d</p><p>Rory hid a smile by looking down. Nicky sat up straighter. \u201cIt was my idea, and it worked!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you decided to ignore the fact that when you told me you wanted to help, I told you it was out of the question? Youdeliberately disobeyed?\u201d</p><p>Nicky opened his mouth to argue, but Rory clapped a hand over it. \u201cYes Marco, we admit it. We\u2019re sorry we worried you and Casey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried me?\u201d Casey yelled. \u201cI damn near went out of my mind!\u201d</p><p>Nicky threw off Rory\u2019s hand. \u201cWell, what are you going to do? Throw us in the slammer? Put us in chains?You\u2019re ignoringthe fact we saved them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, the end doesn\u2019t justify the means. It\u2019s wonderful you were lucky, but it could have had a very different ending. I can\u2019t ignore this behavior. I\u2019m sentencing you both to a month of chores. Chopping wood, washing dishes, cleaning up, whatever there is to do, you\u2019ll do it. Ian will set you both up on one of the work crews. Once he\u2019s back on his feet, he\u2019ll oversee the punishment.\u201d</p><p>Nicky folded his arms. \u201cAnd if I refuse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky,\u201d Marco said warningly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not doing it . Put me in jail instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do as you\u2019re damn well told!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI damn well won\u2019t!\u201d Nicky yelled back, jumping to his feet. \u201cI have a right to serve my month in jail. I demand you send me there right now.\u201d</p><p>Marco growled, his eyes flashed, and he called for the gammas in the hall. \u201cTake him down to the cells in the basement. Lock him in!\u201d</p><p>The gammas looked back and forth at each other. \u201cNicky? You want us to take Nicky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Nicky, dammit!\u201d Marco roared. \u201cTake him out of here!\u201d</p><p>Nicky sauntered to the door between the two without so much as a backward glance. Marco turned to Rory. \u201cWhat about you, Rory? Are you going to take your punishment or pitch a fit like Nicky just did?\u201d</p><p>Rory glanced at Casey and back to Marco. \u201cI\u2019ll take the hard labor, sir.\u201d</p><p>Marco sat for a couple of minutes trying to calm himself. He was breathing so hard and his face was so red, Logan thought he might have a stroke. Nicky, he\u2019d learned, was the only one who could make Marco angry enough to lose control. Marco took a deep breath and turned to Logan. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLogan, your offense was the worst. You deliberately betrayed your mate and tipped off the Hunters we were coming. You almost got Ian and the rest of us killed. What do you have to say for yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lie.\u201d</p><p>The heads of all four wolves at the table snapped toward him. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Marco asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI said, it\u2019s a lie. I never tipped anyone off. I have no idea how they knew. My father didn\u2019t exactly share any confidences with me, but I never tried to get Ian killed. I did everything I could to keep him alive. I told them I had to have his blood to survive. I made them treat his wounds. I tried to get him decent food. I tried to make them stop torturing him. Like I say, I did everything I could.\u201d</p><p>Ian leaned across the table at him. \u201cYou did all of it to protect yourself and keep me alive to feed you. You never once offered me a kind word or gave me any kind of sign, and I watched for one, Logan. You made it plain you hated my guts every time I saw you in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to pretend I hated you. My father was furious. If I had given any sign I cared for you, he would have had you killed immediately.\u201d</p><p>Ian scoffed in disbelief, but Marco and Casey glanced at each other. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t tip them off, who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. I only know it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s lying,\u201d Ian said, giving Logan a cold look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying! Why won\u2019t you believe me?\u201d</p><p>Marco interrupted Ian\u2019s response. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it under advisement, Logan, and let you know what we decide. In the meantime, you can go home with Ian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather stay with Nicky in the jail. I don\u2019t want to be where I\u2019m not wanted.\u201d</p><p>Marco and Ian\u2019s faces both went crimson, and Ian called out angrily for the gammas again. \u201cTake this one too! To the jail cells!\u201d</p><p>A gamma walked toward him, but Logan jumped to his feet and walked with dignity out the door. Only after it closed behind him did he sag in exhaustion and plod wearily down to the basement. Two cells were built there against the wall, side by side. He had stayed in one of them when he first came and had come full circle.</p> <p>Nicky lounged on a bunk in one of the cells as he entered the one next to it. He glanced over at Logan with interest.\u201cGood. At least I\u2019ll have someone to talk to until Marco gets down here.\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled sadly. \u201cYou\u2019re so sure he\u2019ll come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019ll come. That\u2019s one reason he was so angry up there. He knows he can no more stay away from me for a month than he can try to stop breathing. He just can\u2019t do it. He\u2019ll try for a few days, just to save face, but he\u2019ll come. Ian too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Ian hates me.\u201d</p><p>Nicky made a scoffing noise. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you. He\u2019s a wolf! They have the worst tempers on the planet, though they\u2019d never admit it. When they get angry they always say stupid things they regret later. Wolves mate for life. They can\u2019t help it. They have to be with their mates. Mad as he is at you, where did he take you when you got back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo his apartment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI rest my case. Stubborn mules, all of them, especially Marco, and I suspect Ian is just as bad. They like to order us around, bitch and bark and bluster, but when all is said and done, they always cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCave?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCave in...give up...you just have to stick to your guns and don\u2019t let them bully you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not like you and Marco.I\u2019m not Ian\u2019s blood mate, and we\u2019ve only been together a short time. He doesn\u2019t care for me the way Marco cares for you. With what he believes, all I\u2019d be to Ian now is a sex partner.\u201d The way things lookedthere wouldn\u2019t even be sex anymore.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll probably keep you in lock down for a while, but he\u2019s a wolf,\u201d Nicky said again patiently. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same, Logan. Handsome, sexy, brave, and full of themselves! If I know Marco like I think I do, he\u2019ll be down in a little while. He won\u2019t say anything. He\u2019ll just stare at me, trying to make me break. It\u2019ll be the dirtiest look he can muster. You just wait and see. Ian will probably be with him.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. Nicky might be right about Marco, but not Ian. Ian hated him. He fell back on the bunk, wishing he\u2019d stayed behind. To live he\u2019d have to have another wolf feed him, and he didn\u2019t want anyone but Ian. Tossing and turning on his hard bunk, he finally fell asleep out of sheer exhaustion. He woke up about an hour later when a door slammed.</p><p>Both Marco and Ian stood in front of the cells, arms folded across their chests, staring in at Nicky and Logan. Nicky turned his head toward Logan and winked. He sat up on the side of his bunk and stared back into Marco\u2019s eyes. Marco\u2019s eyebrows lowered, and a low growl came from his throat. In response, Nicky unsnapped his leather pants and slipped them down his hips to expose his cock. He lay back on the bunk and slowly stroked himself.</p><p>Marco was livid. \u201cNicky!\u201d he yelled. \u201cCover yourself!\u201d</p><p>Logan was astonished butfascinated by Nicky\u2019s bravado. He laughed out loud and turned to find Ian staring straight at him with a frown on his handsome face. Despite the fact Nicky\u2019s gorgeous cock was on full display, Ian only had eyes for Logan.He\u2019d have some hope in believing Nicky if only Ian\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t so full of hate.</p><p>Following Nicky\u2019s lead, Logan unbuttoned his pants for spite. Ian\u2019s eyebrows shot to his hairline.</p><p>\u201cLogan!\u201d he said warningly.</p><p>Logan pushed down his own pants, freed his cock, lifted his shirt, and looked deep into Ian\u2019s eyes. He began to stroke himself, disobeying Ian\u2019s first order to him, the one about not playing with himself, and he never tookhis eyes away from Ian\u2019s face.</p><p>Both wolves huffed furiously and turned their backs to retreat, banging the door behind them. Nicky\u2019s loud, raucous laughter followed them. \u201cOh, Logan, that was perfect! Did you see their faces?\u201d He fell on his back laughing, holding his sides. Logan couldn\u2019t help laughing along with him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay for that, of course. When they givein and take us home, we\u2019ll have a lot of ass kissing to do to avoid some serious discipline. But God, it was worth it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were right about Ian, too, but for the wrong reason. He wants to see me punished. This is probably going to become my permanent home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, please! He\u2019s so crazy about you he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s coming or going. Everybody knows it. He does too, and he\u2019s mad because he\u2019s so whipped. He wants to hate you, but can\u2019t do it. Drives him crazy. Remember, no matter how much he blusters and tries to hurt your feelings, it means nothing, really. He\u2019s wrapped around your little finger, and he knows it.\u201d</p><p>Logan shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI predict by lunchtime, dinner at the latest, Marco will be back down here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>They pulled their pants back up, and Nicky suggested a card game after h e\u2019d talked one of the guards into giving him a pack. Sitting on the floor next to the bars between them, they played poker for about thirty minutes when the door opened and a couple of gammas came in. They opened their cells and told them to follow.</p><p>Nicky shrugged and winked at Logan. \u201cSo soon?\u201d Logan whispered.</p><p>They both trooped along behind their escorts back up the stairs and were shown into a private meeting room. Marco and Ian sat at a table, both with stern, implacable faces. Marco stood and went to Nicky, standing very close to him. Nicky leaned in toward Marco, as they stood close to each other, as if he couldn\u2019t help himself. Logan knew the feeling, but Ian made no move toward him.</p><p>\u201cNicky, I\u2019m tired of this silly, disobedient behavior. I had planned to let you stay down there for few days longer to teach you a lesson, but your foolish display has forced my hand. I\u2019m revoking your right to stay in jail rather than take the punishment of doing chores. Ian is taking both of you now to put you on a work crew. This matter is finished.\u201d</p><p>Nicky narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms on his chest. He backed away from Marco and met his eyes defiantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not finished for me. You can take me anywhere you want, but Iwon\u2019t lift a hand. I won\u2019t work on any crew you force me on, no matter what you say.\u201d He raised a hand at Marco\u2019s furious look. \u201cYou can beat me if you choose to. I can\u2019t stop you, but I refuse to work. I just won\u2019t do it. I did nothing wrong to warrant this ridiculous, humiliating punishment. Rory and I saved Ian and Logan and brought them home without the pack being endangered in a raid, but instead of praise, we\u2019re receiving punishment. It\u2019s unfair.You\u2019ll have to beat me to death if you choose to take that route.\u201d</p><p>Logan crossed his arms on his chest and stared straight at Ian. \u201cThat goes for me too. I also refuse to work. I did nothing wrong at all, but try to keep myself and Ian alive until we could escape or be rescued. I did not warn the Hunters we were coming, no matter what you say.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he stared at Logan, not unbending an inch.</p><p>\u201cIs that right?\u201d Marco said with a dangerous sounding tone in his voice. \u201cThen you leave me no choice.\u201d He turned his back on the two younger men and walked back to the table. He glanced at Ian, who nodded once. He looked back up at Nicky and squared his shoulders. \u201cIf you refuse to obey the orders of your alpha, you\u2019ll be banished for thirty days. Of course, if you come to your senses in the meantime and choose to apologize and accept your punishment, you\u2019ll be allowed to come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBanished?\u201d Nicky said quietly. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s face was tense. He must know he was playing a dangerous game with Nicky, who was always so unpredictable. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I can\u2019t allow anyone, even my mate\u2014 especially my mate\u2014to challenge my authority. Either you accept your punishment or you will leave. Naturally, before you leave, you\u2019ll be fed, and once during the banishment period, you\u2019ll be allowed to come back long enough for another feeding. We don\u2019t wish to make you ill.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicky looked down for a long moment before he raised his head. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-all right what?You accept your punishment?\u201d Marco\u2019s tone was nervous.</p><p>\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, and I said all right. May I go now?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNicky, this punishment is for your own good. Ian will place you on a work detail. You\u2019ll be with Logan too. The thirty days will pass before you know it.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded. \u201cSure thing. May I go now? Sir?\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded nervously, and Nicky strode to the door, followed by Logan.</p><p>When Nicky got to the door, he turned with an innocent look on his face.\u201cOh and where are we to sleep during this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep? At home, of course!\u201d Marco thundered,</p> <p>\u201cOh, I think not.I\u2019m not sure if I have a home here anymore. I\u2019ll just sleep outside, if it\u2019s all right with you.I\u2019d be a lot more comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped over beside him.\u201cAnd that goes for me too. Either outside or in a cell.\u201d</p><p>Marco and Ian exchanged glances, and Marco turned a furious gaze on the young men. \u201cSuit yourselves.\u201d</p><p>Nicky inclined his head regally and swept out of the room, drawing Logan with him.</p><p>Ian called behind them. \u201cWait outside the rear lodge door. I\u2019ll be out in a moment with your assignments.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded again and took off down the hall, speaking over his shoulder to Logan. \u201cBastard. Marco may think they\u2019re going to give me my assignment, but he\u2019s got another think coming.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot we, Logan. I don\u2019t want to pull you into this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, we\u2019re a team now. I go where you go.\u201d</p><p>Nicky grinned. \u201cOkay. But let\u2019s wait till we get farther away before I tell you. Marco can read my mind at close quarters. It\u2019s a blood match thing. Very annoying.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the apartment area before Nicky turned to him. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving the compound. Marco said we\u2019d be banished. So we\u2019re banished.\u201d</p><p>Logan\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Nicky asked, still enjoying himself.</p><p>\u201cNot scared, no, but Hunters are in the woods, and we won\u2019t last long without wolf blood. They said they\u2019d feed us before we left.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Rory and feed from him. It won\u2019t taste as good, and you won\u2019t enjoy it much, but it will nourish you. I\u2019ll swear Rory to secrecy. Let Marco and Ian worry about us going feral. It will serve them right. I just might plant a little idea in Rory\u2019s head too, in case they manage to break him down. One that will have Marco eating out of my hand.\u201d</p><p>Nicky led Logan to Rory\u2019s quarters, assuring Logan there would be no one there that time of day. Once there, Nicky went into Rory\u2019s closet and found shirts, jeans, and boots that would fit them and coats for both. He included a second set to provide them both with a change, grabbed a few blankets off the shelf as well, and handed some to Logan.</p><p>\u201cNow we need to slip away without being seen by too many people and take off to the woods. We\u2019ll figure out where we\u2019re going once we get safely out of here and find Rory.\u201d</p><p>They accomplished the first task without too much difficulty, but finding Rory was a different story. They went to three different work sites before they saw him on the north side of the compound chopping wood. Luckily, he was off by himself, with only a few other workers around. Nicky called softly to him from the tree line, and he looked up in surprise. Putting down his axe, he went over to him.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two doing out here? I thought Marco was keeping you in jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco decided to get cute and try to force me to obey him. He banished us for thirty days if we refused tojoin a work detail,\u201d Nicky explained.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You must have really made him furious, Nicky. One day you\u2019ll push him too far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, that day may have come. We\u2019re leaving Mountainwood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, stop saying what, Rory. You knowI won\u2019t let Marco force me that way. He needs to learn a lesson once and for all.I\u2019m not his damn little slave or his child. We\u2019re leaving for the full thirty days. If Marco and Ian are worried, oh well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about your feedings? You can\u2019t last thirty days without\u2014oh no, sothat\u2019s why you\u2019re here. I don\u2019t want to get involved in this!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019d rather see us starve? Rory, you have to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, Nicky, feeding two of you will make me so weak I won\u2019t be able to work the rest of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo say you\u2019re sick and go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d Rory rolled up his sleeve and bit down into his wrist. Nicky went first, drinking deeply.</p><p>He finished and looked up at Rory. \u201cDo you need to rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead, Logan.\u201d He held out his arm to Logan.</p><p>Gingerly, he put his mouth on Rory\u2019s wrist and sucked. Nicky was right. It didn\u2019t taste anything like Ian\u2019s. It wasn\u2019t as unpleasant as he thought it would be, but he still had to force himself to keep sucking until Nicky touched his arm.</p><p>\u201cEnough, Logan. That should last us for two weeks. Rory, we\u2019ll need to see you again in a couple of weeks to feed. Will you meet us back here? Same place?\u201d</p><p>Rory, little pale and weak, nodded his head. \u201cOkay, but be careful, Nicky. The Hunters are in the woods.\u201d He glanced over at Logan and shrugged apologetically. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m not a Hunter anymore. I\u2019m Werekin.\u201d</p><p>Rory smiled,and Nicky squeezed Logan\u2019s hand. \u201cRemember, Rory, you haven\u2019t seen us. Don\u2019t give them the comfort of knowing we\u2019ve fed. Oh, and one more thing. We\u2019re thinking of asking the Huntersfor asylum if something can\u2019t be worked out. Then they\u2019ll have to send blood in to us on a regular basis if they want to keep us alive.If Marco and Ian don\u2019t value us anymore and want to banish us, we\u2019ll go to the Hunters for help. They might even have discovered a synthetic blood by now.\u201d</p><p>Rory shook his head. \u201cDamn, Nicky, you\u2019re talking crazy and you can be so cruel to Marco. You know you don\u2019t mean any of that!\u201d</p><p>Nicky blushed. \u201cI might! Okay, of course I won\u2019t. You know I\u2019m crazy about Marco, but he\u2019s so stubborn. He can be pretty cruelhimself, and he has to stop treating me like I\u2019m a disobedient kid. Just look at how Ian has treated poor Logan.You\u2019re welcome to come with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Casey has finally started acting almost normal again. It\u2019s been a rough couple of days for me. You know how he gets. I\u2019ll stay and tough it out\u2014I\u2019m used to working anyway. If I wasn\u2019t doing this, it would be some other chore. No, just be careful. Please. Forget this shit about the Hunters, Nicky. You\u2019ll get yourself and Logan into some serious trouble.\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged and gave Rory a hug.</p><p>\u201cI thought you couldn\u2019t touch another wolf,\u201d Logan said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s related to Marco so it\u2019s allowed between us. Besides, I don\u2019t much care about wolf laws right now.\u201d</p><p>They heard the sounds of some kind of uproar going on already. In the distance they saw people running here and there.Nicky pulled Logan\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cThey know we\u2019re gone. Hurry. We need to get as far away as possible so Marco can\u2019t sense me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowme,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI know a place we can go.\u201d</p><p>Nicky looked surprised, but followed along as Logan led the way, waving a hand to Rory as they left. Logan ran due north of the compound, off the trails, through some pretty dense underbrush. Nicky pulled on a coat to avoid scratching up his bare arms and plowed through the woods behind Logan, already protected with the camo he still wore. After about thirty minutes of making their way through the underbrush, they came to an old trail, mostly grown up, but still clear in some places. Logan followed the trail, again heading north of the compound. They walked for two hours, stopping a couple of times to rest. Logan was out of practice, and Nicky had been mostly sedentary for months. They\u2019d made about four miles, and both were growing a bit weary before Logan heard the sound of the waterfall he searched for. He led Nicky to the falls, and they climbed around to gain access. \u201cTake off your clothes, roll them up and try to keep them dry. We have to go under the falls.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a huge torrent, like many of the falls in the area, more of a steady rain shower effect. Nicky followed Logan\u2019s example, stripping off and rolling the blankets and clothes into a tight ball. They ducked through the falls and into a shallow cave beyond. The mouth of the cave was damp and wet, but further in, toward the back of the cave, it was dry with signs of people having camped there in the past.</p><p>\u201cThis is an old Hunters\u2019 cave,\u201d Logan explained. \u201cHasn\u2019t been used in a while as you can see, not since we moved up closer to the compound,but it\u2019s perfect for our needs. We can have a fire back here, and it just looks like spray or mist outside the cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlenty of handy water, too, but what happens if they come back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a back way out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard Marco mention this place, either. Perfect!\u201d</p><p>They quickly set up their camp, making their pallets and beds and starting a small fire. Nicky looked over at Logan while he worked. \u201cDo you know how to get us some food? We don\u2019t actually have to eat, since the wolf\u2019s blood will keep us nourished for a while, but I still get hungry.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned. \u201cMy Hunter\u2019s skills will come in handy. I can snare rabbits and kill birds with a sling shot I can make. Yeah, I can probably keep us fed pretty well. This stream has fishing further down too, and you can do that. I\u2019ll make you a pole tomorrow. We can tear off the trimming on these blankets to make the strings we\u2019ll need. There\u2019s wild plants that are edible, too, and don\u2019t taste too bad. It\u2019s too late tonight, but I can get started in the morning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGreat! We\u2019re all set then. As long as we can keep away from the Hunters, we should be fine.\u201d He got very quiet for a moment. \u201cMarco knows by now, and he\u2019s upset. Ian too. I hate to cause him worry, but he needs to stop all his domineering bullshit. Casey still bosses Rory around too much, but he takes it. I can\u2019t do it. I guess I\u2019m too independent.\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded. \u201cMe too. I really do love Ian, you know. Though I never thought I\u2019d say that about another man. Seeing him hurt at the Hunters\u2019 headquarters made me realize how I feel about him. I know the bite mademe think I love him, but it\u2019s more than that now. I love him, plain and simple. I wish he realized that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will. Give him a little time, Logan, and I promise he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so. I can\u2019t stand feeling like he hates me.\u201d</p><p>Both young men were quiet, lying back on their pallets and feeding the fire as it grew darker outside, both lost in their thoughts.</p><p>Ian had never been so furious in his life. Not even when he came to the harsh realization Logan\u2019s allegiance lay with the Hunters and he cared nothing for him.If it weren\u2019t for his need for blood, Logan would never have come back with them. Logan choosing to live away from Mountainwood and only coming back for feedings infuriated him, though he did worry if he intended to come back at all.</p><p>Ian watched the interrogation in silence. Rory sat nervously in a chair with both Casey and Marco standing over him. Marco was browbeating the boy as much as Casey would allow. Occasionally, when Marco shouted too much, Casey would lean protectively over Rory and tell Marco to back off.</p><p>For over an hour Rory had doggedly stuck to the story he hadn\u2019t seen Nicky or Logan . At last, his shoulders slumped, and he looked up at Casey, who squeezed his shoulder encouragingly.</p> <p>\u201cIf you know something, sweetheart, tell them. It\u2019ll be for the best, really. It\u2019s dangerous for them to be out there with the Hunters around.\u201d \u201cMaybe Marco should have thought of that before he banished them,\u201d he said, darting a quick glance at Marco.</p><p>Marco growled menacingly, and Casey slapped a hand on his chest to push him away. \u201cBack off, Marco. Let him tell it in his own way.\u201d</p><p>Rory sighed. \u201cOkay. They went to my room and took some of my clothes, a couple of coats and stuff. Some blankets too.\u201d He looked up at Casey. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you I noticed it when we got home. I\u2019m sorry, but Nicky is my best friend. Logan\u2019s a nice guy too, and Ian has been really hard on him.\u201d</p><p>Marco took a deep breath and lowered his voice a little. \u201cI know, Rory, and I appreciate your loyalty to them. I really do. Of course, I was bluffing when I told Nicky he\u2019d be banished. I would never have gone through with it with Hunters in the woods, but I was trying to force him to come around. Ian and I thought...well, no matter. Water under the bridge now. Tell us what you know, please.\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cThey came to me for feeding. I fed them both enough to hold them, I think, for a couple of weeks. They\u2019re supposed to come back and feed again in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere in the hell are they going to stay for two weeks? What will they eat? Hell, they could freeze to death out there at night.\u201d Marco paced, running his fingers through his hair until it stood up around his head. Ian was calmer.</p> <p>\u201cMarco, they have coats and blankets. They\u2019re not going to freeze. Surely Logan knows how to start a fire. That\u2019s not my biggest fear. I\u2019m sorry to say it, but if Logan is as traitorous as I\u2019m sure he is, he might lead Nicky into a trap. They could capture Nicky and use him as a bargaining tool.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cOr bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d Marco sat down hard, his face drained of all color. \u201cOr worse. What if they tortured him? You know that smart mouth of his.God, Ian, he couldn\u2019t stand up to torture.\u201d</p><p>Rory stood up. \u201cWill you stop it?That\u2019s not going to happen, Marco. I don\u2019t believe it. Logan\u2019s not like that, and Ian, you should know that better than anybody. He never resisted us one second, and we wouldn\u2019t have gotten out of there so easy if not for the help he gave us. What\u2019s wrong with you? Logan loves you,and you\u2019re too stubborn to believe him. Get over it!\u201d</p><p>Ian started up out of his chair, and again Casey jumped to protect Rory. The two growled at each other until Marco yelled sharply at them to settle down. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight among ourselves like this. We have to find them!\u201d He turned angrily to Ian. \u201cAnd when we do, you need to step up and take care of your mate. I know what he did hurt you, but we all knew something like that could happen when you agreed to turn him and you have to accept it. You can\u2019t walk away from your responsibilities. I won\u2019t let you, and you\u2019ll hate yourself for it in the end. No matter what, he\u2019s a pet now and your mate. That used to mean something to you.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked up with tears shining in his eyes.\u201cIt still does. He\u2019s tearing me apart, Marco. I never thought I\u2019d ever feel so strongly for someone after Maria, but I swear to God, I can smell him the same as if he were a blood mate. I love him just as much as if he were.I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d He sat down at the table and buried his face in his hands. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. It was my idea to bluff them with banishment, but I never thought it would turn out like this.\u201d</p><p>Marco blew out a long breath and clasped Ian\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ve both been foolish. Too much pride, I guess. We\u2019ll find them. I won\u2019t promise not to spank Nicky\u2019s butt for him, but I have to try to come to terms with him too. He\u2019s everything to me. Unfortunately, he knows it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing you need to know. I think Nicky was bluffing or just fooling around, but you know how he is, Marco.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded grimly.\u201cWhat is it, Rory? Tell us.\u201d</p> <p>Rory looked up and directed his gaze back and forth between the leaders. \u201cHe said\u2014if you two don\u2019t value them anymore, they might just ask for asylum with the Hunters.\u201d</p><p>Ian paled visibly, while Marco dropped his face into his hands. He looked up after a moment. \u201cDamn him! When I get my hands on him again, I swear to God I\u2019ll lock him down for a month. Asylum, my ass!\u201d He was quiet for a moment and then looked at Ian in horror. \u201cYou don\u2019t think they\u2019d actually do it? How do they think they\u2019d feed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all know they take wolf prisoners from time to time\u2014rogues mostly,\u201d Casey said.</p><p>Ian shook his head in confusion. \u201cThey took at least a pint of blood from me. If they do that with all theirprisoners, they could have some banked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said they took it for research, to find a way to make synthetic blood to feed Logan.\u201d</p><p>Rory spoke up. \u201cJust the fact Nicky wouldsay it proves he\u2019s not as happy here as you thought. The word asylum. It implies protection from a hostile society. Is that what he thinks he needs?I don\u2019t completely understand, because I\u2019m not a human, but if I was, I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to stand the way you treat the human pets. The natural born pets are treated much better. Maybe you should think that over very carefully.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked stunned and even Casey frowned down at Rory, saying,\u201cHush, Rory, you\u2019ve said enough.\u201d</p><p>Rory looked contrite, but he held his ground. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Marco, Ian. I know you\u2019re trying to follow the old ways, and I know Nicky scared you last year with what happened to him. He scared all of us. But there are two issues here\u2014the feedings and the domination. The feedings they have to have. We all know that was why Nicky went feral, not because he showed defiance. They\u2019re not supposed to be mindless slaves.They\u2019re men, and you should treat them that way. The way you treat them is demeaning and destroys their self-esteem. Neither of them asked for this, you know. You took everything they were away from them, forcing them to accept being nothing more than a shadow of you, then punished them\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Nicky said something?\u201d</p><p>Rory shook his head. \u201cNo. He loves you, and what you do in the bedroom is one thing. I think he likes being dominated there, just like I do with Casey.\u201d He blushed at the look on Marco\u2019s face. \u201cWell, it\u2019s true, Marco, but Casey treats me with respect the rest of the time. You don\u2019t Nicky, and you don\u2019t Logan, Ian. Casey\u2019s protective, sure, but not fucking crazy like you two can be, like the way you make them dress and wear collars, and stripped them of their body hair.I\u2019m sorry, but if you aren\u2019t careful you could lose them both.\u201d</p><p>Marco looked uncomfortable.\u201cI just try to follow the traditions of our people. I respect Nicky.The collar is a sign he belongs to me.\u201d Marco got to his feet and paced back and forth, deep in thought.</p><p>Ian had a twinge of guilt, comparing how he felt when they snapped the steel collar around his neck. Telling himself it was a completely different circumstance didn\u2019t help much.</p><p>Marco knelt in front of Rory. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t know anymore. I only know I have to find them, Rory. Tell me exactly which direction they took when they left you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey went north. Logan said he knew of a place they could go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know of a place they might be?\u201d Ian asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cDozens,\u201d Marco answered. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to search them all. Casey, you\u2019re in charge until we get back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Two weeks passed almost before they knew it. They had been lucky with the weather \u2014 cold nights, but sunny days, keeping the temperatures bearable. They spent the long days hunting for food, fishing in the streams, or gathering firewood. They cleaned themselves in the icy waters of the fall at night and dried off by the fire.</p><p>Logan had come to admire Nicky\u2019s plucky spirit . He knew he missed Marco terribly, but he never mentioned it and tried to keep Logan\u2019s spirits up as well, not always an easy thing to do. Nicky knew Marco wanted him back, while Logan was sure of the opposite about Ian, no matter how many times Nicky tried to reassure him.Logan knew Ian believed he\u2019d betrayed him and if he took him back, which Logan doubted after the times he\u2019d told him otherwise, it would only be as a responsibility he merely tolerated.Logan couldn\u2019t live the way Ian would treat him, had treated him,and he certainly didn\u2019t want anybody else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Keeping the fire going at night was a full time job, so they usually slept a little late in the mornings. On the morning of the day they were to go meet Rory, they got up earlier than usual and ate some cold,leftover rabbit they\u2019d cooked the night before. Banking the fire, they packed up their gear in case something unforeseen required them to spend the night on the trail and left the small cave, heading south toward Mountainwood. They hadn\u2019t gone far when they heard someone on the trail ahead of them. Darting off into the bushes, they moved as quietly as possible into the deep underbrush to hide. Gradually the voices coming toward them got louder. Two men, both wearing the camo uniforms of the Hunters came into view. Logan recognized one of the men as Dawson, the sadistic bastardwho\u2019d whipped him and Ian. He glanced at Nicky who nodded back at him. Logan held a finger to his lips.</p><p>When the men passed their hiding place and got further down the trail, Logan whispered to him. \u201cThat\u2019s Dawson. He\u2019s a high ranking aide to my father. Why is he out here in the woods? He rarely leaves the compound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s spy on them and see what they\u2019re up to.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky wore a look of mischief that was becoming familiar to Logan, but he grinned and</p><p>nodded. They were just about to step out from their hiding place when they heard someone else coming on the trail and drew back. As they came into view, Logan\u2019s heart beat faster. More Hunters! Three more of them, wearing camo and moving fast down the trail with rifles slung on their backs. Logan gripped Nicky\u2019s arm tightly to keep him still. When he was sure they were out of earshot, he whispered to Nicky.</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s going on. We need to find out why they\u2019re out here.\u201d Nicky stood up and tried to see farther down the trail. \u201cThey could be meeting with them at the stream. You said it was an old Hunters\u2019 site. You think we could sneak up on them and seewhat they\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, the falls make too much noise . Let\u2019s see if they plan on staying at least. I can circle us around and get us close. C\u2019mon.\u201d</p><p>They made a wide circle through the brush, not daring to get near the trail. Finally, they came out downstream, looking up toward the waterfall. The Hunters were there, on the stream bank.</p> <p>Keeping silent, they watched the small group set up a campsite. Nicky followed Logan as he moved further away from the camp. He sat down on a rock near the small trail and regarded Nicky solemnly.</p><p>\u201cNicky, do you trust me?\u201d</p><p>Nicky shrugged. \u201cSure, I guess so. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to ask them for asylum.\u201d</p><p>Nicky stared down at him like he\u2019d lost his mind. \u201cNo! I can\u2019t leave Marco. It would kill him and kill me too. I only said that to hurt him if it got back to him.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked impatient. \u201cI know all that. Look, it wouldn\u2019t be for real. We\u2019ll say that to negotiate a talk. I\u2019ve got to find out how they knew we\u2019d be in the Hunters\u2019 compound that night and,what\u2019s more important, Ian has to know, and he won\u2019t believe me if you don\u2019t hear it too.He\u2019ll never trust me again if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what if we can\u2019t get back out of there? They could force us to go with them. They have a lot of guns with them,and we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking you to trust me to get you out of there. I know I can do this, but if you\u2019re scared...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I\u2019m not scared.\u201d Nicky bristled visibly. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this. What do I say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you were kidnapped and treated badly. We\u2019ll stand at the top of the falls and call down to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they shoot us?\u201d</p><p>Logan snorted. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to shoot us, Nicky. We\u2019re human. They\u2019ll see us as victims they\u2019re rescuing from a fate worse than death.\u201d He hoped.</p><p>Nicky grinned. \u201cMarco as a fate worse than death? I don\u2019t know if I can pull that off with a straight face, but I\u2019ll try.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned back at him. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s do this!\u201d</p> <p>Crawling up the mountain behind the top of the falls, Logan looked back over his shoulder to make sure Nicky was still behind him. Nicky gave him a thumbs up. Logan took a deep breath, stood up, and waved his arms to the men gathered below on the bank. Instantly, the men raised their weapons, but lowered them when Dawson saw who it was.</p><p>Dawson yelled up to him. \u201cCome down, Logan. We\u2019ve been looking for you! We\u2019ll help you!Your father\u2019s been worried sick about you!\u201d</p><p>Logan motioned for Nicky to stand up beside him and looked back down. \u201cI want to talk first,\u201d he yelled back down to him. \u201cWe want asylum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Come down and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst I want your word we can go free if we decide we want to leave. You won\u2019t try to hold us against our will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course! Who is that with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnother one of the humans they kidnapped. Can I trust you, Dawson? Do you give me your word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Logan. I swear!\u201d</p><p>Logan nodded and signaled to Nicky to climb back down. On the way down the side, he spoke to Nicky in a low voice. \u201cI don\u2019t trust him. Like I said, he\u2019s my father\u2019s closest aide, and my father will lie about anything to get what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we going in? They might not let us back out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted him to believe we really want asylum. Just trust me. If I say run, get in the cave. They\u2019ll think they have you trapped and not be in a hurry to go in after you. Straight back, two feet to the right, there\u2019s an overlap in the rock. You can\u2019t see it unless you slide your hand in. Follow it out if I don\u2019t get in with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean if you don\u2019t get in there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean if we get separated and I run the other way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, if you say so. I\u2019m just glad Marco doesn\u2019t know about any of this. He\u2019d have a cow if he could see me now.\u201d</p><p>Ian had been at first surprised, then excited, and finally horrified to see Logan climbing slowly up to the top of the falls. Hunters were right below them\u2014all they had to do was look up.</p><p>Just as Ian was about to break cover to draw their attention away from Logan, Logan stood up and waved his arms, then yelled something down at them. They jumped to their feet and yelled back up. Ian\u2019s blood froze in his veins. He\u2019d actually begun to hope Logan had been telling him the truth, and he hadn\u2019t betrayed him, but there was the proof staring him in the face. Beside him, Marco put a comforting hand on his shoulder.</p><p>Suddenly Marco froze too. Nicky stood up beside Logan, smiling and looking quietly at ease. \u201cOh my God!\u201d Marco said, his voice registering too many emotions to catalog.</p><p>They watched and listened in horror as the two young men had a friendly talk with the Hunters below and then climbed down to them. Almost in shock, they watched as they came down into the camp and shook hands with the leader, who motioned for them to sit beside him at the campfire.</p><p>Unable to watch any longer, Ian fell down on his backside. Marco watched for a few more seconds before falling down beside him.</p><p>\u201cNow what?\u201d Ian asked bitterly.</p><p>Marco got a hard expression on his face. \u201cWe wait until the time is right and move in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>Marco took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m going to get my mate back. Whatever it takes, Nicky\u2019s coming home with me.\u201d</p><p>Ian nodded. \u201cI agree. The same for Logan. Let\u2019s do it.\u201d</p><p>Logan stepped forward to shake Dawson\u2019s hand . \u201cThis is a friend of mine\u2014Nicky uh...\u201d \u201cAnderson,\u201d Nicky supplied. \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou too, Nicky. Well, Logan, your father will be thrilled I\u2019ve found you. I\u2019m sure your</p><p>family will be happy too, son. Please sit down for a minute. We were about to go hunting for some game, but now we need to break camp right away and take you two back home to civilization. We\u2019ll get moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, but we do need a little rest first.\u201d Logan smiled at Dawson. \u201cWhen I spotted you out here, I couldn\u2019t believe it. What are you doing here, Dawson?Don\u2019t you usually stay close to the general?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but since you disappeared, along w ith that wolf, he\u2019s been frantic about you. When we saw you were tied and gagged on the monitor tapes, we feared the worst. We saw some young men dressed as guards taking you down the halls.\u201d He slanted a hard look at Nicky. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in the woods around the wolf compound, hoping for a sighting of you. I hope you weren\u2019t hurt in any way, Logan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo , not at all, this time. They kept me in a basement cell, about all they can do now that I\u2019m Werekin. Nicky was in another one. Together we escaped. We\u2019ve been hiding out in the woods, trying to make our way back down to Brevard so I could contact the general.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad we decided to check out this part of the woods. And you\u2019re sure you haven\u2019t been abused?\u201d \u201cNo, not this time, though they were pretty brutal the first time before that bastard bit me, thinking they\u2019d turn me into their slave. You can see it didn\u2019t work.\u201d He laughed. Something occurred to him that hadn\u2019t before. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why my father didn\u2019t move the facilityafter he learned I\u2019d been captured.He had to know they\u2019d torture me for information. It\u2019s not like him to take a chance I wouldn\u2019t break. I mean I was sure after that long a time, he\u2019d have moved everything out of the compound and fed them a bunch of crap. I figured if I could get out of their compound, I had a chance to escape. I was really surprised when I found the warehouse still packed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, empty crates. That was a stroke of genius on your father\u2019s part. He knew since they didn\u2019t kill you when they took you, they would torture information out of you. We moved everything to the Cummings basecamp.\u201d</p><p>The way a smirk teased the corner of Dawson\u2019s lips, Logan knew Dawson was dying to say since you didn\u2019t get killed when they attacked and didn\u2019t have balls enough to kill yourself,he knew they\u2019d torture it out of you. He set his own features not to take the bait, and swallowed down the disgusting idea his father deliberately left him, certain he\u2019d be tortured and break, to set a trap for the wolves. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dawson continued. \u201cHe set up a continuous guard on the most likely targets, hoping to snare someone in the leadership. He knew the smartest place for them to strike would be our munitions. We backed off on random attacks to watch their compound and radioed ahead as soon as your little group left there. Sure enough, that\u2019s where you took them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it worked great, only the wolves thought I must have tipped you off. The big one you captured along with me didn\u2019t believe me when I denied it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was all your father\u2019s idea. Sacrifices sometimes have to be made for the good of humanity. I\u2019m glad it turned out well in the end.\u201d The smirk went full force. \u201cI hope that didn\u2019t make it even harder on you when they took you again. Well, if you\u2019ve rested, let\u2019s be on our way. Stand up, boys, and let me tie your hands.\u201d He made a hand motion to the men with him.</p> <p>Nicky jumped to his feet in alarm, and Logan stood slowly, putting a hand on Nicky\u2019s arm to calm him even though five men had shifted to encircle them and cover them with their weapons.</p><p>\u201cWhoa there, Dawson. You don\u2019t need to tie us. We surrendered, remember? You granted us asylum.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was beforeI got a good look at your friend here. Did you really think we wouldn\u2019t recognize the alpha\u2019s mate? We\u2019re not going to let him slip through our fingers. Your father is going to be an exceptionally happy man when he sees you and your friend. He\u2019s a brilliant man, and he damn sure read you right.He knew you didn\u2019t have the balls to stand up to torture and would spill your guts. The only thing your father didn\u2019t anticipate was them turning you into a wolf whore. Or did you think he wouldn\u2019t know what it meant when you said they\u2019d turned you to\u2014what is it you called it\u2014Werekin? You must have really twitched that ass of yours around, doing whatever it took to save your life, and getting the beta in the process. Yourfather didn\u2019t buy any of that crap you fed him anymore than I buywhat you\u2019re trying to feed me now. He put a bounty on your head, a nice big fat one. Them taking you off again fouled up his plans for you.\u201d</p><p>Logan went dead inside. \u201cWhat plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think the doctor took all that blood from you and your fuck buddy just for fun, did you?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cNo, he wanted to research what went on with your blood because of the feedings for a while before he killed that fucking wolf. Then he was going to switch you off to another wolf\u2019s blood, to see if you really couldn\u2019t survive on another\u2019s, and if you did, take you off all of it to watch what happened to you. He wanted to see how much difference it made in you too, or did you think we wouldn\u2019t have noticed you\u2019ve put on a good fifteen pounds of muscle and healed in a matter of days after that flogging I gave you?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky gasped, staring at Logan. Logan commented calmly. \u201cThat\u2019s about what I would expect from the psycho son-of-a-bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew he\u2019d do something like that to you?\u201d Nicky exclaimed.</p><p>Logan shrugged slightly. \u201cAs far as he was concerned, I was as bad as a wolf. I tried to ignore or justify the things he was doing, but I knew, Nicky. There wasn\u2019t any reason as far as he was concerned not to do the same things to me. I\u2019m less than human in his eyes now, and God knows being his son meant nothing to him.\u201d He asked Dawson, \u201cHe\u2019s given that honor to you, hasn\u2019t he? You\u2019re the one to take his place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe knew you weren\u2019t strong enough to do what needed to be done. Why do you think you never took part in the interrogations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tortures,\u201d Logan corrected in a mild tone, belying the emotions roiling inside him.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Dawson said with a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I meant. You were a weak excuse for a man before. Now you\u2019re worse than the wolves\u2014both of you. You let those animals fuck you just to save your pitiful lives.\u201d Dawson\u2019s gaze shifted to Nicky. \u201cNow we\u2019ll have two of you to experiment on.The fact that he\u2019s the alpha\u2019s pet will be icing on the cake.\u201d</p> <p>Logan swung his arm up with a punch that caught Dawson right in his mouth, knocking him down on his ass with an almost comical expression of surprise. He yelled over his shoulder to Nicky,\u201cRun!\u201d</p><p>Nicky turned to run, but one of the other men caught him by the arm and held him long enough for a second man to jump him. Nicky pulled back his fist to strike the first, but took a hard blow to the chin, knocking him down. Logan jumped to defend his friend. Three men took him down. When he started up even with the weight of three on him, a hard blow from behind crashed down on his head and put out the lights.</p><p>Logan came back to consciousness slowly, on his back, hands tied in front of him. His head ached and swam with dizziness. He opened his eyes to Nicky beside him, leaning over him. Like Logan, his hands were tied securely in front of him.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Nicky whispered fiercely. \u201cYou scared me to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so. Was I out long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just been a few minutesor so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I\u2019m sorry, Nicky. I told you I could get us out of here and now look.\u201d</p><p>Dawson and one other man stood a few feet from them, holding their rifles on them.</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t know they\u2019d recognize me.\u201d He tipped his head toward Dawson.\u201cAs soon as they hit us, they heard something from those bushes over there. Three of them went out to investigate.\u201d</p><p>Logan sat up, wincing at the pain in his head. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Dawson?\u201d Logan taunted.\u201cDoes every little noise you hear, scare the shit out of you? Getting cowardly in your old age?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fine one to talk about fear. How long did it take you to turn coward and take getting fucked up the ass to save yourself?\u201d</p><p>Logan smiled mockinglyat him. \u201cJealous? God knowsyou\u2019re stupid. Werekin means just what it says, kin to them. It can be from a bite or born into it. Dear old Daddy needs to get that part straight. Being turned to Werekin doesn\u2019t mean having sex, asshole, mating does, and they only mate with permission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d Nicky warned.</p><p>Logan shook his head, telling at Nicky.\u201cI just realized, after the Werekin bite when Ian asked my permission to mate with me, he never once told me I had to agree to save my life.\u201d Logan remembered something else too. When he came to after that first bite, three gorgeous men stood in front of him. His cock ached and his hips wouldn\u2019t hold still, yet all that desire didn\u2019t take direction until he saw Ian. Was it the bite, or was his mind telling him something? Food for thought, but he didn\u2019t have time at the moment.</p><p>\u201cPermission?\u201d Dawson exclaimed. \u201cAre you saying he didn\u2019t even have to rape you? You gave yourself to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, he asked my permission, and it wasn\u2019t until after the mating bite that I had to have blood.\u201d Logan grinned at him. \u201cAnd any wolf\u2019s blood would do. I don\u2019t have to have only his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d Nicky said in warning.</p><p>\u201cThey take care of their people too. Not one of them would leave one of their own to be tortured, just like they came after Ian and me. They share their wealth too. They\u2019ve got mines, you know, sapphires and rubies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLogan,\u201d Nicky exclaimed in horror.</p><p>\u201cNo, keep talking. The general will be real interested in what you\u2019ve learned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Nicky. He won\u2019t repeat anything I say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, and what makes you think a stupid thing like that?\u201d Dawson taunted.</p><p>\u201cBecauseI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Dawson laughed, glancing over at the man with him. Logan didn\u2019t give Dawson any warning, or Nicky either. He launched up and threw himself at both men, slamming his body into Dawson and kicking his feet into the other man. \u201cRun, Nicky,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>Landing in a three-man heap, Logan had a double-handed hold of Dawson\u2019s rifle with his bound hands. When the other man tried to get up, he kicked him in the jaw so hard he snapped his neck. Nicky ran, but not away as Logan meant. He ran to the two struggling men to help.</p><p>\u201cStay away from the front of the muzzle, Nicky!\u201d Logan screamed.</p><p>Nicky jumped over the two, and around, looped his tied arms around Dawson\u2019s neck, choking him and biting him on the ear. Dawson screamed, letting go of the rifle with one hand to grab Nicky by the hair, all Logan needed to wrench the rifle free and throw it clear.</p><p>\u201cGet off him and run,\u201d he yelled at Nicky and jammed his tied hands under Nicky\u2019s wrists and into Dawson\u2019s throat, determined to strangle him. In his mind, Dawson represented everything he hated\u2014his father, the hypocrisy, and the lies.He didn\u2019t let the sound of gunfire and screams in the distance distract him, either. Dawson was going to die.</p><p>Nicky gasped when two huge wolves, one silver, one black, slunk out of the woods.\u201cOh, shit. Don\u2019t move, Logan, don\u2019t move,\u201d Nicky warned.\u201cThey\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Nicky didn\u2019t finish. Dawson squirmed out of Logan\u2019s shocked, lax hold, threw Logan back on his ass and bolted, running hell bent for leather. The wolves were behind him in leaping bounds. Nicky and Logan listened to a vicious, short struggle take place just beyond their line of sight, screams of a man in terror and then a deadly silence. Nicky helped Logan get to his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you tell me to freeze?\u201d Logan asked, trying to work at the knots of rope on Nicky\u2019s wrists with his own still bound hands.</p><p>\u201cSometimes when they\u2019re in their wolf and on the hunt, they can be unpredictable. It\u2019s better to just\u2014oh, shit.\u201d</p><p>The last was barely a whisper when two wolves leaped from the brush twenty feet away, their muzzles covered in blood. Ian and Marco, in a full run, shifted back to naked human glory as they came.</p><p>Despite Nicky\u2019s warning, Logan backed up a few steps, as Ian slowed to a stalking advance, not knowing what to expect. Fight or flight kicked in. He turned and ran, knowing as he did, it was useless. Ian overran him, locked his arms around him, lifted him off his feet, and hugged him fiercely, squeezing the air out of his lungs. Gasping for breath, he was startled when Ian threw him over his shoulder. Logan glanced back to see how Nicky fared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nicky tried for a brief moment to fight Marco. Wrists still tied together, he drew his hands back over his head for a double fisted strike. Marco grabbed his fists, hungNicky\u2019s bound arms over his head and kissed him thoroughly. Nicky sagged against him. Marco spoke urgently in his ear as he bore him to the ground.</p><p>When Nicky saw Marco thundering toward him, he had a sudden flashback to their first weeks together whenMarco\u2019s wolf almost killed him by ripping out his throat. Even though his rational mind told him this was Marco in human form, and he\u2019d never hurt him, he panicked. Instinctively, he raised his bound hands over his shoulder to strike. Marco came to an abrupt halt in front of him, catching both fists in his hands, and locked eyes with him.</p><p>\u201cNicky? Do you want to fight me, baby?\u201d Marco looped his arms over his head, bending to touch his lips gently to Nick y\u2019s. At the first touch, Nicky surrendered, opening his mouth, greedily greetingMarco\u2019s tongue as it swept over the inside of his mouth, searing him with a white hot heat. His own tongue met Marco\u2019s and the old, familiar dance began. Love for this man swept over Nicky, and he sagged in Marco\u2019s arms.</p> <p>Marco pulled his head back and whispered against his lips. \u201cForgive me, baby. I\u2019ve been such a fool about everything.Just don\u2019t leave me. Never leave me again, Nicky.I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>Nicky closed his eyes. Surely he was asleep and dreaming. Marco admitting he was wrong? Had to be a dream.</p><p>\u201cPlease look at me, sweetheart. Rory told me how wrong I was\u2014how unhappy you\u2019ve been. Give me another chance to make it up to you.I swear I\u2019ll try this time.\u201d</p><p>Nicky opened his eyes and looked into Marco\u2019s beautiful dark ones, filled with pain. He opened his mouth to reassure him, but no words came out. For once in his life, he was speechless.</p><p>Marco groaned.\u201cNicky, please. Don\u2019t look at me like that. Things will change, honey. I promise.Will you go home with me and give me a chance to prove it to you?\u201d</p> <p>Nicky licked his lips.\u201cUh\u2014change how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been too protective, too controlling. I even spanked you. I\u2019ll never do it again, Nicky, I swear. You can do whatever you want, wear whatever you want.I won\u2019t boss you around like I did before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now I know I\u2019m dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, baby, I mean it. I was trying to keep you safe and follow the old ways, but I see now I just drove you away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntie me, Marco.\u201d</p><p>Contritely, Marco pulled Nicky\u2019s arms from around his neck and untied Nicky\u2019s wrists, kissing each of them before he released him. He dropped to his knees, pulling Nicky down with him and watched Nicky\u2019s face. \u201cWhat are you thinking, Nicky? Please don\u2019t say you still want to leave me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to leave, Marco. I love you too, but you\u2019re right. Some things need to change.The human pets need better treatment, and you\u2019re the only one who can make those changes.The wolves in your pack aren\u2019t going to like it much. A lot of them are really set in their ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll handle them,\u201d Marco said, setting his jaw.\u201cIf they don\u2019t like it, they can leave. I won\u2019t tolerate a challenge to my authority.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle a little bossiness. It\u2019s a part of who you are. Just treat me as another adult, not your property and an empty-headed puppet. Okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, baby, so long as you talk to me when you get angry and don\u2019t try to take off again. You have to be more careful. The Hunters would kill you, sweetheart, and until we defeat them, you\u2019re not safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, Marco. I\u2019ll be more careful and try not to worry you so much. There is one thing that\u2019s not negotiable though.\u201d</p><p>Marco gave him a sharp look.\u201cOkay, what is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose spankings in the bedroom. You\u2019re not taking those away.\u201d</p><p>Marco threw back his head and laughed. \u201cGod, Nicky, you can always surprise me. Okay, sweetheart, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d He took Nicky in his arms and hauled him over to sit in his naked lap.\u201cI love you, Nicky, since the first minute I saw you.\u201d</p> <p>Nicky settled himself over Marco\u2019s rock hard cock.\u201cThe first time I saw you, I did this.\u201d He leaned over and licked Marco\u2019s chest, making him draw in a quick breath.\u201cAnd a little of this.\u201d He suckedon Marco\u2019s nipple. \u201cBut most of all...\u201d Sliding off his lap, he bent over Marco\u2019s huge, rigid erection.\u201cIwanted to do this.\u201d He licked at the head of Marco\u2019s dripping cock and enveloped the shaft in his mouth, taking it right to the back of his throat. He pulled his tongue back up to the head and swirled a kisson the top. \u201cSo lie back, handsome, and let me show you who\u2019s really boss.\u201d</p><p>Ian carried Logan straight through the falls and into the cave. He stripped his pants down to his knees without a word, pushed him to his back on the floor of the cave, and fell on him. Kissing him and ramming his tongue down his throat, he gagged Logan, backed off when Logan\u2019s throat contracted, but still cut off his air. He let him take a quick breath only to thrust his tongue back, all the while grinding his huge, hardcock against Logan\u2019s instantly rising erection. When Logan almost passed out from lack of oxygen, Ian finally raised his head and looked down into Logan\u2019s stunned eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, damn you! I can\u2019t make it without you! Understand?You\u2019re not going to leave me, Logan.You can\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>Logan tried to speak normally, but it came out a ragged whisper. Ian was so frantic and desperate he scared him a little. \u201cYes, yes, I\u2019m yours. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Growling, Ian leftthe pants bunched around Logan\u2019s knees and folded his legs up to his shoulders, lifting his ass in the air. He swiped precum from Logan\u2019s cock, added his own, and smeared Logan\u2019s hole, ramming inside, not giving Logan time to adjust to the force of his invasion.Logan couldn\u2019t have fought him off if he wanted to. His hands were still tied, held over his head with one of Ian\u2019s hands, and the pants around his knees proved as effective as rope. All Logan could do was wiggle, not to get away but to ease the pressure and spread his lower legs as far as he could to allow Ian\u2019s body closer. Logan wanted Ian inside of him more than anything in the world, but at his choked back cry of pain, Ian froze a moment.</p><p>Ian let Logan settle, his body and voice trembling. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby.\u201d</p><p>He gentled his movements, stroking instead of pounding like a pile driver and reached Logan\u2019s prostate with every stroke. Logan soon purred under him like a kitten.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby. You like that,don\u2019t you?\u201d His large hand enveloped Logan\u2019s cock. \u201cThat\u2019s mine too. All mine. I hope you like it a lot, darlin\u2019, \u2019cause you\u2019ll be getting it every night. Scream my name, baby. Tell me who you love.\u201d He stroked against Logan\u2019s prostate again.\u201cWho, baby? Who do you love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Scream it again!\u201d</p><p>Ian made him scream out again and again until Logan\u2019s throat was raw. Matching the squeezing pulls of his hand to the strokes of his cock, Ian drove Logan out of his mind. On the bridge of climax, Ian\u2019s hand slipped to squeeze the base of Logan\u2019s cock.</p><p>\u201cIan, please.\u201d</p><p>Ian bit his wrist andthrust it into Logan\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cFeed from me, little one. I won\u2019t let you come until I fill you full of my blood. I can\u2019t lose you again.\u201d</p><p>After what seemed like hours of teasing, his cock pulsing like thunder for release, Ian finally pulled his wrist away. He pulled free,ignoring Logan\u2019s cry of dismay, bent down, and whispered in Logan\u2019s ear as he rolled him to his stomach, pulled his ass up, and pushed his knees under him. \u201cTime for the gland again, to remind you who you belong to.\u201d</p><p>Logan moaned, his knees moving in reflex to crawl away, remembering the pain of that knot pushing into him. The next thought was of the incredible orgasms that followed. His first efforts at escape stilled and Ian laughed, using one arm around his hips to pull him back hard, impaling him again on his cock, the knot pressing for entrance. Both arms around Logan\u2019s hips, Ian ground against him, working the knot in. Logan pushed back and out, clenching his hands in fists in the dirt and biting his lip. The knot slipped through, still the size of a baseball, but he\u2019d been broken in enough that it was easier to take it in than it had been the first time. The pressure hit his prostate, and Logan cried out in pure ecstasy. He screamed when Ian bit his neck. No fangs pieced his flesh, but the sensation was the same, intensified pleasure. Logan climaxed, unable to hold back a second longer. He pumped his seed onto the floor of the cave and Ian came, filling him full of his cum, spreading him full of warmth, and triggering another climax. Three or four climaxes later, Logan lost count going in and out, as they continued to rack his body until pure exhaustion put him out for good.</p><p>He woke with his head inIan\u2019s lap. The last coherent memory he had was the huge gland, stretching him until he thought he would rip apart and the incredible pleasure afterward, one climax following another until he thought he\u2019d go mad. He was naked, no surprise, and had a blanket covering him. His hands were still tied, which confused him a little, but he didn\u2019t question. Ian rested his back against the wall of the cave, idly stroking Logan\u2019s cock.</p><p>Logan struggled to sit up, and Ian pushed him back down.</p><p>\u201cLie still. I\u2019m not through with you yet. For the rest of your thirtyday sentence you\u2019ll stay naked and mostly inmy lap when I\u2019m home. If I\u2019m gone, I\u2019ll tie you to the bed. Marco can do what he wants with Nicky, but I\u2019m not going to risk losing you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d he insisted, slurring his words with sleep. \u201cI have to talk to you. I have to tell you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush. Go back to sleep.I don\u2019t want to hear any more out of you. I\u2019m still angry over your running away from me and asking for asylum. Asylum!\u201d His tone was bitter and disgusted. \u201cWhen that son-of-abitch hit you with his gun, I thought I\u2019d lose my mind. I could barely keep it together to get rid of the three we lured away. I don\u2019t want to ever feel like that again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Logan tried to turn his head away, but he was too drowsy. Ian had overfed him, and the blood had a sedating effect, especially after the energy-stealing round with the knot. His eyes closed, and he sank back into sleep. He was exactly where he wanted to be, with Ian, held close to his heart, even with his hands tied. They could talk about the rest later, after Ian had calmed down. Logan had never seen him in such a state.</p><p>He didn\u2019t awake until morning, and Ian must have regained a little of his temper. Logan was still naked, but not tied, and Ian cooked over a fire, no doubt making use of Dawson\u2019s rations. Some time while he slept, Ian had retrieved the clothes he\u2019d shed before changing into his killing wolf.He was dressed, but made sure Logan wasn\u2019t. Remembering Ian saying something about being naked for thirty days, Logan got up and walked with some difficulty to the fire, wondering how he could calm Ian down enough to see reason. His ass was so sore he could barely move without flinching. He padded over to where Ian crouched, heating up some kind of stew. Ian looked up and smiled sweetly at him, the sight of him and the smile cutting right to Logan\u2019s heart.</p><p>\u201cMorning, baby. I love you. I figured I better mention that right away after the way I treated you last night.Do you forgive me?\u201d</p> <p>Logan regarded him with surprise.\u201cYeah,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cI forgive you. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled, but the smile didn\u2019t quite reach the sad look in his eyes even as he teased. \u201cHaving a little trouble walking there?Want Daddy to kiss it and make it better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, very funny. Maybe later.\u201d</p><p>Logan eased himself down onto a blanket by the fire, deciding at the first touch of his ass to the hard rock below he would need to sit on a pillow for a while. He got back up on his knees and looked up to see amusement twitch on Ian\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m glad I can provide you with some humor at my expense.\u201d His tone was sulky, but Ian smiled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, honey. My wolf got a little out of control last night. Okay, a lot out of control.\u201d He leaned over to him and caressed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much, darlin\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve tried to tell you for some time I feel the same. I know I went with Nicky, but I really didn\u2019t know what else to do with you saying you wanted nothing to do with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant it. I wouldn\u2019t have left you in that place, no matter what I said. I was just crazy with thinking you betrayed me and wanted me dead. I never stopped loving you\u2014not for one second.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, you sure fooled me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never meant to chase you away, to make you do something as crazy and dangerous as ask for asylum from those lunatics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t serious. I wanted Dawson to give me information. That\u2019s all. What will you do with the bodies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco and I buried them last night while you and Nicky slept. All that\u2019s over now. I don\u2019t want to discuss it anymore. We\u2019re going home and starting over.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut Ian\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He crossed a finger overLogan\u2019s lips. \u201cNot another word. I\u2019ve been stupid about a lot of things, and I know I have to treat you differently.Obviously, I\u2019m having a little trouble with that. Marco told me last night he and Nicky had a long talk and things are going to change for the pets. Now let me get you some breakfast. I decided last night to stop dwelling on the past. I have you in my arms, and I\u2019ll have you in my bed, and that is not going to change. I hope you can get used to it because, no matter what, I can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am used to it. That\u2019s the way I want that part of it. I\u2019ve been trying to tell you, but I\u2019m a soldier, Ian. I know you think of me as your mate and your possession, but I\u2019m more than that. I have to be more than that.\u201d Something he\u2019d come to realize the two weeks they\u2019d been apart.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ian said quietly.</p><p>\u201cNo, I really don\u2019t think you do. I\u2019ve been military trained for as long as I can remember and started training in combat operations when I was seventeen years old, and I\u2019m pretty damned good at it. If I\u2019m to stay here for the rest of my life, I have to continue working, contributing, being something besides an empty-headed ornament in your apartment. Hell, I like combat. I like training men. I\u2019m damned good with munitions too. Let me use my skills to stop the Hunters. If the idea of me going out in the field upsets you, at least let me train your men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, agreed. That\u2019s settled then.\u201d</p><p>Logan looked at him like he\u2019d lost his mind. Puzzled by the easy agreement, Logan added, \u201cJust like that? No arguments?I don\u2019t want you in danger either. If we agree to this, then I want you to stay out of any more field operations too. I nearly went crazy worrying about what they were doing to you.\u201d</p><p>Ian was quiet for a moment and then sighed. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s fair enough. A good beta should probably stay in the command center anyway. Agreed.\u201d</p> <p>Logan breathed out a sigh of relief. He hadn\u2019t realized how important an issue it was to him until he heard Ian agree. \u201cThis is all sounding too good to be true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is though, Logan. I won\u2019t go back on my word. I can\u2019t promise I won\u2019t be bossy sometimes\u2014I\u2019ll try, but...\u201d</p><p>Logan laughed.\u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t want you to strain yourself, sweetheart. I know who you are.\u201d</p><p>Ian grinned, then turned and scooped some stew into a tin plate. He handed it to Logan. \u201cEat up, honey. Marco will be in here soon. He and Nicky spent the night outside by the campfire. I think Marco made a lot of rash promises last night to Nicky, too, from what he told me. Marco does like to live on the edge.\u201d He laughed, and his eyes showed some easing of the sadness.\u201cNicky certainly makes his life interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Nicky all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he\u2019s all right. Marco would never hurt him. I imagine he got some of the same treatment as you did last night, though. He might be limping a bit himself this morning and not wanting to sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, ha-ha.\u201d</p><p>Ian sat across from Logan and occasionally smoothed a hand over his face or ruffled his hair. \u201cDo you really love me, Logan?\u201d</p><p>Logan looked directly into his eyes. \u201cI really, really love you, you big oaf. I never stopped loving you, not for one second.\u201d</p><p>Ian leaned across and touched his lips to Logan\u2019s. \u201cNever stop telling me you love me. It seems I need to hear it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe same goes for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop looking at me that way, baby, or I\u2019ll have to tap that little sore ass again this morning. Damn, I thought I\u2019d go out of my mind while you two were gone. We were on our way to another site when we stumbled on the Hunters. If we hadn\u2019t done that, we might not have found you in time. We\u2019ve been looking everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been bad. We had fresh water and a fire every day. I showed Nicky how to fish and snare rabbits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own personal commando.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t knock it! I learned in boot camp, very handy skills to have.\u201d</p><p>Ian leaned in for another kiss. \u201cI was worried about you getting enough to eat.\u201d \u201cWe were fine. I know how to defend myself too.\u201d</p><p>\u201dI noticed. If Nicky had been able to defend himself as well, you might have taken the five Hunters when you attacked them. You took two by yourself with your hands tied.\u201d He gave him a tortured smile. \u201cNicky got in your way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot his fault. He\u2019s never been trained to defend himself. He was an artist and a waiter in his former life, for God\u2019s sake. Since he\u2019s the mate of the alpha, and as such, an important target, it\u2019s criminal not to train him in self-defense.\u201d</p><p>Ian looked uncomfortable.\u201cThat\u2019s up to Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to Nicky,\u201d Logan corrected softly.\u201cHe\u2019s a grown man, and he can make the decision for himself.\u201d</p><p>Ian said nothing, but he did slowly nod his head.\u201cI guess you\u2019re right. We just try to protect our mates.Maybe we get a little overprotective at times.\u201d</p><p>Logan grinned.\u201cYou think?\u201d When Ian blushed, he laughed aloud and reached for his hand.\u201cWait till you hear what Dawson told me.\u201d</p><p>A loud voice called from outside before he could even get started. Ian shrugged out of his shirt and threw it to Logan. Big on him, it covered him to mid-thigh when he stood and put it on. Not satisfied with the skimpy clothing, Logan went for his pants, hurrying into them as Ian went to the opening of the cave and motioned for Marco and Nicky to enter.</p><p>Marco walked in, followed by Nicky. He held Nicky\u2019s hand tightly. Nicky smiled at Logan as he came in, his eyes twinkling at the sight of Logan wearing Ian\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cHas Logan had a chance to tell you what the Hunter told them yesterday?\u201d Marco asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he was just getting ready to tell me, actually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sit down, Ian. You need to hear this.\u201d</p><p>Ian sat beside Logan while Marco sat down by the fire and pulled Nicky onto his lap. Nicky launched into the story of meeting the Hunters on the trail.</p><p>When he finished the description of how Elias had used his own son\u2019s life to bait a trap, Ian was at a loss for words, his face pale. \u201cOh God, Logan, and I blamed you, sweetheart! Can you ever forgive me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you.\u201d To show him in a way that spoke stronger than words, Logan scooted up in his lap, cuddling up against him. He knew with this wolf he would never be ashamed of his feelings again. He would never again be embarrassed to show his love.\u201cIt was an honest mistake. I wish you\u2019d trusted me a little more. I understand how hard that is for you, and it means a lot to me that you loved me no matter what you thought.I guess I haven\u2019t made it any easier.\u201d He dug into the pocketof his pants. The note he\u2019d written was still there. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say anything when we were at the compound. They were watching me too closely. I was going to try sneaking this note to you the next day.\u201d</p><p>Ian read it. His eyes watered, and he pressed his lips to Logan\u2019s neck as he hugged him. \u201cThey\u2019d have killed you if they saw this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThey were going to anyway,\u201d Nicky said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more,\u201d Marco said, reluctance showing on every plane of his handsome face. \u201cHe meant to keep the two of you alive, monitoring both blood levels for a time, then killing you andputting Logan on another wolf\u2019s blood to see if he could survive on it\u2014Logan lied to him about needing only yours\u2014monitoring that for a time, and if he survived that, taking Logan off wolf\u2019s blood completely to watch what happened to him.He\u2019s got some screwed up ideas about Werekin too, that Logan never corrected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God, oh my God.\u201d Ian moaned, holding Logan tight, and the note clutched in his hand.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, baby.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLogan wasn\u2019t surprised to hear it,\u201d Nicky put in.</p><p>\u201cI was dead to him the momentI was captured,\u201d Logan told him. \u201cIn his eyes, I\u2019d already failed,and he expected me to break under the torture he was sure you\u2019d use.\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s fingers trailed down Logan\u2019s back. The cuts and scabs had long ago healed and he wasn\u2019t scarred, thanks to being Werekin, but the new healed skin showed in faint marks through the darker, tanned skin on his back. Logan had kept his back turned away from Nicky and didn\u2019t think about what Ian had seen when he undressed him until Ian asked, \u201cThey did whip you?Why did you act like they hadn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Logan answered over Nicky\u2019s gasp. \u201cIt hurt me, Ian, that you believed something so bad and wrong about me. A floggingwouldn\u2019t have made any difference to you then anyway. You\u2019d have believed it was for the reason he said and had nothing to do with me trying to save you. The doctor came in every day to monitor the healing process. Just another one of his experiments.\u201d He gave them a twisted grin, more like a grimace. \u201cNot nearly what my father wouldhave liked to do to me, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him if he ever tries to touch you again. Hell, I might kill him anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Logan snuggled even closer. He was hurt by his father\u2019s actions, but he was not going to let him destroy his happiness. In a murmur, he teased,\u201cMaybe another sympathy fuck would help ease my pain.\u201d</p><p>Only Ian knew what he referred to, blushed a bright red, and burst into laughter. He hugged Logan furiously. \u201cOkay, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s going to become any kind of habit.\u201d He bent, kissing his mouth hungrily. Going to a whisper for Logan\u2019s ears only, he said, \u201cOne of those compromises, maybe. Then you could do something for me. I got pretty turned on with you all tied up.\u201d</p><p>Suspecting Ian enjoyed being fucked more than he\u2019d admit, Logan whispered back, \u201cI can teach you about your prostate.It\u2019s a very interesting little gland.\u201d</p><p>He twisted on Ian\u2019s lap, wrapping his arms around him and deliberately ground his ass in the rapidly growing bulge in Ian\u2019s pants. With a growl, Ian told him, \u201cI\u2019ll show you how interesting it can be.\u201d He spoke to Marco. \u201cAlpha, if you wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>Marco went to his feet, Nicky in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet for lu\u2014\u201d His concentration broke when Nicky bouncedhis hip into Marco\u2019s crotch. \u201cMake that dinner.\u201d</p><p>Nicky gave Logan a self-satisfied little smirk. Logan laughed out loud as both wolves looked from one to the other, trying to decide if the joke was on them.</p> <p>Left alone afterMarco\u2019s hurried exit, Ian turned sober. \u201cI hate what that bastard wanted to do to you.You mustn\u2019t think his sickness reflects on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to, but Idon\u2019t anymore.\u201d His hands worked the fasteners of Ian\u2019s pants. \u201cI love you, Ian, with all my heart and soul, just like I said in that note. I made my choice a long time ago, and I\u2019ll never change my mind.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cI respect fullyrequest permission to speak to the council,\u201d Logan said, knowing even showing up in the council room was stomping all over wolf protocol. Nicky stood by his side in silent support.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Logan , Nicky?\u201d Marco asked.</p><p>\u201cA couple of things, sir,to do with weaknesses in security.\u201d</p><p>Casey practically bolted out of his chair, making Ian tense to a defensive posture, ready</p><p>to interfere if Casey moved to threaten the young men. Casey only retorted, \u201cA pet is going to tell us about security?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just ask you hear me out then judge for yourself.\u201d</p><p>Marco waved Casey down. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trusting the humans in town too much. I know their economy depends on you, and you\u2019ve always had a good relationship with them, but they are human. While most of them are grateful and satisfiedwith the way things are, there\u2019s too much chance of one of them thinking a handful of money beats working for a weekly paycheck. I know the Hunters have information they didn\u2019t get by watching Mountainwood. Most of it is skewed and incomplete, but it\u2019s still info they didn\u2019t get from observation. One example is they knew you had a new mate, Alpha, and his name is Nicky. They even knew what he looked like. The information the workmen you\u2019ve brought in already know and have passed on can\u2019t be helped, but you need to stop letting the humans up here, even to work, until the war with the Hunters is ended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need them. How else are we to complete the work?\u201d one gamma asked while all the others thoughtfully considered what Logan said.</p><p>Logan took a deep breath, bracing himself. \u201cUse the Werekin.\u201d</p><p>As he expected near bedlam broke out. For once, Casey wasn\u2019t yelling the loudest. Rory had never stopped working, but then Rory, as a wolf and mate, was a special case. Marco finally stood and shouted the others into silence.</p><p>\u201cIs that all?\u201d he asked of Logan.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir. The Werekin need to be trained in self-defense at the veryleast...\u201d</p><p>The roar of protest drowned out Logan to such a degree he gave up. Again, it was what he expected. What he didn\u2019t expect was Marco demanding quiet and saying, \u201cYes. I agree.\u201d</p><p>Some were stunned into just staring. Others yelled in outrage, though they quieted quickly when Marco turned his fierce gaze on them. The strongest objections carried one common word, feral.</p><p>Logan leaned down, speaking above the turmoil to tell Marco, \u201cI have a theory on the feral thing.\u201d</p><p>Marco nodded, holding a hand up to him while he waited for the others to calm down enough for him to quiet them and speak. He glanced at Nicky and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ve nearly lost Nicky twice now, not because he isn\u2019t brave enough or even strong enough against any human attacker, but because he doesn\u2019t know how to fight properly. He didn\u2019t even remember to stay away from the front end of a rifle two men fought over until Logan yelled at him. As the dangers to us escalate, even as closely as we guard those we love, someone could be attacked or kidnapped right out from under us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we train them to fight, they\u2019ll go feral for sure,\u201d an older man cried.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Nicky\u2019s had some experience with that, more than anyone here. We all know he defied me, but what turned him feral wasn\u2019t his rebellion. It was going without feeding.\u201d</p><p>Nicky nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Logan has a theory I think all of you will be interested in hearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have a theory?\u201d Ian asked of Logan.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t discussed any of this with you?\u201d Marco asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, he\u2019s just asked me a bunch of questions on our history,\u201d he answered and from his expression Logan guessedhe\u2019d hurt Ian.</p><p>Logan explained quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you in the middle of it. I wanted you to hear it all for the first time the same as everyone else so your reactions would be to what I said, and they couldn\u2019t accuse you of...\u201d</p><p>Ian smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby. Tell them what you think.\u201d</p><p>Logan took another deep breath. \u201cFrom what Ian tells me, you think your heritage comes from the Cherokee Indians.\u201d Nods went around the room. \u201cWhen a written history started, most of the laws were transcribedwithout any explanation as to why.\u201d Again nods went around and several leaned forward to listen.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible the oral legends had been twisted, things left out, others added through interpretation and even personal beliefs. From what I could find in my research, you\u2019re not descendants of the Cherokee, but the Creek Indians. The Creeks were mostly driven out of this area by the Cherokees, but there was a small population here in Western North Carolina, much more savage than the Cherokee.\u201d He paused, knowing he was treading a thin line. \u201cI think your true ancestors came from a branch of the Creek. I think they were the shifters.It\u2019s well known they killed and wounded their enemies, and even raped on their raids, to humiliate and prove their superiority.</p><p>\u201cWithout fully understanding their own natures then, in a blood lust they bit without even thinking ofwhat it would do. They didn\u2019t practice leaving live captives, but if just a Werekin bite saved Nicky, their bites could have saved victims they left for dead. This may be where the stories of monster werewolves came from. These poor victims were turned and without the care and protection of the one who turned them, without the feedings, they went feral and were quickly killed by their own people. Your beliefs about keeping your humanborn Werekin under strict control so theywon\u2019t go feral may have developed from all that. I think there were feral-werewolf creatures, but not as a result of a lack of control and discipline of Werekin in the clans. I think they were victims of these attacks, bitten and abandoned during raids. The same basic thing may have happened in Europe where the Hunters originated, going all the way back to the Viking raids by shifterswho didn\u2019t have any more understanding of what would happen during a raid than the Creek did.\u201d</p><p>A general discussion broke out, most of it angry. Ian, however, beamed at him with pride, making Logan brave enough to blurt out the rest.</p><p>\u201cI think my father is planning to create ferals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d Casey demanded.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d Marco asked in a calmer voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe experiments he\u2019s doing. He said he was trying to develop synthetic wolf blood to feed me. He didn\u2019t give a damn about feeding me at all, so what is he really trying to do? I think he\u2019s trying to develop the blood in the hopes of creating a change, then withdrawing the blood to make feral creatures. He probably heard the stories about Nicky from the human workers. It would have intrigued him. He doesn\u2019t know it takes a combination of the bite, the knot, the sperm, and the blood for a complete transformation. All he knows about is the blood. Think about it. How much support would you get from the local communities if monsters started attacking their people? Not to mention the fact ferals would make quite a fighting force against the wolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Logan,\u201d Casey grumbled. \u201cIf you\u2019re right all he has to do is capture our mates and starve them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr capture a wolf and torture him until he agrees to bite humans to turn them. Then my father can withhold the blood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhich he\u2019ll probably concentrate on doing once he fails to create one synthetically,\u201d Logan said.\u201cI think that\u2019s what Dawson was setting up for when we intercepted him in the woods\u2014a place to hide out near the lodge so they could kidnap pets or lone wolves.That\u2019s why your wolves need to be on high alert, make sure none of you travel alone, and your Werekin need selfdefense training.\u201d He gulped.knowing how the next would be taken. \u201cAnd combat training.\u201d</p><p>Complaints, denials, and refusals filled the room until Marco stood. Nicky walked over to stand beside him. Marco stood and raised a hand for order.\u201cWe all need time to consider what\u2019s been said. We\u2019ll meet again tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Logan. \u201cThank you.\u201d Ian stood, his arms going around Logan. Marco smiled at Logan. \u201cAnd thank you, Ian, for managing to bring this man into our clan\u2014to make him a true Werekin.\u201d</p><p>Ian planted a breathtaking kiss on Logan, one he fully returned. Logan was through being embarrassed by his love for Ian.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mind me kissing you like this in front of everyone anymore, baby?\u201d Ian asked.</p> <p>Logan shook his head.\u201cNo, not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Ian said gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s about damned time.\u201d</p><p>THE END </p> </body></html>"]
