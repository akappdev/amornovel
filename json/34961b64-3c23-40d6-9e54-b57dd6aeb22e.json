Or both.</p><p>Every muscle in her body was whining at her to stop, so she surrendered, collapsing to the mat and rolling onto her back. Eyes closed, she pressed her spine flat to the floor a few times, then starting with her toes and working upward, she consciously relaxed each muscle in turn, focusing on every even breath, in and out, the steady beat of her heart\u2014</p> <p>\u201cYo, Cyn.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s Zen state collapsed. She kept her eyes determinedly closed and snapped out an irritated, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her workout partner cum sadistic trainer Elke laughed. \u201cI wanted to be sure you were still breathing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was relaxing. It\u2019s good for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good for all of us, but it\u2019s nearly midnight.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>Elke gave an unladylike snort. \u201cPretending ignorance won\u2019t get you out of it.\u201d</p><p>Cyn sat up and cast a scowling glance at the vampire who\u2019d become a friend. Surprising, since she and Elke hadn\u2019t exactly started on the best of terms.</p><p>\u201cHey, don\u2019t blame me,\u201d the ice-blond vampire said now. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to be more involved. Be careful what you wish for and all that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be more involved in security issues, things to do with Raphael\u2019s safety. Not every goddamned business meeting. I hate business meetings. I don\u2019t even go to my own. Besides, how do you know what I wanted? I never told anyone but Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Elke rolled her eyes. \u201cRight. Like every single vampire in the compound didn\u2019t know you were pissed about that business at the fund raiser in March.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn grabbed a bottle of water, tipped her head back, and drained half of it, instead of responding. She wasn\u2019t comfortable discussing her personal affairs with anyone, and there was nothing more personal than her relationship with Raphae . . . and especially what had happened between them at the end of March. She\u2019d been furious about his decision to put himself at risk, essentially offering himself as bait to draw in the same man who\u2019d already tried to kill him once. That had been bad enough, but his real offense had been keeping her in the dark precisely because he\u2019d known she\u2019d fight him on it. So rather than talk to her, try to reason with her, and maybe, just maybe, listen to her objections, he\u2019d simply not told her. Until he was shot and she\u2019d figured it out for herself.</p><p>She\u2019d almost left him that night. Had come closer to walking out the door than at any time in their relationship, including the earliest days when she\u2019d still been coming to terms with the fact that she was falling in love with a bossy, fucking vampire lord who was alpha to the extreme. But, in the end, she couldn\u2019t do it. She loved him in a way she\u2019d never loved anyone in her entire life.</p><p>Elke was right, though. She\u2019d insisted Raphael keep her in the loop going forward. She didn\u2019t like to call it an ultimatum, though that\u2019s what it had been. She had told him if he ever lied to her like that again, she\u2019d leave and he\u2019d never find her. Raphael had contacts and money, but then, so did she. Of course, they had a blood bond which would make it easy for him to locate her, at least for a while. But, on the other hand, he was hampered by vampire politics, which would make it difficult for him to come after her overseas.</p><p>But now Raphael was trying to make it up to her by including her in every little thing, and she didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him it was too much. She\u2019d already hurt him enough. Well, that and she didn\u2019t want to sound like an ungrateful bitch who just couldn\u2019t be satisfied.</p><p>Cyn sighed and pushed up off the floor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better shower and change,\u201d she told Elke. \u201cDon\u2019t want Raphael\u2019s business buddies to think he mated a stinky human.\u201d</p><p>Cyn stepped out of the shower, feeling well and thoroughly pummeled. Their shower was big and decadent, its multiple showerheads like a terrific massage rather than a shower. She wrapped herself in a towel, then grabbed another and rubbed it over her wet hair as she walked over and opened the door. Cool air rushed into the steamy room, and she started to turn back, but then smiled at the sight of Raphael sitting in his big chair, reading something on an iPad. He looked all serious and handsome in a brilliant white shirt and perfectly creased charcoal slacks, a dark blue silk tie with a tiny silver design providing a nice touch of color. The matching suit jacket was lying across the bed, as if he\u2019d tossed it there. But Cyn knew that was only for show. Raphael was far too vain to risk marring the perfect cut of his suit. He\u2019d have laid it down just so. She grinned crookedly. He was such a control freak.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t trust that grin,\u201d he commented without looking up.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Pirozzi you shouldn\u2019t trust,\u201d she said, deliberately offhand as she strolled across the room toward him. \u201cThat vampire\u2019s a pig. No, wait. Pigs are too smart. He\u2019s a toad. A big, fat, bloated toad.\u201d She stood directly in front of him and nudged his leg with her bare foot teasingly, waiting for a response.</p><p>Raphael smiled slightly and set down his iPad, still without looking up. And then before she could react, he grabbed her around the waist and tumbled her laughing into his lap.</p><p>\u201cInsulting our guest won\u2019t get you out of the meeting,\u201d he murmured, slipping one long-fingered hand beneath the towel and caressing her naked hip.</p><p>Cyn tightened her lips in irritation, then turned and stuck her tongue out at him.</p><p>He only laughed and said, \u201cNeither will that. I\u2019ve better uses for your tongue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d she murmured, and bracing herself against his shoulders, she rose up and twisted around until she was straddling his lap. She began loosening his tie. \u201cWe\u2019ll be late for your meeting,\u201d she commented, sliding the tie off and tossing it aside.</p><p>Raphael tugged her towel completely away and dropped it to the floor. \u201cThere is no meeting without me,\u201d he growled and cupped both of her breasts in his hands, strumming the nipples with his thumbs. His eyes lifted to meet hers, their black depths flickering with silver starlight.</p><p>Cyn\u2019s breath caught in her throat as a familiar thrill shivered along her nerves. She loved the way he desired her, the heat that still filled his eyes whenever he looked at her. No matter how long they\u2019d been together or how much they argued\u2014and they did argue\u2014he still wanted her. This beautiful, powerful creature who could turn heads just by walking into a room wanted her.</p><p>Her heart swelled as she wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>Raphael gripped her more tightly, one hand on the nape of her neck, the other low on her back, holding her still as he crushed his mouth against hers in a hungry, demanding kiss. His tongue swept between her lips, caressing every inch of her mouth, tangling around her tongue in a battle for dominance that neither one of them cared about winning.</p><p>\u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he whispered against her lips. \u201cRemember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to remember,\u201d she said fervently. \u201cYou\u2019ll always be here to tell me.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again, yanking her closer until his growing arousal was nestled right between her thighs. She rocked forward, eyes closed, pleasuring herself against the rigid bulge of his cock as he switched his kisses to her breasts, taking one nipple between his lips and sucking hard, his tongue tormenting the stiff peak until his teeth closed on it gently, and she hissed in pleasure. She loved it when he did that, when the initial sting of his bite became a jolt of lust that sizzled right down through her belly to spear her pussy. She felt the resulting gush of wet heat and ground herself on his cock where it was straining against the confines of his zipper.</p><p>\u201cOh, dear,\u201d she said breathlessly, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten your pants all wet and sticky.\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s strong fingers dug into her ass. \u201cI have other pants,\u201d he hissed, his breath hot on her neck as he teased her with small bites, never breaking the skin, only tantalizing her with the scrape of his fangs and the soothing touch of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she groaned.</p><p>He lowered his head further, his teeth closing around the fragile arch of her clavicle, barely breaking the skin before pulling away and licking the small taste of her blood.</p><p>\u201cDelicious, my Cyn,\u201d he murmured, and she could feel his smile against the curve of her shoulder.</p><p>She made a wordless noise of frustration, grabbing both sides of his fine shirt and tearing it open, sending buttons flying. She sighed with satisfaction at the sight of his naked chest, running her fingers lovingly over his firm pecs, pushing the shirt over his shoulders and squeezing the thick pads of muscle there, then smoothing her hands down to his waist and scraping her nails over the hard ridges of his abdomen.</p><p>\u201cGorgeous,\u201d she whispered, her fingers already busy unbuckling his belt. She glanced up and found him leaning back and watching her with bemusement. Giving him a quick grin, she carefully unzipped his pants, humming with satisfaction when his beautiful, hard cock sprang into her fingers, bucking as if eager for her touch.</p><p>Cyn stroked up and down\u2014once, twice\u2014loving the glide of hot skin over the hard steel of his erection, the clench of his abdominal muscles as he hardened even further in her grasp.</p><p>\u201cMine,\u201d she said, then rose up onto her knees, just enough that she could slip him between the swollen lips of her sex, into the slick, wet ache between her thighs. She lowered herself slowly, taking him into her body, feeling her sensitive tissues stretch to accommodate his thickness. A sigh of pleasure escaped her lips, and she closed her eyes as she began rocking slowly back and forth.</p><p>Raphael growled abruptly, a deep rumbling sound that had Cyn\u2019s eyes flashing open to see his eyes burning with hunger. His arms came around her and his hands stroked down her back to curl over her hips and grip her tightly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sucked in a breath as his fingers dug in and he buried his cock more deeply inside her. Cyn threw her head back and closed her eyes, savoring the exquisite sensation as he began thrusting up against her, his big hands gripping her hips, holding her close as he asserted his dominance. Leaning forward, she lowered her mouth to his shoulder and bit down hard, satisfaction zinging through her at his hiss of lust. Anticipation shivered over her skin when she felt his moist breath against her neck, when his tongue scraped roughly over her jugular. She groaned at the press of his fangs and wanted to call his name, to demand that he take her now. But her throat couldn\u2019t produce the sounds, her breath panting out of her chest, her lungs squeezed by the pounding of her heart. She cried out, begging for release, trying to move, to flex her hips against his thrusting, anything to relieve the terrible need building to a crest so high it threatened to crush her.</p><p>Raphael watched with hooded eyes as Cyn writhed in his grip, a study in pure sensuality. Her lovely skin was flushed with color, sweat gleaming along the swell of her breasts as they swayed against him, her nipples rosy pearls that rubbed against his chest with every thrust of his cock into her sweet body. Her nails scraped the back of his neck, and he felt the warm brush of her breath against his skin a moment before she bit his shoulder, her blunt human teeth drawing blood. He hissed with pleasure when her lips closed over the wound, when her tongue lapped out and she swallowed, drinking his blood. Fisting his hand in her silky hair, he bared her neck and lowered his mouth to the gentle curve of her jaw, nibbling, teasing, relishing her pleading gasps as he finally brought his mouth to the enticing blue line of her jugular. His tongue rasped along its length, plumping it until it was a juicy swell of blood. Baring his fangs, he sliced easily through the velvet warmth of her skin, puncturing the thin membrane of her vein and releasing the honey sweet flow of her blood. He drew deeply, like a man starved, her blood filling his mouth and sliding down his throat, giving him warmth, granting him life. Cyn\u2019s scream of climax vibrated against his bones as she trembled in his arms, every muscle clenching, holding onto him as if she couldn\u2019t let go, her knees digging into his hips as her hot, wet pussy squeezed his cock like a vise and she shivered in his arms. He gripped her hips more tightly and thrust upward, her sheath pulsing along his length, demanding his climax, urging him to join her, to spend himself inside her.</p><p>With a final flex of his hips, he plunged balls-deep into her heat, his own orgasm racing in an unstoppable wave until it crashed over him, filling her with his release, claiming her once again as his own, now and forever.</p> <p>Cyn collapsed against Raphael and waited for the trembling to stop, for her heartbeat to grow even, for her lungs to draw a full breath. Sex with Raphael was like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. She snuggled her face against his neck, breathing in his familiar scent, loving the way he was smoothing one hand up and down her back, almost as if to comfort her. She kissed the soft skin of his freshly shaved jaw. A couple more hours and his beard would show up again, and she\u2019d love that, too. Who was she kidding? She loved him any way she could get him.</p><p>His arms tightened around her, which was the only warning she got before he stood, taking her with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked lazily.</p><p>\u201cTo the shower we both need.\u201d</p><p>Cyn chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re still wearing clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot for long.\u201d He slid her down his body until her feet hit the ground, placing both hands on her waist until he was certain she was steady on her feet. \u201cStay there,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>Cyn considered making a run for it, just because it would be so much fun when he chased her. But she was feeling too boneless to generate that much energy, so instead she watched in amusement as Raphael stripped out of his clothes in record speed, giving her a sly glance at the ruin of his shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou have plenty of shirts,\u201d she dismissed. \u201cIn fact, you have plenty of exactly that shirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe loss was well worth it,\u201d he all but purred, and Cyn felt a little shiver of excitement tighten her nipples.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d Raphael said, turning her around and giving her ass a smack.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d she protested, even though he\u2019d barely touched her. Their lovemaking became wild sometimes, but he was always exquisitely careful with her. His strength was overwhelming, but he\u2019d never hurt her. Not that way.</p> <p>\u201cShower,\u201d he repeated. \u201cPirozzi is still waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately. You sure he hasn\u2019t given up and gone home?\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cI\u2019m certain I\u2019d have heard if that were the case. Jared is keeping him company for us.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s good mood hiccupped at the mention of his lieutenant\u2019s name. Jared had been behind the plan to use Raphael as bait for the assassin, and she was sure he\u2019d argued for keeping her in the dark about it, too. Duncan would never have done that. She still missed Raphael\u2019s former lieutenant, even though she understood that his leaving had been a good thing for Duncan and Raphael both. Duncan had finally gotten a territory of his own, which was an honor long overdue. Plus he\u2019d met Emma who, it turned out, was the love of his life. And Raphael ... well, Raphael got another ally on the powerful Vampire Council. More, really, since it was Raphael who\u2019d made Duncan a vampire, and the bond between a vampire and his children was nearly unbreakable. One by one, Raphael was seeding the Council with vampires who were either his own children or who\u2019d agreed to ally with him for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Raphael had plans, and Cyn wasn\u2019t sure anyone knew exactly what those plans were. She wanted to ask him about it, but was afraid he wouldn\u2019t tell her. Or, worse, that he\u2019d lie about it. And she couldn\u2019t take it if that happened. So, she didn\u2019t ask, figuring he\u2019d tell her when he thought the time was right. In the meantime, she went to every boring meeting, keeping up her side of the bargain. As Elke had said, Cyn was the one who\u2019d insisted on being in on the decision making.</p><p>\u201cInside,\u201d Raphael said, and she realized that he\u2019d hustled her into the bathroom while she\u2019d been thinking of other things. He opened the shower door and leaned in to turn on the water.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you joining me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, with a small smile.</p> <p>\u201cUh oh,\u201d she joked. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking bad thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said smoothly, stepping into the shower behind her and closing the door. \u201cMy thoughts are very, very good.\u201d</p><p>He lathered up and began washing her body ... slowly, sensuously, his strong hands massaging her back, squeezing her ass. She moaned, arching her into him as his fingers dipped between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cNow who\u2019s thinking bad thoughts,\u201d he whispered against her overheated skin.</p><p>Cyn turned to face him, taking pleasure in his indrawn breath as her breasts brushed against his chest. Reaching behind him, she pumped some shower gel into her hands and began stroking his very fine chest. \u201cMy turn,\u201d she murmured, letting her hands drift down over his flat belly and farther, until she was caressing the hard length of his fully aroused cock. One of the joys of bedding a vampire\u2014their stamina and recovery was phenomenal. She smiled happily.</p><p>\u201cCyn,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She looked up and found his eyes had gone nearly solid silver with lust. Her womb clenched ,and an aching need swelled between her thighs. She licked her lips, and his gaze shifted avidly.</p><p>With a low growl, he lifted her by the waist and pinned her against the tile wall. Looping his hand under her thigh, he wrapped it around his hip, lifting her until his cock was positioned at her entrance. Cyn bucked against him hungrily, wanting him inside her again ... and again after that. It would never be enough. Raphael\u2019s hand came between them, and then he was sliding between the swollen folds of her outer lips, forcing his way through the slick tissues of her sheath, until there was nothing between them but skin.</p><p>He paused for a moment, his fingers clenching along her thigh, his other hand fisted on the tile over her head as he stared down at her. His cock kicked deep inside her, as if demanding he start moving again. Cyn looked into his eyes and smiled, then flexed her hips just slightly.</p><p>Raphael snarled and started fucking her hard and fast, slamming his cock into her, their wet skin slapping noisily in the steamy confines of the shower. Cyn wrapped her arms around his neck and hung on, meeting every thrust with one of her own, threading her fingers through his short hair, digging her nails into his scalp. She cried out as her climax drew closer, as every nerve ending she possessed began quivering in eager anticipation. The inner walls of her sex tightened, caressing Raphael\u2019s thick cock, making him groan as he fought to keep moving in and out.</p><p>Cyn was drowning in sensation, sweat rolling down her body in the steamy shower, hot water pounding them from all sides. Her skin felt too tight, with even the slightest touch of Raphael\u2019s hand sending waves of pleasure straight to her clit, her nipples so hard that every scrape against his chest was a fresh ripple of orgasmic stimulation. Raphael\u2019s eyes were closed, his muscles straining as he fought his own climax, fought against the loss of control. Focusing hard, Cyn flexed her inner muscles around his cock. Raphael\u2019s eyes flashed open, his hot gaze meeting hers.</p><p>\u201cCome with me, lubimaya. Come now.\u201d</p><p>Cyn let go with a groan of relief, letting the climax overtake her. She tipped her head back against the tile wall, her entire body convulsing as desire roared through her veins and shrieked along her nerves, her muscles spasming until she would have fallen if Raphael hadn\u2019t been there to hold her up. He wrapped her legs around his waist, lifting her higher and spreading her thighs, so he could go even deeper. And then with a rush of heat that she felt in her womb, he was coming, his voice a rasp of sound against her ear as he said her name.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>They were late for their meeting, but no one seemed to care. Or at least, no one dared say anything to Raphael. Cyn was certain everyone knew she and Raphael had been humping their brains out. There was only so much one could do to cover up that post-orgasmic glow. But fuck \u2019em. They could find their own perfect lovers. She had hers, and she was going to take full advantage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jared filled them in on what they\u2019d missed so far, a quick and thorough rundown of an incredibly boring session. In a nutshell, Pirozzi wanted to expand his very successful manufacturing operation, and since Raphael was his biggest, and only other, shareholder, he needed the big guy\u2019s approval. Yawn.</p><p>But she managed to appear reasonably alert and interested, managed also to remain, if not friendly, then at least polite to Jared. And not to cheer out loud when the meeting ended.</p><p>Raphael gave her a discreet wink, knowing her too well not to understand what she was thinking. She gave him wide, who-me? eyes that fooled no one, least of all Raphael, then watched as he stood to bid Pirozzi farewell, accepting the other vampire\u2019s slight bow of obeisance. There were some vampires in Raphael\u2019s circle, those closer to him, with whom he\u2019d shake hands in greeting, or even, in Lucas\u2019s case, exchange hugs. But then, that was Lucas. He was a very huggy guy for a vampire. In any event, Pirozzi was not of the inner circle and definitely not a friend. He was simply one of the many vampires who called Raphael master. Raphael ruled his people absolutely, but fairly, and they accorded him both respect and fear. That\u2019s how it worked among vampires.</p> <p>When Pirozzi and his assistant were gone, Raphael took Cyn\u2019s hand and pulled her to her feet, draping a possessive arm over her shoulders as he walked her out of the conference room and down the hall to his office.</p><p>\u201cWork?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAn hour\u2019s worth. You can go downstairs if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ll stay with you. I\u2019ve got some catching up to do, too.\u201d</p><p>Raphael settled behind his desk, while Cyn sat on the couch with her laptop. She still did private investigations, but most of her clients were vampires now, and almost all of her investigations were done remotely. She hadn\u2019t sworn off field work; she liked the adrenaline rush too much. But just as Raphael had promised to keep her in the loop, she\u2019d promised him not to take the kind of crazy risks that had almost gotten her killed. So lately, the only time she\u2019d been in the field was with Raphael, and her on-line research skills were getting better with every job.</p> <p>\u201cWhen is that thing in Chicago?\u201d she asked. She\u2019d received a new e-mail job request, but the time frame was short.</p><p>\u201cThe first week in December,\u201d Raphael said absently, then looked over at her.</p><p>\u201cDecember in Chicago?\u201d she asked unhappily. \u201cWe\u2019re going to freeze our asses off.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cProbably, but the Midwest needs a new lord, and we can\u2019t delay any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have to be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tradition. The presence of the Council lords helps keep violence to a minimum. We will be stopping in South Dakota first, however.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn scowled. \u201cSouth Dakota. That\u2019s kind of like stopping in Fairbanks to warm up before the Arctic.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shot her an amused look. \u201cI need to consult with Lucas, and, against my better judgment, you\u2019ll be meeting Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn?\u201d Cyn grinned happily. \u201cCan Emma and Sarah come, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Cyn just laughed. But the first thing she did was dash an e-mail off to the rest of the Mates Club, giving them the good news. The name wasn\u2019t ideal\u2014too nautical by half\u2014but that\u2019s what Sarah had suggested they call themselves for now, since \u201cspouses\u201d didn\u2019t work and Colin\u2019s participation ruled out anything gender specific. Their first official get-together was supposed to be at the upcoming Chicago Council meeting, and now Cyn was about to get the full scoop on their newest member. She hit send and glanced up to find Raphael studying her suspiciously.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I want to know what you just did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw,\u201d she cooed, getting up and walking over to slide onto his lap. \u201cYou\u2019re a tough guy. You can take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn is with the FBI, you know. She\u2019s very law abiding, according to Lucas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, giving him a comforting pat.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still active. Working in the Minneapolis office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she repeated in the same soothing voice.</p><p>He eyed her narrowly. \u201cCyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d She gave him her best angelic smile.</p><p>He sighed deeply. \u201cI\u2019m going to regret this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be silly. We\u2019re gonna have fun!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>South Dakota</p><p>They flew to South Dakota by private jet\u2014Raphael and Cyn, plus their security. Cyn\u2019s personal team consisted of Elke and Robbie, the former Army Ranger who was her daytime bodyguard and friend. She loved Robbie. He\u2019d gone through hell and back with her, and that was a bond not easily put aside. Raphael\u2019s team was much larger, of course. Not that he couldn\u2019t defend himself, but vampires were very big on appearances, which meant Raphael had to travel with a suitable security cadre.</p><p>Juro was with them, naturally, since he was Raphael\u2019s Security Chief. Cyn got along just fine with Juro. The big Japanese vampire had been the only one of Raphael\u2019s inner circle who\u2019d argued in favor of telling her everything about their plan to bait the assassin last March.</p><p>Jared was with them, too, but he was another matter. Cyn would have liked to ignore him altogether, but as Raphael\u2019s lieutenant, he was constantly around. And she knew the distrust between them troubled Raphael, so she made the effort to be civil.</p><p>There were three SUVs waiting for them when they landed in Rapid City, which was the closest airport able to handle Raphael\u2019s Learjet. Lucas had provided drivers along with the vehicles, but being the hyper-paranoid personalities they all were, Juro immediately replaced Lucas\u2019s people with his own. Not surprisingly, Lucas\u2019s people were prepared for that eventuality, and all piled into a fourth vehicle. The team leader lingered, offering to lead the way back to Lucas\u2019s estate, which Juro accepted. Cyn had done her homework and knew that Lucas lived in the back end of nowhere, so a guide was a good thing. That didn\u2019t mean Juro wouldn\u2019t double-check everything, though.</p><p>Raphael led Cyn over to the middle of their three SUVs, which was kind of predictable if any bad guys had plans to take Raphael out on the road. But then, if any bad guys tried to ambush Raphael\u2019s convoy, they\u2019d be in for a few surprises. And not the happy kind.</p><p>Juro slid behind the wheel, and Cyn hid her grin as he immediately reprogrammed the in-dash Nav system. His fingers flew over the screen\u2019s keyboard in a blur of vampire speed as he replaced whatever data Lucas\u2019s people had already put in there. Trust among friends, Cyn thought to herself. It was touching, really.</p><p>They made good time once they left the city behind. There were very few cars on the road. The only light was from the nearly full moon overhead, the only sound the hum of the tires on the road and the occasional murmur of voices from Jared or Juro in the front seat. Cyn sank back into the comfort of Raphael\u2019s embrace, her eyes closing almost of their own accord. The days leading up to this trip had been unexpectedly busy. Two days ago, she\u2019d had the fortunately rare pleasure of participating in a big meeting with the legal team managing the Leighton Family Trust, a meeting which naturally included her grandparents and her father. Cyn usually proxied her vote to one of the lawyers she trusted when it came to such things, but this particular meeting had required her presence. Seeing her father had been especially stressful, since he was still pissed off about Raphael buying the Karcher property out from under him last year. He was convinced Cyn had something to do with it, and she supposed indirectly she had, since it was her father\u2019s disregard for her that had motivated Raphael to buy it. But the truth was, Karcher or not, she and her father didn\u2019t have much in common. So there had been that charming encounter, and then several other business matters, all of which had to be handled during daylight, and, of course, Raphael continued to claim her nighttime hours, which was not exactly a hardship. But it did mean she\u2019d gotten very little sleep, and as they sped through the black night, she drifted off to the familiar sounds.</p><p>It was a break in the familiarity that woke her. She sat up, abruptly wide awake, every sense on high alert as she tried to figure out what had changed. One of the security SUVs was in the lane next to them, and then sliding past as their SUV sped up and the security vehicle dropped back to trail behind them. She frowned and leaned forward to look out the front window. There had been two SUVs in front of them, one with Lucas\u2019s people and the other with their own. There was now only one, which meant the threat, whatever it was, was coming from the rear.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she asked no one in particular.</p><p>It was Jared who answered her. \u201cTrailing vehicle thinks we have a tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s that in front of us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s our people. Lucas\u2019s team is dropping back to check out the unknown.\u201d</p><p>Cyn turned to stare out the back, but could see nothing, not even headlights. With the bright moon out here, the vampire drivers had all turned off their lights, but what about their uninvited visitor? She strained to see something, her hand automatically creeping to the 9 mm Glock that rode in its usual shoulder holster, touching it like a talisman for good luck. Although she didn\u2019t really believe in luck. She believed in being prepared and kicking ass.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s hand touched her thigh, his fingers squeezing lightly. \u201cThey know their jobs, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>She grimaced unhappily, but scooted back and settled close to him. \u201cI know that,\u201d she muttered. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Cyn scowled, not sure she liked that idea either. But she pretended to relax while listening avidly to the murmured conversations in the front seat and wishing she\u2019d worn her own ear bud.</p><p>Finally, Jared turned around to say, \u201cThey\u2019re gone, my lord. Whoever it was saw us reacting and took off across country. No lights.\u201d</p><p>No lights. That meant ... \u201cVampires?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. The moon is bright tonight, and locals would know the terrain well enough to travel in the dark and conceal themselves successfully.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo our guys lost them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas\u2019s guys, but yes.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Raphael, but he didn\u2019t seem particularly perturbed by any of this. He seemed to sense her doubts, though, because he gave her a small smile, and said, \u201cI trust Lucas absolutely, my Cyn. Whoever this was, Lucas had nothing to do with it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen who did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is something we\u2019ll discuss with Lucas when we arrive.\u201d</p><p>Cyn wasn\u2019t particularly happy with his answer, but she knew it was the best she was going to get. And she had to admit that there was very little else they could do at this point. She slouched down in the seat unhappily. Raphael\u2019s arm came around her, and she supposed he meant it to be comforting. It might have worked, too, if not for the grin he was fighting unsuccessfully. She elbowed him, and he gave up the fight, chuckling softly.</p><p>She sighed, pretty sure she\u2019d never manage to get back to sleep. \u201cI was having a great dream, too,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat were we doing?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled up at him. \u201cWhat makes you think you were in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said it was great. I assumed that meant it included me.\u201d</p><p>She tsked loudly. \u201cWhat an ego you have.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOf course. So, what were we doing in your dream?\u201d</p><p>Cyn regarded him evenly, then rolled her eyes and said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>He laughed and pulled her into a hard embrace, hanging onto her when they hit a pothole so deep the whole SUV tilted to one side.</p> <p>\u201cJesus, did we blow a tire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just Lucas\u2019s idea of a security perimeter.\u201d</p><p>The road continued rough for a short distance, then smoothed out as a white fence appeared seemingly out of nowhere, gleaming in the headlights like a guideline to whatever came next. That turned out to be a big barn, surrounded by white-fenced paddocks in the distance. Cyn leaned across Raphael to see better.</p><p>\u201cHorses?\u201d</p><p>Raphael stroked a hand down her back and nodded. \u201cLucas breeds them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty,\u201d she said as they drew closer. She sat up and looked at Raphael. \u201cDo you ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou forget how old I am, my Cyn. I grew up on a farm before the invention of the combustion engine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t mean you ride, old man. Maybe you drove a buggy or something.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael stroked a finger slowly over her cheek. \u201cYou do enjoy poking at the beast, lubimaya. I believe we\u2019ll continue this conversation later,\u201d he growled, his eyes glittering with power. \u201cWhen we\u2019re alone.\u201d</p><p>Cyn swallowed hard as she met his silvery gaze. Raphael would never hurt her, but she sometimes forgot just how much power he wielded. And he was right, she loved teasing him. But that was partly because he was so powerful. Everyone constantly catered to him, and she felt it was her duty to keep him humble. Well, okay, not humble. Raphael would never be humble, but she teased him as a reminder of his humanity.</p><p>She leaned forward and bit his lower lip, licking away the blood as she slipped her tongue into his mouth and gave him a slow, sensuous kiss.</p><p>\u201cI look forward to it,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s gaze was heated as he gazed back at her. \u201cI love you, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you back, my Raphael.\u201d</p><p>At that moment, the SUV made a final sweeping turn and Lucas\u2019s main house came into view. It was a clearly modern construction, but an effort had been made to include a strong Southwestern flavor in the overall Craftsman style. It was built into the hillside, giving it a low profile, but the roof was high and peaked, with red tile and skylights. The skylights were an unusual touch in a vampire\u2019s home, but maybe Lucas liked to look at the stars and moon, or maybe he just liked the way it looked. The structure shone almost golden against the dark night, all lit up by artistically placed landscape lighting. The front door opened as they arrived at the house, casting an even brighter rectangle of light down the stairs and right onto the spot where their SUV pulled to a stop.</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d Jared said from the front seat, asking, without saying it specifically, if Raphael was ready to disembark.</p><p>\u201cGive the word, Jared,\u201d Raphael said.</p><p>Jared nodded, then muttered a few words into his Bluetooth mic. The doors on the two security SUVs popped open at once, and Raphael\u2019s vampires poured out, forming a security phalanx up the stairs and right to the open doorway. This wasn\u2019t their usual deployment, and it gave lie to Jared\u2019s early assurance that the trailing vehicle had been nothing to worry about. Cyn loosened the safety strap on her Glock just as Jared opened the passenger door next to her. He glanced up, meeting her eyes briefly, then stood back without offering his hand to assist her. Smart vampire. First, Cyn didn\u2019t need help getting out of a fucking truck, and second, she wouldn\u2019t have accepted his hand even if he\u2019d offered it. She knew it was petty, but she\u2019d always been good at holding a grudge, and apparently that hadn\u2019t changed.</p><p>Raphael exited behind her, his arm slipping around her waist. Cyn grinned inwardly at the show of possessiveness. Lucas was not only a friend, he was also madly in love with Kathryn, his newfound FBI lover. But when it came to these guys, possessiveness trumped pretty much everything, even when it wasn\u2019t necessary.</p><p>\u201cRaphael!\u201d Lucas\u2019s pleased shout had Cyn glancing up to see the Lord of the Plains flanked by his own security team and waiting just beyond the front door. Cyn rolled her eyes. They had enough security here to start a small war.</p><p>Ignoring his bodyguards, Lucas stepped out onto the porch with a big grin on his face. She had to admit he was a handsome devil. Not as handsome as Raphael, naturally, but then her own personal vampire lord was unusually beautiful. Still, Lucas was very pretty with his black hair and almost golden eyes. Unfortunately, as far as Cyn could tell from their brief acquaintance, Lucas\u2019s favorite pastime was tweaking Raphael, which was her favorite pastime. She resented the hell out of anyone usurping her rightful role. Why Raphael put up with it, she didn\u2019t know, although she\u2019d gotten the impression at their previous meeting that the two powerful vampires had an almost father-son relationship.</p><p>\u201cLucas.\u201d Raphael\u2019s greeting was much more restrained than Lucas\u2019s, although he did step forward to accept the other vampire\u2019s hug, going so far as to offer an abbreviated embrace in return.</p><p>Releasing Raphael, Lucas turned his laughing gaze on Cyn, arms outstretched, but she gave him a warning glare. She wasn\u2019t a huggy person.</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Raphael growled, adding his own warning.</p><p>\u201cLucas, our guests have barely arrived. Be good.\u201d</p><p>Good luck with that, Cyn thought to herself, then held out her hand to the tall blonde standing a step back and to Lucas\u2019s right. \u201cYou must be Kathryn,\u201d she said.</p><p>The woman grinned. \u201cAnd you\u2019re Cynthia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyn,\u201d she corrected immediately. \u201cI\u2019ve been dying\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lucas cleared his throat loudly and interrupted, saying, \u201cRaphael, this is Kathryn Hunter, the love of my life.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes, but smiled as she reached out to shake Raphael\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor, my lord. Lucas has told me so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd all of it good,\u201d Lucas added.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Raphael said dryly, then turned his attention to Kathryn. \u201cA pleasure, Agent Hunter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, call me Kathryn, please. Let\u2019s not stand on ceremony. Lucas tells me we\u2019re all friends here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell spoken, acushla,\u201d Lucas said, \u201cand absolutely right. I apologize for not coming out to greet you, Sire, but my security people were all hot and bothered about your shadow on the way here. Your people too, from what I\u2019m told. Come inside, let\u2019s be civilized. You, too, Jared. And Juro, you\u2019re looking spectacular, as always.\u201d</p><p>Juro didn\u2019t say anything, only growled deep in his throat.</p><p>Predictably, that made Lucas laugh, as he took Kathryn\u2019s hand and led the way deeper into the house.</p><p>Cyn and Raphael followed, with Jared and Juro in their wake. Cyn looked around curiously, wondering if the interior would hold up to the lovely exterior, and she wasn\u2019t disappointed. Keeping with the Southwestern style, the floors were all tiled, with the rest of the decor following the theme. They passed a huge open room that looked like someone\u2019s man cave, with a giant flat screen and multiple game consoles and other electronics. Cyn recognized the room\u2019s functionality, because they had one just like it back at Raphael\u2019s Malibu estate. It was where the vamps hung out when they weren\u2019t on duty, but weren\u2019t quite free to leave the estate either.</p><p>Lucas led them past that room, turning left down a hallway until they reached a pair of double doors that stood open on another spacious room, this one with an open-beam ceiling and a big stone fireplace with a good-sized fire burning cheerfully. Cyn moved automatically toward the warmth, smiling her greeting at yet another good-looking vampire who waited for them just inside the room, looking very frat boy in his faded denims and black crewneck sweater.</p><p>\u201cYou know my lieutenant, Nicholas, of course,\u201d Lucas was saying, and Cyn nodded, remembering him from the briefing at Raphael\u2019s Grand Junction house after the assassination attempt.</p><p>\u201cNicholas,\u201d Raphael acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cSit,\u201d Lucas said, indicating a pair of overstuffed sofas facing each other across a gorgeous coffee table made of artfully distressed wood.</p><p>Kathryn gave Lucas a quelling look and amended the offer, saying, \u201cPlease. Have a seat.\u201d</p><p>He responded by grabbing her around the waist and giving her a loud smacking kiss on the cheek. \u201cWhat would I do without you, Katie mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we all know the answer to that,\u201d Nick muttered, and Kathryn shared a snicker with him.</p><p>Lucas ignored the exchange, collapsing onto one end of the sofa and slouching down, stretching his long legs out and plopping his booted feet on the heavy coffee table.</p><p>Raphael sat with a bit more care, taking the other end of the sofa and opening his leather jacket as he settled back into the cushions. Cyn eyed him appreciatively. He looked like someone off the cover of a glossy magazine and she wished they were alone, so she could lick him up one side and down the other. His black eyes came up to meet hers, hot with intent. She gave him a lopsided smile, and he winked back at her. A promise for later. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSit over here with me, Cyn,\u201d Kathryn said, drawing her attention as she sat on the facing sofa. \u201cThat way we can listen to what we want and tune out what we don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wound me,\u201d Lucas said, clutching his heart dramatically. \u201cI thought my every word was music to your ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she muttered back. \u201cCome on, Cyn. I have cookies, and coffee, if you want it. If you\u2019d rather\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCoffee would be great,\u201d Cyn assured her. She unzipped her jacket before sitting down, giving her easy access to her weapon. Sure, Lucas was a friend, and yes, Jared and Juro were here to provide security, not to mention Raphael himself being fully capable of defending himself. But Cyn was a control freak, especially when it came to Raphael\u2019s security, and she couldn\u2019t help noticing that there was a telltale bulge beneath Kathryn\u2019s jacket, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pair we are,\u201d Kathryn confided as she poured some coffee. \u201cIn a room full of killers, and we\u2019re worried about protecting them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d Cyn agreed, sucking down the hot caffeine. \u201cBut I can\u2019t seem to stop myself.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn sighed. \u201cSame here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI noticed the horses when we drove in,\u201d Cyn said, wanting to change the subject. She loved Raphael, but she spent most of her waking hours with vampires and welcomed the chance to talk about something else. \u201cRaphael says Lucas breeds them, but do you ride, too?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI rode a lot when I was younger, but I hadn\u2019t done so in years. I\u2019ve been getting back into it since I met Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ride at night?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. \u201cHave to, don\u2019t we? The horses are used to it, though, and the trails are well-marked. Why? Do you ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. My various handlers felt it was something a properly raised young woman should know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHandlers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I call the parade of nannies and private school administrators who were in charge of my education.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour parents were ... gone?\u201d Kathryn asked, her voice hushed and full of sympathetic understanding.</p><p>Cyn nodded. \u201cDefinitely gone, but not the way you think,\u201d she replied, trying to keep the bitterness out of her voice. \u201cMy mother left when I was three, and never looked back, and I don\u2019t think I exchanged a hundred words with my father the first two decades of my life. Poor little rich girl, huh? But at least I don\u2019t fall off when I try to ride a horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go riding then,\u201d Kathryn said, politely leaving behind the subject of Cyn\u2019s childhood. \u201cI\u2019m on duty most of this week. My nights are free, but I\u2019m saving my days off for the big Chicago blow-out this weekend. I\u2019m off tomorrow, though, and it would be nice to ride in the sunshine for a change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, but let me just check something.\u201d</p><p>Cyn pulled out her cell phone and punched Robbie\u2019s speed dial.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night, woman. This better be good.\u201d Robbie and the other daylight guards had arrived a day earlier so they would be set up and ready for Raphael\u2019s arrival. Robbie and the others would be sleeping somewhere nearby, though she didn\u2019t know exactly where everyone was yet.</p><p>\u201cThis is what I get for trying to be nice?\u201d she joked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d he asked cautiously.</p> <p>\u201cGee, am I really that bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was sleeping, Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Do you know how to ride a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou woke me up for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobbie.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cYes, oh wonderful one, I ride, courtesy of the US Army and too much time in the fucking sandbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Wear your spurs tomorrow, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly wait. Is that all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d she heard him grumble as he disconnected the phone.</p><p>\u201cMy daytime bodyguard,\u201d Cyn said to Kathryn\u2019s questioning look.</p><p>\u201cYou have a bodyguard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t let me,\u201d Lucas said, eavesdropping shamelessly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an active FBI agent,\u201d Kathryn said, directing the words at Lucas, her long-suffering tone indicating this was an old argument. She switched her gaze to Cyn. \u201cI can\u2019t have a bodyguard trailing me around, and at night I have Lucas and all of his team. What more do I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have two,\u201d Cyn said with a scowling glance toward Raphael. \u201cA vamp for nighttime\u2014her name\u2019s Elke\u2014and Robbie during the day. And if it was up to Raphael, I\u2019d have a whole team following me everywhere. He thinks I might get into trouble by myself.\u201d</p><p>Across the room Raphael caught her eye with a skeptically raised eyebrow. \u201cMight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so it\u2019s possible there\u2019s been a time or two.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed, and she threw a cookie at him. Of course, he caught it smoothly and tossed it back at her. Stupid vampire.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she continued, with a glare at the love of her life, \u201cI\u2019d love to ride tomorrow, Kathryn, and you\u2019ll like Robbie. He\u2019s a sweetheart under the gruff exterior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a date. We\u2019ll aim for afternoon, since we\u2019ll be up all night. Sunset\u2019s early this time of year, so I\u2019ll meet you out front around two, if that\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I can fill you in on all the inside scoop without big ears listening in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOooh, secret handshake stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the very least,\u201d Cyn agreed, blowing a kiss at Raphael who was shooting evil looks at her.</p><p>\u201cForget them,\u201d Lucas told Raphael, waving a dismissive hand at the conspiring women. \u201cThe worse they\u2019ll do is spend money.\u201d</p><p>Juro snorted wordlessly, as Raphael gave Lucas a pitying look. \u201cYou have a lot to learn, my friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Lucas replied undaunted, \u201cbut let\u2019s talk about Chicago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s talk about enemies first, Lucas,\u201d Jared interjected. \u201cHow many people knew about Raphael\u2019s arrival, and why would anyone bother to put a tail on us?\u201d</p><p>Lucas sobered immediately. \u201cI wish I knew the why of it, but the how isn\u2019t that difficult. With both the Council meeting and the territorial competition being held at the same time in Chicago, it\u2019s obvious Raphael would be coming this way, along with everyone else. And I made no secret of the fact that Klemens\u2019s role in the assassination attempt on Raphael was a big part of what motivated me to take him out. In most eyes, that means the two of us are at least allies. From there, it\u2019s a small step to think that Raphael might stop to meet with me so we could consult on Klemens\u2019s replacement before the big confab. Which is exactly what we\u2019re doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, if they already knew we were coming here,\u201d Jared persisted, \u201cthen, why tail us? What do they gain from that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn opportunity,\u201d Kathryn said from across the room, proving that the two women were paying more attention than Lucas had credited. \u201cMaybe they knew you all were coming, but underestimated how much security you\u2019d have with you. If your group had been smaller, if you\u2019d been traveling in a single vehicle, for example, an RPG could have taken you all out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemind me never to piss you off, acushla,\u201d Lucas joked.</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d she replied in kind.</p><p>\u201cKathryn has a point,\u201d Cyn chimed in, meeting Raphael\u2019s gaze. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said this before. You\u2019re blinded by your own power. You\u2019re so used to being the baddest guys in the fight that you ignore the damage even a weak opponent can do with the right weapon.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not saying whoever followed you had an RPG. I\u2019m just saying they\u2019re available if you have the right connections, and it doesn\u2019t take a genius to fire one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo who hates you, Lucas?\u201d Jared asked.</p><p>\u201cThe list is long and varied,\u201d Juro growled.</p><p>Lucas gave the big vampire a surprised look. \u201cDid my ears deceive me? Was that a joke, Juro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Juro snapped back.</p><p>Lucas laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve always known that beneath that stony exterior you love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you be serious, Lucas?\u201d Kathryn said.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re all assuming they hate me. After all, they followed Raphael. Maybe it\u2019s all tied up with the competition for control of the Midwest. I\u2019ve been open in my support for Aden. If someone put two and two together, they might figure Raphael would throw his support to Aden, too. Maybe someone who wants the territory decided to even the odds before the challenge begins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it didn\u2019t matter whose support the contestants had. I thought this was a survival of the fittest sort of contest,\u201d Cyn said, giving Raphael a questioning look.</p><p>\u201cStrictly speaking, my Cyn, that\u2019s true. But it is not unheard of for one or more of the Council members to ... clear the field, you might say, for a favored candidate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever done that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have not, and I must point out,\u201d he said, turning to Lucas, \u201cthat there is no assurance Aden will win. There are several strong candidates in contention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Aden, my lord. He\u2019s going to be the one left standing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mine,\u201d Lucas said simply. \u201cI didn\u2019t make him, but I took his oath more than a hundred years ago, and he\u2019s never let me down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut can he rule? You know the situation, Lucas. You know what we\u2019re facing. We cannot afford someone who is unable to hold his territory.\u201d</p><p>Every investigative instinct Cyn possessed sat up and quivered. The situation, he\u2019d said. What situation?</p><p>\u201cAden\u2019s been running St. Louis for me for a very long time,\u201d Lucas was saying, in answer to Raphael\u2019s question. \u201cHe was sitting right there on Klemens\u2019s western border, dealing with almost constant incursions, and he never lost a square yard of territory to that bastard. He\u2019s powerful as hell, and he\u2019s smart enough when he isn\u2019t being an ass. He doesn\u2019t have the most outgoing personality in the world, but we share a certain history. There, but for the grace of a mother\u2019s love and all that. In the final analysis, though, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time together over the years, and I trust him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut ...\u201d Raphael said, and his expression said there definitely was a but.</p><p>\u201cBoy\u2019s got a problem with women,\u201d Lucas admitted. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mind fucking \u2019em\u2014\u201d He shot the two women a guilty look, and said, \u201cSorry, ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re both familiar with the word,\u201d Kathryn said dryly. \u201cBut how is it possible that you hung out with someone who doesn\u2019t like women?\u201d</p> <p>Lucas grinned and flashed her a lascivious wink. \u201cI told you, he doesn\u2019t mind bedding them, and there was never a shortage of volunteers for the job. But other than that ... he thinks they\u2019re beneath him, and that that\u2019s where they belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm,\u201d Kathryn said thoughtfully. \u201cSounds like bad mommy syndrome. I guess we should be glad he\u2019s only a vampire instead of a serial killer.\u201d She paused a beat. \u201cOh wait, they\u2019re the same thing.\u201d</p><p>Cyn started laughing, and Kathryn joined in, the two of them high-fiving. They looked over at their respective vampire lovers, wanting to share the joke, and found the two of them staring back blank-faced. Which only made the two women laugh harder.</p><p>\u201cAn FBI agent, Lucas? Really?\u201d Raphael said grimly.</p><p>\u201cOh, right,\u201d Lucas drawled. \u201cBecause yours stays home and bakes cookies all night.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn looked up from wiping tears from her eyes. \u201cHey! I can bake cookies.\u201d</p><p>That only earned her a disbelieving scowl from Raphael, which threatened to set her off again. He shook his head and turned back to Lucas.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Aden now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn St. Louis, but he can be here tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll meet him as favor to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Sire,\u201d Lucas said, leaping gracefully to his feet. \u201cIn the meantime, this house is yours. Kathryn and I will stay at the homestead, and I\u2019ll tell Aden to meet us out there tomorrow. It\u2019s more discreet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s acceptable,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cBut, Lucas,\u201d he added, his voice going cold and deadly, \u201conce that\u2019s done, we\u2019re going to find out who was after us and why. Because, if there\u2019s to be a hunt, I intend to be the hunter, not the hunted.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Cyn waited while Raphael sealed the elevator door behind them, then turned and eyed the well-appointed bedroom.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t Lucas\u2019s and Kathryn\u2019s bedroom, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Raphael replied, dropping his leather jacket on the back of a chair. \u201cThis is a guest room. Would it matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said emphatically. \u201cI don\u2019t like sleeping in someone else\u2019s bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou slept in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack in the day,\u201d she clarified, moving restlessly around the room.</p> <p>He laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust feels like it,\u201d she said absently.</p><p>\u201cShould I be insulted or flattered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your pick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCynthia,\u201d Raphael said. He didn\u2019t use her full name very often. She looked at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She studied him a long moment, then said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation, Raphael? When you were talking to Lucas,\u201d she clarified, when he gave her a puzzled frown. \u201cYou said something about how he understood the situation. Well, I want to understand it, too. What is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d</p><p>Cyn watched him intently, holding her breath as she waited to see what his next words would be. Would he answer her question? Or would he deflect it with casual humor, or even sex?</p><p>He picked up his jacket from the chair and hung it in the closet, then sat down. Her lungs squeezed hard enough to become a physical pain in her chest when he lifted his black-eyed gaze and said, \u201cSit with me, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can stand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>She eyed him doubtfully, her lips flattened against the emotions clogging her throat. But he\u2019d said \u201cplease,\u201d which he rarely did, so she walked over. She intended to sit on the opposite chair, but Raphael had other plans. He snagged her hand and tumbled her onto his lap, holding her there when she would have gotten up.</p><p>\u201cRaphael. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. I\u2019m ensuring that you can\u2019t get away until I finish speaking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it that bad?\u201d she whispered, her chest so tight she could barely draw breath for the words.</p><p>\u201cIt is very serious, and, yes, it is bad, though I suspect not the way you mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust tell me,\u201d she demanded, unable to stand the stress.</p><p>\u201cYou are aware that I\u2019ve been gathering allies lately, beginning with Rajmund, although, of course, my relationship with Lucas is far older.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve had my suspicions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo have others, although no one but a select few understand my true motives. My enemies assume I\u2019m trying to take over all of North America, that I\u2019m setting puppets on the thrones of the other territories so that I may rule through them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that. It\u2019s something else, but I don\u2019t know what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is the most critical of secrets, my Cyn. It cannot be shared with anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, why tell me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I nearly lost you to a secret, and nothing\u2014no secret, no person\u2014is more important to me than you.\u201d</p><p>The tears rolled down her cheeks. Tears of relief that he wasn\u2019t going to lie to her, and of love at the raw emotion in his words. She leaned against his broad chest, resting her head on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he murmured, holding her close. \u201cListen, and tell me what you think.\u201d</p><p>She nodded wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cThe threat is not on this continent, but in Europe. There are many very old vampires there, vampires who were alive long before I was turned, and who\u2019ve survived by being both wily and powerful. They rule territories in Europe, as we do here. But the territories are small and crowded because these old vampires made too many children in years past, when a vampire was judged by such things.</p><p>\u201cThis overpopulation has created a large number of strong and ambitious younger vampires who have nowhere to go. They no longer wish to serve under the yoke of their masters, but there are not enough open territories\u2014or at least not enough with lords who can be handily defeated\u2014and no unsettled lands for them to move into.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey want to come here,\u201d Cyn said, stunned with the realization as she sat up and stared at him.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThey look at North America and see eight vampire lords ruling a vast amount of territory. They assume that makes us weak, that no one vampire is strong enough to rule so much, and they think to replace us with their own number. Not one vampire for a territory, but several. Not eight vampire lords for all of North America, but twenty-five or thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you? What about the others? Do they really think they can take you all on and win?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not privy to their strategy or thoughts, only their ultimate goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what are we going to do about it?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>Raphael smiled and hugged her close. \u201cMy fierce Cyn. Our first order of business is to continue as we have, to ensure the ascension of vampires we can trust, who will fight with us, and who are capable of consolidating and defending their territories should it come to a war. Which is why the selection of Aden is so important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Lucas, and while he may seem like someone who doesn\u2019t take life seriously, the reality is quite different. When it comes to survival, Lucas is deadly serious. He also happens to be an excellent judge of others. He tells me it\u2019s a side effect of his being a people person,\u201d he added, grimacing in such distaste that Cyn had to laugh despite the seriousness of the subject.</p><p>\u201cThe talent probably lies in the opposite direction,\u201d she assured him. \u201cHe\u2019s a con artist, which means he has to understand his victims. It\u2019s the same skill, just applied differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I ever tell you how Lucas and I met?\u201d</p><p>Cyn frowned at what seemed like a non sequitur. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe thought to pick my pocket, or more likely to steal my purse. Either way, his so-called people skills failed him quite spectacularly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you let him live.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cI saw something in him, something I thought I could use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you right?\u201d</p><p>It was Raphael\u2019s turn to laugh. \u201cOh, yes. He was a challenge, but ultimately well worth the effort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. Kathryn seems to like him anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of Kathryn, remember, you cannot share any of this with her. If Lucas chooses to confide in her, that is his choice, but we cannot afford to let our enemies know that we know they\u2019re coming. This is not a topic for your Mates Club.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweet Cyn,\u201d he said, patting her ass affectionately, \u201cI know about everything. You should understand that by now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>The next day found Cyn urging her horse up the final rise to the top of a hill, and thinking ruefully that the pretty little bay mare probably didn\u2019t need her help, or her urging. No doubt the horse was far more familiar with this trail than Cyn was.</p><p>She\u2019d been impressed earlier with Lucas\u2019s stable of horses. For that matter, she\u2019d been impressed with his stable. Cyn had been raised with money and privilege, and most of her friends growing up had been likewise fortunate. When she\u2019d told Kathryn she\u2019d had riding lessons all through her youth, she\u2019d been telling the truth. She\u2019d been taught by the very best instructors at the most exclusive stables that California and, ultimately, Europe, had to offer.</p><p>But even with that background, Lucas\u2019s stables were amongst the finest she\u2019d seen, especially in private hands. Horses weren\u2019t cheap, not to feed, not to stable, and not to care for. But it was obvious that Lucas did all three and spared no expense. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Robbie suddenly surged past her on the right. He was riding a monster of a beast, a chestnut gelding who was at least eighteen hands tall and with fire in his eye. But then, Robbie was a big guy, so nothing smaller would suit. He was also, as it turned out, a damned good rider and seemed to relish the challenge the horse presented. Horse and rider both appeared to be grinning when they raced past her.</p><p>Cyn grinned back. Lucas\u2019s lands were meant for riding, with lots of wide, well-groomed trails that were kept clear of obstacles. She supposed in the deep part of winter, with the snow up to everyone\u2019s ass, the trails were less reliable. But as far as she was concerned, only a masochist would venture out in that kind of weather, anyway. As it was, the afternoon\u2019s early December temperatures were pushing her boundaries of reasonable comfort, though even she had to admit the sun felt good on her face and the air was cold and fresh.</p><p>She leaned forward and patted her mount on the neck. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about those silly boys, sweetheart,\u201d she soothed. \u201cThey\u2019ll stub a toe, and then they\u2019ll be crying like the big babies they are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRaphael know you have such a high opinion of men?\u201d Kathryn asked, coming up behind her at a more sedate pace than Robbie\u2019s headlong dash.</p><p>\u201cOf course, he knows. But then, as he\u2019s always pointing out to me, he\u2019s not a man.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn laughed, as they rode side by side up over the rise and paused on the ridge line. \u201cIt is lovely here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d she asked, looking back over the rolling expanse of snow-dappled hills.</p><p>\u201cExcept for the cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold?\u201d Kathryn scoffed. \u201cHoney, you ain\u2019t seen cold. It\u2019ll be up to our asses in a month.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly what I was thinking. But I thought this was your first winter here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but I\u2019ve visited the Minneapolis office enough times to know. Only for Lucas would I live here. I\u2019m a Southern girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky for me, Raphael hates the cold as much as I do.\u201d Cyn spotted Robbie heading back toward her across the wide, flat top of the ridge. She stood in her stirrups to shout at him, and had just sucked in her breath to do so, when the unmistakable crack of a long range rifle shot shattered the peace of the day, and had both her and Kathryn diving for the ground.</p><p>\u201cCyn!\u201d Robbie roared as he flew across the plateau. He jumped from the saddle before the big horse had even come a full stop, too much of a warrior not to have his rifle in hand as he crouched low and ran to where Cyn was scooting along the snow-covered ground, heading for the protection of a small cluster of good-sized rocks. \u201cGod damn it,\u201d he swore as he grabbed her on the fly and half-carried her the rest of the way. Kathryn was already nearly there, having been closer when the shooting started. Robbie reached out now to snag her jacket and drag her behind the largest of the rocks.</p><p>\u201cI counted two shots,\u201d Cyn said, pulling her Glock from its shoulder holster and wishing she had something with better range.</p><p>\u201cRifle,\u201d Kathryn confirmed. \u201cLong range, probably\u2014\u201d She risked a quick peek and ducked back. \u201c\u2014the next hill over, those trees.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you think, Robbie?\u201d Cyn asked.</p><p>The big Ranger shrugged out of his dark-colored parka, leaving him in nothing but a long-sleeved, off-white thermal Henley. Rolling to one side, he squirmed down into the snow and slipped the barrel of his Remington M24 around the side of the rocks.</p><p>\u201cWant me to put some snow on your head,\u201d Cyn whispered, only half-facetiously.</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Cyn. I can\u2019t take you anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he was shooting at you!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Robbie grunted, his eye and his focus now on whatever he was seeing through the scope of his rifle. Eventually, he pulled the gun back, rolled over and sat up.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re right about where it came from,\u201d he told Kathryn, \u201cbut the shooter\u2019s gone. Probably saw his chance, took the shot, and then ran for it, maybe without even waiting to see what he\u2019d hit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d Cyn said. \u201cFirst we\u2019re tagged from the airport, and now someone\u2019s shooting at us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but why us? You and I can\u2019t influence the damn challenges,\u201d Kathryn said angrily.</p><p>Cyn snorted. \u201cUnless we die,\u201d she said dryly. \u201cWhen a vampire\u2019s mate dies, it\u2019s a devastating blow. Maybe they\u2019re targeting you and me to get to Lucas and Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn blushed hotly, her already cold-pinked cheeks getting even redder. She shot Robbie an embarrassed glance. \u201cUm, Lucas and I aren\u2019t actually mated yet.\u201d</p><p>Robbie gave Cyn a meaningful stare. He clearly thought she was the target because her death would definitely hurt Raphael badly. Maybe even make him skip the Council meeting. She had to admit the evidence seemed to point that way, if Kathryn and Lucas weren\u2019t mated. Sure, Lucas would mourn her death, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt him the way the loss of a mate would. Of course, that assumed the shooter knew they weren\u2019t mated, and besides, there were other reasons for shooting someone. It didn\u2019t have to be related to vampire politics.</p><p>\u201cWho hates you enough to try to kill you?\u201d she asked Kathryn, avoiding the whole mating issue. \u201cAny big FBI busts you\u2019ve been involved in lately?\u201d</p><p>Kathryn frowned. \u201cNot really. I honestly don\u2019t do that much field work, and when I do it\u2019s mostly white collar stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought terrorism was the big issue these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, but even there, my involvement is more in the way of tracing financial transactions, following the paper trails, not hunting down bad guys. Most of the people we arrest wouldn\u2019t even know I was involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo offense, but it sounds pretty boring. You have skills. When this is all over, I think we should talk.\u201d</p><p>Robbie groaned loudly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be so dramatic. You think it\u2019s safe to stick our heads up?\u201d</p><p>He grabbed his jacket and dug into a pocket, pulling out a pair of compact, but extremely powerful military-issue binocs. Propping himself higher, he began a systematic search.</p><p>\u201cYou were a boy scout when you were little, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Cyn teased.</p><p>\u201cBabe, I was never little,\u201d he said, without taking his eyes away from his search.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnow, trees, rocks. Some grass. No bad guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m calling Steve Sipes back at the house to let him know what happened, and that we\u2019re coming in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Steve Sipes?\u201d Kathryn asked.</p><p>\u201cRaphael\u2019s head of daylight security. Lucas must have one, too, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Guy named John Breunig. He\u2019s probably at the homestead, since that\u2019s where Lucas is, but I can give him a call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo that,\u201d Robbie said. \u201cSipes\u2019ll call him, too, but it\u2019ll be good if he hears from you directly first.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn nodded and punched a speed dial number on her phone, while Robbie did the same. Feeling somewhat superfluous\u2014something she wasn\u2019t used to in situations like this\u2014Cyn rolled into a crouch, and ignoring Robbie\u2019s glare, she stood and made her way across the plateau to gather the horses. They weren\u2019t happy about all the excitement, but she soothed them one at a time and brought them in. Even Robbie\u2019s monster gelding.</p><p>Robbie was off the phone and glowering at her. \u201cWhat if I\u2019d been wrong? What if that shooter had still been active?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d really thought that, you\u2019d have tackled me before I ever got up.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her a long minute, then huffed a laugh. \u201cCome on. Let\u2019s get you back to Raphael before I get any grayer.\u201d</p><p>It was nearly dark by the time they returned to Lucas\u2019s big house. They\u2019d met Steve Sipes and his security team halfway back. He\u2019d detailed some of his team to continue on to the plateau and see what they could find in the little bit of light that was left. While the rest of the team had escorted the three of them back to the estate, which Cyn thought was massive overkill. Whoever had fired on them was long gone, and a crappy shot to boot.</p><p>But she knew Raphael wouldn\u2019t see it that way, and Robbie knew it, too. Raphael was powerful enough, and their bond was close enough, that even in his sleep, he\u2019d have known that Cyn was in danger. So when they made it back to the stable, she passed the mare\u2019s reins to Robbie, slid to the ground and ran for the main house. She didn\u2019t recognize the security guys on the outer perimeter, but Sipes\u2019s men were standing guard closer in, and two of them were waiting for her at the front door.</p><p>She smiled as she ran past, hurrying down the hallway to the elevator. She entered the code and stepped inside, slipping through the doors downstairs before they were fully open and rolling onto the bed just as Raphael opened his eyes and reached for her. She laughed as he tumbled her beneath him and efficiently stripped away her clothing until he had inspected almost every inch of her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, reaching up to smooth his hair away from his forehead.</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d he purred, dipping down to nuzzle the side of her neck. \u201cYou smell like horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they were aiming at Kathryn, not me.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head. \u201cThat would have been small comfort if you\u2019d been the one shot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>He stared down at her, meeting her eyes, and then smiled ruefully. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I\u2019m the one who should apologize to you. I\u2019ve brought this violence into your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she said, letting everything she felt for him flood the link between them, \u201cI love our life together. I love you. Without you, I\u2019d still be sneaking around taking pictures of cheating spouses and probably end up getting shot anyway as a prowler. I\u2019d much rather spend my life with you, no matter the risks. I love you,\u201d she repeated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her then, his lips moving over hers in a sensuous caress as he pressed his hips between her thighs. There was no foreplay, no preparation, just his cock, familiar in its weight and thickness, in the velvet stroke of it as he pushed deep inside her with a single thrust. She was wet and ready for him, had been ready from the moment he\u2019d rolled her beneath him. She hungered for him always, for his touch, his heat, the spark of silver in his eyes, the deep growl of his voice.</p><p>She\u2019d been a fool to think she could ever leave him.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she whispered, as he plunged between her legs, harder and faster until they tumbled over the edge of ecstasy together, their passion a searing heat that entwined their fates forever.</p> <p>And God help any creature who thought he could tear them apart.</p><p>\u201cI am yours,\u201d Raphael rasped against her ear. \u201cAlways, lubimaya. Always.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Raphael tugged Cyn closer, enjoying the heat of her body, the soft press of her breast against his side as they made their way to Lucas\u2019s homestead. Blackness stretched all around them, their vehicle the only one seemingly for miles.</p><p>\u201cRaphael?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCyn.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, and it made him smile. \u201cWhat is it, lubimaya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn said she and Lucas aren\u2019t mated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I understand it, Kathryn is what you would call commitment phobic. Lucas is giving her time to adjust.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was commitment phobic. You didn\u2019t give me any time to adjust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. But then I am not Lucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certainly not,\u201d she said, burrowing closer and giving him a hard hug. \u201cBut you said they aren\u2019t mated yet?\u201d she clarified, emphasizing the yet.</p><p>\u201cI believe Lucas will push for it sooner, rather than later. The situation we discussed will bring danger to all of us,\u201d he said, his mood turning deadly serious. \u201cThere will be no more margin for adjustments, not for anyone. Lines will be drawn, sides will be chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill it come to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost certainly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hope for a peaceful resolution?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is always hope, my Cyn, no matter how small. But hope doesn\u2019t win wars. Preparation does.\u201d</p> <p>They rode in silence, wrapped in the comfort of each other\u2019s presence, in the knowledge that whatever the future brought, they would meet it together. The empty countryside flashed by the darkened windows, until the SUV slowed and made a turn seemingly out into the wilderness itself.</p><p>\u201cWhere the hell are we going?\u201d Cyn muttered, as dirt kicked up by the SUV\u2019s big tires billowed around the windows in pale clouds. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now that if this involves sitting on a log and watching a fire burn, I\u2019m waiting in the truck.\u201d</p><p>Raphael kissed her temple. \u201cNo campfires. We\u2019re nearly there. Look ahead.\u201d</p><p>Cyn sat up enough that she could see out the front window, and he nearly laughed at the look at her face.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d she demanded. \u201cA log might be better than that ... shack.\u201d She studied it more closely. \u201cOh my God, is that an outhouse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s functioning,\u201d he teased. \u201cThis, my Cyn, is the homestead, the original domicile on this parcel of land, and the one that permitted Lucas to claim the entire acreage as his own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe homestead,\u201d she repeated flatly. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, bonnets and long dresses?\u201d</p><p>Raphael grinned. \u201cNo bonnets for you. And no long dresses either, not the kind you mean anyway. I like your legs too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAw, you say the sweetest things. But really, when you say homestead, you mean like from the Homestead Act? Because it certainly looks ancient enough.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cIt is. That shack, as you call it, was considered an improvement at the time.\u201d</p><p>In fact, Raphael mused thoughtfully, once upon a time, the house had been the only structure for miles around, and what now served only as camouflage had been the sole truth of it\u2014an old, poorly built house suitable for tear down and nothing else. But Lucas had long ago upgraded the structure, so that while it still looked old and rundown, it was anything but.</p><p>\u201cIt has been improved since then, however,\u201d he assured her somewhat absently. \u201cJared,\u201d he said, turning his attention to his lieutenant who sat in the passenger seat up front. \u201cWhen is Aden arriving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told he\u2019s no more than a few miles behind us, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael frowned. \u201cHow many are with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly his lieutenant, Sebastien. That was the agreement, while Lucas has his two, and you have myself and Juro.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Jared. If anything happens, I\u2019ll just wring my hands and fret like I always do,\u201d Cyn said testily.</p><p>Raphael raised a single eyebrow in Jared\u2019s direction, but the vampire didn\u2019t bother to respond to Cyn\u2019s remark, smart enough to know he couldn\u2019t win that particular conversation.</p><p>Cyn glanced at Raphael. \u201cI still think you should have brought more,\u201d she said. \u201cToo much weird stuff going on.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cPerhaps, but I don\u2019t anticipate any hostilities tonight.\u201d</p><p>Cyn snorted dismissively. \u201cPut too many vampires in one room, and there are always hostilities.\u201d</p><p>Raphael smiled. \u201cNo violence, then. Aden is sworn to Lucas, and they are friends besides.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all the same to you, I\u2019ll keep my gun close anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dream of asking you to do otherwise,\u201d he assured her, dropping a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cJared, is Lucas ready for us?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d</p><p>The SUV came to a stop, blowing more sandy brown clouds over the front of their vehicle, obscuring the windshield until Raphael could barely make out the house. Behind the wheel, Juro scowled and turned neatly, parking the truck head out and to one side of the small porch. They waited until the dust settled, then the two vampires disembarked from the front seat. Juro moved a little away from the house and stood staring out into the stygian depths of the desert, his eyes glowing in the faint light, while Jared circled around to Raphael\u2019s side of the truck and opened the door.</p><p>Raphael stepped out, then waited for Cyn, resting a hand low on her back as they walked toward the shabby-looking porch. The front door opened before they got there, splashing yellow light into the darkness, and making Jared swear as he turned his back before it could ruin his night vision. Sensing Lucas\u2019s intent before the door ever opened, Raphael had lowered his eyes against the sudden light, and now lifted them in time to see Lucas coming toward him, his expression unusually grim.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d Lucas said formally. Very few vampires knew of the blood tie between Raphael and Lucas. He only spoke of it now because the vampires present were the inner circle of their security, the warriors they trusted more than any other.</p><p>\u201cLucas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m told the life of your mate was put in danger this afternoon. I apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Cyn believes your Kathryn was the target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she?\u201d He glanced back at the house with a scowl, though Kathryn was nowhere to be seen. \u201cKathryn was rather vague as to the details,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think that was intentional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cIt\u2019s dusty out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it?\u201d Lucas asked, his usual grin returning.</p><p>Cyn huffed impatiently, and Lucas laughed as he started to reach for her hand. Raphael growled softly in warning, but Cyn deftly avoided the grab and moved back, sliding her hand into the crook of Raphael\u2019s arm instead.</p><p>\u201cLead the way,\u201d she told Lucas, her voice pleasant enough, though her eyes were narrowed in irritation.</p><p>Lucas went to link his arm with Raphael\u2019s other side, but stopped midway when Raphael swung his head around and gave him a challenging glare.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Lucas swore, going straight for the open door. \u201cYou guys are too fucking serious. I need a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlcohol doesn\u2019t work on you,\u201d Cyn called.</p><p>\u201cIt does if I drink enough of it, sweetheart. Come on in.\u201d</p><p>Cyn gazed after him as he disappeared inside, then she looked up at Raphael. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to be taking this security business very seriously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only time Lucas is unmistakably serious is when he\u2019s on the field of battle. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not paying attention the rest of the time.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a doubtful look. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word on that, since I\u2019m assuming tonight\u2019s not going to end in a battle.\u201d</p><p>Raphael started to agree with her, but the distant hum of an approaching engine made him pause, even as Juro came to his side and said, \u201cInside, my lord, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded and urged Cyn toward the house\u2019s open door. \u201cThere\u2019s a vehicle coming,\u201d he told her, assuming she hadn\u2019t heard.</p><p>\u201cAden?\u201d she asked.</p><p>It was Juro who answered, saying, \u201cProbably, but we shouldn\u2019t take that chance. Not even with your gun at hand.\u201d</p><p>It was an obvious reference to Jared\u2019s earlier, and unintentional, slight of Cyn\u2019s skill, and she beamed at Juro. The two of them got along famously for some reason. Raphael couldn\u2019t explain it, since Juro didn\u2019t bother with very many people, but it comforted him to know that the big Japanese vampire and his brother would be there to protect Cyn if the worst happened. If his enemies succeeded, and Raphael was no longer there to do it himself.</p><p>Cyn glanced back, trying to sneak a glance at the new arrival, but before she could see anything, Juro followed them inside and closed the door, taking up a position with his back against the wall. Jared had moved farther into the room and assumed a watchful stance near the fireplace where flames were already licking hungrily over fragrant logs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It wasn\u2019t long before even her human ears could pick up the noise of the approaching vehicle, but now that they were inside, no one seemed overly concerned. Raphael had abandoned her in favor of joining Lucas near the fireplace, where they were pouring drinks from a carafe of something that looked and smelled like whiskey.</p><p>She used the time to take a good look around the fucking homestead. Obviously Raphael had been having a little fun at her expense, because the interior of the house was completely at odds with its outward appearance. It was on the small side, you couldn\u2019t hide that, but what there was had been put to good use. The living room was spacious, probably close to half of the total footage, and beautifully decorated. The furniture\u2014a big leather sofa and two matching chairs placed around a rustic coffee table with a natural rock base\u2014was clearly intended to be used, and the fireplace had a gorgeous stone hearth. What looked like typical family pictures hung on one wall, and many of the knickknacks looked personal. This was different from what she\u2019d typically encountered in her experience with vampires, most of whom tended to avoid personal mementos. It wasn\u2019t that they wanted to forget, it was just that it was difficult to maintain the bits and pieces of a life when it lasted hundreds of years. It didn\u2019t surprise her that it would be Lucas who went against the trend. He seemed to relish the role of rebel.</p><p>\u201cCyn!\u201d Cyn turned as Kathryn made her way across the hardwood floor, boot heels tapping sharply. \u201cI had to deal with a last minute phone call from the office. I\u2019d hoped to manage a few days off the grid, but it\u2019s not to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Cyn assured her. \u201cThis is a really nice place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like much from the outside, though, does it?\u201d Kathryn said, laughing. \u201cThe first time Lucas brought me here, all I could think of was whether or not it had indoor plumbing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, right?\u201d Cyn agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I said to Raphael, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a drink? I\u2019ve got food for you and me. They\u2019d starve us if we didn\u2019t take care of it ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forget about food sometimes myself. I\u2019d say it\u2019s good for my figure, except I make up for it on the days when I do eat,\u201d Cyn commented, following her to the small kitchen, which clearly doubled as a wet bar. \u201cYou have vodka?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have everything.\u201d</p><p>Cyn glanced over to the big couch where Raphael and Lucas were already deep in conversation. She could see the faint swirl of red in the amber depths of the drinks they were sipping, and knew they\u2019d added blood. She felt the sharp bite of jealousy. Raphael wasn\u2019t supposed to drink anyone\u2019s blood, but hers.</p><p>\u201cIce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Cyn asked, turning to look at Kathryn. \u201cOh. Yes, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn handed over her drink and stepped in close. \u201cWe need to talk,\u201d she said almost too softly for Cyn to hear.</p><p>Cyn glanced up and held her gaze for a moment, then cut a significant glance at the two vampire lords. Later she mouthed silently, and Kathryn nodded her agreement.</p> <p>Just then, a heavy car door punched the air out front, and she heard deep voices. Juro moved, positioning himself between the door and Raphael, while Jared took a step closer. Raphael didn\u2019t seem to notice. He remained seated while Lucas stood to greet his new guest.</p><p>Following Juro\u2019s cue, Cyn set her drink down and unsnapped the safety strap securing her Glock in place. Kathryn caught the movement, and her eyes widened, her gaze swinging immediately to Lucas who was walking over to open the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going with you,\u201d she snapped, striding over to stand with her lover. Lucas only smiled and brushed the back of his hand down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cause for alarm, Katie mine. Aden is a friend.\u201d</p><p>Cyn caught Juro\u2019s eye, then moved several feet to the right, giving herself a better angle on the door and taking all the friendlies out of her line of fire. Even Jared.</p><p>Lucas saw what she was doing and snorted a quick laugh. He shook his head and took a step forward, stopping right in front of Juro who was blocking the door. \u201cHonestly, big guy. You know I would never endanger Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Juro stared him down for a long heartbeat, then nodded once and stepped away.</p><p>Cyn expected some smartass remark from Lucas, but apparently he\u2019d been sincere in his assurances to Juro, so he only nodded his thanks. He opened the front door and walked outside, and the smell of dust and exhaust fumes wafted in. A moment later and Lucas was back, and he wasn\u2019t alone. The newcomer, presumably Aden, was nearly as tall as Raphael, but bulkier, with thickly padded shoulders and arms beneath a leather coat. His black hair and olive complexion made her think his origins were probably Mediterranean. He stepped into the room behind Lucas and paused, his hooded gaze taking in the room and everyone in it before zeroing in on Raphael. Cyn tensed when Raphael stood to meet him, but Raphael continued to look perfectly at ease, and she reminded herself that he was more than capable of defending himself\u2014and everyone else, if it came down to it.</p> <p>\u201cMy lord Raphael,\u201d Lucas said formally, \u201cThis is Aden.\u201d</p><p>Aden surprised Cyn by giving Raphael a slow, respectful bow from the waist. He straightened, then waited a beat, his eyes carefully assessing, before he crossed the room and stretched out his hand in greeting.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s impassive expression didn\u2019t change, but he shook Aden\u2019s hand, and Cyn was struck by the unusual tableau. Two big, beautiful males, almost visibly radiating power, sizing each other up, but with no overtly hostile intent. For now. Raphael gestured, inviting Aden to sit, and he did so, taking one of the chairs. Lucas and Raphael took opposite ends of the sofa facing Aden, and, as if that was the signal everyone had been waiting for, the tension level in the house plummeted. Even Juro relaxed somewhat, resuming his former sentry position against the wall.</p><p>Waiting for her heartbeat to return to normal, Cyn went back over to the small kitchen and drank a healthy slug of her vodka, feeling it burn all the way down. Kathryn joined her a moment later and pulled a beer out of the fridge.</p><p>\u201cGuess I don\u2019t need to worry about playing hostess, huh? No hors d\u2019oeuvres for these guys,\u201d she murmured to Cyn as she twisted off the cap and took a drink.</p><p>Cyn laughed. \u201cThey heard that, you know,\u201d she said, not even trying to speak softly. She\u2019d learned long ago that it was nearly impossible to foil vampire hearing. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you and I go outside? If it\u2019s too cold, we\u2019ll climb into one of the trucks and turn the heater on. And I\u2019ll tell you all the secrets of vampireland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVampireland,\u201d Kathryn repeated. \u201cI like that. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyn,\u201d Raphael called before they\u2019d gotten halfway to the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside,\u201d she called sweetly.</p><p>He gave her stern look, then ruined it by giving in to the smile playing around his lips. Cyn couldn\u2019t help herself, she smiled back. He was such a beautiful male, and he was all hers.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she promised.</p><p>\u201cYou have your gun, acushla?\u201d Lucas called cheerfully.</p><p>Kathryn rolled her eyes and said, \u201cYou know I do, sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t stay too long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Cyn assured them. \u201cBesides, we\u2019re in the middle of nowhere. Anyone tries to hit this place, we\u2019ll see him coming a mile away.\u201d</p><p>Raphael waited until the door had closed behind the two women, before returning his attention to the night\u2019s business, which was Aden.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean to interfere, my lords,\u201d Aden said, leaning forward urgently. \u201cBut additional caution is warranted. There are vampires out there who are plotting to do more than simply install a new Lord of the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>Raphael eyed Aden for a long moment before answering. \u201cWhat do you know of it?\u201d</p><p>Aden glanced across at Lucas and said a single name. \u201cMagda.\u201d</p><p>Lucas shot him a look of disbelief. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucas, you know me. I don\u2019t kid about such things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck me. What\u2019s that bitch up to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMagda blames Kathryn for her disgrace,\u201d Lucas\u2019s lieutenant, Nicholas, interjected urgently as he circled the couch and took the other chair. \u201cMaybe Cyn\u2019s right about Kathryn being the target this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you and Magda were close,\u201d Raphael commented.</p><p>\u201cWe were,\u201d Lucas agreed. \u201cUnfortunately, during the conflict with Klemens, she put her ego ahead of the safety of this household, and I reassigned her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I spoke with her very recently,\u201d Aden said, \u201cshe had a real hard-on for you, Lucas. A woman scorned, unless I miss my mark.\u201d</p><p>Lucas rolled his eyes. \u201cShe was jealous of Kathryn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s got it in her head that she can replace you as Lord of the Plains.\u201d</p><p>Raphael grunted softly in disagreement. \u201cI\u2019ve met Magda. She wouldn\u2019t make it a day without challenge, and she wouldn\u2019t survive that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t have the juice,\u201d Lucas agreed thoughtfully. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll admit it, or that she won\u2019t give it a try. Magda\u2019s always had an inflated sense of self-worth. Is she acting alone?\u201d he asked Aden.</p><p>\u201cThere were others with her, though none with real power. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to meet any of them in challenge, singly or, for that matter, altogether. And that includes Magda. You could leave this to me, my lords. I could eliminate all of them easily and count it as part of the competition.\u201d</p><p>Raphael shook his head. \u201cKathryn may have been the target, but my Cyn could have been killed. Whether they intended to or not, they\u2019ve challenged me, and I will not let it stand. In any event, I doubt they\u2019ll wait until Chicago. They seem determined to eliminate one or both of us before then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why?\u201d Lucas asked. \u201cMe, okay, I get it. Magda\u2019s pissed and not thinking straight. She thinks if I\u2019m dead, she\u2019ll be able to hold my territory. But why would she risk challenging Raphael?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s stupid and vindictive,\u201d Aden growled. \u201cYou never should have fucked her. I warned you she was trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think all women are trouble,\u201d Lucas replied. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s been decades since I took her to bed. And you\u2019re wrong, she\u2019s not stupid. I kept her on precisely because she\u2019s damn smart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart\u2019s even worse. She thinks she can outwit you. She may be right,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>\u201cThanks for that, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGentlemen,\u201d Raphael said with forced patience. \u201cWhoever is behind these attacks will be dealt with, whether it\u2019s Magda or someone else. But we have other business to discuss tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lord,\u201d Aden said.</p><p>\u201cLucas believes you can take and hold the Midwest, Aden. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe territory is mine, my lord. The challenge is simply a formality. I know my competition, and I will prevail.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAssuming you\u2019re correct, and the territory becomes yours, Klemens ran a corrupt empire,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cMost, if not all, of his income came from illegal sources, which forced him to do business with untrustworthy humans of criminal repute. That made him weak, and I cannot afford to have a weak lord ruling the Midwest.\u201d</p><p>He watched Aden closely, waiting to see how the other vampire would react to the implied threat. To see if Aden understood that he was being offered a place in an alliance\u2014an alliance very much controlled by Raphael\u2014and if he would agree to be a part of it. Or if he was stupid enough to challenge Raphael, which meant he would die here tonight.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me, my lord,\u201d Aden said solemnly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my history. But I\u2019ll tell you this much. I don\u2019t consort with criminals, or with anyone whose purpose in life is to take advantage of others.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cI had heard as much, but I needed to hear you say it. And don\u2019t worry about Magda. Lucas and I can handle her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPiece of cake,\u201d Lucas chimed in. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t broken the bond between us for some reason. Probably coasting on my protection for now. But it means I can find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she will lead us to the others before she dies. It will make your path smoother,\u201d Raphael told Aden. \u201cThere will be no need for you to expend your energy on what my Cyn would call low-hanging fruit.\u201d</p> <p>Aden laughed. \u201cAn apt description, my lord. I would be happy to assist in Magda\u2019s demise, however. I always enjoy a good hunt, and vampires are much wilier prey than humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hunt is mine,\u201d Lucas said. \u201cOr ours,\u201d he amended, catching Raphael\u2019s chilling glance. \u201cNow, I say we enjoy this very fine Irish\u2014\u201d</p><p>All three vampires were suddenly on their feet and heading for the door as the sound of gunfire cut through the night.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cThere are times when I wish I smoked,\u201d Cyn said as she leaned against the fading warmth of the SUV\u2019s front end.</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean,\u201d Kathryn agreed, zipping her jacket. \u201cIt looks so satisfying in the movies. So cool. Smoke drifting in the cold air, dramatic pauses to suck in a new lungful of tar and nicotine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil the stuff kills them, anyway. They don\u2019t show that in the movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is that. I wonder if vamps can smoke. You know any who do?\u201d</p> <p>Cyn thought about it. \u201cI may have met one or two. But Raphael\u2019s people are fairly fanatic about security, and so they tend to be health nuts, working out all the time, and forcing me to work out with them. Kidding,\u201d she added, when Kathryn gave her a sideways look. \u201cAbout the forcing, not the working out part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met that many of Lucas\u2019s vampires yet,\u201d Kathryn said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them in battle, though, and they\u2019re certainly serious about that. Maybe they\u2019re health nuts, too. I\u2019d meet more of his people if I traveled with him. He\u2019d like me to, but the FBI prefers that its agents show up for work most days.\u201d She smiled to show it was her turn to be joking, but Cyn sensed there was more to it than that.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Cyn commented. \u201cThe vampire lords\u2019 life style ... it\u2019s all-consuming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Lucas is used to getting what he wants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all are. I\u2019ve made it my personal mission to make sure Raphael doesn\u2019t always get his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d</p><p>Cyn chuckled. \u201cNot so well, but it\u2019s fun trying. And it drives him nuts, so the effort is well worth it.\u201d She smiled, thinking about Raphael\u2019s usual reaction to what he considered her stubbornness.</p><p>\u201cGood times,\u201d Kathryn agreed, and they both snickered.</p><p>\u201cYou know, the air\u2019s really fresh out here,\u201d Cyn said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it is. Bracing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we sit in the truck instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah. Who needs fresh air? I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>Cyn laughed and opened the driver\u2019s side door, sliding behind the wheel. She snagged the extra keys from their hiding place and turned on the engine, then made sure the heater was set to human warmth.</p><p>Kathryn turned as she settled into the passenger seat. \u201cSo ... this Mates Club ... There are other women like you and me?\u201d</p><p>Cyn smiled. \u201cI prefer to think of myself as one of a kind, but if you mean mated to vampire lords, then, yes, we are not alone. And we\u2019re not all women, either. The vampire lord up in Canada is female. Her name is Sophia, and yes, she\u2019s still called a vampire lord. Chauvinistic bastards. Anyway, her mate is a former Navy SEAL and all around badass named Colin Murphy. We went through some really heavy shit together a few months ago, and survived. He\u2019s a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s Sara, whose story is hers to tell, not mine. She\u2019s a survivor, though, and also a friend. I\u2019m actually the one who introduced her to Rajmund\u2014he\u2019s Lord of the Northeast. They did the traditional marriage thing not long ago, big wedding, the whole bit. Beautiful dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and Raphael aren\u2019t married?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re mated, which is the vamp way, and enough for us. I don\u2019t know how much Lucas has told you, but it involves\u2014surprise, surprise\u2014an exchange of blood.\u201d</p><p>Kathryn shook her head. \u201cLucas has hinted around about the mating ritual and what it would mean for us, but I can tell he doesn\u2019t want to push too hard, too soon. It sounds a lot like being married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is, I guess. There are definitely advantages, though. The blood link means Raphael can find me anywhere in the world, pretty much. And the longer we\u2019re together, the stronger the link. That\u2019s why I had to race back to the house this afternoon. Our link is strong enough that he can follow me even in daytime, especially if something traumatic or emotional happens.\u201d She huffed a laugh. \u201cLike if somebody was shooting at us. I wanted to be there as soon as he woke up, so he could see I was fine. If I do get hurt, though, the blood link lets me heal a lot faster than normal.\u201d She turned to stare out the windshield, thinking about Washington and how close she\u2019d come to dying. \u201cThat shit I told you Colin and I went through together? I would have died if it hadn\u2019t been for Raphael and the blood we share.\u201d</p><p>Cyn grew silent, remembering, and realized how very quiet it was out here. No distant hum of traffic, no planes, no drift of music, no people. There were only her and Kathryn, and two vampires\u2014Lucas\u2019s second bodyguard, a big vampire named Mason, and Sebastien, who\u2019d come with Aden. The two of them seemed to have reached agreement on how to guard the shack, er, homestead, as long as the honchos were convening inside. Mason was currently standing guard at the opposite corner of the house from where Cyn and Kathryn sat in one of the trucks, while Sebastien had disappeared around back a few minutes ago.</p><p>\u201cAny other law enforcement in the club?\u201d Kathryn asked, breaking the silence.</p><p>Cyn shook her head. \u201cThe closest is Emma, but she\u2019s a lawyer, and a political one at that. She\u2019s mated to Duncan in D.C. She\u2014\u201d Cyn stopped talking to stare straight ahead.</p><p>Kathryn followed her gaze. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Cyn didn\u2019t say anything, just opened the truck door and stepped outside, listening hard. \u201cMason,\u201d she called softly, \u201cdo you hear anything?\u201d</p><p>He stared at her unblinking, then his head swiveled and his attention focused on the unpaved road leading to the house. His whole body seemed to lean forward intently, and then Cyn stopped watching him because her own senses were telling her that she\u2019d been right all along. A truck was speeding toward the house, and with no lights. It was the dust cloud she\u2019d seen first, caught in a chance flicker of moonlight at just the right angle to be visible for a few seconds. But she could hear the transmission whining with effort now, as the unknown driver pushed it past its limits, either unable or unwilling to shift gears. Another glint of moonlight, this one off metal, and then Cyn was pulling her gun and thanking the instinct that had warned her to load her so-called vampire killer rounds tonight. She didn\u2019t know who was driving that truck, but the special ammo would work as well on a truck as a vampire.</p><p>\u201cKathryn!\u201d she called, as the truck came into view, no more than sixty yards away and closing the distance fast. She felt more than saw Kathryn pull her weapon, felt her take up a shooter\u2019s stance. The truck roared into the cleared area in front of the house. It was a big pickup, its diesel engine rumbling like a freight train. She could make out one person in the cab, the driver, his hands gripping the steering wheel and his unwavering gaze focused straight ahead. There was no hesitation, no lessening of speed as he drew closer, no indication that he doubted what he was about to do.</p><p>The sound of a sub-machine gun on full auto thundered in from Mason\u2019s position, and then Cyn and Kathryn were both firing, not knowing what the driver had in mind, only that they had to stop him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cyn lifted her aim from the truck\u2019s engine compartment and trained it on the driver instead. She saw the windshield crack, saw the driver slump over the wheel as if his strings had been cut. Saw someone big in the corner of her eye, and then a pair of strong arms was grabbing her, and before she knew it, she was inside the house and the door was being slammed with only seconds to spare before an ear shattering explosion rocked the homestead on its ancient foundation.</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>\u201cCyn?\u201d Raphael stroked her face softly. She wasn\u2019t hurt. He\u2019d know if she\u2019d sustained any physical injury. It was most likely the concussive shock of the explosion, which had rocked Lucas\u2019s fortified house like a child\u2019s toy and stolen her consciousness briefly.</p> <p>Her eyes opened, green and a little confused. He watched puzzlement turn to wide-eyed alarm before her gaze cleared and she reached up to touch his cheek.</p><p>\u201cIs everyone okay?\u201d she asked. \u201cMason was outside, and Sebastien, and ... the house?\u201d She looked around, struggling to sit up.</p><p>\u201cEveryone is well, lubimaya,\u201d he said as he helped her sit up. \u201cI told you, Lucas\u2019s shack is far more than it seems. He often spends the daylight hours here and has no desire to be interrupted or attacked while he sleeps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must be a fortress,\u201d she said softly. \u201cImpressive. So what the hell happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously, the truck was filled with explosives.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWill you help me up?\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood easily, then held out his hand. Cyn grabbed it, and he pulled her to her feet and into his embrace, whispering against her ear. \u201cOne too many times, my Cyn. This has to end.\u201d</p><p>She pulled back to frown at him. \u201cThe only way to end this is to figure out who\u2019s behind it, and take them out. You big bad bloodsuckers have any ideas on that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne or two. Lucas?\u201d he said, glancing over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cReplacement vehicles are on the way, Sire. We should remain inside\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Cyn snapped. \u201cWe need to recover whatever we can of that damn truck. The driver\u2019s dead, but if we can figure out where the vehicle came from, we can\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you know the driver\u2019s dead?\u201d a deep voice said from behind her.</p><p>Cyn spun around, one hand on her Glock before it registered that Raphael never would have permitted a threat to come up behind her. She left her hand there anyway, and Raphael knew it was because it was Aden who\u2019d spoken and she didn\u2019t know him. The knowledge that Raphael and Lucas considered him an erstwhile ally would count in his favor, but even that wouldn\u2019t be enough to make her trust a vampire she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cBecause I killed him,\u201d she said flatly, answering Aden\u2019s question. \u201cAnd if my bullets didn\u2019t do it, then that explosion surely did. Raphael, I need to get out there before any more evidence is destroyed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Aden said, addressing Raphael. \u201cI\u2019m not certain the females should be involved in this.\u201d He lowered his gaze to regard Cyn coolly. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Mason, and it was the two women who drew first, possibly in something of a panic upon realizing their own danger. I also find it curious that Ms. Leighton somehow knew the truck was coming before either of the vampires on guard. Perhaps we should check it ourselves first, rather than permit her\u2014\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t get any further than that.</p><p>Cyn went ballistic. She pulled her weapon, her movement faster than a human should have been capable of. But Raphael was faster yet. He grabbed her from behind, wrapping her in his arms and holding her hand in place before the gun cleared her holster.</p><p>\u201cGently, my Cyn,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>But there was nothing gentle about the rage burning in his chest, making his blood seem to boil in his veins. He was furious at the insult to Cyn, to her honor, and his blood link with her only made it worse. His fury leaked through to Cyn, combined with her own rage, and then pulsed back at him the same way, creating a closed circuit of his anger, stoking it higher and higher until it was a living, breathing thing. Until every other vampire in the room froze, wondering if they would survive the next few minutes.</p> <p>\u201cJared, clear the room,\u201d Raphael ordered.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Jared murmured, and hustled over to the front door where Nicholas was already inputting a code on the keypad, releasing the security shutters. The steel plates retracted with a heavy grinding noise that made him suspect at least one of them had been damaged in the explosion. But no one commented on it. They simply waited in silence until Jared was able to pull the door open, and then one by one the lesser vampires vacated the room.</p><p>Jared was the last to go, meeting Raphael\u2019s eyes with a nod, before pulling the door closed behind him, leaving only Aden, Raphael and Lucas, along with Kathryn\u2014who\u2019d refused to leave\u2014and Cyn. Raphael hadn\u2019t moved an inch while he waited. His arms still encircled Cyn, holding her tightly, preventing her from taking any action, still worried about what her anger might drive her to do. Or perhaps it was his own anger that worried him and Cyn both, because she freed a hand enough to rest it on his where it gripped her upper arm, and he felt a rush of warmth through their shared link.</p><p>There was no warmth when he spoke to Aden, however.</p><p>\u201cI am hundreds of years older than you are,\u201d he said in a voice that frosted the air around them. \u201cI come from a time when women were chattel to be traded away for economic or social gain. But even I am not so backward that I continue to discount the integrity of women, not to mention their courage and intelligence. Lucas has told me you have issues with females. That is your history, your prerogative, your foolish prejudice. But when you let that prejudice interfere with serious affairs, with matters of life and death, that is ignorance and stupidity. My mate is worth a thousand of you. If she were a vampire, you would be calling her Lord of the South. Remember that before you think to insult her again, or the next time I\u2019ll let her go ahead and kill you.\u201d</p><p>Aden\u2019s eyes had come alive as he listened to Raphael, as his avid gaze shifted to stare at Cyn. \u201cSo, the rumors are true,\u201d he said softly. \u201cIt was you who killed Jabril.\u201d</p><p>Cyn froze, her heart pounding against Raphael\u2019s arm where he still held her fast. She tightened her grip on his hand, and he knew what she was asking. She wanted to claim her kill. She was justifiably proud of having gotten rid of the depraved and murderous Jabril, but Raphael had repeatedly told her to keep it quiet, that it was dangerous for anyone to know. And that was still true. But if Aden thought to join Raphael\u2019s Council\u2014and it was his Council, no matter its official designation anymore\u2014then Aden needed to know with whom he was dealing. And he needed to know that he could not fuck with Raphael\u2019s mate.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s arms around Cyn gentled slightly. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he said finally, making certain that Cyn could hear the pride in his voice, something he\u2019d never let her hear before, though he\u2019d always felt it. He\u2019d been so damn proud that she\u2019d not only triumphed over Jabril\u2019s designs against her, but that she\u2019d made him pay the ultimate price. Raphael only wished he could have been there, could have seen the shock in Jabril\u2019s eyes at the realization he\u2019d been bested not simply by a human, but by a woman.</p><p>Aden bowed his head slightly, a sign of both acknowledgment and respect. \u201cI meant no offense, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did,\u201d Raphael scoffed. \u201cBut your offense was against Cynthia, not me. And make no mistake, you won\u2019t be given a chance to do it again.\u201d</p><p>Aden dipped his head a second time. \u201cMy apologies, Ms. Leighton,\u201d he said politely enough, but he continued to stare at Cyn, studying her curiously. Raphael frowned and exerted a tiny bit of his will, compelling the other vampire\u2019s sight upward, away from Cyn, until it collided with Raphael\u2019s own cold gaze. He held it there just long enough to make his point, long enough that Aden was forced to acknowledge Raphael\u2019s unbreakable control.</p><p>Raphael released him. \u201cDo you still believe this is Magda\u2019s doing?\u201d he asked casually, as if they hadn\u2019t just clashed in a test of wills.</p><p>\u201cI do, my lord,\u201d Aden responded, demonstrating his willingness to accept Raphael\u2019s lead and move on to urgent matters. \u201cLucas knows her better, but this latest attack\u2014all of the attacks thus far\u2014are consistent with what I know of her. She prefers to act from the shadows, sending others to do her work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet that driver was human,\u201d Cyn commented, proving that while she was still angry, she was more interested in pursuing the source of the attacks than in killing Aden. For now, anyway.</p><p>Raphael gave her a final hug and then released her.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Aden asked, and Raphael could hear nothing but sincere curiosity in his voice. Cyn apparently had some lingering doubt about that sincerity, because she waited a moment before answering.</p><p>\u201cObservation,\u201d she said finally. \u201cHe had the headlights on at the end\u2014when he was really speeding up\u2014and you guys never need them. For another, he was scared to death, gripping that steering wheel for dear life and staring straight ahead, as if he was under a compulsion, unable to break away even if he\u2019d wanted to. And, frankly, he died too easily. I\u2019m certain it was the gunfire that killed him, not the explosion. And I don\u2019t think a vamp would have died from even my special ammo at that distance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpecial ammo?\u201d Aden asked curiously.</p><p>\u201c147 grain Hydra-Shok,\u201d Cyn informed him. \u201cSmall hole going in, really big hole coming out. I call them my vamp killer rounds,\u201d she added, and Raphael could hear the quiet warning in her voice, before she added, \u201cBut you guys are tough. At that distance and with the truck moving so fast ... I don\u2019t think it would have killed a vampire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Aden allowed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, if the sun comes up and there\u2019s no bloody bits lying about? If there\u2019s nothing but ash?\u201d Cyn said with a shrug. \u201cThen we\u2019ll know for sure.\u201d She turned to Raphael. \u201cIn the meantime, I know time is short until sunrise, but Kathryn and I\u2014\u201d She glanced over and caught Kathryn\u2019s nod of agreement. \u201c\u2014need to check out the scene before we leave. The driver\u2019s body\u2014what\u2019s left of it\u2014will attract animals, and they could drag away evidence. It\u2019d be ideal to store the body somewhere, but I\u2019m not eager to tote it around, and I doubt Lucas wants to store it in here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas made a noise of disgust that made his position clear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to do as much as we can before Kathryn has to get back to the city,\u201d Cyn continued. \u201cAnd then I can come back by daylight and do a more thorough search.\u201d</p><p>Raphael didn\u2019t say anything, but he wasn\u2019t happy about her coming out here without him, and he didn\u2019t try to hide it.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be careful,\u201d she promised, clearly understanding the source of his concern. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll have Robbie with me. You know his instincts are even better than mine when it comes to sensing danger. And it\u2019s not like anyone can sneak up on us out here in the middle of nowhere.\u201d</p><p>He studied her a few minutes longer, then nodded reluctantly. She smiled, rising up on her toes to kiss him lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she whispered directly into his ear. \u201cI\u2019ll tuck you into bed first.\u201d</p><p>If they\u2019d been alone, she\u2019d have been naked and on her back already. But since they weren\u2019t, he satisfied himself with a warning glare, which only made her laugh. Clearly, she was in terror of his retribution.</p><p>\u201cOne thing puzzles me,\u201d Cyn said, stepping back to include Lucas and Kathryn in the conversation. \u201cYou said Magda worked closely with you, Lucas. So why would she aim a bomb at what she knew was a fortified building?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t know,\u201d Lucas said simply. \u201cMost of my vamps have never been out here, and of the ones who have, only Mason and Nick are aware of the extra security measures. There\u2019s an underground bunkhouse out back where my guards sleep, so there\u2019s no need for them to come in the house. And Magda never liked the place. Said it was too primitive. She hasn\u2019t been out here since we put the furnishings in, which was well before we added the enhanced security.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn nodded her understanding, but what Raphael found most interesting about Lucas\u2019s comments, was that he had no qualms about revealing his security arrangements while Aden was in the room. That indicated a level of trust which spoke directly to Lucas\u2019s confidence in Aden, and it made Raphael\u2019s opinion of Aden go up a notch, despite his blindness when it came to women.</p><p>\u201cOkay, we need to check out the scene,\u201d Cyn was saying. \u201cKathryn, I have a flashlight in my purse, but just one, and these guys never need them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Kathryn said in mock affront. \u201cDon\u2019t you watch TV? I\u2019m an FBI agent. I always have a flashlight with me.\u201d She disappeared into the bedroom, emerging a moment later with the same kind of Mini Maglite that Cyn carried. Raphael couldn\u2019t help noticing the similarities between the two women, and he only hoped Kathryn tormented Lucas as efficiently as Cyn did him. The thought made him smile.</p><p>\u201cI hate to break up the party,\u201d Lucas said dryly, when the women were gone, \u201cbut it\u2019s getting late. Kathryn will be going back to the city this morning, but, Raphael, I\u2019ll have to stay at the main house today. We don\u2019t know yet what damage this place has suffered, and given the situation\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your home, Lucas. Your territory. In any event, Cyn and I will leave for Chicago at sundown.\u201d</p><p>Everyone was being polite, Raphael thought to himself, but the truth was that vampire lords were too aggressive and territorial to play well together, especially when visiting another\u2019s territory. The annual Council meetings typically lasted only a few hours, with the various lords flying in for the meeting and leaving just as quickly. This year\u2019s meeting in Chicago would last longer because of the challenge, but since the city was part of the Midwest and currently no one\u2019s territory, the strain would be lessened.</p> <p>There was also the fact that under Raphael\u2019s guidance, the members of the Council were slowly becoming allies, rather than enemies. They couldn\u2019t erase their vampire instincts, but they could blunt them long enough to get along and work toward a common goal. Which was why Raphael had maneuvered all of them into this situation in the first place. If the European vampires had left him and his alone, he would have been happy ruling nothing but his Western territory with Cyn at his side. But he was nobody\u2019s victim. If Europe wanted a fight, they\u2019d get one. And they\u2019d discover the bitter taste of defeat.</p><p>But for today, Raphael and Lucas would sleep in the same house, albeit as far from each other as physically possible. It helped that Lucas was Raphael\u2019s child, and that he was willing to submit to Raphael\u2019s will if it came down to it. But despite their love for each other, it would be stressful. It was necessary for this one day, but that was it.</p><p>The front door opened with a squeal of damaged wood, and Cyn stuck her head in.</p><p>\u201cThe replacement SUVs are here, and sunrise is about an hour away,\u201d she said with obnoxious good cheer. \u201cTime to rock and roll, my lords.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to rock and roll?\u201d Raphael repeated, as he locked down the elevator in their guest quarters.</p><p>Cyn laughed. \u201cI considered going with saddle up, what with Lucas having horses and all, but decided to stick with the classic instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClassic is obviously a relative term,\u201d Raphael commented drily.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being awfully calm about me going back out to the homestead this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you said, Rob will be with you, and I happen to agree with your reasoning. It is necessary to find and stop Magda before she can disrupt the challenge in Chicago. With all of the other lords present, the potential for disaster is fairly high. And that doesn\u2019t take into account the challengers who will be on edge even without her machinations.\u201d</p><p>Cyn narrowed her eyes at him. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Cyn,\u201d he said, stepping close to her and trailing a finger down her silken cheek. \u201cI have finally come to understand that my attempts to control you only result in you engaging in ever more risky behavior in order to prove that I do not, in fact, control you. I have, therefore, changed my approach. I am capable of adapting, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, my love,\u201d she drawled, \u201care one of the most adaptable people I have ever met. You have one goal, and that is to win. And you do whatever it takes to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would move heaven and earth to keep you safe, lubimaya.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, her eyes going soft. \u201cEven though I could argue you\u2019re controlling me by not controlling me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cIf only we had time for that discussion,\u201d he said with mock regret. \u201cYou did promise to tuck me into bed, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm. So, I did.\u201d She shrugged out of her jacket, letting it drop to the floor behind her, then stripped her sweater off over her head. \u201cHow much time do we have?\u201d She walked toward him, her hips swaying seductively as she twisted the front clasp on her bra.</p><p>Raphael growled and stuck his fingers into the waist band of her jeans, pulling her closer as her bra fell open, baring her beautiful breasts. He rested a hand on her waist as he bent to take her mouth in a kiss. Her arms snaked around his neck as she leaned into the kiss and pressed the full length of her body against him.</p><p>Their tongues caressed each other in a dance that was both familiar and different every time. She tasted like Cyn, sexy and seductive and surprisingly sweet. He could smell the enticing scent of her blood, so very close to the surface of her satin skin, the delicious perfume of her arousal. He lowered his head to the curve of her neck and simply breathed her in. He loved this woman as he had never loved another, as he never would love another.</p><p>He bent suddenly and swung her up into his arms, unable to wait any longer. The sun wasn\u2019t far away, and he needed to be inside her, needed to feel her bucking beneath him, to hear her cries as she came over and over again, helpless in the throes of their lovemaking.</p><p>Cyn laughed as he threw her onto the bed. He pulled her boots off, then began tugging at his own clothes.</p><p>\u201cStrip,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI want you naked.\u201d</p><p>Cyn blew a raspberry at him, but put her hands on her jeans, snagging her lacy underwear as she began a sexy shimmy that shoved them both over her hips and down her endlessly long legs. When they were around her ankles, Raphael bent and pulled them the rest of the way off, then wrapped his fingers around her calves and placed one knee on the bed between her legs.</p><p>He looked her over then, one eyebrow raised in a challenging stare as he slid his hands higher along the inside of her thighs, spreading her legs until she was completely open to him.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she whispered, her breaths shallow, her heart pounding so loud that he didn\u2019t have to strain to hear it as he watched her fingers twist into the elegant silk of the bed\u2019s coverlet.</p><p>\u201cMy Cyn,\u201d he crooned, pressing his hand to the slick wetness between her legs, spreading the swollen lips of her vagina, and leaning close enough that his hard cock stroked teasingly against the satin skin of her inner thigh.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said ...\u201d She panted a little to catch her breath, trying to finish her sentence. \u201cYou said,\u201d she repeated breathlessly, \u201cthere wasn\u2019t much time.\u201d Her last word ended on a cry as he slipped a finger into the delicious heat of her sex, while his thumb rubbed slow circles around her sensitive clit.</p><p>Cyn groaned and tried to reach for him, but he only smiled. She swore and palmed her own breasts instead, pinching her nipples until they were full and ripe as cherries, until he could almost see the blood pulsing between her fingers.</p><p>It was his turn to swear. Leaning forward, he flattened one hand beneath her upper back and lifted her breasts to his mouth, sucking hard, first right then left, before biting one juicy nipple with a hungry growl. Cyn cried out, her nails digging furrows into the skin of his shoulders as her back bowed upward, offering herself to his mouth. Her hips thrust against him impatiently, her legs wrapped around his hips, pulling him into her heat.</p><p>Raphael reached between his legs with a snarl, and fisted his cock, wetting only the tip between her thighs, sliding it up and back, enjoying her small cries of frustration, until he finally positioned himself and entered her with a firm thrust. Plunging as deep as he could go, feeling the trembling sheath of her body as it parted before his invasion, then wrapped him in a hot, wet embrace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cyn scraped her fingers along his scalp and gave a hard tug on his hair, pulling him up to her mouth, tasting her own blood on his tongue as they kissed passionately. This was no longer a seductive dance of tongues. This kiss was demand and desire all tangled up in the deep love they felt for each other. It was a hunger they could never satisfy, and one they would never tire of. Their teeth clashed as their tongues fought for dominance, and Raphael wanted to roar with the sheer joy of the battle.</p><p>With a growl, he wrenched his mouth away from her lips and nipped at her neck. Cyn\u2019s breath caught, and he felt the first clench of her sheath. He bit harder, still teasing, still not breaking the skin, but beneath him Cyn\u2019s muscles tightened in excitement, and the hot grasp of her pussy began to shiver around his cock.</p><p>Raphael lifted his head enough to stroke his tongue over the taut side of her neck. He kissed the swell of her jugular once, a bare touch of his lips.</p> <p>\u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he whispered against her hot skin.</p><p>\u201cRaphael,\u201d she panted, then groaned as her inner muscles contracted.</p><p>Raphael\u2019s fangs emerged, and he struck without warning, slicing into the velvet honey of her vein, her blood filling his mouth, his stomach, spreading heat and life into every inch of him, until it was hard to tell where she ended and he began.</p><p>Cyn cried out, her inner walls fisting his cock until he could barely move, her abdominal muscles clenched, the hard pearls of her nipples scraping against his chest as she climaxed, bucking beneath him. He knew he should retract his fangs, should stop the satin flow of her blood into his mouth. He was powerful and old, he didn\u2019t need much blood to sustain himself, but this was more than nourishment\u2014this was his Cyn. He took one more long, indulgent pull, relishing the sheer, sweet taste of her, then lifted his head enough to lick the twin wounds shut.</p><p>Her eyes flashed open, green and fogged with desire. Her tongue dashed out, and she licked her lips, meeting his gaze in a challenge of her own, as she flexed her inner muscles around his cock.</p> <p>Raphael sucked in a breath as desire flooded every nerve, heating his blood and swelling his cock to almost painful hardness as it jerked deep inside Cyn\u2019s sexy body.</p><p>He growled and cupped her ass with both hands, holding her open as he began fucking her with long, hard strokes, the friction of their bodies generating an almost volcanic heat that surrounded his cock and shot straight to his balls. It soared higher and higher, a wild heat that shot down his shaft, splashing against Cyn\u2019s womb as she orgasmed yet again, the two of them thrusting against each other until they were both spent and breathless.</p><p>Raphael collapsed on top of Cyn, feeling the pulse of her heart beating against his chest for only a moment before he rolled to one side, taking her with him. It was a few minutes before either one of them could speak.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s that for tucking?\u201d she asked, the tease ruined by the jaw-cracking yawn she spoke around.</p><p>\u201cExcellent tucking,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou should sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cI need to get back to the homestead before there\u2019s nothing left to find.\u201d She yawned again, then groaned. \u201cJesus, I hope there\u2019s coffee on this ranch somewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Raphael hugged her. \u201cLucas has the usual daytime staff, so I\u2019m certain there\u2019s coffee and breakfast, too. You need to replenish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to drink water, you mean. That\u2019s what I get for loving a bloodsucker.\u201d</p><p>He slapped her ass.</p><p>\u201cHey! There\u2019s no need to beat me.\u201d</p><p>Raphael scoffed wordlessly, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for the day, then?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what we find at the homestead. If there\u2019s anything to follow, we\u2019ll do that, but I\u2019ll be back before dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, yeah, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, my Cyn,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She rose up enough to press her lips against his. \u201cI love you back, my Raphael.\u201d</p><p>Raphael closed his eyes against the searing heat of the rising sun that was blazing inside his skull. He fought it as long as he could, straining to remain awake, to give voice to the alarm bells clanging in the back of his mind. But this was one foe he could never defeat, and sleep claimed him before he could warn her that among vampires even friends could be enemies.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Robbie muttered, as he climbed from the SUV and stood staring at the debris scattered in front of Lucas\u2019s homestead house.</p><p>Cyn ignored him as two of Lucas\u2019s daytime security guards walked over to join them. She recognized both of them from the previous morning, and smiled a greeting.</p><p>\u201cOkay with you if we look around a little?\u201d she asked, although the request was mostly for form, because the visit had been arranged in advance.</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d one of the guards said. \u201cLord Donlon cleared it already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. You all haven\u2019t seen anyone snooping around, have you? Maybe a vehicle headed this way in the distance that turned around suddenly?\u201d</p><p>The guard shook his head. \u201cSee for yourself. Line of sight goes on forever here. We\u2019d definitely notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. We\u2019ll poke around a bit, and get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoller if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Robbie didn\u2019t look up when she rejoined him. Eyes on the ground, he grumbled, \u201cWhose idea was it to search through this stuff anyway? Oh, wait,\u201d he continued, slanting a look at Cyn. \u201cIt was yours.\u201d He leaned over to push aside a piece of tire, then grunted in disgust.</p><p>Cyn glanced over at what appeared to be a piece of human rib bone with bits of meat still attached.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised there are any body parts left,\u201d she said absently, returning to her own search. \u201cI thought the animals would have dragged it away or eaten it by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA visual I could live without,\u201d Robbie groused. \u201cYou know, Cyn, when you called this morning, you said we were going hunting, not picking through some guy\u2019s barely dead remains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not picking through remains, we\u2019re looking for clues. And then we\u2019ll go hunting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure the big guy knows you\u2019re doing this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely, and he agreed it was necessary.\u201d</p><p>Robbie sighed. \u201cAll right, what the hell are we looking for again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think our best bet is finding something from the truck. It looked like a personal vehicle to me. I had other stuff on my mind at the time, but I remember it as being fully loaded. Shiny paint, lots of chrome, big tires. Somebody\u2019s baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing from the plate?\u201d</p><p>Cyn closed her eyes briefly, trying to replay what she\u2019d seen in those few minutes of panic. \u201cWhat\u2019s the South Dakota plate look like?\u201d</p><p>Robbie frowned. \u201cMount Rushmore, I think.\u201d</p><p>Cyn stared at him without seeing. \u201cYeah, that could be it. Blue sky, with something gray. It might have been Rushmore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. That narrows it down to only a few hundred thousand vehicles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be snarky. It was dark, and he turned his lights on when he got closer. Not to mention the bomb he was carrying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuses,\u201d he tsked, shaking his head.</p><p>Cyn grinned despite herself. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, scouring the scattered debris. \u201cOur best bet\u2014and I know it\u2019s a long shot, so no smart ass remarks\u2014would be even a small piece of the plate. The back end was loaded with explosives, not to mention the gas tank, so that probably blew all to hell, but the front plate might have been thrown out of the immediate blast range.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem,\u201d Robbie said absently, reaching into his pocket and pulling on a latex glove. \u201cI\u2019ll get right on that for you.\u201d</p><p>Cyn\u2019s laugh trailed off as he held up a bloody piece of something.</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019d rather have this,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cI do believe it\u2019s a thumb.\u201d</p><p>She hurried over. \u201cI think you\u2019re right,\u201d she said. She retrieved a bottle of water from the SUV, and poured it over the gruesome appendage, washing away the dirt and grime.</p><p>\u201cCould be someone else\u2019s, I guess,\u201d Robbie said.</p><p>\u201cNah, it\u2019s too fresh. Let\u2019s see if our guy\u2019s in the system, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She whipped out her cell phone, took the thumb in her own gloved hand, and pressed it to the screen, scanning it quickly before handing it back to Robbie. The image was automatically sent to her laptop, which would then query every fingerprint database she had access to, and that was most of them.</p><p>\u201cAin\u2019t technology great?\u201d Robbie commented. \u201cShould we save this thing?\u201d</p><p>Cyn dug a plastic baggie out of her pocket. \u201cJust in case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of cases,\u201d he said, dropping the thumb into the baggie, \u201chow come the local cops aren\u2019t all over this? That explosion was visible for miles. We saw it from the ranch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKathryn says Lucas is friends with the mayor. He made a few calls, and voila, no police were dispatched. Your tax dollars at work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore likely it\u2019s Lucas\u2019s political contributions at work. Corruption is everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, get over it and help me decide what to do next, because we have a winner, boys and girls.\u201d</p><p>They both peered down at the ID displayed on Cyn\u2019s cell phone. \u201cMatthias Hoover,\u201d she read. \u201cHe has an old DUI conviction. No surprise that one would hit first. There\u2019s an address, but this record is old. Let me see ...\u201d She tapped the screen rapidly, accessing the local white pages, and found a listing under the same name, same address.</p><p>\u201cI love people who stay in one place. Incoming,\u201d she murmured and sent the address to Robbie\u2019s phone, which pinged almost immediately.</p><p>\u201cGot it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe check out the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCyn,\u201d Robbie said in clear warning.</p><p>\u201cIf it looks like Magda or any other vampire is using the place, we won\u2019t go inside,\u201d she promised. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait until sunset, and let the big guns handle it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPromise?\u201d</p><p>She scowled.

Well, not anymore.</p><p>\u201cScout\u2019s honor,\u201d\u2019 she told Robbie.</p> <p>\u201cYou were never a scout,\u201d he snickered as they climbed into the SUV and drove away from the wreckage.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a saying, Robbie. Sheesh. You know where you\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but the Nav system does. Sit back and enjoy the ride.\u201d</p><p>Enjoy the ride, Cyn thought to herself. What was there to enjoy? She\u2019d never been a fan of the kind of dry, barren country she was seeing outside the truck window. She could admire the spires and pinnacles in the distance, but the view was mostly hills covered with dry grass with blotches of snow. In the spring, it was probably lovely and green. In a few weeks, pretty and snow-covered white. Today? Splotchy brown and boring.</p><p>She caught Robbie checking his rearview mirrors and frowned, thinking she\u2019d seen him do that one too many times.</p> <p>\u201cProblem?\u201d she asked, cutting a glance at her own side mirror.</p><p>\u201cThat blue sedan three vehicles back. I\u2019m sure it was behind us earlier.\u201d</p><p>Cyn studied the car in question, angling her head for a better view. There weren\u2019t a lot of vehicles on the road, but enough that someone could tail them if they were smart about it.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think? You want to drive around a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur exit\u2019s coming up. Let\u2019s see if they follow us.\u201d</p><p>Robbie slowed, exiting to the right, and making an immediate right hand turn. Cyn didn\u2019t even look where they were going, too intent on watching their potential ghost.</p> <p>\u201cHe kept going,\u201d she said, twisting around to look out the back window. \u201cHold up a minute.\u201d</p><p>Robbie pulled to one side, and they waited, until she couldn\u2019t see the blue sedan anymore.</p><p>\u201cLooks like we\u2019re clear.\u201d</p><p>He did his own quick scan, then nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to drive around a bit before going to Hoover\u2019s house just to be safe, but I think you\u2019re right.\u201d He put the truck in gear and pulled back onto the road.</p><p>By the time they reached Matthias Hoover\u2019s address, they were confident they\u2019d lost their tail, assuming they\u2019d ever had one. They parked about a quarter mile away on the opposite side of the street, and under the stark cover of a bare-limbed black walnut tree.</p><p>Cyn raised a pair of binoculars to her eyes and scanned the house. It was small and old, and stood alone, separated from its nearest neighbor by several hundred yards of scrub. It was in desperate need of a paint job, and if it hadn\u2019t been for the light dusting of snow on the ground, Cyn was pretty sure the front yard would have been nothing but dirt and a few scraggly bushes.</p><p>Well, that and the two human guards lurking around the perimeter, which told her this wasn\u2019t exactly an ordinary human dwelling.</p><p>After watching the guards silently for a few minutes, Cyn lowered her binoculars. \u201cWhat does that look like to you?\u201d she asked quietly.</p> <p>\u201cLooks like a big comedown for someone who used to live on Lucas\u2019s ranch,\u201d Robbie said, studying the house through his own binocs.</p><p>Cyn swallowed a chuckle. \u201cTell me about it. But I\u2019m talking about the guards.\u201d She lifted the binoculars again.</p><p>\u201cIs that what they\u2019re supposed to be?\u201d</p><p>Cyn eyed the two human guards who were standing at opposite corners of the house, not even trying to look alert. \u201cPoint taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably a vamp house, though,\u201d Robbie agreed. \u201cShades are all down, and why else have guards at all? Unless it\u2019s drugs, but that sort tend to have a more effective watch than those two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssuming it\u2019s vamps, and I think it is, it doesn\u2019t have to be Magda. There\u2019s no reason for her to hang around. She could have sent Hoover off on his suicide mission, and moved on to Chicago. Whoever\u2019s in there might just be some flunkies she left behind to keep an eye on things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe she wanted to be close to the action. If the bomb had succeeded in taking Lucas out, the territory would be up for grabs, right? Maybe Magda figured she could swoop in while everyone was still reeling.\u201d</p><p>Cyn pursed her lips thoughtfully. \u201cMaybe. Or maybe this house is all she can afford. After all, it was Lucas\u2019s money that subsidized her lifestyle before. Maybe she\u2019s a shopaholic and spent all of her salary on clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBummer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter why, or even if, she\u2019s here, I guess. Doesn\u2019t matter how many are in there either, because Raphael doesn\u2019t approve of killing vamps while they sleep, not even the assholes.\u201d She stared at the house thoughtfully. \u201cAlthough ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of that,\u201d he said worriedly.</p><p>\u201c... it might be useful to know how many vampires are in there. You know, so Raphael will know what he\u2019s dealing with.\u201d</p><p>Robbie huffed dismissively. \u201cYeah, right. Because Raphael and Lucas would just have one hell of a time coping if there\u2019s too many of them low-level vamps in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoilsport. But you\u2019re right, damn it. Hey!\u201d she said, brightening. \u201cWhat if when we go back to the ranch to tell Raphael, Magda wakes up, and is gone before we get back here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice try, babe. How about if we use a cell phone to tell Raphael instead? And that way no one can sneak away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I promised Raphael I\u2019d be there when he woke up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so I drop you at the estate, then come right back here. I\u2019ll keep watch just in case that Magda bitch is an early riser. If they take off, I\u2019ll follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou worried about me, Cyn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways. It\u2019s a pain in the ass to train a new bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you, too, babe. You just wake the big guy and bring reinforcements. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Cyn propped herself on Raphael\u2019s chest and watched him sleep. Some might argue that what he did wasn\u2019t a true sleep, since he couldn\u2019t wake up. But he dreamed, and it was restful for him, and that was close enough for her.</p><p>Her eyes cut to the digital clock on the bedside table. She was like a walking Farmer\u2019s Almanac these days, at least when it came to the sun. She heard the minute click of the clock as the time changed, and then Raphael\u2019s arms came around her, and she smiled. It was always the first thing he did. His midnight eyes opened, and his big hand rested familiarly on the curve of her butt.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my Cyn.\u201d He tugged her higher until their mouths met in a soft, welcoming kiss.</p><p>\u201cAnd how was your hunt today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. We\u2019re pretty sure we found the house where Magda\u2019s holed up.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her cautiously. \u201cAnd is she still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking if we went into the house, the answer is no. We decided to wait for you guys.\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, his handsome face drawn into a scowl. \u201cWhere is my Cyn, and what have you done with her?\u201d</p><p>She slapped his chest.</p><p>\u201cOn second thought,\u201d he said, rubbing her butt, \u201cI recognize this ass. So why the suddenly sensible approach?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was Robbie\u2019s influence. He\u2019s determined to be the voice of reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that make you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlive. Because everyone knows the voice of reason is the first to die when the monsters come.\u201d</p><p>He blinked, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. Tell me where this house is, and I\u2019ll let Lucas know. Magda is his child, after all. He\u2019ll want to deal with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we have to go back there, too,\u201d she said urgently, raising herself enough to stare into his face. \u201cRobbie\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving tonight. You can call Rob, have him meet us at the airport.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a narrow-eyed look. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose, to torment me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I? Maybe it\u2019s a test of your new cautious nature.\u201d</p><p>Cyn made a dismissive noise. \u201cI never said anything about being cautious, fang boy, so put that idea right out of your head. We could easily have taken Magda\u2019s human guards, but I know how you feel about killing vamps while they sleep, so there was no point in going inside. So there.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cWelcome back, my Cyn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awful. How am I supposed to become a better person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to get any better,\u201d he said, his voice deep and silky as he buried his face against her neck. \u201cI love you exactly the way you are.\u201d Without warning, he rolled her beneath him. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing clothes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she said, flexing her hips playfully, feeling the hard length of his arousal.</p><p>\u201cI need to shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, I\u2019m feeling a bit gritty myself. That explosion site was pretty gruesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could shower together.\u201d</p><p>Cyn flexed her hips again. \u201cIt might take longer that way.\u201d</p><p>Raphael stood, taking her with him. \u201cThen we should get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s taking them so long?\u201d Cyn sat with Elke on the stairs of Lucas\u2019s big house, watching Raphael and Lucas discuss how to proceed with the night\u2019s hunt, and thinking Kathryn would be sorry to miss this. Especially if it turned out to be Magda in that house. Cyn had gotten a clear impression that there was no love lost between the two of them. Unfortunately, Kathryn had been called into the agency this morning, so she was going to miss the big takedown.</p><p>Assuming it ever happened.</p><p>The vampires all stood at the bottom of the stairs, near the several big SUVs which were waiting to take them away ... once they finished negotiating. Jared and Juro were there with Raphael, and Nicholas from Lucas\u2019s side. It was all terribly civilized, which struck Cyn as rather anticlimactic under the circumstances. They were about to hunt down and kill some rogue vampires, not rendezvous for dinner at the local steak house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d she demanded irritably. \u201cRobbie\u2019s been sitting on that house all alone for hours. We need to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a question of precedence,\u201d Elke said. She sat one step higher than Cyn, leaning back on her elbows with her legs stretched out in front of her. To all appearances, she was completely relaxed, but Cyn knew she could be on her feet in mere seconds if a threat manifested. She also could probably hear every word the two vampire lords were saying.</p><p>\u201cWhat precedent?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSeveral actually, that\u2019s the problem. Raphael is Lucas\u2019s Sire, which gives him precedence. But this is Lucas\u2019s territory, and Magda is his child. And though Raphael was followed from the airport, most likely with nefarious intent, the other far more dangerous attacks affected both lords equally, whether intentionally or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJeez, sign a fucking contract why don\u2019t they? If I\u2019d known they were going to call in a mediator, I\u2019d have taken care of it myself while the sun was up. Can we go now?\u201d she called loudly.</p><p>Raphael said something that made Lucas laugh. She gave him a squinty look. \u201cWhat\u2019d he say, Elke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re like a sister to me, Cyn\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, bad analogy, but I\u2019m not telling you anyway. You\u2019re a friend. But Raphael owns me body and soul.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d She glanced at Elke over her shoulder. \u201cThink your lord and master is going to get his very fine ass in gear any time soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, my Cyn?\u201d Raphael said from way too close, his deep voice laced with amusement.</p><p>Her head snapped around to find him standing right in front of her, one hand held out. She scowled as she let him pull her to her feet. \u201cI hate it when you do that,\u201d she muttered as they walked toward the waiting SUVs. The two lords were traveling in separate SUVs. They\u2019d agreed on that much early on. Ostensibly, this was because Raphael and his party would be going directly to the airport after dealing with Magda. But Cyn knew the real reason was because they were getting on each other\u2019s nerves. She could feel their growing tension like a constant, and fucking irritating, buzz over her skin. It was a relief when they finally climbed into their respective vehicles and drove away from the house, putting some distance and cold metal between the two powerful lords.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the deal?\u201d Cyn asked Raphael once they finally hit the main road and started making good time. \u201cYou guys work out your issues?\u201d</p><p>Raphael\u2019s sensuous mouth curved slightly as he put his arm over her shoulders and pulled her close. \u201cThe kill is Lucas\u2019s. Magda is his child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that blows. Why\u2019d I bother to track her down if we don\u2019t even get in on the kill?\u201d</p><p>He studied her for a moment, his eyes gleaming silver in the darkness of the backseat. \u201cYou\u2019re so bloody-minded, lubimaya,\u201d he said with obvious pride. \u201cIs this is my influence? Or were you always this way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t stab other children on the playground, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking. Let\u2019s just say that living with you has freed up my more primal instincts and leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it is me,\u201d he concluded, chuckling happily.</p><p>Cyn slanted a quizzical look at him. \u201cMost guys would be freaked out to discover they\u2019re living with a homicidal woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I,\u201d he purred, skimming his lips over her cheek, \u201cam definitely not most guys.\u201d</p> <p>Cyn turned her head to catch his lips in a kiss. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAnd thank God for that.\u201d She kissed him again. \u201cSo why are we bothering, if we\u2019re not in on the kill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor appearances. Magda offended us equally, after all.\u201d He paused a moment. \u201cBut mostly because Lucas thinks it will be fun to hunt together again.\u201d</p><p>Cyn rolled her eyes. \u201cNot much of a hunt. I already found her for you. And for the record, if anyone else asked ... no, forget it. No one else would dare ask you to do something just for the fun of it. Except me, of course. But I don\u2019t get why Lucas wants you to do it tonight. You guys are already on the verge of ripping out each other\u2019s throats.\u201d</p><p>Raphael was spared from responding to that when Cyn\u2019s phone rang. Frowning, she took a quick look. \u201cIt\u2019s Robbie,\u201d she told Raphael before answering. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s going on, Cyn. There\u2019s a new bunch of vampires who just arrived at the house, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re friendlies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe challenge is active,\u201d Raphael said softly, his vampire hearing having permitted him to hear both sides of the conversation. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you recognize anyone?\u201d she asked Robbie.</p><p>\u201cNo one I know. There\u2019s five of them, but one guy\u2019s clearly in charge. He\u2019s big, nearly as tall as Raphael, but darker, Middle-eastern looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAden,\u201d Raphael said simply. He pulled out his own phone and hit a speed dial. \u201cLucas,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re minutes away, Rob,\u201d Cyn said quickly, half listening to Raphael\u2019s call. \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think they saw me, and I\u2019m not sure they\u2019d associate me with Raphael, even if they did. You need to get here, though.\u201d</p><p>Cyn disconnected and caught the tail end of Raphael\u2019s conversation with Lucas. \u201cThe decision is yours,\u201d he said, and disconnected.</p><p>Cyn took one look at his carefully blank face. Not angry, not anything. It was his vampire lord face, remote and unemotional. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Raphael shrugged. \u201cMagda belongs to Lucas, but Aden is within his rights to challenge her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he have to wait until the Council makes it official?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s made it clear that her intention is to compete for the territory. Not only to Aden, but to others. That effectively began the competition, at least where she was concerned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, damn. This just gets worse and worse. Now Aden gets the kill.\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed, hugging her close. \u201cMy poor Cyn.\u201d</p><p>She sat up suddenly. \u201cThere,\u201d she said, pointing out the black SUV where Robbie waited. \u201cThe house is that white one with ... oh,\u201d she concluded, realizing there was no need for her to point out the house. The human guards were gone, but Aden was very much in evidence. Backed by two other vampires, he was approaching the closed front door of the house. He turned at their approach, and strode out to meet them with a welcoming smile. It was the first smile Cyn had seen on his face.</p><p>\u201cHe looks awfully smug,\u201d she said sourly.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d Raphael said, blatantly trying not to laugh as he took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s see what Aden has to say for himself.\u201d</p><p>By the time they were out of the SUV, Raphael\u2019s stoic lord of the universe mask was firmly back in place. He nodded as Lucas joined them, then they both turned cool gazes upon Aden.</p><p>\u201cMy lords,\u201d Aden said, clearly striving for solemnity, but it was a losing battle. He was too obviously pleased with himself to manage it.</p><p>\u201cYou knew she was staying here?\u201d Lucas asked. His manner was not altogether friendly, and Cyn felt the first prick of unease. There was a lot of power in those three. Raphael and Lucas were both proven commodities, and Aden obviously had power of his own if he thought to rule the Midwest. With tensions already running high, the likelihood of everything going south was terrifyingly high.</p><p>Aden\u2019s smile disappeared. Smug or not, he was smart enough to see the risk and avoid adding to it. \u201cI did not know where Magda was, my lord. I did, however, assume she was in town, given the attack last night. And, so ...\u201d He turned and gave Cyn a sly look. \u201cI had someone follow Ms. Leighton and her friend this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Raphael grew very still. Not a good sign.</p><p>\u201cWe suspected there was a tail on us,\u201d she said casually, trying to break the tension. \u201cBut we thought we lost them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Aden agreed. \u201cBut you got them close enough. There aren\u2019t that many houses out here, after all.\u201d What he left unsaid was that as a potential vampire lord, he was powerful enough to sense Magda\u2019s presence once he got close enough.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send you a bill,\u201d she said, slipping her arm through Raphael\u2019s. \u201cIt won\u2019t be cheap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuality never is,\u201d he said, with a slight dip of his head. He turned his attention to Lucas. \u201cBut there is still the question of Magda, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Lucas scowled and was about to say something when the front door opened, and a curvy, dark-haired woman appeared. No, not a woman, a vampire. As were the two young men who crowded behind her, as if she could protect them.</p><p>\u201cMagda,\u201d Raphael told Cyn softly.</p><p>Magda paused briefly, eyes wide as she stared at the welcoming committee of vampires on her doorstep. She was a beautiful woman. Cyn acknowledged that much as she watched Magda visibly attempt to gather her courage, to wrap herself in the arrogance of someone who knew the value of her own beauty. But she couldn\u2019t do it. Not with two vampire lords waiting for her, not when she\u2019d tried to kill those same vampire lords less than twenty-four hours earlier.</p><p>Magda closed her eyes as if in prayer, then strode forward. Juro immediately stepped in front of Raphael, even as Nicholas moved to intercept Magda before she could reach Lucas. She flashed an angry glare at him\u2014she had enough arrogance left for that\u2014but then her gaze found Lucas, and there was nothing but pleading in her eyes. She dropped to her knees, then lower, prostrating herself before her Sire.</p><p>\u201cSire,\u201d she said, her voice muffled as she kept her eyes downcast, her face nearly touching the ground. \u201cI was a fool. I beg forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>Cyn stared at the prostrate female in disbelief. Did she really think Lucas would forgive her for trying to kill him and Raphael? For taking a shot at Kathryn? Something of her surprise must have alerted Raphael, because his fingers tightened almost imperceptibly around hers. Cyn glanced at him, then followed his gaze to Lucas. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lucas. Raphael had told her not long ago that the only time Lucas was truly serious was on the field of battle. And perhaps this qualified, because the lighthearted, teasing Lucas was gone, gone, gone. The Lucas who stepped around Nicholas to stare down at Magda was as cold as ice, terrible in his beauty, his eyes gleaming with a subdued golden light. He raised those eyes to the two vampires still lingering in the doorway, and his lips peeled back to bare his fangs. He didn\u2019t move so much as a muscle that Cyn could see, but suddenly the two vampires collapsed, scattering into dust before their bodies hit the ground.</p><p>And then he turned that deadly gaze on Magda.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d Aden said, boldly interrupting. \u201cThe challenge has begun.\u201d</p> <p>And the way he said it, it sounded formal, like part of a ritual.</p><p>For a moment, Cyn thought Lucas would kill Aden for daring to speak. His golden gaze lifted to stare at Aden, and there was no friendship in that look, no emotion at all. It was the flat look of a predator deciding whether his prey was worth the effort of killing.</p><p>But Aden never flinched. His own eyes lit with the deep blue of dusk as he faced down his master, his friend, his body language a complex mix of both submission and challenge. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he repeated. \u201cThe challenge has begun.\u201d</p><p>Lucas blinked lazily, then shifted his predator\u2019s gaze to Magda and said, \u201cThe challenge has begun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Magda shrieked. Her eyes were wild, rolling white as they went from Lucas to Aden and back again. \u201cPlease, Sire! I beg you!\u201d</p> <p>To no avail. Lucas turned his back on her as if she represented no threat at all and walked back to the waiting SUV. Nicholas was not so sanguine about his Sire\u2019s safety. He never took his gaze off Magda as he backed after Lucas.</p><p>Magda jumped up as if she would run. Aden did no more than glance at her, but he unleashed a slap of power that Cyn felt like a shiver along her bones as it slammed Magda back to the ground, and left her screaming in pain.</p><p>Cyn figured it was all over then, but Aden turned slightly, shifting his attention to Raphael, and holding his gaze for a moment before dipping his head in a slow bow. \u201cThe challenge has begun, my lord.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded casually, his body language completely relaxed as he shifted to slip an arm around her waist, his fingers dropping to caress her hip. \u201cThe challenge has begun,\u201d he agreed. And then, still holding onto Cyn, he turned and walked away, as if none of it mattered anymore, as if Magda, writhing on the ground in pain, struggling against Aden\u2019s invisible bonds, didn\u2019t matter anymore.</p><p>And perhaps she didn\u2019t. It was the way of Vampire. There was no room for pity or squeamishness.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain of him?\u201d Raphael asked Lucas when they met up at the vehicles.</p> <p>\u201cI am. He can be an ass, but he will stand with us, Sire,\u201d Lucas insisted. But despite his confident assurances, there was something in his voice that drew Cyn\u2019s attention, a bleakness in his eyes that told her Magda\u2019s imminent death was going to hurt him. Or maybe it was her betrayal. Or both. But whatever it was, it made Cyn, the least huggy person in the world, want to give him a hug. So, she did.</p><p>Lucas sighed softly when her arms came around him.</p><p>\u201cTell Kathryn I\u2019ll call her,\u201d she told him, when she stepped away. \u201cShe needs to know what to expect in Chicago. Major frock event.\u201d</p><p>A little bit of Lucas\u2019s usual twinkle returned to his eyes. \u201cSounds intriguing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she agreed, one brow arched. \u201cBut you don\u2019t have the equipment to appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>Lucas smiled at that, then turned to Raphael. \u201cSee you in Chicago, Sire.\u201d</p><p>Raphael nodded. \u201cUntil then.\u201d</p><p>The two vampire lords clasped hands and slapped backs quickly, then strode away from each other while trying to look like they weren\u2019t in a hurry. Which they so obviously were.</p> <p>Juro took off as soon as Raphael climbed in and pulled the door closed. Cyn turned around to verify Robbie\u2019s presence in the convoy, then settled next to Raphael for the trip to the airport.</p><p>\u201cThat was kind of you,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Cyn shrugged uncomfortably. \u201cHe seemed so sad, and Kathryn wasn\u2019t there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, yes. Kathryn. I assume your conversation with her will include this new club of yours?\u201d he asked casually.</p><p>Cyn was grateful for the change of subject, but she wasn\u2019t fooled. He was dying to know what was up with the Mates Club.</p><p>She snuggled closer with a deep sigh. \u201cI just want to be sure Lucas has warned her about the formal events in Chicago. You know, so she knows how to dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I wonder?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI cannot imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa, ha. But I was wondering ... how much I should charge Aden for coasting on my investigation. I had to take a fucking print off a dead guy\u2019s thumb!\u201d</p><p>Raphael laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re still upset you didn\u2019t get to bloody anyone tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, yeah, I am.\u201d</p><p>He tucked his mouth next to her ear and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll have to work off that energy some other way.\u201d</p><p>She shivered, then turned and met his kiss, closing her teeth over his lower lip. \u201cPromise, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise, my Cyn.\u201d His gaze became distant, as if he was seeing something she couldn\u2019t, and he said, \u201cBut do not worry. There will be blood enough for everyone before this is finished.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Chicago, Illinois</p><p>Cyn held Raphael\u2019s hand tightly as they strolled down the hallway. The hotel corridor was empty, despite the number of guests already filling the large ballroom beyond the double doors just ahead of them. Raphael\u2019s security had cleared the way for them, just as she knew others had done earlier that evening. All of the sitting vampire lords had walked down this same hallway this evening. Raphael was only the last.</p><p>Some might have thought having all of the lords in one place made them vulnerable, an easy target. But vampire lords were scary powerful. Put them all together, and you didn\u2019t have an easy target. You had a bomb waiting to go off in your face. Except the vampire lords would all be alive and well after the so-called bomb went off, and you\u2019d be dead.</p><p>Not that there wouldn\u2019t be violence associated with tonight\u2019s gala. But it wouldn\u2019t be coming from any of the current vampire lords. The sole purpose of this gathering was to launch the competition which would determine who would be the next Lord of the Midwest. Everyone\u2019s power was on full display. No one was hiding what they were, from the lowest minion to the prominent contenders, to the lords themselves, and aggression was running high. According to Raphael, the vampire lords\u2019 presence and power were the only things that kept it from becoming a complete free-for-all.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready, my Cyn?\u201d</p><p>She looked up and found Raphael watching her with infinite patience. Well, that and the heat that was always there when he looked at her, as if what he really wanted to do was drag her back to their private suite and fuck her senseless. Which he\u2019d already done once this evening. Twice if you included the shower. Which she definitely did. She smiled in recollection, and he smiled back, knowing what she was thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, lubimaya. As always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo do you, fang boy.\u201d And, God, that was true. Some men were born to wear a tux, and Raphael was one of them.</p><p>\u201cThe others are waiting,\u201d he told her, although his look clearly said they could wait forever if that\u2019s what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s go wow the masses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr at least a few vampires,\u201d he amended.</p><p>Cyn was laughing when they opened the doors. There were smiles and greetings all around as she and Raphael joined the others. Air kisses and hugs, and the enthusiastic admiration of designer frocks, and tuxes, too. Improbably enough, these people had become her friends, and she paused a moment to take them all in.</p><p>\u201cMy lord,\u201d a deep voice said, and she turned to find Aden waiting to pay his respects. \u201cMs. Leighton,\u201d he added, smiling.</p><p>\u201cI e-mailed you my bill earlier,\u201d she informed him, with a shark\u2019s grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to be sitting down when you open it.\u201d</p><p>Aden laughed cheerfully. \u201cIt was well worth the price. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s for sure,\u201d she agreed.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ve finished, my Cyn,\u201d Raphael said smoothly, slipping his arm around her waist. \u201cWe do have business to conduct.\u201d He shifted his gaze to Aden. \u201cI wish you luck, Aden. I\u2019m certain we\u2019ll hear from you before it\u2019s over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, my lord. I look forward to it,\u201d he said, then bowed again and disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>\u201cYou think he\u2019ll be the next vampire lord?\u201d she asked Raphael.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite certain of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill he join us when the time comes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, he dies,\u201d Raphael said without pause. \u201cThere is no room for sentimentality or friendship in the coming battle. He\u2019s either with us, or I\u2019ll kill him myself and find someone who is.\u201d</p><p>And then, Raphael tightened his arm around her, and together they returned to their friends and allies, the ones who would stand with them until the end. </p> </body></html>"]
