Across the street was her husband\u2019s\u2014one of them\u2014office. Seth was sheriff of the small town.</p><p>She\u2019d parked around back because sooner or later, Dillon, another of her husbands, would drive through on his way to his pub, and he\u2019d most certainly see her SUV in front of the doctor\u2019s office, which would cause him to barge in, demanding to know if everything was all right.</p><p>Michael, the middle Colter brother and the third man she called husband, was safely ensconced in his own veterinary office outside of town, so she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about running into him. Hopefully.</p> <p>Her stomach simply wouldn\u2019t settle and she didn\u2019t know if it was because of nerves or because\u2014</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think of that yet. She closed her eyes and squeezed her fingers into tight balls in her lap. It did no good to borrow trouble. Her mother-in-law, Holly Colter, would be the first to tell her that.</p><p>It could be some weird stomach bug. Hadn\u2019t there been something going around Clyde in the last week? But her issues had presented themselves long before last week and she knew it.</p><p>She was unbelievably tired, she was sick over the most ordinary smells, and her breasts were so tender that the slightest pressure made her wince.</p><p>The night before when her husbands had made love to her, it had been all she could do not to cry out\u2014in pain\u2014when they lavished gentle attention on her breasts, and she knew then that she had to confront her denial and see the doctor.</p> <p>\u201cLily Colter.\u201d</p><p>Lily looked up to see the nurse standing in the doorway smiling at her. Slowly, Lily pushed herself from the chair and trudged across the room.</p><p>The nurse was bright and bubbly, but then Tina always was. If she noticed that Lily wasn\u2019t quite herself, she refrained from prying too much.</p><p>When, however, she began to take Lily\u2019s vitals and ask routine care questions about the reason for her visit, Lily murmured, \u201cI\u2019ll discuss it with Dr. Burton.\u201d</p><p>Tina didn\u2019t pursue the matter. She quietly finished taking Lily\u2019s blood pressure and temperature, patted Lily reassuringly on the hand, and then promised that Dr. Burton would be along shortly.</p><p>Lily slumped against the chair and eyed the exam table nervously. She was scared, uncertain, and worried over what Dr. Burton would say\u2014what she was certain he would say.</p> <p>A moment later, a light knock sounded and the door pushed open. Dr. Burton stuck his head inside, smiled, and then ambled in.</p><p>He took a seat across from Lily at the small table and opened the laptop he used for patient notes and records. He met her gaze over the top of the computer and studied her. \u201cSo, what brings you in today, Lily?\u201d</p><p>If he noted the oddity of her not having at least one of her husbands or another family member present, he didn\u2019t say anything. But then there were some things, as she\u2019d learned, that she had to do alone.</p><p>This was one of them.</p><p>\u201cI think ...\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cI suspect ... I could be pregnant.\u201d</p><p>When she reopened her eyes, Dr. Burton\u2019s were soft with understanding. But instead of saying anything, offering sympathy or reassurance, he merely nodded and then said, \u201cWell, it seems to me the first thing we ought to do before we go any further is do a pregnancy test. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHave you performed an over-the-counter test? Those things are pretty accurate.\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cI came here first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it won\u2019t take but a moment. I\u2019ll get Tina back in here. She\u2019ll have you give her a urine specimen. If it turns out you\u2019re pregnant, then we\u2019ll go from there. No sense getting all het up for nothing, right?\u201d</p><p>She took in a shaky breath. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>He patted her on the hand and then rose. He leaned out the door and bellowed down the hall for Tina. A moment later, Tina returned, rolling her eyes at the elderly doctor.</p><p>She showed Lily into the bathroom and gave her the instructions, which Lily didn\u2019t really need, but she stared blankly and nodded as if she had no clue what was expected of her.</p><p>Maybe she should have just done one of those stick pregnancy things. At least then she would be home, alone, and not in front of someone else when she received the shock of her life.</p><p>A few moments later, she exited the bathroom and returned to her tiny exam room to wait. And wait. Each minute that ticked by seemed like an eternity. She kept eyeing her phone nervously, knowing that eventually someone would figure out she wasn\u2019t at home and would want to know what she was up to. And she hated lying. But what was she supposed to say? If she said she was at the doctor\u2019s, she\u2019d have no fewer than three people in the waiting room for her when she got out. If she lied and then someone saw her and casually mentioned her whereabouts, it would be even messier.</p><p>She sighed, leaned her head down onto the table, and closed her eyes.</p><p>Breathe. Just breathe, Lily. They promised it would be different. They swore what happened with Rose wouldn\u2019t happen again.</p><p>Tears gathered, stinging her eyes and drawing up her nose. She\u2019d gained so much strength during the last two years. Strength she hadn\u2019t imagined she possessed. A newfound happiness and independence she would have thought beyond her reach.</p><p>But this ... This had the power to destroy her all over again.</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>She yanked her head up to meet Dr. Burton\u2019s gaze. She stared hard, trying to see something. Some sign.</p><p>He came in and sat across from her, his expression still unreadable. Some of the tension started to unknot in her stomach until he reached over to slide his wrinkled hand over hers. He squeezed and her world tilted sideways.</p><p>\u201cLily, my dear, you are indeed pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Even though she\u2019d known, she\u2019d suspected, the news still came like ice-cold water thrown over her head. Her mouth opened in automatic denial, but she clamped her lips shut and dug her teeth into the bottom one to prevent the sound of dismay from escaping.</p><p>Dr. Burton\u2019s eyes softened in sympathy. \u201cI know the news isn\u2019t ideal and probably not what you wanted to hear. But is it so bad?\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyes watered. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I was so careful. I took all my pills.\u201d Her cheeks colored at the next admission, but he was her doctor and they\u2019d certainly been down this road before. \u201cWe don\u2019t use condoms anymore. Maybe I should have insisted we continue. I know they would have done anything for me. But I\u2019d hoped after I started on birth control that we wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d</p><p>The doctor squeezed her hand again. \u201cBirth control isn\u2019t one hundred percent effective. It\u2019s close, but you\u2019d be surprised at how many \u2018oops\u2019 babies I\u2019ve delivered over the years. Sometimes these things just happen, and I\u2019m always convinced that if God intends it, then he finds a way for it to happen. Maybe this baby was just meant to be.\u201d</p><p>And Rose wasn\u2019t?</p><p>She wanted to scream it. Why was this baby more deserving of a chance than her sweet, darling daughter had been?</p><p>She pushed her knuckles to her mouth and rocked back and forth, desperately trying to maintain control and hold back her grief before it exploded out of her.</p><p>Dr. Burton sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going to write a script for some vitamins, and I want you to start taking them. You\u2019ll also need to make another appointment on your way out. I want to draw some blood before you leave just so we can take a look at things. My suggestion is to take a few days and think this over. Don\u2019t react in the moment. Give it some time to settle in and then you might see that it\u2019s not such a bad thing after all. You know those boys will be all over you, and their parents won\u2019t be any different. You\u2019ll have help, Lily. You won\u2019t face this alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she murmured. She even tried to return his reassuring smile, but she failed miserably.</p><p>The rest of the visit was a blur. Tina came in and drew several vials of blood before handing her a prescription along with some samples of prenatal vitamins that she wanted Lily to start on right away.</p><p>\u201cAnd if you\u2019re still taking your birth control pills, you need to discontinue those immediately,\u201d Tina said.</p><p>Lily nodded numbly, only wanting to get out so she could breathe again.</p><p>A few moments later she stumbled out of the doorway into the brisk, cold morning. Her breath escaped in a visible puff and she stood there a long moment, gulping in the chilly air.</p><p>Then, realizing she was standing on the sidewalk for anyone to see, she hurried around the corner of the building to the small parking lot in the back where she\u2019d parked her SUV.</p><p>After she climbed in, she started the engine but didn\u2019t turn on the heat. Her fingers curled around the steering wheel, and for the longest time she simply stared forward out of the windshield. Then she lowered her forehead to the steering wheel as hot tears rolled down her cheeks.</p><p>CHAPTER 2</p><p>CALLIE Wilder trudged into her house, dropped her purse onto the floor, and promptly flopped onto the couch. Face-first. She groaned once but couldn\u2019t summon the energy to adjust her position. She was so tired, and she felt like complete and utter crap.</p><p>She wished Max were here. She missed him dreadfully. Especially now that she\u2019d come down with the creeping crud, and all she really wanted to do was curl into his arms and sleep for about a week.</p><p>He didn\u2019t often go anywhere without her. One of the benefits of being married to a man who had a Midas touch when it came to business and investments was that she could often indulge in one of her greatest passions. Traveling. And Max was every bit as much of a free spirit as Callie was herself. It was how they met. Only Callie had been backpacking through Europe and Max ... Well, he had much more luxurious accomodations than she\u2019d had. But that had all changed soon enough.</p><p>From the moment they\u2019d met, there was an undeniable spark between them. She\u2019d been drawn to him, found him irresistible. He\u2019d taken over, lavished luxury on her, and she\u2019d spent every available moment with him in his hotel suite.</p><p>The only problem was that their meeting hadn\u2019t been accidental at all. Max had targeted her and purposely seduced her. All over a piece of land that he considered his legacy.</p><p>Just remembering had the power to send shadows through her mind. She hated that the way they met and the wonderful month they\u2019d spent together was forever tainted because it hadn\u2019t been real, even though Max swore he\u2019d fallen hard for her from the start.</p><p>He\u2019d come for her, all the way to Clyde where she\u2019d sought refuge in the bosom of her loving family. Thus had begun the long, rocky climb to where they were today. Happily married. Forgiveness given. It hadn\u2019t been easy, but looking back, Callie knew she didn\u2019t regret a single moment because everything that had happened had brought her to where she was today. Stronger. Loved.</p><p>Happy.</p><p>No, he didn\u2019t often go anywhere without her at all, but his sister had called, and Max had left suddenly, worried and quiet. The worry aspect didn\u2019t bother Callie so much. Max was a born worrier when it came to the people he loved. But the quiet part was what bugged her. He hadn\u2019t said a word. He\u2019d simply told her he had to go and then left.</p><p>That had been two days ago. He\u2019d called but he hadn\u2019t volunteered what the issue was and she hadn\u2019t pushed. She\u2019d find out when he returned even if she had to drag it out of him.</p><p>He was getting better about not being so closemouthed about personal stuff, but he was still a clam. Callie was working on him.</p><p>Her cell phone rang, and she groaned again because she didn\u2019t want to move in order to answer it. But it was one of her brothers calling\u2014they all had the same ringtone\u2014and if she didn\u2019t answer, they\u2019d only worry and come out to check on her.</p><p>She fumbled with her pocket and finally dug the phone out, putting it to her ear while she still lay facedown.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Lo,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cHow are you, baby girl?\u201d</p><p>Dillon. Just hearing his voice sent warmth through her chilled veins. Of all her brothers\u2014and she loved them all dearly\u2014she and Dillon were most alike. The rebels or free spirits of the bunch. She\u2019d always shared a closeness with Seth, a bond that she treasured, but she and Dillon had been cut from the same mold.</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d she said, not even bothering to lie and say fine. If it had been Michael or Seth, she could have gotten away with the lie, but Dillon had tossed her out of the bar bright and early, and he knew she didn\u2019t look good.</p><p>She could hear him frowning through the phone.</p><p>\u201cI think you should come over here until Max gets back. Let Lily fuss over you. Or if you won\u2019t come here, at least go over to Mom\u2019s so she can baby you.\u201d</p><p>As tempting as the suggestion was, she was simply too exhausted to move. Going anywhere would require far more energy than she possessed. She wanted Max and Max wasn\u2019t here.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she croaked out. \u201cJust tired.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Dillon snorted. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about coming back to the bar. You\u2019re done. I\u2019ll throw your scrawny ass out of here if you show your face.\u201d</p><p>Callie sighed, not that she\u2019d argue. She only worked in Dillon\u2019s bar when Max was gone, which wasn\u2019t often. It gave her something to do to pass the time. She knew Max wasn\u2019t particularly fond of her working in the bar, but he didn\u2019t say anything, which likely killed him.</p><p>She and Max ... Well, they shared a different type of relationship. Which when she considered that her fathers and her brothers all had a very nontraditional relationship with their one wife, her and Max\u2019s situation wasn\u2019t that eyebrow raising.</p><p>Max was dominant. He expected\u2014demanded\u2014submission. Her submission. But he cherished it and her. But just because she willingly chose to submit to him, he never attempted to curb her free spirit. He loved it too much. He often told her that caging someone such as her was to squash everything that made her the woman he loved.</p> <p>He was dominant, yes, but he spoiled, pampered, and lavished her with so much love and understanding that she simply couldn\u2019t imagine her life any other way. His dominance settled her. Provided her a much-needed sanctuary and haven. She was safe with Max. And she was free to be herself because he loved everything she was.</p><p>\u201cGoing to bed now,\u201d she mumbled to Dillon. \u201cPromise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake care of yourself, Callie,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you too.\u201d</p><p>She ended the call and dropped her arm over the edge of the couch. The phone dangled from her fingertips before hitting the floor with a thud.</p> <p>It was cold. Her chill bumps even had chill bumps. But she was too miserable to get up and get something for the fever she was sure she had.</p><p>Going to her mom and dads\u2019 place sounded good, but it would require moving. She could call her mom to come over. If she hadn\u2019t dropped the phone already. Being babied by Holly Colter would make anyone feel better.</p><p>She tucked her hand back underneath her body and then turned to face the inside of the couch. She reached blindly for the blanket that lay over the back of the couch and pulled it down, drawing up her knees so she could huddle under it.</p><p>Oh bliss. She closed her eyes and immediately drifted off.</p><p>MAX Wilder pulled into his drive and turned off the windshield wipers. The snow was coming down harder, adding to the few inches already accumulated on the ground.</p><p>He got out, eager to see Callie again. He didn\u2019t spend much time apart from her, but when Lauren had called, and he\u2019d heard the quiet desperation in her voice, his single-minded goal had been to get to her as fast as possible. In retrospect, he should have taken Callie. It would have been good for Lauren to have Callie there. He hadn\u2019t thought. He\u2019d simply reacted and had done as he\u2019d always done. Gone immediately to protect his family.</p> <p>Only now his family went beyond Lauren. Their mother had passed just a few years earlier, leaving Max and Lauren alone. He\u2019d always been fiercely protective of both his mom and his sister, and he\u2019d been used to being a lone wolf. He was the protector. The provider. He didn\u2019t depend on other people. His sister depended on him.</p><p>Now he had Callie. And he had the Colters. All of them. It was something he was still getting accustomed to. This whole idea of having a large, extended family. Not just any family, but one that was closely knit and fiercely loyal and would do anything, go to any lengths to protect their own. And he and Lauren were a part of that now.</p><p>As he mounted the front steps, he frowned. Usually Callie was at the door to meet him, even if he\u2019d just taken a short trip into town for groceries. He\u2019d grown accustomed to her enthusiastic greetings, and he loved the way she lit up when she saw him again.</p><p>He let himself in and opened his mouth to call out to her when he saw her on the couch in the living room. He smiled and put his suitcase down. On quiet feet, he walked to the sofa to stare down at her, curled into a ball, sound asleep.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t like her to sleep in, but if he had to guess, she\u2019d worked the night before in her brother\u2019s bar. He wasn\u2019t crazy about her doing it, but he didn\u2019t say anything about it. Plus she only did so on the rare occasions when he was out of town and she stayed home.</p><p>He leaned down to kiss her temple but as soon as his lips touched her skin, he frowned and drew away. He put his hand to her forehead, cursing softly when he felt the dry heat radiating from her flesh.</p><p>She was sick.</p><p>And he\u2019d left her alone.</p> <p>He knelt by the couch and gently shook her. \u201cCallie. Dolcezza, wake up.\u201d</p><p>She grumbled softly in her sleep, and when she opened her eyes, they were dull. Her cheeks were flushed with fever and she blinked several times as if she were unaware of her surroundings.</p><p>Worry ate at his gut. She was his. Completely and utterly his. To love, to protect, and he\u2019d left her alone because he\u2019d been gutted by his sister\u2019s plea for help. He should never have left Callie. She should have been with him every step of the way.</p><p>\u201cMax,\u201d she whispered. Then she smiled. A warm beautiful smile that made the very heart of him ache. \u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward to kiss her forehead. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you call me? I would have come home immediately. How long have you been sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust last night,\u201d she croaked. She broke off and rubbed her throat.</p><p>He frowned again because he didn\u2019t like to see her in discomfort. \u201cHurt?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI was okay when I went in. Really. But I started feeling bad not long into it. I didn\u2019t want to call Dillon. I thought I could make it. I crashed here as soon as I got home.\u201d</p><p>He stroked a hand over her forehead. \u201cWait here. I\u2019ll go get something for your fever.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her eyes already closing again.</p><p>He got up and hurried into the kitchen to the cabinet where they kept the medicine. He frowned as he stared at the acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Finally he grabbed the bottle of ibuprofen, filled a glass half full of water, and went back into the living room.</p><p>Callie was back into a tight ball, and he could see her shivering from across the room.</p><p>He set the glass on the coffee table and carefully pulled her up and into his arms. She promptly burrowed into his chest and sighed in contentment.</p><p>\u201cTake your medicine, dolcezza. It will make you feel better. After you\u2019ve swallowed your pills, I\u2019ll take you to bed. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be more comfortable out of these clothes.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head against his chest. \u201cWill you build a fire instead? Want to stay here and snuggle.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the top of her head. \u201cYou know I\u2019d do anything to make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you.\u201d</p><p>The soft words came out a little breathy, but they gave him the same thrill they always did. No matter how often she told him, he soaked the words in and held them close. She was everything to him. Her love was the most precious gift he\u2019d ever been given.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMissed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed you too, dolcezza. Now take your medicine so I can build a fire and make you more comfortable. Want your pj\u2019s or one of my shirts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, your shirt, please.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. It was a wonder he had any sort of a wardrobe left, because she routinely stole his shirts to sleep or lounge in. It gave him a ridiculous thrill to see his clothing on her. Just another stamp of his possession. Like the bands she wore on her wrists. She was his.</p><p>Oh, she had a wedding ring. A gorgeous princesscut diamond that had appalled her with how much it cost. But the platinum cuffs she wore around both wrists ... Those were more special than even the symbol she wore on her finger. They were what signified her bond to him. Her submission.</p><p>They were intricately designed, made especially for her, and he\u2019d had them engraved. On the outside of one, along the bottom, read two halves of a whole. And on the other was we are one. And on the inside of each in flowing script, Max and Callie.</p><p>He gently placed the pills on her tongue, then held up the glass so she could sip at the water. She winced and swallowed hard, putting her hand to her throat as the pills finally went down.</p><p>\u201cI should take you to the doctor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou might have strep throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m not better by tomorrow, I\u2019ll go. Promise. Going to the doctor means having to move, and right now I just want you to hold me.\u201d</p><p>He eased her back onto the couch, pressing another kiss to her temple. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Just need to get some wood to start the fire. I\u2019ll get one of my shirts and pillows and another blanket.\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes to stare up at him. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home.\u201d</p><p>His heart softened at the love in her eyes and voice. He touched her cheek and then hurried toward the door leading outside to the patio where he kept wood stacked.</p><p>A few minutes later, flames licked over the dry wood. He hurriedly collected the items from the bedroom and returned to Callie.</p><p>He sat her up and she leaned into him as he undressed her down to her socks. He left them on, not wanting her to get cold, and then pulled his shirt on her and buttoned it all the way to the top.</p><p>After kicking off his shoes, he settled onto the couch, propping pillows around her before pulling her against him.</p><p>She let out a sigh and snuggled deeply into his arms, burrowing until she was damn near underneath him.</p><p>\u201cI feel better already,\u201d she said against his chest.</p><p>He kissed her again, unable to stop himself from touching her. His arms were full of the woman he loved. He was home. There was no better feeling.</p><p>\u201cIs Lauren all right?\u201d</p><p>He blew out a long sigh and clutched her a little closer to ease the pain that had suddenly crept through his chest. \u201cNo. She\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>Callie tried to raise her head, but he pulled her down, holding her against him.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man she was with ...\u201d He couldn\u2019t even form the words. It made him angry to even think it. He closed his eyes and rested his cheek against the top of Callie\u2019s head. \u201cHe abused her.\u201d</p><p>Such a simple word that in no way conveyed what this man had done to his baby sister. He\u2019d savaged her. Broken her in body and spirit. Abused? No, the word simply didn\u2019t do justice to the damage he\u2019d inflicted.</p><p>\u201cOh, Max, I\u2019m so sorry. What happened? Where is she now? Why didn\u2019t you bring her back with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. She wouldn\u2019t come. She\u2019s ashamed. God, Callie, I can see it in her eyes. She can barely even look me in the face. She called me only because it had gotten bad, and she was afraid he\u2019d kill her. She was hiding at a friend\u2019s house, terrified that at any moment the bastard would find her.\u201d</p><p>This time Callie did sit up and fire was in her eyes. \u201cMax, she has to come here. She shouldn\u2019t be alone now!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo of course not,\u201d he soothed. \u201cI\u2019d never leave her alone and unprotected. I\u2019ve taken care of it. And yes, I agree. She needs to be here. I don\u2019t plan to back off, but she\u2019s overwhelmed right now. I was ...\u201d He broke off and sighed. \u201cI was afraid to push her too hard. She seems so fragile and so near her breaking point. I moved her into an apartment. I\u2019ve hired someone to shadow her at all times. I also reported the asshole who abused her to the police. There\u2019s a warrant out for his arrest right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did he do to her?\u201d Callie asked, tears brimming in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe beat the hell out of her,\u201d Max said, bleakness nearly overwhelming him.. \u201cShe says he didn\u2019t rape her, but I\u2019m not sure I believe that. I\u2019m so angry. And I feel helpless. She was ashamed to call me and wouldn\u2019t have if it hadn\u2019t been a last resort.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be safe here,\u201d Callie vowed.</p><p>Max nodded. \u201cI want her here by Christmas. I\u2019m giving her space and time for the bruises to fade. She didn\u2019t want anyone to see her as she is now. It\u2019s frustrating because I don\u2019t care. I just want her here, with me, where I know she\u2019s safe and taken care of. But she refused to even consider coming right now, and as I said, I was afraid to push too hard. I have a cop friend who\u2019s going to check in on her as well, and he\u2019ll also keep me posted when they find that little bastard.\u201d</p><p>Callie hugged him tightly and he shook his head at the idea that as sick as she was, she was offering him comfort. He kissed her again and hugged her back, letting her sweetness wash over him.</p><p>\u201cI should have seen it.\u201d He let some of the pent-up despair that had lived with him for the last few days ease from his chest. Grief was thick in his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve always checked up on her boyfriends in the past. But this time I let it go. I told myself she wasn\u2019t a baby anymore. That I should trust her judgment.\u201d</p><p>Callie reached up and cupped his face. She looked at him with such love and tenderness that, again, he was shamed by the thought that he should be doing all he could to offer her comfort. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat could you have done?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t live her life for her, Max. She has to make her own choices. How could you have known? Men who abuse women don\u2019t wear a sign. A lot of the time they\u2019re outwardly charming. Nice guys. No one would ever guess what they do behind closed doors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just makes me sick to see her the way she is now. She\u2019s so sweet. Sees the best in everyone. And now she\u2019s full of shame for something that was done to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll get it back. She\u2019ll come here. We\u2019ll surround her with love and support and she\u2019ll get her confidence back. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve ever heard the details of how my mom met my dads, but she was abused by her first husband. She knows what it\u2019s like. She\u2019ll take Lauren in and mother her senseless, and my dads will kick the ass of anyone who comes near her.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled. \u201cShe loves your family. I think she\u2019s awed by them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou have to go get her, Max,\u201d Callie urged. \u201cSoon.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to him and stroked his hand down her back. \u201cI will, dolcezza. I will. But first, I\u2019m going to get you well again. I\u2019m not leaving you when you\u2019re so sick.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 3</p><p>WARM lips nuzzled her neck, sending chill bumps dancing down her spine. Holly Colter smiled and turned into her husband\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Adam murmured just before he captured her lips in a long, tender kiss.</p> <p>She sighed because this never got old. It was the way he\u2019d greeted her every morning for more than thirty years. She returned his kiss hungrily even as she melted more firmly into his strong embrace.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled away and smiled. \u201cLove you too, baby.\u201d</p><p>They both turned when they heard the back door into the kitchen open. Ethan and Ryan came in, stomping snow from their boots. Her heart melted as their gazes found hers, as if they\u2019d looked immediately for her.</p><p>\u201cIs it still snowing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cNot too bad. Just steady. Supposed to quit by this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>She broke away from Adam and closed the distance between them. Ryan caught her first, pulling her into his arms. His face was cold, his lips colder, but as soon as their mouths met, heat surged through her veins.</p><p>He slipped his hand into her hair and curled his fingers around the strands, holding her in place as he devoured her lips.</p><p>As soon as he relinquished his hold on her, Ethan tugged her toward him. He kissed her but dropped his mouth down to nuzzle at her neck.</p><p>\u201cAre the roads clear?\u201d she asked as Ethan tucked her into his side.</p><p>Adam frowned. \u201cI think so. Why do you ask?\u201d</p><p>Holly rolled her eyes because she knew what was coming. But she barged ahead anyway. Her men hadn\u2019t changed one iota over the years. She didn\u2019t love them any less but it didn\u2019t mean she paid them any mind when they started in with their worrying.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to see Lily. Thought I\u2019d call Callie and see if she wanted to ride over with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMax is back,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI saw his SUV before we came in. Doubt we\u2019ll see Callie for at least a day.\u201d</p> <p>Holly chuckled softly. She was glad Max was back home. Callie had missed him fiercely. She was always glad when her family was where they belonged. Home. On their mountain. Right where she could see them and talk to them anytime she wanted.</p><p>\u201cGuess I\u2019ll be going to Lily\u2019s by myself then.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s frown grew bigger and he shook his head. \u201cYou know one of us will drive you over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot necessary,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cLily and I have women stuff to do and you\u2019ll just get in the way.\u201d</p><p>Ryan scowled but he didn\u2019t argue.</p><p>\u201cTake the SUV and make sure it\u2019s in four-wheel drive,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Holly sighed. \u201cAt what point will I be able to get into a vehicle to drive myself into town without the three of you worrying?\u201d</p><p>Adam sent her a quelling stare. \u201cTry never? We\u2019ll always worry when you aren\u2019t with us, baby. That ain\u2019t going to change. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re taking a drive down some city street or the interstate. The drive down the mountain is dangerous even in great weather. It\u2019s snowing and the roads are wet and messy.\u201d</p><p>She broke from Ethan, went over to Adam, and stood up on tiptoe to brush her lips over his. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Do any of you need anything from town?\u201d</p><p>They all shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cCall one of us when you get there,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>She sent him an exasperated look.</p><p>\u201cJust do it,\u201d Ryan growled.</p><p>She left the room, grumbling under her breath, but as soon as she was away, she broke into a huge smile. Her heart felt as light as it had so many years ago. The love of her husbands was constant. It was true. It was her shelter.</p><p>LILY drove aimlessly, her direction unclear. The wipers moved across her windshield, melting the spiraling snowflakes in a wet path across the glass.</p><p>Instinctively she turned toward home and the road at the edge of town that led upward to the cabin where she lived with Seth, Michael, and Dillon.</p><p>When she pulled into the drive, she parked and sat for a long moment before opening the door. A whoosh of cold air skittered over her. She shivered but plunged out into the chill, needing something to center her.</p><p>She dragged her sweater around her and trudged through the snow toward the back of the house where her husbands had built a private memorial to Rose. It had been a gift to her, a place where she could go and be at peace, surrounded by the mountains and the quiet.</p><p>The rose of Sharon vine that covered a trellis framing a spectacular vista was brown and withered, the burst of color long gone since winter had descended on the mountains.</p><p>She perched on the edge of a wooden bench that Dillon had crafted with his own hands. Intricately carved on the seat was a flowering vine mirroring the one on the trellis. Roses for Rose.</p><p>Tears crowded her vision as she looked up. She inhaled deeply, taking in the cold, crisp air. Snowflakes landed on her lashes and she blinked them, and her tears, away.</p><p>But they continued, warm trails down her cheeks, quickly turning to ice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHelp me.\u201d</p><p>Her chest swelled with grief and sadness. And fear. So much fear that it threatened to overwhelm her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this. I know I was angry with you for taking her from me. I don\u2019t deserve your mercy or understanding, but I need your help.\u201d</p><p>She wiped ineffectually at the tears that ran in streams down her cheeks. Emotion knotted thick in her throat until breathing was nearly impossible.</p><p>Losing Rose had nearly destroyed her. She would still be so very lost if it weren\u2019t for Seth and his brothers. Seth had taken a young woman from the streets and given her so much love. A family. To her bewilderment, his two brothers had loved her as much as Seth had. There were times she still couldn\u2019t wrap her mind around the dynamics of her relationship with the Colter brothers, but she gave thanks for them every single day.</p><p>They\u2019d saved her. Given her a reason to live again. They\u2019d given back to her when everything in the world had been cruelly yanked from her.</p><p>They\u2019d given her the strength to confront her past. To go to Charles, her former husband, stand up for herself, and tell him he\u2019d been wrong to blame her for their baby daughter\u2019s death.</p><p>But nothing could give her back her baby.</p><p>And now she was pregnant. Another child. A precious gift.</p><p>What if she lost it as well?</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t trust her husbands. They\u2019d promised her that if and when she was ready to ever have another child, they\u2019d be with her every step of the way and she\u2019d never have to shoulder the burden alone.</p><p>But what if it happened anyway?</p><p>Sudden infant death syndrome.</p><p>Just thinking the words paralyzed her.</p><p>How would she be able to sleep for fear of having her baby snatched away in the space of a stolen moment of rest?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she whispered again.</p><p>She closed her eyes and bowed her head, whispering the first tentative words of a prayer she\u2019d gone long without saying.</p><p>Warmth slid over her as the sun peeked from the thick cover of puffy gray clouds. She opened her eyes and lifted her head as a single ray slipped over her, warming her skin, a barrier to the cold.</p><p>The wind picked up and the trees rustled and swayed. The scent of pine was strong and the breeze dried the wetness on her cheeks.</p><p>It will be all right.</p><p>She imagined the nearly silent whisper that sounded as if it was carried through the trees from the valley. But it comforted her, still.</p><p>She hunched forward and carefully put a hand over her still-flat abdomen.</p><p>A life.</p><p>A tiny, defenseless life lay nestled there underneath her fingers. Already precious. And loved. Loved so very much.</p><p>She hugged herself and rocked back and forth, willing the fear to dissipate. She was strong. So much stronger than before.</p><p>But no matter how strong she was now, she wouldn\u2019t survive another loss.</p><p>The peal of her cell phone disturbed the peaceful solitude. She jumped and then reached into her pocket for the phone. It was her mother-in-law\u2019s ringtone and Lily\u2019s pulse ratcheted up.</p><p>Someone had probably seen her at the doctor\u2019s, and Holly was likely calling to see if everything was okay. Lily wasn\u2019t ready to divulge such unsettling news. She needed time to come to terms with her pregnancy before she blurted it out to her family.</p><p>Family.</p><p>She closed her eyes, wrapping herself in the comfort and knowledge that she had the best family in the entire world. They loved her and she loved them dearly.</p><p>With shaking fingers, she hit the button to receive the call and put the phone to her ear.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily, dear, it\u2019s Holly. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cF-fine. I\u2019m fine. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on my way over, actually. I hope you\u2019re home! I didn\u2019t even think to call before I left. You know how I am. Once I get an idea in my head, I act. And to be honest, I was more focused on being able to get past the husbands without the third degree. You know how they are about me driving myself into town.\u201d</p><p>Lily smiled, picturing Holly rolling her eyes as she always did when she talked about the three older Colter men.</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good,\u201d Holly breathed. \u201cI have a huge favor to ask.\u201d</p><p>Lily let a sigh of relief. Her mother-in-law wasn\u2019t calling because she knew Lily had been to the doctor.</p><p>She stood rapidly, still holding the phone as she headed toward the back door. It wouldn\u2019t do for Holly to see the mess Lily was in. She\u2019d latch on and there\u2019d be no avoiding the issue.</p><p>She wiped frantically at her face even as she murmured a good-bye to Holly. She tossed the phone onto the counter and then headed into the bathroom.</p><p>She had about fifteen minutes to make it look like her world hadn\u2019t just been tilted on its axis.</p><p>CHAPTER 4</p><p>LILY smiled broadly at herself in the mirror. She grimaced and then let her lips fall. The smile looked exactly the way it felt\u2014fake and forced. When the doorbell rang, she sighed and turned away.</p><p>Makeup did wonders, though Lily didn\u2019t normally wear much\u2014and she didn\u2019t have much on now. Just enough to disguise the signs of grief that had ravaged her face earlier.</p><p>She hurried to the door, putting on a genuine, warm smile before opening it.</p><p>Holly bustled in from the cold, immediately pulling Lily into a huge hug. Holly wasn\u2019t a large woman by any stretch, but she hugged like a bear. Lily felt it to her soul and closed her eyes as her mother-in-law soothed and patted and made Lily feel like she was bathed in sunshine.</p><p>\u201cAre none of those boys of mine home today?\u201d Holly asked when she finally released Lily.</p><p>Lily shut the door, took Holly\u2019s coat, and shook her head. \u201cDillon went in early because Callie was working the bar last night. He never likes it when she does and neither does Max. Max called, wanting him to at least make sure she didn\u2019t sleep on the couch in the office, so I\u2019m sure he went in and made her go home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Holly said. \u201cWell, Max is home so he\u2019ll take care of that, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad they\u2019ll be here this Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s entire face lit up. \u201cOh yes, me too. My whole family here for Christmas. I\u2019m so excited, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d</p><p>As they entered the living room, Lily paused and turned to see Holly staring intently at her.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, Lily? You look a little pale.\u201d</p><p>Lily swallowed and forced a brighter smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned but didn\u2019t pursue the matter, and now Lily worried that she\u2019d mention her concerns to her sons. Impulsively, she reached for Holly\u2019s hand and squeezed, feeling better for the contact.</p><p>\u201cHolly, I\u2019m fine. Now tell me what favor you need. You know I\u2019d do anything for you.\u201d</p><p>Her mother-in-law turned, took both of Lily\u2019s hands in hers, her eyes dancing with excitement. \u201cI want you to teach me how to cook.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lily\u2019s mouth dropped open. Of all the things that Holly could have said, this was the farthest thing from Lily\u2019s mind. She stared at Holly for several long seconds before she finally found her tongue.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth for?\u201d</p><p>Holly sighed, let go of Lily\u2019s hands, and then settled on the couch. Lily took a seat next to her, tucking one leg underneath her and rotating so they faced each other.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a running family joke for years that I can\u2019t cook and that my husbands have always provided the meals for our family\u2014which is totally true, mind you. It\u2019s never bothered me, but this year ... This Christmas I\u2019d like to put the food on the table for my family and know that I made it. I want this year to be special. So much has changed in our family in a short amount of time, and for the first time in a long time we\u2019re all going to be together. Last year, Max and Callie spent Christmas overseas. But this year all my babies will be at home where they belong.\u201d</p> <p>Lily leaned over to put her arm around Holly. She squeezed and then smiled. \u201cOf course I\u2019ll help. When I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll be able to prepare the best holiday meal the Colters have ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>Holly beamed and then threw her arms around Lily, hugging her tight. \u201cI knew I could count on you. Now, where do we start?\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s bright enthusiasm was a balm to Lily\u2019s soul. Some of her fear and melancholy lifted away as she focused on a way to make her mother-in-law happy.</p><p>\u201cWell, it depends on what you\u2019d like to serve. Are we going traditional with a bird, dressing, and the fixings? Or do you want to go for wow factor?\u201d</p><p>Holly pulled away, a pensive frown on her face. \u201cI kind of like wow, but maybe that\u2019s too much to expect in such a short amount of time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. What if we did something creole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yum. There\u2019s a Cajun restaurant in Denver that I love. The husbands take me there when we\u2019re in the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, okay. How does a pan-seared catfish fillet covered with crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e sound?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike my mouth is watering!\u201d</p><p>Lily grinned. Holly\u2019s excitement was infectious. \u201cFor starters, we could do a lobster bisque and crawfish-stuffed shrimp. I have an awesome recipe for homemade rolls that won\u2019t take any time in the bread machine. Then we\u2019ll have the fish and \u00e9touff\u00e9e as the main course. For dessert, I\u2019m thinking caramel Heath bar pie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas anyone ever told you what a culinary genius you are? Dillon has always been the master chef in the family but you, my dear, he can\u2019t hold a candle to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I love it when you stroke my ego. I\u2019ll love getting to take credit for getting Mama Colter to create a perfect meal. Dillon will be bitter forever. He keeps swearing he\u2019s going to get you into the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Holly snorted. \u201cDillon and I would never make it together. I\u2019d murder my own child before it was over with.\u201d</p><p>Lily rose. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s go shopping. We have groceries to buy and a kitchen to mess up. We\u2019re on a tight timeline here. We only have until the guys get home from work, and if they catch us in the kitchen or see the kitchen in a mess, they\u2019ll want to know what on earth we\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>Holly shot to her feet, an excited smile lighting up her face. \u201cThank you, Lily. I can\u2019t wait!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to find a way to get over here every day until we get this right,\u201d Lily cautioned. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to think of something to say to the dads so they don\u2019t get suspicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll handle them,\u201d Holly said airily, mischief sparkling in her eyes. \u201cTomorrow is Saturday so I\u2019ll come over in the morning and make the boys go over to their fathers\u2019.\u201d</p><p>CALLIE stirred, tried to swallow, and grimaced. She opened her eyes to see Max staring intently down at her, his lips set in a fine line.</p><p>\u201cYour throat hurting worse?\u201d</p> <p>She nodded. \u201cNeed something to drink.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, holding her tightly so she didn\u2019t slide from his lap, and retrieved the glass of water sitting on the coffee table.</p><p>She drank greedily, trying not to flinch at the discomfort it caused her throat. Her fever had broken and she was damp with sweat. Where before she\u2019d been freezing and sure she\u2019d never get warm again, now she was hot, aching, and twitchy all over.</p><p>When she was done drinking, she lay limply on Max\u2019s chest, her eyes closed in exhaustion. It was ridiculous really. There was no reason for her to feel so weak, but she couldn\u2019t do battle with a kitten at the moment.</p><p>The doorbell rang and she groaned, but Max simply lifted her to the side and settled her among the pillows. As if he was expecting someone. She glanced up, her suspicions confirmed when Max opened the door and Dr. Burton came in, shaking snow from his hat before Max took it and his coat from him.</p><p>She huffed in exasperation as Max and the doctor returned to the couch. \u201cMax, really. This was so unnecessary. I can\u2019t believe you made Dr. Burton come all this way. What about his patients?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are my patient, missy,\u201d Dr. Burton said in reprimand. \u201cYou should have come to see me first thing this morning instead of crawling home to suffer alone.\u201d</p><p>Callie allowed him to poke and prod at her. He looked at her throat, made several noncommittal noises, and then took out his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cLooks like strep to me. Of course, I can\u2019t do a test here, but that throat looks bad and, regardless, you need an antibiotic, so we\u2019re going on the assumption you have strep. Start the antibiotics immediately and by tomorrow afternoon you should start feeling better.\u201d</p><p>While Dr. Burton phoned in the prescriptions, Max left the room for a moment. Callie snuggled back into the pillows, already feeling the chill returning. A few minutes later, Max came back and spoke to Dr. Burton briefly before showing the other man out.</p><p>The next thing Callie knew, Max was back, holding more ibuprofen in his hand.</p><p>\u201cTake these, dolcezza. Your fever is returning.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed them down and then sighed in contentment when he sat beside her and pulled her back into his arms.</p><p>Then she frowned. \u201cHow am I supposed to get the antibiotics?\u201d Obviously Max would have to go into town to get the prescription filled, but the selfish part of her whined at the idea of him leaving.</p><p>\u201cI called your mother. Well, actually I called your dads first and they said your mom was in town with Lily, so I then called your mom and asked her to pick up your medicine on her way back. She\u2019ll be by in a little while to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s awesome,\u201d Callie croaked out.</p><p>Max smiled tenderly down at her. \u201cMoms are the very best when you\u2019re sick.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t so absorbed in her own misery that she\u2019d forgotten Lauren. She\u2019d thought of her all afternoon. Lauren was sweet and shy, so different from Max\u2019s dominating personality. It sickened Callie that Lauren had been abused by some asshole she\u2019d trusted.</p><p>\u201cMax?\u201d</p><p>He swept his hand over her hair, smoothing it from her forehead so he could see her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI know you wanted to give Lauren time, but I really think we should go get her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sick, Callie. I don\u2019t think you should be going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard the doctor. If I start on antibiotics today, by tomorrow afternoon I\u2019ll be feeling better. We could leave for Denver in the morning, take an afternoon flight, and be in New York by tomorrow night. We could be back home with Lauren by the day after tomorrow, and you and I would both feel better.\u201d</p><p>Max sighed and she knew he was close to caving. His thoughts had been consumed with his sister. Callie knew it, and that he was deeply worried. He was torn between the thought that Callie needed him here and that his sister was wounded, frightened, and alone.</p><p>Callie sat up and touched Max\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Max. Lauren is more important than some stupid bug I\u2019ve caught. I know I won\u2019t feel better until she\u2019s here with us where we both know she\u2019s safe, and if I\u2019m that adamant, I can\u2019t even imagine how you\u2019re feeling. I know you wanted to be gentle and considerate with her, but now isn\u2019t the time for that. I vote we go in and don\u2019t come back without her.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled then and pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love most about you, dolcezza. You\u2019re frighteningly fierce when you set your mind to something. You\u2019d make most men tremble in their boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Provided you start your antibiotics immediately and you don\u2019t worsen overnight. I\u2019ll arrange for my jet to arrive in Denver in the morning, refuel, and be on standby when we get to the airport in the afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re doing the right thing, Max. She needs to be surrounded by people who love her right now even if she thinks she wants to be alone.\u201d</p><p>He stroked his hand through her hair, idly fingering the strands. \u201cI just want my sister back. The woman I saw a few days ago isn\u2019t the sister I remember. She\u2019s changed so much just since I saw her last.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened in her hair and his expression grew darker. \u201cI hate that bastard for what he did. Not just for the physical damage he did, but because he crushed her spirit. She\u2019s a shadow of her former self, and I guess my fear is that she won\u2019t get that spirit back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will. She just needs time. My dads and brothers will baby her, as will you. She\u2019ll see that all men aren\u2019t bastards. In time she\u2019ll trust herself again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, of course. Now, for a time, let\u2019s focus on you. Are you hungry? Would you like some hot tea for your throat? Tell me what it is you want and I\u2019ll make it happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Max, you should know better than to give me that much leeway,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI mean every word. You\u2019re my life. Your happiness and well-being are everything to me. I don\u2019t like to see you not feeling well. Now, are you hungry?\u201d</p><p>They were interrupted by the peal of Max\u2019s cell phone. Unlike her, he didn\u2019t have a ringtone for everyone. It drove her crazy because she liked to know who was calling even before she looked at the display screen.</p><p>He put the phone to his ear. \u201cHello, Mrs. C.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled at the mention of her mother.</p><p>\u201cNo, actually we were just discussing whether she was hungry. Hang on. I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p><p>He put the phone to his shoulder and turned to Callie. \u201cYour mom wants to know if you\u2019d like some of Lily\u2019s chicken noodle soup.\u201d</p><p>Callie\u2019s mouth instantly watered. \u201cOh my God, yes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Max chuckled and picked the phone back up. \u201cThat\u2019s a yes. All right. Be careful and we\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d</p><p>He put the phone back down. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way. She\u2019s swinging by to pick up your medicine and then she\u2019ll be up.\u201d</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Holly breezed through the door without knocking and shooed Max back when he started to rise. She set the container of soup on the coffee table, then bent over to give Max a hug and a kiss.</p><p>She perched on the edge of the couch and enfolded Callie in her arms. \u201cSorry you\u2019re sick, baby. I brought your medicine and some of Lily\u2019s soup. You should be feeling better in no time with Max here to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled and snuggled into her mother\u2019s embrace. No matter how old she got, she\u2019d never be too old for her mother to baby. There just wasn\u2019t anything better than a mother\u2019s hug and unconditional love. She sighed and squeezed before finally relinquishing her grip on her mom.</p><p>Then she glanced back at Max, her gaze questioning. Slowly he nodded, understanding what she was asking.</p><p>\u201cMom, Max and I are going to New York tomorrow to bring Lauren home.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s brows came together. \u201cBut you\u2019re sick. Maybe Max should go. You could stay with me and your dads, or if you prefer, I\u2019ll come stay here with you.\u201d</p><p>Callie shook her head and then put her hand over her mother\u2019s. \u201cMom, she\u2019s been abused. The guy she was with ... He hurt her terribly. She didn\u2019t want to come back with Max, but I think if I go back with him, together we can convince her to return here. She needs to be surrounded by people who love her.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes were stricken, and then anger lit fire in their depths. Her fingers curled around Callie\u2019s hand and tightened. \u201cBring her home. We\u2019ll take care of her and we\u2019ll kick the ass of anyone who ever tries to hurt her again.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled and leaned forward to kiss his mother-in-law on the cheek. \u201cI can see now where Callie gets her ferocity. You, Mama Colter, are the best, and Lauren and I are lucky to have been swept into your fold.\u201d</p><p>Holly dug into the bag she\u2019d tossed down beside the soup and shook out one of the antibiotic pills. \u201cHere, baby. Take your medicine so you can get to feeling better. Now that everyone will be home, we\u2019ve got Christmas to hold, and we\u2019re going to make the most of it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>CHAPTER 5</p><p>SOMETHING was bothering Lily. Seth watched her from the doorway of her studio as she tugged at her bottom lip with her teeth. She dabbed paint with her brush, but he could see the distant look in her eyes that told him she wasn\u2019t really focusing on her painting.</p><p>She\u2019d been quiet and distracted for a few days now, and it was driving Seth\u2014and his brothers\u2014crazy.</p><p>Lily wasn\u2019t much of a complainer and she rarely bothered to volunteer information when something was wrong. Seth, Michael, and Dillon usually had to drag it out of her.</p> <p>They\u2019d actually been delighted once when they\u2019d managed to piss her off enough that she\u2019d lit into them with both barrels. His ears still stung from the dressing-down she\u2019d given them, but they\u2019d grinned the entire time she was doing it until she\u2019d realized they were smiling, and then she\u2019d given them bewildered looks and demanded to know what was so funny.</p><p>Seth had pulled her into his arms, peppered her beautiful face with kisses, and then explained to her that it was okay to unload on them. About anything at all. No matter how insignificant she thought it was. That was what they were here for. To be her rock. To protect her. To love her. Always.</p><p>He still marveled at the miracle she was. At how content he and his brothers were. She\u2019d given them so much and they were just as determined to give back to her.</p><p>Dillon appeared at the doorway and frowned when he saw Seth staring in at Lily. \u201cMom\u2019s here to see Lily and we\u2019ve been banished to go watch football with the dads. I smell a rat.\u201d</p><p>Seth stared pensively at Lily as she looked up when she heard them talking. A soft smile removed the consternation that had been evident moments before.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re staring.\u201d</p><p>Seth relaxed, unable to remain thoughtful when her smile tugged at his heartstrings. \u201cIs it a crime to stare at a beautiful woman?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head but her cheeks darkened with a hint of color. No matter how often they told her she was beautiful, that she was their world, she always got shy when they gave her compliments.</p><p>\u201cMom\u2019s here. She\u2019s kicking us out. Know anything about that?\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s eyebrow arched. \u201cWhat, she can\u2019t come to visit me without you getting suspicious?\u201d</p><p>Dillon snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t trust my mother when she\u2019s smiling that sweetly at me. She patted me on the cheek and called me her baby. I know she\u2019s up to something.\u201d</p> <p>Seth snorted at the image of their petite mother patting Mr. Badass on the cheek and cooing at him. \u201cMama\u2019s boy,\u201d he taunted.</p><p>Dillon flashed a grin. \u201cYeah, so? You\u2019re just mad because she loves me better.\u201d</p><p>Seth rolled his eyes and then Lily laughed. God, he loved that sound. She had the most beautiful laughter. It was a far cry from the sad-eyed woman he\u2019d first seen in the line at a soup kitchen for the homeless. She\u2019d been so somber and serious then. That she laughed and smiled so readily now made his chest tighten.</p><p>Lily got up and walked to him, sliding her arm around his waist even as he pulled her into his side. He kissed the mop of dark curls and rubbed his cheek over the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cCome on. We don\u2019t want to keep Mom waiting.\u201d</p><p>Lily slid her hand into Dillon\u2019s and tugged him along behind her and Seth as they made their way into the living room. They both were warm and vibrant against her. Strength. Comfort. Her entire world.</p><p>And there was Michael, sitting with his mom, but as soon as she and his brothers entered the room, his gaze found hers and was so full of love that her heart stuttered.</p><p>There was so much love in this family. That she\u2019d found a place here in their midst still boggled her mind.</p> <p>She belonged. This was hers. They belonged to her.</p><p>It would be all right. She just had to keep telling herself that.</p><p>\u201cLily!\u201d Holly exclaimed as she rose. \u201cI hope I didn\u2019t disturb your painting.\u201d</p><p>Lily accepted her mother-in-law\u2019s warm hug and returned the embrace with one of her own.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re never a bother. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Do you know if Callie is feeling better?\u201d</p><p>She marveled at just how innocent the exchange seemed. She could barely suppress her grin. So far, things had gone off without a hitch. It truly looked as though Holly had popped in for a visit and wanted to spend time with her daughter-in-law.</p><p>Holly\u2019s expression sobered for a moment. \u201cShe and Max are flying to New York this afternoon. They left for Denver this morning.\u201d</p><p>Dillon scowled. \u201cWhat the hell? She\u2019s sick. She doesn\u2019t need to be flying all over the damn country. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have let her work the bar while Max was gone. He hates it and so do I.\u201d</p><p>Holly sighed as Seth and Michael both gave frowns of disapproval as well.</p><p>\u201cIt was necessary. There are issues with Lauren. Max didn\u2019t want Callie to go either, but she insisted, and she was right to do so. Lauren needs them. She needs all of us right now.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s brow furrowed at the sorrow in Holly\u2019s voice. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s lips turned down. \u201cShe was abused by a man she trusted.\u201d</p><p>Lily\u2019s husbands\u2019 frowns turned to deep scowls. If there was one thing the Colter men held true to, it was that women were to be cherished above all things. It was a principle passed from fathers to sons and was evidenced in the way the Colter women were coddled, pampered, and protected.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Michael muttered.</p><p>It was common knowledge in the family that Holly had escaped an abusive husband many years earlier. It was what had brought her to the Colter men. They\u2019d nearly lost her to the bastard, and the subject of abuse was always bound to make any of the Colter men immediately snarly.</p><p>Holly stared at each of her boys in turn, love warming her eyes. \u201cShe\u2019ll need us all. We\u2019re her family now. All she has left is Max. Max said she\u2019s ashamed and doesn\u2019t want anyone to see her or know what\u2019s happened. I\u2019m counting on you boys to spoil her rotten and make her feel at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know we will, Mom,\u201d Dillon said, his face still dark with a frown. \u201cDamn it, but that sucks. She\u2019s a little bit of a thing.\u201d</p><p>Lily nodded her agreement, wincing at the image of some man knocking Lauren around. They\u2019d all met Lauren only once\u2014at Callie and Max\u2019s wedding\u2014and she\u2019d been a beautiful, shy young woman, so different from Max\u2019s overpowering presence and quiet confidence.</p><p>Michael\u2019s arm came around Lily, and he pulled her into his side. He squeezed almost as if he knew how much she needed his comfort and support. And oh God, she did. More than anything she needed to know that everything would be all right. That he and his brothers would be right here, with her. Always.</p><p>\u201cWhen will they be back?\u201d Seth asked quietly.</p><p>Holly shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. You know how your sister is when she sets her mind to something. She won\u2019t be coming home without Lauren and it won\u2019t matter what Lauren thinks she wants.\u201d</p><p>Michael chuckled. \u201cTakes after Dillon. Both stubborn hardheads.\u201d</p><p>Dillon curled his lip at his brother.</p><p>Holly rolled her eyes. \u201cOkay boys, time to clear out.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s eyes narrowed in suspicion. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>Holly lifted both eyebrows in mock dismay. \u201cWhat a thing to say to your mother! Go on now. All of you shoo. Your fathers are expecting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sad that even when I\u2019m thirty-three years old, my mother can still make me feel ten,\u201d Seth grumbled as he got his coat out of the closet.</p><p>He tossed jackets to Michael and Dillon, then headed back toward Lily.</p><p>Without a word, he hugged her up tight and squeezed until she was breathless. Then he kissed her, his hand lingering on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cBe back later, baby.\u201d</p><p>Lily kissed Dillon and Michael and watched as they shuffled out the door. Then she turned to her mother-in-law. \u201cReady to get to work?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 6</p><p>THIS is ridiculous,\u201d Max muttered as he drove down the interstate. \u201cI never should have let you talk me into this.\u201d</p><p>Callie huddled in the blanket Max had wrapped around her and adjusted the heater vent to hit her more squarely.</p><p>\u201cI just took some more ibuprofen. My fever will break soon,\u201d she said, trying to control her chattering teeth.</p><p>\u201cYou can barely talk,\u201d Max said. \u201cAnd your throat hurts. You have chills and fever and you have no business getting on a plane. I should check you into a hotel and have your dads or brothers come get you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare,\u201d Callie growled. \u201cI can lie down on your plane same as I can lie down at home in my bed. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference is you\u2019d have someone to fuss over you, you\u2019d have a more comfortable bed, and you wouldn\u2019t be out in the cold and snow.\u201d</p><p>She made a disgruntled sound and burrowed deeper into her blanket. \u201cLauren needs us both. I can use my sickness as a trump card. If she starts arguing, I\u2019ll feign weakness and be pitiful. Then she\u2019ll have to come so you can whisk me back home to my sickbed.\u201d</p><p>Max shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re diabolical.\u201d</p><p>She grinned around her quivering lips. \u201cYou love that about me.\u201d</p><p>He shot her an amused look. \u201cI love you more when that evil streak isn\u2019t aimed at me.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she stared at him, suddenly struck, as she was so often, by how much she adored this man. Was he perfect? Oh hell no. He\u2019d made his fair share of mistakes. But he\u2019d done everything in his power to make up for those mistakes. He showed her every day how much he loved and adored her. He took care of her. He showered her with affection. She was one spoiled woman and she loved every minute of it.</p><p>\u201cDo I even want to know what you\u2019re thinking?\u201d he asked with a resigned sigh.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>His eyes darkened and his fingers tightened around the wheel. \u201cI love you too, dolcezza. I give thanks every day that you are able to love me after all we\u2019ve been through.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and reached over to lace her fingers through his. He raised her hand to his mouth and pressed a kiss to her palm.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done. It does neither of us any good to dwell on the past. Not when our future is so very bright.\u201d</p><p>Max gripped her hand for a long moment and he swallowed almost as if he wanted to speak but couldn\u2019t. When he finally spoke, it was to change the subject entirely.</p><p>\u201cAre you comfortable? Perhaps you should sleep for a while. We still have an hour and a half until we get to the airport.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head back against the headrest and closed her eyes, willing to let him veer into neutral territory. She knew he still lost sleep when he remembered how close he\u2019d come to losing her. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. I feel like a wet noodle. I want to be rested for when we meet Lauren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleep then, love. I\u2019ll wake you when we get to the plane.\u201d</p><p>DESPITE her protests, Max carried her, wrapped in the blanket from his SUV, onto his jet. He made sure the pilot had warmed the interior and was ready to go the moment they arrived.</p><p>Within minutes they took off and Max didn\u2019t wait long to unbuckle her and pull her into his arms once more. He carried her back to the lounge area to a comfortable leather couch, and he settled onto it, holding her against his chest.</p><p>She dozed for most of the flight. Max woke her up once to give her more medicine when he noted that she was once again shivering and then she drifted back off, snuggled deeply into his embrace.</p><p>By the time they landed in New York, some of the bone-deep chill had worn off. Callie felt wrung out, but at least she wasn\u2019t so cold she couldn\u2019t function. What she needed most now was a bath to wash off all the sweat and the sticky sensation. But she didn\u2019t want to delay even a moment in going to get Lauren.</p><p>It amused Max that she insisted the pilot remain on standby. They wouldn\u2019t be more than a few hours\u2014over her dead body were they going to remain in a city with the asshole loose who\u2019d beaten Lauren.</p><p>Even sick, grumpy, having a sore throat, and feeling like complete crap, she was a woman on a mission.</p><p>Max whisked her into a waiting car and directed the driver to take them to the apartment where he\u2019d relocated Lauren.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure she\u2019s okay?\u201d Callie asked anxiously as she watched traffic drive through melting puddles of snow.</p><p>Max put his hand over hers. \u201cRelax, dolcezza. I get hourly reports from the men I hired to guard her. She goes nowhere without their protection. No one gets into her apartment without their knowledge and consent. She\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>She blew out her breath. Yes, if Max had hired someone to protect his sister, he would have hired only the best. Still, she\u2019d feel much better when Lauren was back home with them in the midst of Callie\u2019s loving family.</p><p>At times like this, a girl needed family above all else. Callie was going to make sure Lauren had it.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they pulled up to an apartment building. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose I can convince you to remain in the car where it\u2019s warm and dry while I go collect Lauren,\u201d Max said.</p><p>Callie shook her head emphatically and Max chuckled.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Well, come on then. Let\u2019s hurry. I want you back home where I can take better care of you.\u201d</p><p>Max got out and helped Callie onto the sidewalk before tucking her firmly under his arm. They hurried toward the building, where Max scanned a security card to gain access.</p> <p>As they headed toward the elevator, Max pulled out his cell phone, punched in a number, and then put the phone to his ear.</p><p>\u201cThis is Wilder. I\u2019m coming up with my wife.\u201d</p><p>Max ushered her onto the elevator, suddenly all business. He was tense and his face was set in stone. Already he was preparing for battle. A battle he didn\u2019t intend to lose. Callie put her hand on his arm and gently squeezed.</p><p>His expression softened and he pulled her closer to him. He brushed a kiss across the top of her head, then squeezed her back.</p><p>The elevator opened and they stepped into the hall. When they rounded the corner, they were met by two very broad-shouldered, intimidating men. Callie instinctively stepped closer to Max.</p> <p>These weren\u2019t the polished, suave, security detail\u2013type men in suits she\u2019d expected. They were rough around the edges. Looked mean as hell. Were as big as damn mountains. But the upside? Callie couldn\u2019t imagine anyone in their right mind fucking with these two. That included Lauren\u2019s loser of an ex-boyfriend.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Max asked in clipped tones.</p><p>One of the men scowled. \u201cHasn\u2019t left her apartment since she arrived.\u201d</p><p>Max swore under his breath. \u201cHas she been eating?\u201d</p><p>The second man nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure of it. She\u2019s not too happy with us\u2014or you\u2014at the moment.\u201d</p><p>Max grimaced, then turned to Callie. \u201cCallie, this is Liam Prescott and Noah Sullivan, the two men I hired to oversee Lauren\u2019s safety.\u201d He glanced back at the two men. \u201cThis is my wife, Callie.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d Liam said as he dipped his head respectfully.</p><p>Callie swallowed and continued to stare at the two boulders. Yes, boulders. It was the only word to describe them. They were hard as stone and had muscles in places Callie had never imagined muscles to be.</p><p>\u201cShe probably hasn\u2019t left her apartment because she\u2019s scared to death of them,\u201d she whispered to Max.</p><p>Liam chuckled. \u201cNo ma\u2019am, she\u2019s not afraid of us. She\u2019s pissed. There\u2019s a difference. I\u2019d rather have her pissed off than in danger though.\u201d</p><p>Noah shrugged like it didn\u2019t matter to him one way or another.</p><p>Callie cleared her throat. \u201cWell, um, we\u2019ve come to take her home with us. I mean, not that you aren\u2019t doing a good job\u2014I\u2019m sure you are\u2014but she belongs with family.\u201d</p><p>A smile quirked the corner of Liam\u2019s mouth. \u201cWe don\u2019t bite, Mrs. Wilder.\u201d</p><p>Max silenced him with a glare.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Max,\u201d Callie said impatiently.</p><p>Max motioned her ahead and Callie gingerly walked by the two mountains and knocked lightly on Lauren\u2019s door. A moment later it swung open, and Lauren was there with a disgruntled look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI ate, okay?\u201d</p><p>Then she stopped and her eyes went wide with surprise. \u201cCallie! What are you ... I thought it was them ... Max?\u201d</p><p>Callie pulled her petite sister-in-law into a hug and squeezed her fiercely. When she let her go, Max held out his arms and Lauren went into his embrace.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d he asked her quietly.</p><p>She nodded as she pulled away. \u201cCome in. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>The two mountains took their positions by the door and Lauren closed the door with a sharp bang.</p><p>\u201cPains in my ass,\u201d Lauren muttered as she turned away. \u201cNow, what are you two doing here? Not that I\u2019m not thrilled to see you.\u201d</p><p>Callie studied her sister-in-law closely and didn\u2019t like what she saw. Behind the fa\u00e7ade of normalcy was an exhausted, shadowed woman with fear in her eyes. Callie\u2019s heart ached for her.</p><p>There were deep smudges underneath Lauren\u2019s eyes, and she looked much thinner than the last time Callie had seen her. Her arms and neck were covered by the long-sleeved shirt and scarf she wore, but Max had told Callie about the dark bruises that marred her skin.</p><p>\u201cWe came to take you home,\u201d Callie said firmly.</p><p>Lauren\u2019s lips twisted unhappily, but before she could launch a protest, Callie held up a hand to silence her.</p><p>\u201cThis is not up for discussion. Max and I both agree you need to be with family. My parents are dying to get their hands on you. My brothers will spoil you rotten.\u201d</p><p>Lauren shook her head but Callie wasn\u2019t giving up.</p><p>\u201cYou need us, Lauren,\u201d she said softly. \u201cEverybody needs their family. Especially when something terrible happens. I should know. I shut mine out when I should have been wallowing in all their love and support. Come home with us. I\u2019m not leaving without you.\u201d</p><p>Max spoke up for the first time. \u201cShe\u2019s right, baby.\u201d His voice was tender and coaxing. \u201cAnd you know how fierce Callie is when she\u2019s set her mind to something. She\u2019s sick with strep throat and a hundred-and-four fever but hell if she wasn\u2019t getting on a plane to come bring you home.\u201d</p><p>Lauren smiled faintly. \u201cMy brother sounds afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Callie grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s because he\u2019s a smart man.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s expression grew more troubled. \u201cI don\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>Callie took her hands and squeezed. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to know or think about. There\u2019s nothing for you here. Come home with us and heal. There\u2019s no better place to be than surrounded by the Colters.\u201d</p><p>Tears gathered in Lauren\u2019s dark eyes and her lips trembled. Then finally she nodded. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 7</p><p>I\u2019M starting to get worried,\u201d Dillon said bluntly.</p><p>He folded his arms over his chest and stared over the bar at his two brothers seated on bar stools. Seth and Michael had come into the pub during their lunch hour on the day the pub was closed.</p><p>Usually Dillon would be home. With Lily. Usually if Seth was free for lunch, he came home to be with Lily. If Michael wasn\u2019t busy at his practice, he would be with her.</p><p>But today, they had agreed to meet at Mountain Pass, away from Lily. To discuss ... her.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not herself,\u201d Dillon continued, eyeing the unease on his brothers\u2019 faces. It was an unease he distinctly shared. Something wasn\u2019t right, and it was high time to figure out what the hell it was.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Michael said wearily. \u201cShe isn\u2019t. She puts on a good front, but when she thinks we aren\u2019t looking, she seems ... sad. Worried.\u201d</p><p>Seth leaned his forehead against the edges of his palms and blew out a deep breath. \u201cGod almighty, I don\u2019t know what it could be, but it scares the hell out of me. What if ... what if this whole thing isn\u2019t working for her anymore? What if she isn\u2019t happy with the arrangement?\u201d</p><p>Seth had voiced the question uppermost in Dillon\u2019s mind. He\u2019d pinpointed Dillon\u2019s number one worry, and judging by the look on Michael\u2019s face, Seth had nailed Michael\u2019s primary concern too.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Dillon muttered.</p><p>Michael shook his head, his lips set into a fine line. \u201cNo. That can\u2019t be it. It can\u2019t. Lily ...\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily what?\u201d Seth demanded. \u201cLily\u2019s happy? I think we all know that isn\u2019t true right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have to assume worst-case scenario,\u201d Dillon pointed out.</p><p>\u201cWhy the fuck are we sitting here talking about worst-case scenarios?\u201d Michael asked in disgust. \u201cWe should be asking her what\u2019s wrong. This speculating is making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re all afraid of the answer,\u201d Seth said quietly.</p><p>Dillon blew out his breath. \u201cYeah. Right there. Scared shitless, and I don\u2019t mind admitting it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think Mom knows what\u2019s up?\u201d Michael asked. \u201cShe\u2019s been over there a lot lately. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re up to. Could be nothing. But Mom doesn\u2019t usually come over and kick us out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be anything,\u201d Seth said. \u201cShe might be working on a Christmas present for the dads. There are a lot of explanations for why Mom would be coming to see Lily all hush-hush.\u201d</p><p>Dillon clenched his fist in frustration. \u201cSo we\u2019re back to square one. Which is that we have no idea what the hell is going on with the woman we love, no idea how to fix it, because again, we have no idea what it is and we\u2019re all too chickenshit to ask. Have I got it about right?\u201d</p><p>Michael gave a disgusted sigh. \u201cThat about sums it up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Dillon asked.</p><p>He hated how fucking helpless he felt. Like his entire life was on the line and he had no control over how it turned out. He knew his brothers felt the same because their expressions said it all.</p><p>They\u2019d all secretly feared that the relationship wouldn\u2019t work out. It was their number one fear.</p><p>Though their fathers had a very nontraditional relationship with their mother, it had never occurred to them that they would follow in the same path. It hadn\u2019t been discussed. No one had ever suggested it. They\u2019d certainly had relationships, flings, whatever the hell you wanted to call them, with other women, and they damn sure hadn\u2019t ever called any of the others up and asked him if he was up for a foursome.</p><p>Seth had been the first to make that connection with Lily, but it hadn\u2019t meant that his was any more intense than Michael\u2019s or even Dillon\u2019s own. From the moment Dillon had laid eyes on her, he\u2019d known without a doubt that she was his and that he\u2019d go to any lengths to possess her.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t cared that Seth had already staked a claim or that she was in town because she\u2019d come with him. There was no way he could walk away from her and settle for a relationship as her brother-in-law. Oh hell no.</p><p>It had taken some discussion between the brothers before they\u2019d realized that they had a huge problem. They were all in love with the same woman and none of them were willing to take a step back.</p><p>No one in their family so much as blinked an eye. Hell, no one in the town of Clyde would have been surprised. But Lily?</p><p>This wasn\u2019t normal to her. It wasn\u2019t something she\u2019d been exposed to all her life. They\u2019d come at her like fucking bulldozers.</p><p>Maybe now she was having some serious second thoughts. Maybe she didn\u2019t like having to juggle three men in a relationship.</p><p>It was automatic for Dillon to think back, to try to figure out if he or one of his brothers had been demanding. Expected too much from her. But no, they were always so careful. Because they feared overwhelming her, because they feared pushing her too far.</p><p>Fuck it, but this was for the birds. It was time to get their asses home and figure out what the hell was wrong with their woman so they could make it right.</p><p>LILY tugged her sweater tighter around her waist as she walked through the small grove of aspens behind the cabin. She loved this trail, especially in fall when the leaves burned gold and were so brilliant to look at that it made her eyes hurt.</p><p>She should have taken her heavier coat but she hadn\u2019t planned on going this far. She\u2019d only meant to sit awhile on her bench and stare at the vista through Rose\u2019s memorial.</p><p>It had begun to snow, adding another thin layer to the ground cover that crunched beneath her boots. They weren\u2019t due for any heavy snow, at least not today. She hadn\u2019t checked the extended forecast to know what lay beyond.</p><p>The last several days had been good because Holly had kept Lily busy with teaching her how to cook. But the downside was that Lily was no closer to knowing how to break the news to her husbands because she hadn\u2019t had time to think.</p><p>She was always around someone. She hadn\u2019t had any time alone to just be. To think and consider. To face her fears and resolve to share her secret with the men she loved.</p><p>She took her hands out of her pockets and blew on them to warm the tips. She hadn\u2019t brought her gloves either, but she wasn\u2019t so cold that she was compelled to return to the cabin. Not yet.</p><p>There was a point she wanted to reach, where she could look out and see forever. Over the valley and down the ridge. The most beautiful country she\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>This was her home. She had to constantly remind herself that it was hers. She had a place in the world.</p><p>And now so would her child.</p><p>She paused, taking that last step, and then rested her hand on the trunk of an aspen as she peered out, taking in the breathtaking view.</p><p>After a moment, she leaned her back against the tree and soaked in her surroundings. The crisp, clean smell of the air. The scent of pine. The tickle of snowflakes as they drifted lazily down, melting on her cheeks.</p><p>Her breath came out in a fog, and after a while, her breathing slowed and evened out. For the last few days, she\u2019d existed in denial. She hadn\u2019t allowed herself to think about the baby, much less dwell on the details. Boy. Girl. Who would it look like? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She\u2019d busied herself with Holly and immersed herself in family, putting on a brave front, not allowing them to see her worry or fear.</p><p>But it hadn\u2019t helped. She had decisions to make. She had fears to face. All she had to do was reach out and ask for help. Seth, Michael, and Dillon loved her. She had no doubts there. They\u2019d do anything in the world to make her happy, and they\u2019d help her work through her conflicting emotions about her pregnancy.</p><p>She just had to muster the nerve to blurt it all out.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, she pushed off the tree and started retracing her steps back to the cabin.</p> <p>As she drew nearer, she frowned. She could swear she heard her name.</p><p>She quickened her step through the aspens but stopped when she heard the distinctive call. It was Seth and he was yelling her name.</p><p>Worried that something was wrong, she jogged through the snow, taking care not to slip as she headed down the incline.</p><p>She came to an abrupt halt when she broke into the clearing and saw all three of her husbands spread out behind the cabin, obviously looking ... for her.</p><p>CHAPTER 8</p> <p>MICHAEL was the first to see her. He turned, did a double take, and then charged toward her, calling to his brothers the entire way.</p><p>Lily\u2019s breath caught in her throat and her pulse accelerated wildly. There was fierce determination\u2014and worry\u2014in her husbands\u2019 gazes and she knew that no matter whether she was prepared or not, the time had come. There was no way around it.</p><p>Michael ran up to her, took her arms in his hands. \u201cLily! What on earth are you doing up here? We were worried sick. You aren\u2019t even dressed for the cold.\u201d</p><p>Even as the questions poured out, he pulled her into his side, wrapping as much of his coat around her as he could while providing her with his body warmth.</p><p>His worried gaze cut to his brothers as they ran up, snow kicking up from their boots.</p><p>Dillon stood back a little hesitant. \u201cLily?\u201d</p> <p>She sent him a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Dillon. I just went for a walk through the aspen grove. It\u2019s such a beautiful day.\u201d</p><p>Seth frowned. \u201cYou aren\u2019t dressed to be out tromping around in the snow. You don\u2019t even have a coat or gloves.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI hadn\u2019t planned on going that far. I went to sit out on the bench and got the urge to take a walk. I was just heading back. I haven\u2019t been out that long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s get you back inside,\u201d Michael said. He propelled her toward the house, still holding her tightly against his side.</p><p>With a sigh she settled against him, letting his solid strength seep into her body. She leaned her head against his chest and blinked away the snowflakes trapped on her eyelashes.</p><p>It was, as she\u2019d said, a truly magnificent day. She loved winter on her mountain. She loved the cabin that Dillon had built himself and later added on to when it had been decided that they would all live here.</p><p>Now she looked at it with different eyes. Holly and the dads\u2019 cabin ... it was where all the Colter children had grown up. There was a strong sense of home there. You couldn\u2019t walk into their house without being swamped by love. History. The sense of family. There were pictures everywhere. Of Seth, Michael, and Dillon, and then Callie, who\u2019d come along later and had been a surprise.</p><p>That house was a symbol of everything she wanted most in the world. She\u2019d always been a little awed by it. The family gatherings on the weekends for dinner. The easy way the Colters demonstrated their love for one another.</p> <p>She wanted all of that for herself. She wanted to start a new chapter in a solid legacy. She wanted her home to be filled with love and laughter. Children. Oh God, children.</p><p>Did she have the courage to face her worst fears?</p><p>When they got to the house, they filed through the back door. Dillon bent to take off her boots while Seth took her sweater after Michael unwrapped her from his coat.</p><p>She headed for the kitchen, thinking hot chocolate would be nice, but then she stopped and turned, cocking her head.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you all doing home so early anyway? At the same time, even.\u201d</p><p>One of them being home early was nothing uncommon. But all three at the same time?</p><p>There was definitely something up, and the more she caught their gazes and the determination etched in their faces, the more she realized that she was the reason for their early arrival.</p><p>Seth caught her hand as she reached for a mug. He gently took the cup away and kissed her forehead. \u201cIf you want hot chocolate, I\u2019ll get it for you. Why don\u2019t you go into the living room? Dillon will build a fire so it\u2019s warm. We want to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>A nervous flutter rose from her belly into her throat.</p><p>\u201cO-okay.\u201d</p><p>He gently nudged her in Michael\u2019s direction and set about making the hot cocoa. Michael twined his fingers with hers and pulled her toward the living room, where Dillon was already lighting the kindling under the logs in the fireplace.</p><p>Michael guided her toward the big, fluffy chair that was her favorite, and she reluctantly let him settle her down. It took all her control not to fidget. She wasn\u2019t sure she could sit here calmly and have a rational conversation like they were obviously wanting.</p><p>She needed to pace. To work out some of her nervous energy. How could she sit here and look them in the eye when her heart was about to beat out of her chest?</p><p>Dillon stood up from his crouch in front of the hearth and turned just as Seth walked in carrying her mug of chocolate. She took it with shaky hands but quickly set it on the table next to her chair before she sloshed it all over herself.</p><p>She pushed herself out of the chair, not able to sit still another moment. Michael caught her hand in his firm grasp as if he was afraid to let her go.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>Her first instinct was denial, to say nothing, act as if she had no idea what he was talking about. She tugged her hand away instead and turned, only to land against Dillon\u2019s muscled chest.</p><p>His agitation was evident in his tense, coiled muscles. For a long moment, he held on to her, his chest heaving against her as he gripped her. He buried his face in her hair and stroked one hand down her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Lily?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhatever it is, tell us so we can make you happy again.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away and smiled. That part was easy even when her insides were in such turmoil. Because all she had to do was think about them and their unwavering love and it brought her instant joy\u2014and peace. Then she reached up to frame his strong jaw. \u201cYou always make me happy, Dillon. Always.\u201d She took a deep steadying breath before she made her confession. \u201cI\u2019m just scared right now, and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her hands in his and pulled them down between their bodies. His gaze pierced her, right to the heart, so intense. \u201cYou don\u2019t ever have to be afraid.\u201d</p><p>The vehemence in his voice was reassuring. And she knew. She knew all of this logically. If there was one thing in this world she was sure of was that they\u2019d always protect her and she really didn\u2019t have to be afraid. But sometimes logic was so simple. Sometimes fear overran all else. Even common sense.</p><p>She swallowed hard and then turned so she could see the others. Seth was staring at her, his blue eyes fierce, but he waited. Tense. Stiff. As if he feared what it was she had to say.</p><p>She\u2019d made such a muck of this. Because of her fears, she\u2019d made them afraid.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t the way it should have happened. She should have made a special dinner. Should have asked them how their day went. Snuggled on the couch. Gone to bed, made love, and in the aftermath told them that they were going to be fathers.</p><p>And now there was no escape. No do-overs. No way she could pretend nothing was wrong and then plan the big moment for the next night. She\u2019d utterly ruined everything and it was too late to salvage the mess she\u2019d made.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us, Lily,\u201d Seth pleaded. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to see you unhappy. Is it ...\u201d He broke off, rubbed the back of his neck with his palm. Then he dropped his hand and stared back at her with tortured eyes. \u201cIs it us? Are you no longer happy with the arrangement we have?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open in shock. \u201cWhat? No!\u201d Oh God. It was what they all believed. She\u2019d done this. Made them doubt her commitment because they\u2019d noticed her unhappiness and her distance.</p><p>She closed her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>It came out barely a whisper, the words so final. When she opened her eyes, they were staring at her in total surprise.</p><p>The multitude of emotions that registered on their faces was hard to track. There was relief. They\u2019d obviously expected something far worse. There was uncertainty, as if they weren\u2019t sure they could express their happiness over such news. And there was worry and fear because they knew that of all things, she feared having another child the most.</p><p>Seth blew out his breath and wiped a hand over his mouth. He was always, or at least usually, so self-assured. As sheriff he had to be, and he always knew what to say. But now he seemed, for lack of a better word, lost.</p><p>Michael looked shell-shocked, and for the first time she realized how just blurting out such news had affected them. Damn it, but she\u2019d just ruined what should have been a special moment. Perhaps one of the most special moments of their lives. She knew how badly they wanted children. A large family like they\u2019d grown up in. They\u2019d been patient and understanding with her fears. They\u2019d never pushed her. Not once. They\u2019d been willing to wait as long as she needed, or to forego having children altogether if that was her wish.</p><p>But deep down, she\u2019d known how much they wanted their own family.</p><p>Now she\u2019d made a complete and utter mess and she was horrified by her selfishness.</p><p>Tears stung her eyes and she put a hand to her mouth to stifle the sob choking her. They\u2019d done so much to make her happy, and she couldn\u2019t even give them this one thing without making it sound like the end of the world?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said in agony. \u201cYou didn\u2019t deserve this. Not this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLily,\u201d Dillon began.</p><p>She shut him out. For the first time she could ever remember, she purposely turned away, closing herself off from her husbands.</p><p>She hurried toward the back, wanting\u2014needing\u2014fresh air. To be able to breathe around the huge knot in her throat. So that maybe she wouldn\u2019t dissolve into tears or completely break down and lose what little composure she had left.</p><p>The cold was a slap in the face, but it was what she needed. Her boots, haphazardly shoved onto her feet, were awkward as she trekked through the snow toward her bench.</p><p>She really had no idea where she was going. Or she did, but knew it was no escape. She was so angry at herself for doing this to them.</p><p>Of all the ways to tell them that they were going to have a son or daughter, this wasn\u2019t one she\u2019d wanted. They would forever associate their firstborn with their mother freaking out and being a selfish twit. Not exactly what she\u2019d want to put into a scrapbook or memory book.</p><p>She sank onto the bench and bowed her head, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>Almost immediately, warm, strong hands slid over her shoulders. Seth and Michael settled onto the bench next to her while Dillon crouched in front of her. He gently pried her hands away from her face, his expression warm and loving.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cWhat for? For being human and being scared?\u201d Dillon asked quietly. \u201cLily, you don\u2019t have to put on a brave front with us. You don\u2019t have to pretend.\u201d</p><p>Michael smoothed a hand over her hair and then leaned in to press a kiss to the top of her head. On her other side, Seth slid his hand over hers and laced their fingers together.</p><p>\u201cHow do you feel about it?\u201d Seth asked softly.</p><p>\u201cScared,\u201d she admitted. It felt good to say it out loud. To get it out there. \u201cIt caught me off guard. I wasn\u2019t prepared and so when I learned that I was for sure pregnant, all the grief over Rose just came back. All the old fears. For a while I was back there in that time, feeling just as I felt then. Exhausted, helpless, alone. Oh God, I don\u2019t want to ever feel that way again.\u201d</p><p>Michael pulled her back into his arms and she laid her head back against his chest while Seth still held tightly to her hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lily. We were so careful, or we tried to be. You have to know we wouldn\u2019t have you feel this way for anything in the world. We just want you to be happy, and if that meant never having a child, we were okay with that.\u201d</p><p>She appreciated the sentiment, but she was beyond the what-ifs now. She didn\u2019t have the luxury of imagining or weighing whether she ever wanted to have another child or not. It was here. Her reality. She was pregnant, and she\u2019d never ever do anything to change that fact.</p><p>\u201cI want this baby,\u201d she said quietly, fiercely. \u201cI\u2019m scared out of my mind, but I want it. I love him or her already.\u201d</p><p>A shiver stole over her. Dillon peeled off his coat and arranged it around her body so she would have it and Michael\u2019s body for warmth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seth raised the hand he still held and kissed her palm and then each finger. \u201cWe\u2019ll be here for you, Lily. I need you to trust in that. We\u2019ll never let you down. No one will ever be more loved than you and that baby.\u201d</p><p>Her heart melted and some of the awful fear that had held her captive for so long loosened and slipped away.</p><p>\u201cI know. I do trust you. I love you all so very much. I just need some time. To adjust. I\u2019m so sorry I ruined the moment. It should have been special.\u201d</p><p>Dillon put a finger over her lips. \u201cYou are what\u2019s special to us. It\u2019s going to be different this time, Lily. I swear it.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at the faces of her husbands, at the earnest determination in their eyes. Saw the love\u2014love for her\u2014reflected in their depths.</p><p>Yes, it would be different this time, and she had faith\u2014in them, and in herself\u2014that this time her miracle wouldn\u2019t slip away.</p><p>CHAPTER 9</p><p>ADAM Colter watched as his wife, Holly, decorated the huge family Christmas tree with Ethan and Ryan hovering to make sure she didn\u2019t fall off the ladder.</p><p>It\u2019s not that they wouldn\u2019t have been more than happy to decorate while she oversaw the project, but Holly was determined that she hang every ornament and exclaim over each one as she did so. Every single one reflected a memory for the Colter family through the years, and each Christmas the tree grew heavier with those collected memories.</p> <p>Maybe it was his age, but he seemed to grow more nostalgic with each passing year. He\u2019d watched his children grow up under this very roof. He and his brothers had watched their wife blossom under their love and protective umbrella, and in return she\u2019d given them something so infinitely precious that they could never want for more.</p><p>Now his children had spread their wings. They\u2019d left the nest and yet they were all right here, surrounding him. All had come back. There had been several points in his life when he couldn\u2019t have imagined being happier. The births of his children. Callie being born in the meadow. Holly returning to him and his brothers when they\u2019d thought they\u2019d lost her. But nothing compared to right here, right now.</p><p>His wife slipped her arms around his waist and hugged him to her. \u201cWhat has you so deep in thought over here?\u201d</p><p>He blinked, realizing that the tree was done and the lights sparkled like tiny diamonds hung over the thick limbs. He smiled and leaned down to kiss the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about my children and my wife.\u201d</p><p>Holly turned her face up and smiled back. \u201cGood thoughts then.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe best.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and stared back toward the tree and then let her gaze wander to her other husbands as they cleaned up the boxes and put them away until the tree came down.</p><p>\u201cThis year we\u2019ll have Lauren. Callie\u2019s so worried about her. She hasn\u2019t left Callie and Max\u2019s place since she got here a few days ago. Callie says she\u2019s so ashamed, and my heart just aches for her. I want to go over and just hug her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d Adam asked, smiling at how tenderhearted his beautiful wife was.</p><p>Holly hesitated. \u201cBecause I know how it feels. That kind of shame. Even as you know it\u2019s not yours to bear, you can\u2019t shake it.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her, anger still fresh and fast to surface when he remembered what she\u2019d endured at her first husband\u2019s hands. The little bastard had died in prison the previous year, which only brought a small measure of satisfaction to Adam and his brothers. They would have much preferred to make him suffer a long, slow, painful death.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precisely why you should go visit her,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou more than anyone know exactly what she\u2019s going through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want her to venture out,\u201d Holly said, her lips firming in resolution. \u201cEveryone will spoil her endlessly and restore her faith in the male species. She needs that.\u201d</p> <p>Adam nodded. \u201cBe patient. She\u2019ll take on the world and venture out of her safe haven when she\u2019s ready. But there\u2019s nothing to say that you can\u2019t go over and lend her your love and support.\u201d</p><p>Holly checked her watch and then let out an exclamation. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run. I\u2019m supposed to go see Lily today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll drive you,\u201d Ethan said from across the room. \u201cI need to go into town anyway.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned and shook her head. \u201cNo need.\u201d</p><p>Adam exchanged raised eyebrows with his brothers. Holly had been acting awfully suspicious lately. Not that she didn\u2019t often visit Lily, but during the last week, she\u2019d gone down there with increasing frequency and she was adamant that no one accompany her.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s lips thinned and he crossed his arms over his chest as though he was about to argue, but then he seemed to think better of it and abruptly backed down. \u201cWhat time will you be back?\u201d he asked gruffly. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to snow again.\u201d</p><p>Holly considered the matter a moment and then did another check of her watch. \u201cI\u2019ll be home by dark. Promise. I may stop in to check on Callie\u2014and Lauren, but I\u2019ll call you from her house if I do.\u201d</p><p>Adam pulled her up and kissed her lingeringly. \u201cBe careful, okay? We worry when you\u2019re away from us.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a dazzling smile and hurried away to get her purse and keys. As soon as she left the room, Adam shot his brothers a seeking glance.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is our sweet little wife up to?\u201d</p><p>Ethan shook his head. \u201cHell if I know, but she scares me when she gets this way. There\u2019s no telling what she has up her sleeve.\u201d</p><p>Ryan frowned and shoved his hands into his pockets. \u201cYou think everything is okay with Lily? Have the boys said anything lately about any problems they might be having? Holly\u2019s been spending a lot of time with her lately.\u201d</p><p>Adam rubbed his hand over his chin as he pondered the possibility. But no. Seth, Michael, and Dillon all seemed happy. Content. At total peace. You could sense it in them. And there\u2019d been nothing in Lily\u2019s actions to hint at any turmoil. She was as sweet as ever. Quiet, shy, but fierce in her protection of the people she loved.</p><p>Finally he shrugged. \u201cIt does us no good to stand around and speculate. Sooner or later we\u2019ll know what she\u2019s up to. Until then we\u2019ll just have to be patient.\u201d</p><p>HOLLY pulled into Callie\u2019s driveway just as dusk was blanketing the mountains. Snow flurries spun and spiraled in crazy swirls, melting on the windshield as she cut the engine. Instead of calling her husbands as she\u2019d promised, she sent a text to all three that she was safe at Callie\u2019s and would be home shortly. It saved time and prevented the inevitable concern she\u2019d hear in their voices.</p><p>And to be honest, she wasn\u2019t feeling entirely wonderful. She had a chill and a fiery ache had settled into her right side. The fever could well be the result of being exposed to Callie\u2019s strep throat, and she could only assume she\u2019d eaten something over the past several days that hadn\u2019t agreed with her. She and Lily had cooked enough Christmas dinners to feed an entire battalion. Twice. But she was confident that come Christmas Day, she was going to serve her family the best holiday dinner they\u2019d ever tasted.</p><p>With a sigh, she climbed out of the SUV and headed toward Callie\u2019s front door. The entire front of Callie\u2019s house was decorated in bright, colorful Christmas lights. A large wreath hung on the door, and framed in the huge picture window stood the tree, ablaze with over a thousand white lights. Callie had always loved Christmas. Every bit as much as Holly did. It warmed Holly through that her daughter had her own home just a short distance away from her parents. She missed her babies when they were away and of all her children, Callie had spent the most time away from home. Now she was back where she belonged and Max would keep her centered. He\u2019d calmed her restless spirit and had given her a safe haven.</p><p>As she reached the steps, the porch light came on and the door opened, revealing Max.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mrs. C. Come in, come in. Here, let me take your coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi Max,\u201d Holly said, leaning up on tiptoe to kiss his cheek. Her son-in-law\u2019s acceptance into the family hadn\u2019t come without hiccups, but he\u2019d proven himself a dozen times over since he and Callie had married.</p><p>Max took her coat and ushered her inside to the living room, where a fire blazed in the hearth.</p><p>\u201cMom!\u201d Callie cried as she hurried over.</p><p>Holly caught her daughter in her arms and hugged her tightly. \u201cHi, baby. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. What brings you over? Would you like some hot chocolate or a glass of wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing for me, thank you,\u201d Holly said. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lauren? I\u2019d hoped to see her while I was here.\u201d</p><p>Callie and Max exchanged pained looks.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in her room,\u201d Callie said with a sigh.</p><p>Holly glanced at Max. \u201cWould you mind if I went to see her?\u201d</p><p>Max wiped a hand wearily over his face. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful for whatever you could do for her. I feel so damn helpless. I want to help her but I don\u2019t know how. She\u2019s hurting and I\u2019m powerless to stop it.\u201d</p><p>Holly impulsively went to him and enfolded him a big hug. In her mind, no one ever got too old for a motherly hug, and judging by his reaction, he didn\u2019t think so either.</p><p>He hugged her back, squeezing a little tighter than normal.</p><p>Holly drew away and patted his cheek affectionately. \u201cI know you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re helping her, Max, but I promise you she appreciates you just being here and for going to New York to fight for her. She\u2019s adrift. She feels isolated and alone. She\u2019s afraid, ashamed, angry. It just takes time to heal and to regain your confidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf she can be as half as strong as you are, Mrs. C, she\u2019ll be just fine,\u201d Max said, clear love in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t very strong in the beginning,\u201d Holly said ruefully. \u201cAdam, Ethan, and Ryan made me strong. Their love made me strong. Just like our love is going to make Lauren strong again. We simply have to make her see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Max said sincerely. \u201cFor caring about my sister.\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled, reached over to squeeze Callie\u2019s hand, and then headed toward the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll be back down in a bit, Callie. If your fathers call, tell them I\u2019m with Lauren. They\u2019ll understand.\u201d</p><p>She climbed the stairs and turned to the left, away from the master suite and down a hallway where the other bedrooms were located. At the end, she encountered the closed door of Lauren\u2019s bedroom and knocked softly.</p><p>\u201cLauren? It\u2019s Holly Colter. Can I come in for a few minutes?\u201d</p><p>A long moment later, the door opened and Lauren stood there, surprise and confusion reflected in her dark, wounded eyes. Holly wanted to cry as she took in how changed the lovely young woman was from the last time Holly had visited with her.</p><p>She looked infinitely fragile. Haunted. Callie had said she\u2019d been wearing scarves and long sleeves to cover the bruises, but she wore no such things now, and even days after her attack, there was still evidence of bruising. Much fainter now. Yellow and green instead of black and blue, but the marks were there.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Holly offered softly.</p><p>Lauren smiled but swallowed nervously. \u201cHi, Mrs. Colter. I didn\u2019t realize you were coming over.\u201d</p><p>Holly flashed a bright, cheerful smile, determined not to show any pity or anger over Lauren\u2019s condition. \u201cOh, I pop in all the time. I wanted to see how you were doing. I\u2019ve been dying to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Guilt crept into Lauren\u2019s eyes and she gripped the door a little tighter.</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Holly asked again.</p><p>Lauren hastily glanced back and then opened the door wide. \u201cOf course. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Holly sailed past her, her heart aching at the change so evident in the young woman. Spying the two chairs by the window, she headed in that direction and perched on the edge of one. She leaned over to pat the other and motioned for Lauren to sit.</p><p>Lauren gingerly settled onto the opposite chair, her unease rippling from her in waves. Holly grasped Lauren\u2019s hands and squeezed comfortingly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been good at being subtle so I\u2019m going to just dive right in. Callie told me what happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Lauren closed her eyes and her head bowed automatically. Holly moved one of her hands from Lauren\u2019s and cupped Lauren\u2019s chin, gently nudging it upward until Lauren was forced to look at her.</p><p>\u201cListen to me, baby,\u201d Holly said in an achingly gentle voice. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t your fault. It\u2019s not your shame to bear. I know how you\u2019re feeling. I understand all too well.\u201d</p><p>Lauren\u2019s eyes clouded. \u201cHow?\u201d she cracked out. \u201cHow could you possibly know? Or understand? Your husbands would never ...\u201d</p><p>Holly shook her head. \u201cNo, they wouldn\u2019t. Thank God for that. I thank God for them every single day. But you know what? I didn\u2019t always have them. I was running from my first husband when Adam found me lying in a ditch. He took me home, and he and his brothers helped put me back together. They protected me, they loved me, and they gave me the strength to fight back when the time came.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lauren\u2019s eyes rounded in surprise. \u201cYou ... Someone\u2014your husband\u2014hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Holly nodded. \u201cLauren, honey, you can\u2019t hide from the world forever, and moreover, you can\u2019t hide from the people who love you. My husbands and my sons are dying to spoil you rotten and treat you like an honorary daughter and sister. Hell, they spoil Callie shamelessly and she\u2019s a married, grown woman. It\u2019s bad enough Max gives her the moon, but her fathers and brothers do as well. I know it\u2019s hard for you to trust right now, but in time your faith will be restored. Not all men are bastards. There are some really good men out there who\u2019d die before ever hurting a woman.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled Lauren\u2019s eyes. \u201cI just feel so stupid. And I\u2019m angry with myself. I should have left him. I made excuses for him. I brushed off the warning signs. I just felt so damn alone and for a while he filled that emptiness inside me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Holly said, pulling Lauren into her arms. She held her tightly and rocked back and forth. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a crime to make a mistake. We all make them. Just because you gave your trust to the wrong man doesn\u2019t mean you should punish yourself for the rest of your life.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren sighed and wiped hastily at her tears as she pulled away from Holly. \u201cIt sounds pretty stupid when you say it like that. What I mean is that I sound stupid and you make complete sense. I just wish it was that easy to believe, you know?\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled and ran her hand over Lauren\u2019s damp cheek. \u201cThe thing is, you don\u2019t have to endure this alone. You\u2019re surrounded by family, by people who love you. No one in this family thinks less of you. We\u2019re worried about you. My boys want to go kick the little bastard\u2019s ass, but we all just want you to be happy again. Venture out of your shell. We want you to feel safe here.\u201d</p><p>This time Lauren hugged Holly and her slender body shook with sobs as she buried her face in Holly\u2019s shoulder. For the longest time, Holly simply sat there and held her, rocking her back and forth as Lauren let go of the pent-up emotion.</p><p>\u201cI miss my mom,\u201d Lauren whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, baby. It\u2019s times like these when a girl needs her mother the most. No matter how old you get, the need for your mother never goes away. I hope you\u2019ll allow me to stand in for her.\u201d</p> <p>Lauren squeezed her fiercely. \u201cI\u2019d love that more than anything.\u201d</p><p>Holly squeezed her back. \u201cNot only do you have a stand-in mother, but you also have three fathers and three brothers in addition to Max, and you have two sisters too.\u201d</p><p>Lauren lifted her head, her eyes wide in wonder. \u201cI do, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled. \u201cYou most certainly do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Lauren breathed. \u201cMax and I are so very lucky. For so long it was just us three. Him, me, and Mama. And then just me and Max. I\u2019ve always dreamed of having a big, loving, wonderful family that just surrounded me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d say you got your wish,\u201d Holly said with an indulgent smile.</p> <p>Lauren wiped at her face again and briefly looked down before returning her gaze to Holly. \u201cDoes the self-recrimination ever go away? I close my eyes at night and I\u2019m just bombarded by humiliation. I cringe at the things I put up with. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m furious with him. But I\u2019m also angry with myself, and that\u2019s harder to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being too hard on yourself,\u201d Holly said gently. \u201cGive yourself time to heal. Distance always provides perspective. The guilt and self-blame will fade. You\u2019ll be able to look back and know that the blame lies solely with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re right,\u201d Lauren murmured. \u201cI hate wallowing in this cesspool of pity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy advice? Get out more. Stop shutting yourself away from the world. Take long walks. It\u2019s beautiful up here. Go to town. Buy something fun for yourself. Pamper yourself. Get a manicure. Whatever it takes to give yourself back the gift of confidence.\u201d</p><p>Lauren smiled. \u201cThanks, Mrs. C. Really, just thank you. I needed this kick in the ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t kick people in the ass,\u201d Holly said. \u201cThat\u2019s what my husbands are for. I just hug people to death and then mother them senseless.\u201d</p><p>Impulsively, Lauren hugged her again. \u201cI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m here. This family is the absolute best.\u201d</p><p>Holly held her for a long moment and then eased back so she could rise from her chair. \u201cI\u2019d love for you to come up to the house for dinner. My children are in and out all the time. Our door is always open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Lauren said softly.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I better run before the husbands send out a search party,\u201d she said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThey love you so much,\u201d Lauren said wistfully.</p><p>Holly reached out to stroke her hair. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll find someone who loves you just as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you down,\u201d Lauren said, rising from her own chair.</p><p>Holly gave her a delighted smile. Max and Callie would be thrilled that Lauren ventured down. It was a step. Lauren wouldn\u2019t be taking on the world in the next day, but she\u2019d get there on her own. The Colters would simply close ranks around her and help her get back on her feet again.</p><p>CHAPTER 10</p><p>LILY waited anxiously for her husbands to get home. They\u2019d been banished to the dads so Holly could come over for her cooking lesson. For the first time, Lily had been impatient for her mother-in-law to leave. Lily was focused on having her men return so that she could make things right.</p><p>She thought back over her plan for the hundredth time, reciting the words she\u2019d committed to memory but also knowing that the moment her husbands were there in front of her, she\u2019d forget everything and have to wing it.</p><p>The important thing was that she would give them a memory to replace the one of her freaking out and scaring them to death. She\u2019d give them something to look back on when their own children were grown. A happy time, a time to be excited and look to the future.</p><p>It had been a wake-up call for her when she\u2019d realized just how much she lived in the now. Not that it was a bad thing. No one wanted to wish their life away, always looking forward and never enjoying the here and now.</p><p>But she\u2019d made it a practice to never look beyond the next day. It was almost as if she were afraid to hope for any kind of a future. Or maybe she was just afraid she wouldn\u2019t have one.</p><p>Finding out she was pregnant had altered her perception. It had altered her focus. No longer was today the only thing she concentrated on. Now she looked to the future, imagining how their lives would change when they welcomed a son or daughter into their family.</p><p>It was ... nice.</p><p>Scary. Heart-stopping. Nerve-racking. But so very nice.</p><p>Her pulse leaped when she heard the truck in the drive. She smoothed her hands down her jeans, wiping her palms before she started toward the door to greet them.</p><p>She was there to open the door before they reached the porch. She tried to smile but she was so nervous that she wasn\u2019t sure she pulled it off convincingly.</p><p>Michael reached her first, and before he could say anything, she launched herself into his arms and gave him a scorching kiss to curl his toes.</p><p>When she pulled away, his eyes were half-lidded and dazed. She smiled and pushed him into the living room.</p><p>Seth and Dillon stood in the doorway, observing her cautiously. Not wanting to leave them out in the least, she went into Seth\u2019s arms and kissed him with every bit as much heat as she\u2019d kissed Michael.</p><p>Man, she loved the way he smelled. Loved the way he felt. He was still wearing his uniform, and he hadn\u2019t yet taken off his holster with his gun.</p><p>All in good time.</p><p>She felt a little smug when he was reluctant to let her go, but she pointed him toward Michael and then went into Dillon\u2019s arms.</p><p>She tried to take control much as she\u2019d done with Michael and Seth\u2014though interestingly enough, Michael was the more dominant force, especially when it came to sex\u2014but Dillon was having none of that.</p><p>He met her hungrily, taking over and ravaging her mouth. For several long, breathless seconds, he tasted her, explored her lips, and nibbled teasingly at their fullness.</p><p>\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She put a finger over his lips and then turned to the others.</p><p>\u201cI have something important I want to tell you.\u201d</p><p>Seth lifted an eyebrow, then glanced at Michael, then to Dillon, and finally back to her. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She gestured everyone toward the couch. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>As soon as they were all seated, she moved forward, no longer nervous or edgy. Peace settled over her. Her mind was quiet and no longer contained the painful memories of the past. It was filled instead with images of the future. Of her husbands and a tiny newborn baby. And then an older child, a girl or a boy. And of her husbands doting on him or her, and other children. Their family.</p><p>Her heart felt near to bursting. For so long she\u2019d been ruled by the past. She\u2019d hurt for so long that she\u2019d nearly forgotten how to experience joy. Now it flooded her. Seeped into every part of her heart and soul.</p><p>She went to her knees between Dillon\u2019s legs and reached with both hands to pull Seth\u2019s and Michael\u2019s hands so that she held them against her heart.</p><p>\u201cGuess what? I\u2019m having your baby,\u201d she said, her smile so big that she could barely get the words out.</p><p>Seth\u2019s eyes went soft. With love. So much love. And understanding as well. Michael smiled and squeezed her hand. Dillon reached out and cupped her cheek, his expression so fierce, and yet tears glittered harshly in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that wonderful?\u201d she asked.</p><p>And suddenly she was pulled onto Dillon\u2019s lap. Michael cradled her from behind and Seth pulled her feet onto his lap. They surrounded her, their love warming her to her very core.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most wonderful gift anyone\u2019s ever given me,\u201d Dillon choked out.</p><p>Seth\u2019s hand caressed a line up her leg to rest on her knee and he squeezed, his smile so big that his face nearly split.</p><p>Michael nuzzled her neck and then whispered low in her ear. \u201cAre you happy, Lily? I know you\u2019re scared, baby, but are you happy?\u201d</p><p>She turned, leaning into his chest. \u201cI\u2019m terrified, but I\u2019ve never been happier than at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let you down,\u201d Dillon said gruffly. \u201cWe\u2019ll be with you every second of every minute of every day. You\u2019ll never be alone.\u201d</p><p>She reached up to cup his face as he\u2019d done to hers. \u201cI know, Dillon. I do know. I love you all so much. I\u2019m so sorry I handled this so badly the first time. I wanted it to be special and for a little while, I let grief for Rose overwhelm me. I want this baby. I want our child. So very much.\u201d</p><p>She turned so she could straddle Dillon\u2019s lap and so she could touch Michael and Seth. She could see them and they could see her.</p><p>\u201cBefore I met you, I would never have believed that my life could be so full of joy and happiness. I\u2019d vowed to never have another child. I wouldn\u2019t risk it. But you give me such strength. You love me, and because you love me, I feel so strong. I feel like I can do anything. Even face my darkest fear.\u201d</p><p>Seth leaned in and pressed his lips to hers and then he cupped the back of her head, simply holding her close.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do this together, Lily. Just like Dillon said. You\u2019ll never be alone. We\u2019ll be with you every step of the way. Our baby will be protected, cherished, and loved by every member of the Colter family. No child will ever grow up more loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to the doctor yet?\u201d Michael asked. \u201cDo you know how far along you are?\u201d</p><p>They hadn\u2019t discussed the pregnancy since she\u2019d had her little meltdown. She could see the questions they were dying to ask, but they\u2019d purposely not overwhelmed her and had given her time to adjust to the idea.</p><p>She loved them for that, but she also knew that it had been difficult for them because they wanted to be able to talk about it. They wanted to be able to be excited. They wanted her to be as happy about it as they were.</p><p>And so they\u2019d let her take the lead and had been as loving and supportive as always, content to wait until she was ready to take that first shaky step.</p><p>Well, she was there. She might not light the world on fire with her courage or bravery, but she had something going for her that not many others had. She had three wonderful men who loved her unconditionally.</p><p>Unconditionally.</p><p>Such a strong, powerful word. How many people could say they were loved without conditions? Without strings? No questions. No hesitation. They were loved.</p><p>Her heart clutched even as she nodded in response to Michael\u2019s question.</p><p>\u201cI went to see Dr. Burton several days ago. I suspected ... or rather I had a suspicion, or maybe it was a fear. He did a test there in the office, then gave me a bunch of vitamins to take and scheduled another appointment in a month. My best estimate is that I\u2019m around six to eight weeks along. Probably closer to eight by now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all go with you to your appointments. Every one of them. Have you been feeling sick? Are you more tired than usual?\u201d</p><p>Lily smiled at the concern in Michael\u2019s voice. Though as a vet he treated animals, he still went all doctorly on her at the first sign of any illness or upset.</p><p>\u201cQueasy. And yes, tired. Like oh-my-God tired. And my breasts are sore. But the fatigue was what clued me in. It was exactly how I felt with Rose\u2014like I didn\u2019t even want to get out of bed. I felt that way for much of my pregnancy, and it\u2019s why I never really recovered when I went home with her.\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s expression grew fierce. \u201cThat won\u2019t happen this time. You\u2019re going to rest. You aren\u2019t going to lift a finger. And after the baby is born, you\u2019re coming home and you\u2019re not going to do anything more than hold or feed the baby.\u201d</p> <p>Her heart ached at the protectiveness in his voice. If only she\u2019d had them when Rose was born. So many if-onlys. She reached down to place a hand on her still-flat belly. She couldn\u2019t bring Rose back. And she couldn\u2019t replace her. But she could give birth to her brother or sister, and a part of Rose would live on.</p><p>Dillon picked up her hand and pressed a gentle kiss to her palm. \u201cI love you, Lily. We\u2019ll take care of you and our baby. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward and hugged him tightly. He wrapped his arms around her and held on. He trembled against her, so much emotion shuddering through his big body.</p><p>\u201cI know you will, Dillon. I love you too. So much. You and Michael and Seth saved me. You save me every day.\u201d</p><p>When she pulled away, Michael tugged her into his arms and cradled her close.</p> <p>\u201cDo you want to tell the rest of the family or would you rather wait awhile?\u201d</p><p>Lily hesitated. \u201cI thought it would be a great Christmas present. For everyone. A new Colter. The first grandchild for your parents. Everyone will be together this year. Somehow it just seems fitting to break the news then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a wonderful idea,\u201d Seth said, joy lighting his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I think would be an even more wonderful idea?\u201d she said in a low, husky voice.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s hands tightened on her thighs as though he recognized the tone in her voice and knew exactly what it was she was up to.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Dillon asked in a near growl.</p> <p>\u201cIf you all took me to bed and made love to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell yes,\u201d Michael said as he rose from the couch. He was already reaching for her, pulling her up from Dillon\u2019s lap.</p><p>He swept her into his arms, cradling her against his heart. He gazed down at her, relief and love like a beacon shining in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his voice hoarse and a little shaky.</p><p>She reached up to touch his face. \u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>He carried her toward the bedroom, followed by Seth and Dillon. Once there, he laid her gently on the bed and kissed her deep and sweet.</p><p>There was a reverence to their every touch as they undressed her. Their touches were gentle, so much so that it made her chest tighten and ache. Their fingers stroked, their palms caressed, and their lips kissed.</p><p>She lay there naked, spread out before them as they stood over the bed, their gazes riveted. Their eyes brimmed with love, with adoration. Tears burned her lids because she could feel their love. They didn\u2019t just say the words. They lived them each and every day.</p> <p>It had nearly broken her when Seth had asked if she no longer wanted the relationship with him and his brothers. Never did she want them to doubt her love or her commitment.</p><p>She watched as they undressed. She never tired of seeing their bodies, of holding her breath as each piece of clothing fell away. They still did that to her. Still made her light-headed and turned her on with nothing more than a stare.</p><p>Michael was the leanest of the three. Taut, muscled. Not as broad shouldered as his brothers, but he was a bit taller. While Seth and Dillon had short, clean haircuts, Michael had shoulder-length, mussed hair that she found adorably sexy. She always thought it was his one rebellion. Nothing about him would make anyone think he was a rebel. He was extremely intelligent, quiet, and tended to be serious.</p><p>Seth was broader and his muscles more developed. He maintained a disciplined fitness regimen, especially since he\u2019d been laid up and out of work for several months after being shot two years ago.</p><p>Dillon was the stockiest of the three. Massive shoulders, bulging arms that sported tattoos. He had an I-don\u2019t-give-a-fuck attitude that often irritated others, but those who knew him knew he had a heart of gold and when he loved, he loved with all his heart, deeply and without reservation. He was loyal to his toes. All the Colters were. It was a principle drilled into them from birth.</p><p>Family wasn\u2019t just something. It was everything.</p><p>Dillon leaned over her, pressing his hard, warm body to hers. He was careful to hold most of his weight off her as he stared down into her eyes. He stroked his fingers through her hair and then leaned down to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cAre you more sensitive now?\u201d he asked huskily. \u201cI\u2019ve heard women\u2019s breasts can be painful during early pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re extremely tender. They feel bigger, and if I so much as bump into something, it\u2019s like stubbing a toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll be extra careful with you.\u201d</p><p>He moved to the side of her, laid back, and then reached for her arm. \u201cGet on top,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cI want to look at you, and I know they do too.\u201d</p><p>Seth took her hand and helped her sit up, and then Michael was there, helping her slide over Dillon\u2019s thighs. She settled just below his straining erection, allowing it to rest against her belly.</p><p>No one could resist such temptation.</p><p>She wrapped her fingers around the thick base and gently slid her hand upward to the tip. The bed dipped and Michael and Seth got in on either side of her. Seth leaned in, kissing her shoulder, nipping gently. Michael cupped one breast ever so gently in his palm, then leaned down to brush a light kiss across the top.</p><p>Her nipple immediately hardened and instead of aching discomfort, she ached for his touch. She wanted his mouth, even knowing how hypersensitive her breasts were at the moment.</p><p>Dillon slid his hands up her legs and over her hips to her waist. Then he lifted her, positioning her so she was over his cock.</p><p>There was a sense of urgency, almost as if he couldn\u2019t wait to get inside her, to reaffirm his possession. As soon as she pushed down, enveloping his hardness, his nostrils flared and his eyes closed.</p><p>His hands shook at her hips and then he tightened his grip as she took him all.</p><p>Seth turned her face to his, kissing her long and deep. \u201cIs it okay? He\u2019s not hurting you, is he?\u201d</p><p>She returned his kiss hungrily, wanting more. She wanted it all. All three men loving and cherishing her. Making love to her as only they could.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut I want more. I want you.\u201d</p><p>Seth sucked in his breath. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou won\u2019t hurt me, Seth. The baby is safe. We don\u2019t have to stop making love. At least not for a while. I need you.\u201d</p><p>The soft plea turned his eyes warm and soft but then they glittered and his pupils dilated. His breathing sped up as he pulled back and pushed up from the bed. A moment later he returned and rained a trail of kisses down her spine, to the small of her back, and then over the curve of her behind.</p><p>His fingers were gentle as he parted her cheeks. The lubricant was warm, as if he\u2019d rubbed it between his hands so it wouldn\u2019t be cold. His fingers slid easily inward, easing the passageway.</p><p>For several breathless moments, she remained still, mounted on top of Dillon, whose cock was hard and deep within her. She tried not to move as Seth\u2019s fingers worked sensuously in and out of her tight opening.</p><p>Her pussy tightened around Dillon\u2019s cock with each stroke of Seth\u2019s hand and Dillon groaned, his fingers digging into her waist.</p><p>Michael stayed to her other side as Seth carefully positioned himself at her entrance. Michael stroked her hair, caressed her breast with featherlike touches, and then bent down to run his tongue over the taut peak.</p><p>She sighed, or maybe it was a moan. She was edgy and itchy all over. Eager, impatient. They were being so incredibly careful and she loved them for it. Maybe she even needed this gentleness from them when she felt so vulnerable.</p><p>They weren\u2019t in any hurry, and they seemed determined that each movement fully express how much they adored her.</p><p>\u201cI want to taste you,\u201d she whispered against Michael\u2019s lips as he returned to kiss her.</p><p>He smiled but shook his head. \u201cThis is all for you, baby. We\u2019re not taking. We\u2019re giving. I\u2019m just going to stay right here and I\u2019m going to kiss you and tell you how much I love you while Seth and Dillon bring you as much pleasure as they can. And then afterward, I\u2019m going to hold you and our child while you sleep.\u201d</p><p>The beauty and sincerity of his words clutched at her heart. She reached over, thrust her hand into his hair, and pulled him closer so she could lock her lips to his as Seth slid past the resistance of her body.</p><p>She gasped into Michael\u2019s mouth. The sudden fullness was overwhelming, as it always was. No matter how often they took her in this fashion, the thrill never wore off. It was always as exciting as the very first time.</p><p>\u201cTell me how it feels,\u201d Michael growled into her mouth. \u201cTell me what it feels like to have them both inside you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike heaven,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI so love when all three of you are a part of me. Inside me. Showing me your love and allowing me to show you mine.\u201d</p><p>Michael\u2019s hand fisted in her hair just as Seth and Dillon found their rhythm. Dillon held her more gently now, his hands on her hips, holding her in place for their combined thrusts.</p><p>Her eyes were half-lidded as she stared into Michael\u2019s eyes. Her hair was drawn tight, the strands wrapped around his fingers as he held his fist firm.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged softly.</p><p>Michael blew out his breath in a ragged spurt. \u201cLike I could damn well refuse you anything.\u201d</p><p>He maneuvered up, standing and leaning back toward the headboard. Then, using one hand as leverage against the wall and leaving the other tightly wound in her hair, he pushed his hips forward until his cock pressed against her mouth.</p><p>She ran her tongue over the tip, appreciating the moan that spilled from his lips. Then she sucked him inside, wanting that last connection.</p><p>They were all three a part of her. Deep inside her.</p><p>She relaxed, allowing the tension to ease and the fear that had knotted her insides for so long to slide away.</p><p>She let them take the reins. Let them have control. She trusted them. She was in their hands. In their care.</p><p>Closing her eyes, she inhaled deeply and took Michael as far as she could, savoring the taste and feel of him on her tongue.</p><p>Seth slid deeper into her body in an alternating rhythm with Dillon. When Seth pulled back, Dillon sank deep. When Dillon retreated, Seth pushed forward.</p><p>Their movements were exquisitely tender. No hurry. No frantic race to completion. It was as if they\u2019d determined that they had all the time in the world and they weren\u2019t rushing a damn thing.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s hands left her hips and trailed up her belly, pausing for a moment to caress her abdomen. Then he went higher, palming both of her breasts in the most tender of gestures.</p><p>He ran both thumbs lightly over the puckered nipples, all the while making sure he didn\u2019t press too hard.</p><p>\u201cTouch yourself, Lily,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>Having long since lost her self-consciousness when it came to lovemaking, she lowered one hand to Dillon\u2019s taut abdomen and then trailed her fingers down to his groin where their bodies met and meshed.</p><p>She slid her fingers between them, through damp folds, until she stroked over her clitoris.</p><p>Immediately her body tightened all over. Seth and Dillon both let out strangled sounds. Her mouth molded tighter around Michael\u2019s cock and his fingers tangled in her hair once more, holding her in place while he stroked back and forth over her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Dillon murmured. \u201cPleasure yourself. I want to see you come apart right in front of my eyes. I want to feel you tighten all around my dick and then bathe me in your heat.\u201d</p><p>Her nostrils flared and her body began to tremble all over in response to the seductive words. Dillon had such a wicked tongue. He had a way with words that never failed to tilt her right over the edge. He could talk a woman to orgasm. She was convinced of it.</p><p>Seth\u2019s hands gripped her behind, held her as he began to thrust more forcefully.</p><p>She was teetering. So close. So very close.</p><p>She rubbed her clit in a circular motion, stroking the taut, sensitive bud with one finger. Harder. Faster.</p><p>The world went hazy around her. All she was aware of was pleasure. Beautiful, never-ending pleasure. And the love of the three men who\u2019d changed her life forever.</p><p>Inside her. All of them. Deep. Loving.</p><p>She let out a soft cry around Michael\u2019s erection and then went liquid in their arms. Seth and Dillon both held her up, supporting her with gentle hands. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Michael slid out of her mouth, though she knew he hadn\u2019t come, and she slumped forward onto Dillon\u2019s chest as Seth shuddered behind her, in the throes of his own orgasm.</p><p>Dillon twitched, arched his hips up one last time and then he closed his eyes and wrapped his arms solidly around her, holding her as he poured himself into her body.</p><p>For the longest time, she lay there, softly panting, eyes closed as she savored the aftermath. All too soon, Dillon shifted and then she found herself lifted into Michael\u2019s arms. He turned, rolling with her so she was nestled into his side on the bed.</p><p>She snuggled into his embrace, tangling her legs with his. She wanted to be close. Didn\u2019t want any space between them.</p> <p>And then Seth was behind her, molding himself to her back, one leg thrown over hers so she was completely and utterly surrounded by him and Michael.</p><p>She smiled against Michael\u2019s neck. This was love. This was her life.</p><p>This was home.</p><p>CHAPTER 11</p><p>CALLIE sat at the vanity in her bedroom brushing her hair, but her gaze never left Max as he shrugged out of his shirt and prepared to go shower.</p> <p>He wouldn\u2019t take long. He never did. Not when he showered alone. Which he\u2019d been doing with increasing frequency lately.</p><p>Usually ... She stroked through her hair again and frowned as she watched him disappear into the bathroom. Usually he took her into the shower, washed her hair and every inch of her body. Then and only then did he quickly see to his own shower, and when they were done, he\u2019d dry her body and her hair and then she\u2019d await his next instruction.</p><p>Chill bumps danced across her skin at the memory of some of those instructions.</p><p>One simply never knew with Max.</p><p>His power and his confidence enticed her. His dominance gave her a measure of comfort nothing else could.</p><p>In his arms, she was free to be herself. He was her center, her anchor. A safe haven for her free spirit and wanderlust. Because no matter where she went, where she was, if she was with Max, she was home.</p> <p>She continued to brush her hair even though there wasn\u2019t a single knot and the strands were starting to fuzz out from static electricity. She was waiting. For Max.</p><p>Max wasn\u2019t himself, but then she could hardly blame him. His focus was on Lauren. But what Callie didn\u2019t like was the way Max seemed to be pushing Callie away.</p><p>She understood his worry and his concern. Knew that he was preoccupied with thoughts of his sister. But Callie was his wife and they were supposed to share everything. She knew without a doubt that if she had a family issue, he\u2019d be by her side, involved up to his nose, and he\u2019d do whatever he had to in order to help or support her.</p><p>She looked up when the door to the bathroom opened. Max stepped out still toweling his hair dry and wearing only a towel around his waist.</p><p>Her mouth went dry because the man was simply gorgeous. He still took her breath away. Still made her heart do this silly little stutter step every time she looked his way.</p><p>She laid the brush down and then turned on her seat to face him. He tossed aside the towel he\u2019d been using to dry his hair and then seemed to realize she was looking at him.</p><p>He caught her gaze and then his brow furrowed. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer right away. Nervous butterflies scuttled around her belly before her chin finally came up and she felt calm descend.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are you avoiding me, Max?\u201d</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise that wasn\u2019t faked. \u201cAvoid you? Where the hell would you get an idea like that?\u201d</p><p>She rose and walked toward him. She allowed her robe to fall away until she stood naked before him. Then she gracefully slid to her knees, lifting her chin so she could once more look him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re avoiding this,\u201d she said softly. \u201cUs. The way we are. Who we are. Have you changed your mind, Max? Is this no longer what you want?\u201d</p><p>She pulled at one of the bands around her wrist, the implication being that she\u2019d remove it even though she couldn\u2019t without one of the tiny keys they both owned, but his hand was quick to clamp around her wrist, holding the band tightly in place.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cGod no, Callie, don\u2019t take it off. Those mean more than our wedding rings. Is this what you want? Is this what you\u2019re trying to tell me?\u201d</p><p>She stayed on her knees, his fingers still wrapped tightly around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t touched me,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI understand why you wouldn\u2019t demonstrate your dominance of me in front of Lauren or others. We agreed that what we do is private and not for the world to see. But even in the privacy of our bedroom, you\u2019ve stopped ... you\u2019ve stopped everything. What am I to think other than that this isn\u2019t what you want?\u201d</p><p>He went to his knees in front of her, only the second time ever that he\u2019d put himself in an equally vulnerable position with her. He grasped her face between his hands, his eyes dark and earnest.</p><p>\u201cYou are my life, Callie. If anything I\u2019ve said or done has made you doubt that even for a moment, I\u2019m sorry. I would never have you feel that way.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head because this wasn\u2019t about her pouting and being dramatic. She didn\u2019t want to bring him low. She just wanted her Max back. Dominant, badass Max who always had a firm hand with her.</p><p>\u201cI just want to know what\u2019s changed. Is it Lauren? Do I need to spell it out? We\u2019re currently existing just like a normal couple with an average marriage and an average sex life. We aren\u2019t normal, Max. I submit to you. I choose to submit. Wholly. With no reservations. That doesn\u2019t mean sometimes or when I feel like it. It\u2019s always. I made that commitment. It\u2019s what I need. It\u2019s what I want. But ever since we brought Lauren home, you\u2019ve done everything but act the dominant counterpart. If anything, you\u2019ve backed way off and have been careful not to seem remotely demanding in any aspect of our relationship.\u201d</p><p>Max leaned his forehead against Callie\u2019s and she felt the tremor of emotion flow through his body and into hers.</p><p>Slowly he rose and then extended his hand down to her. Wordlessly. Just a look that told her it wasn\u2019t a request. Relief surged, making her shaky as she allowed him to pull her to her feet. He led her to the bed, pulled the covers back, and then motioned for her to crawl in.</p><p>He then sat on the edge, his body angled so he faced her. His expression was serious and a little uncertain. This wasn\u2019t the Max she was used to.</p><p>\u201cWhen I saw her,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cWhen I saw the bruises, when she told me what happened and she explained the relationship she had with this asshole, it sickened me. And then I began to think, is this me? Am I like that?\u201d</p><p>Callie gasped. Of all the things she thought might be wrong, this certainly hadn\u2019t been a consideration. It horrified her that Max was mentally comparing himself to the man who\u2019d abused his sister.</p><p>He shook his head, a silent command for her to remain quiet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m controlling. You know this. I know this. From the day we met, I took over. I took, you gave. I dominated, you submitted. Some of the things that we do ... God, Callie, can you imagine how someone looking in from the outside would view our relationship? Can you imagine if Lauren walked in when you\u2019re across my lap and I\u2019m spanking your ass? Or when I have you tied up and I\u2019m fucking your ass after I\u2019ve reddened it with a crop? How do you think that would look to her? Hell, she\u2019d be calling nineone-one.\u201d</p><p>Callie swallowed hard but remained silent as he continued.</p><p>\u201cDo you know what would happen if one of your fathers or your brothers ever saw the marks on your body from one of our encounters? You have to know that I\u2019m extremely careful with placement so that you don\u2019t have to answer uncomfortable questions to your family and so they won\u2019t come after me with a shotgun. Because if they ever so much as thought that I was hurting you, they\u2019d kill me, dolcezza. They\u2019d do it without remorse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh Max,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t you see the difference?\u201d</p><p>Max closed his eyes. \u201cI used to see it. Or rather, I thought I did. I told myself that I loved you and that you loved me and that this was a consensual relationship. I justified it in my head. I made excuses. But then I really looked hard and I asked myself what made me any different than the bastard who put those bruises on Lauren\u2019s body?\u201d</p><p>Callie leaned forward, cupping Max\u2019s jaw in her palm. With her other hand, she laced her fingers through his and brought his hand up until it lay against her heart.</p><p>\u201cWhen you aren\u2019t so raw with grief over what\u2019s happened to Lauren, you\u2019ll realize how very different the situations are. You do nothing that I don\u2019t want. You do nothing that we haven\u2019t agreed upon. I can say no at any time. You pamper and spoil me endlessly. You take care of me. You give me everything I could ever possibly need or want. And you love me.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love Lauren. He wanted to control her. He wanted to hurt her. He wanted to intimidate her. To him she was a thing. Something to vent his temper on. When have you ever touched me in anger? When have you ever lost control and struck me in anger?\u201d</p><p>Max still looked indecisive and tortured.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to say that I don\u2019t know the difference between love and abuse?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cThat I don\u2019t have a mind of my own and that you do all my thinking for me? That I\u2019m just a puppet dancing on your strings? That I obey without question or that I\u2019m too afraid to stand up to you?\u201d</p><p>He visibly recoiled. \u201cHell no. You\u2019re one of the strongest willed women I know.\u201d</p><p>She smiled then and caressed the lines on his face. \u201cThen tell me how on earth you think you\u2019d ever get away with abusing me. Forget my dads and my brothers. If you ever crossed the line, it isn\u2019t them you\u2019d need to worry about. It\u2019s me, because I\u2019d kick your fucking ass all over this mountain. There wouldn\u2019t be anything left for my fathers or brothers to mangle when I was finished with you.\u201d</p><p>His expression eased and his lips twitched upward into a smile.</p><p>\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that I\u2019m being a complete idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yes, I suppose that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying,\u201d she said with a grin.</p><p>He gathered her in his arms and held her tightly, his face buried in her hair. \u201cI love you, Callie. So damn much. I don\u2019t want to ever be without you. I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I ever hurt you, if I ever abused your trust in me.\u201d</p><p>She nestled her face in his neck, inhaling his scent.</p><p>When he finally pulled away, his face was somber. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do to help her, Callie. For the first several days I felt like the worst sort of fraud. God, I felt ashamed, like I was some hypocrite and that I wasn\u2019t worthy of any better treatment than the son of a bitch who beat her.\u201d</p><p>Callie smiled softly, allowing her love to shine through. \u201cJust being here for her is helping. Us going to get her, not allowing her to close herself off and wallow in shame\u2014that\u2019s helping. She\u2019s going to be fine. It\u2019ll take time. The best thing you can do is not treat her like she\u2019s broken. Don\u2019t tiptoe around her. Treat her like she\u2019s part of the family and that we\u2019re thrilled she\u2019s here. The rest will come in time.\u201d</p><p>Max let his hand wander through her hair and then down to her bare breasts, where he toyed idly with her nipples. \u201cHas anyone ever told you that you\u2019re a wise woman, Callie Wilder?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cNo, I can honestly say that no one in my family has ever accused me of being anything but flighty and free-spirited. Wise doesn\u2019t exactly fit in there anywhere.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her temple and squeezed her tight again. \u201cYou\u2019re my everything, dolcezza. And where you fit is right here with me. Always.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t hold back,\u201d she begged. \u201cI need you, Max. I need your dominance, your strength. Your control. I need that structure. It centers me. It reminds me that I have a place in this world. With you.\u201d</p><p>He let his hands slide down to the bands circling her wrists. The bands he\u2019d placed there as a symbol of his ownership. To him, they were more important than their wedding rings. They meant more. They went deeper.</p><p>\u201cNever take these off,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear it.\u201d</p><p>She extended both wrists, holding them upward in supplication. \u201cI\u2019m yours, Max. I don\u2019t want to ever be anything else. I\u2019ll never take them off unless you ask me to.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward, finding her lips in the sweetest of kisses. \u201cGood, because I\u2019m never going to ask.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 12</p><p>HOLLY awoke in the middle of the night shivering, and the ache in her lower side had intensified to a fiery pain that wasn\u2019t alleviated by movement. Ryan lay sleeping beside her, but no one was on her other side. Adam and Ethan had evidently taken to their own beds instead of crashing in the common bedroom tonight.</p><p>She pushed to the vacant side, careful not to awaken Ryan. Her feet hit the cold floor and she shivered as another chill overtook her. Fire splintered through her side and she hunched over, grabbing for the edge of the bed to steady herself. Nausea welled in her throat and she swallowed hard against the urge to vomit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She managed to stagger into the kitchen, and she opened the medicine cabinet to get some ibuprofen. After shaking out four pills, she returned the bottle and started toward the cabinet for a glass.</p><p>Pain assaulted her, spearing through her, robbing her of breath. She fell, hitting the floor with a thud, driving the air from her lungs in a painful rush. She lay there, balled into a fetal position, afraid to move because the pain was so horrific.</p><p>Something was terribly, terribly wrong.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she called weakly. \u201cAdam? Ethan?\u201d</p> <p>Darkness hovered on the fringes. She fought unconsciousness as the pain intensified. She heard a distant sound, tried to call out again, but the blackness swirled until she was dizzy with it.</p><p>RYAN awoke, a frown turning his lips downward. It was automatic to reach for Holly, a habit he hadn\u2019t broken in over thirty years. But she wasn\u2019t there. Something had awakened him. His name. He could swear he\u2019d heard her call.</p><p>Throwing aside the covers, he hurried out of bed and into the hall. No lights were on in the house and it was silent. The fire had long since died out in the living room and only a few glowing embers remained.</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d he called.</p><p>Something like dread pitted his stomach and clutched at his throat. He hadn\u2019t checked his brothers\u2019 bedrooms because he\u2019d just known that wasn\u2019t where she was. After surveying the living room, he walked toward the kitchen and damn near tripped over her before he\u2019d gotten far.</p> <p>His heart bottomed out. He dropped to his knees, yelling her name hoarsely. She was in a tiny ball, knees drawn up as if she were in unimaginable pain. Her skin was hot and dry to the touch. He immediately felt for a pulse, relieved to find a steady rhythm against his fingers.</p><p>\u201cAdam! Ethan!\u201d he roared. \u201cGet in here!\u201d</p><p>Gently, he collected Holly in his arms, unsure of what to do. He only knew he wasn\u2019t leaving her lying on the cold floor.</p><p>Not ten seconds later, his brothers ran down the hall and appeared in the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Adam barked.</p><p>Ethan crowded into Ryan, his hands going to Holly\u2019s face and then her neck, frantic, just as Ryan had been to feel the reassuring pulse pattern.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with her?\u201d Ethan demanded.</p><p>\u201cI woke up when I thought I heard her call for me. She was gone and so I got up and found her on the floor,\u201d Ryan said grimly. \u201cGet the keys. We have to get her to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>His words sent his brothers in different directions. Ethan grabbed a blanket and tossed it over her as Ryan headed for the door. Adam sprinted toward the bedroom and returned a moment later, dressed and holding the keys to the SUV.</p><p>\u201cGet me some damn clothes,\u201d Ryan bit out in Ethan\u2019s direction. \u201cYou can change on the way and I\u2019ll get dressed when we get there.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t about to let Holly go long enough to rectify his current mode of undress.</p><p>FOUR hours later, the three brothers paced around the waiting room, edgy, silent, worried sick. The doors burst open and their children rushed in, their faces white, eyes filled with fear.</p><p>Adam immediately went into protective mode. His wife was in surgery and he was scared out of his mind, but he didn\u2019t want his sons and his daughter to be as afraid as he was.</p><p>\u201cDaddy,\u201d Callie said, rushing into his arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Mama? What happened?\u201d</p> <p>Adam crushed her to him and held on a long moment while his sons went to stand by their other two dads. Lily stood back with Max, but she looked no less concerned than everyone else.</p><p>Adam pulled away from Callie and motioned his brood into one of the smaller side rooms usually reserved for the doctor to speak to the family. When everyone was pushed inside, he took a deep breath and glanced over at his brothers.</p><p>\u201cYour mother is in surgery.\u201d</p><p>Dillon looked crushed. Michael\u2019s lips drew into a grim line, and Seth looked utterly baffled, as if he couldn\u2019t quite grasp it all.</p><p>Callie\u2019s eyes filled with tears and Max wrapped a supportive arm around her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Dillon croaked out, his voice choked with fear.</p><p>\u201cAppendicitis,\u201d Ethan said quietly. \u201cThey believe it may have already ruptured. They didn\u2019t waste a lot of time going in. We won\u2019t know more until the doctor comes out of surgery.\u201d</p><p>No one looked as though they had any idea what to say or do. They stood numbly, staring at one another, helpless anxiety reflected in their gazes. If Holly were here, she\u2019d take charge. She\u2019d soothe everyone. Do what she did best. Love with all her heart and warm the entire world inside and out.</p><p>Adam sank into his chair, his legs no longer able to hold him up. Callie immediately wrapped her arms around him, hugging him tightly. \u201cShe\u2019ll be all right, Daddy,\u201d she whispered fiercely. \u201cShe loves you all too much to go down. She\u2019ll probably be back on her feet in no time. You know she wouldn\u2019t miss Christmas for the world.\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled faintly, amused by the fact that his precious daughter was the one providing comfort for him. It was his job to protect his children. His wife. Only now his sons and his daughter were gathered around, offering their support to him and his brothers.</p><p>All through the rest of the night, they sat in grim silence, and the realization of just how important a role Holly played in their family was outlined in stark reality. She was the very center. The heart and soul. The one around whom the rest of the family revolved. Every heart. Every child. Every man. They all loved her with a fierceness that couldn\u2019t be described, only felt.</p><p>She was everything to this family, and Adam didn\u2019t even want to contemplate how they would survive without her. She was their strength. Their light. The glue that held them all together.</p><p>He could see her in every one of his children. Callie\u2019s infectious smile. Her exuberance for life. Her kindness and gentleness. Her fierce stubbornness and her endless capacity for love and her undying loyalty to those she loved.</p><p>Seth\u2019s steadfastness. His quiet strength. His resilience. Michael\u2019s intelligence. His work ethic. His quiet spirit. The way Dillon loved with all his heart and soul. Just like Holly.</p><p>\u201cDaddy?\u201d Callie whispered. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t posed as a question but he could hear the uncertainty in his daughter\u2019s voice. She was trying to offer him the encouragement she so desperately needed herself.</p><p>Adam drew her into a hug. \u201cYes, baby. Your mother\u2019s going to be fine. She\u2019s a fighter through and through. She\u2019s been down before, much worse than this, and she refused to stay down.\u201d</p><p>Just then the doctor came into the small room and everyone looked up, the sudden silence tense and forbidding. Tension coiled and snaked through the room. Dread mounted and everyone leaned forward, eager to hear what the doctor would say.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Colter is out of surgery,\u201d the doctor began.</p><p>Not able to contain himself another moment, Adam shot to his feet, but Ethan beat him to the doctor.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Ethan demanded. \u201cWill she be all right? When can we see her?\u201d</p><p>The surgeon held up a placating hand. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine. She\u2019ll make a full recovery. We were able to remove her appendix before it burst. I\u2019ll want her to stay in the hospital a day or two so I can be certain there\u2019s no infection or leakage, but if all goes well she\u2019ll be home before Christmas.\u201d</p><p>The relief in the room was palpable. Adam\u2019s shoulders sagged and his eyes burned with sudden tears. Holly was his life. His entire life. And, oh God, he couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Dillon\u2019s arm went around him and Adam turned, hugging his son fiercely as the others comforted one another.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we see her?\u201d Ethan asked hoarsely.</p><p>The doctor eyed the room full of people with doubt. \u201cYou can\u2019t all see her. One of you can go in when she gets out of recovery.\u201d</p><p>Ryan scowled. \u201cHell no. We can manage three, but we\u2019re going in to see her.\u201d</p><p>The doctor cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s customary for a spouse to have access. The rest of the family must wait until she\u2019s in a room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are her damn husbands,\u201d Ryan snarled. He jabbed his thumb into his chest and then jerked it over his shoulder to point at Ethan and Adam.</p><p>The doctor\u2019s brows lifted and he went silent. He fiddled with his clipboard and uneasily fidgeted. \u201cUh, well, there isn\u2019t a precedent for this. Perhaps you should take it up with the nurse in charge.\u201d</p><p>After saying that, the doctor beat a hasty retreat, muttering under his breath as he went.</p><p>Ryan turned back to Adam and Ethan. \u201cLet\u2019s go. They\u2019ll let us in or I\u2019ll tear this damn place apart.\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled, the tension escaping in a rush. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a good track record with hospitals, man.\u201d He turned to Adam. \u201cRemember when his cranky ass was shot and he pissed off every nurse and doctor in the ER and on the floor until they put him in the same room as Holly?\u201d</p><p>Adam smiled but his heart clutched at that long-ago memory. At the moment he knew he\u2019d be every bit as forceful as Ryan if they dared to keep him away from his wife.</p><p>CHAPTER 13</p><p>IT was as if time had stopped and for the moment Christmas had been suspended into a nebulous cloud that floated above the Colter family. Everyone refused to even contemplate the holiday without Holly at home, surrounded by her family.</p><p>She was, as Adam had asserted, the very center, the heart and soul of her husbands and children.</p><p>Holly sat in the hospital bed, her fingers gripping the sheet as she considered her options. With Christmas just a few days away, the very last thing she wanted was to be stuck in a hospital room when she could be at home, surrounded by the family she so dearly loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not asking, Dr. Hollister,\u201d she said calmly, because she\u2019d long ago discovered that calm was hard to argue with. \u201cI\u2019d like to be discharged today. I understand your concerns, and I\u2019ll heed your instructions to the letter, but I would recover more rapidly in my own home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing like throwing me to the wolves,\u201d the doctor said dryly. \u201cThose husbands of yours will kick my ass if I let you walk out of here before they believe it\u2019s time. Hard to remember who has the medical degree here.\u201d</p><p>The light sarcasm in his voice made Holly grin. Dr. Hollister had been Holly\u2019s physician for years. He was well acquainted with her unusual situation, just as he was very well acquainted with her husbands\u2019 huge protective streak when it came to her.</p><p>\u201cI want to be home for Christmas,\u201d she said, an ache in her voice that was more pronounced than any residual pain from her surgery. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be so wonderful this year. And I\u2019m cooking!\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hollister stared at her over his glasses and tactfully cleared his throat. \u201cWell, maybe it\u2019s best if you aren\u2019t puttering around a kitchen quite yet.\u201d</p><p>Holly snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve listened to far too many stories about my lack of ability in the kitchen. My daughter-in-law is a dream cook, and she\u2019s taught me how to make the most awesome holiday dinner.\u201d Her smile softened wistfully. \u201cAll my babies are going to be home this year. That hasn\u2019t happened in so long. We always have most, but not everyone. No way I\u2019m going to miss that.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Hollister smiled indulgently. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you go, Holly. I don\u2019t fool myself into thinking that if I said no you\u2019d actually listen to me. But I want you to follow my care instructions to the letter, and don\u2019t think I won\u2019t outline them in great detail to your husbands.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cI\u2019m not staying in bed twenty-four/seven. Just so you know. Don\u2019t even hint to my husbands that this is part of your care plan.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and shook his head. \u201cWhat I\u2019m going to tell them is that you are to resume normal activities with caution and that you are to rest perhaps more than usual until you\u2019re feeling more yourself again. I want you to take your medications and I want you to listen to your body, Holly. I\u2019m serious about this. If it\u2019s telling you to slow down and rest, then do it. You don\u2019t want to end up back in the hospital, I assume?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head vigorously.</p><p>\u201cThen follow my instructions and we\u2019ll all be happy. Your husbands included.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she grumbled. \u201cHow soon can you have me discharged?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cOne-track mind you have. Give me an hour, okay? I need to give the nurse my report and write your scripts. She\u2019ll be down to set you loose as soon as I\u2019m done. Happy?\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him. \u201cThanks, Pete. You know I appreciate you.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cYou only appreciate me when you\u2019re bending me to your will.\u201d He leaned over to give her a kiss on the cheek. \u201cTake care of yourself, okay? I\u2019ll want to see you again in a week. If you don\u2019t want to drive up to the city, I\u2019ll be happy to come out on a Saturday.\u201d</p><p>Holly snagged his hand and squeezed. Over the years, Pete Hollister had become a family friend. During that terrible time when she\u2019d been attacked and then had discovered her pregnancy, he\u2019d been a rock. And because she\u2019d trusted him, she\u2019d continued to seek his medical care in the years afterward. She and her husbands had donated a large sum of money to fund his clinic for those who couldn\u2019t afford healthcare and had no insurance, and as a result he felt deep loyalty to the Colters. It was nothing for him to drop everything and make the trip to Clyde if one of them needed care beyond what the general practitioner in Clyde provided. And, well, he didn\u2019t seem to trust others to care for the Colters. He\u2019d sort of adopted them, and while he gave her husbands grief over being so protective of her, he was just as protective of the Colters as a whole. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThanks, Pete,\u201d she said again. \u201cI hope you have a merry Christmas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot seeing you in my hospital again will make my holidays go a lot better.\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled and nodded and then sank back onto the pillows behind her as the doctor left the room. A few moments later, the door swung open again and her husbands stalked in, suspicious looks on their faces.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said Pete wasn\u2019t coming by until later.\u201d Ryan said with a scowl. \u201cWe just passed him in the hall and it looked like he\u2019d just come out of your room.\u201d</p> <p>Holly put her hands over her lap and smiled serenely. \u201cHe did.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed. \u201cLet me guess. You strong-armed him into letting you go and you sent us out on a fool\u2019s errand so we wouldn\u2019t be here to disagree.\u201d</p><p>She grinned because she wasn\u2019t about to try and deny it. Her husbands knew her far too well.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d Ethan grumbled as he sat on the edge of the bed next to her. \u201cDo you even want what we brought back for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes! I\u2019m starving,\u201d she said, pouncing on the bag Ethan held out.</p> <p>\u201cDo you even have time to eat?\u201d Adam drawled. \u201cOr will you be pushed out of here in the next fifteen minutes?\u201d</p><p>She made a face. \u201cI have an hour at least.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes went heavenward and he shook his head in resignation.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she said stubbornly. \u201cI\u2019m not spending Christmas in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>To emphasize her statement, she raised her arms and crossed them over her chest. She thrust out her chin in a gesture of defiance and sent them a mutinous glare.</p><p>Ryan leaned down and kissed her furrowed brow. \u201cWe worry about you. You know that.\u201d</p> <p>She went completely soft and she turned her face up to stare into those intense blue eyes so like Callie\u2019s. \u201cI know you do and I love you for it. But if you want what\u2019s best for me? That\u2019s to go home and be surrounded by my husbands and my children and to spend Christmas there. Not here. I can rest much easier there, and I\u2019ve already promised Pete I wouldn\u2019t overdo it. He\u2019s going to give you a list of dos and don\u2019ts so that he\u2019ll be sure you enforce them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always liked that man,\u201d Adam said approvingly.</p><p>Holly snorted. \u201cYou just like him because he sides with you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grinned beside her and tugged her hand into his. \u201cYou know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to be home,\u201d she said softly. \u201cThere\u2019s no other place I\u2019d rather be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we want you there,\u201d Adam said, emotion knotting his throat. \u201cYou gave us a scare, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ryan stroked her cheek with his palm and then lowered his lips to hers. \u201cDon\u2019t do that again.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best not to end up in the hospital ever again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what you said the last time,\u201d Ethan grumbled.</p><p>Knowing her food was getting cold, she gestured for the portable tray and Adam wheeled it over to the bed, sliding the arm over her lap so she\u2019d have a place to eat.</p><p>While she dug into the food, Ethan made phone calls to the boys and to Callie to let them know she was coming home that day.</p><p>Holly smiled in anticipation because she knew they\u2019d all be waiting. All gathered in her home, just where she liked them.</p><p>CHAPTER 14</p><p>SETH, Michael, and Dillon stood across the room from the couch where Lily lay sound asleep, and they smiled. She was curled on her side, head nestled on one of the cushions.</p><p>They were all tired. The last few days had been nerve-racking as they\u2019d waited for their mother to be released from the hospital. Now that she was finally home, the dads had banished all the children to their own homes to get some much-needed rest.</p><p>\u201cThis pregnancy seems to be kicking her ass,\u201d Seth said in a low voice. \u201cEven before the thing with Mom, I mean. I\u2019m as nervous as hell over this. I don\u2019t want her getting so beat down that she feels even for a moment like she did with Rose.\u201d</p><p>Dillon\u2019s expression grew fierce. \u201cThat ain\u2019t going to happen. I don\u2019t care if I have to sell the damn pub or have Callie take it over so I can spend every waking moment with Lily. I don\u2019t want her to ever feel that kind of despair again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Michael said somberly. \u201cShe\u2019s had a hard time coming to grips with this. I don\u2019t think she was ready. Hell, I\u2019m not even sure how she managed to get pregnant. I know birth control isn\u2019t foolproof but it still has a pretty damn good success rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo sense belaboring that point now,\u201d Seth said. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is how we make her feel from this point forward. I don\u2019t want her to doubt, even for a moment, our commitment to her and our child. I want her to go into the delivery room knowing that she has absolutely nothing to worry about this time.\u201d</p><p>Dillon nodded his agreement. His jaw was set into a fierce line and Seth knew he was probably already planning the next seven months and beyond. It wouldn\u2019t surprise Seth whatsoever if Dillon did let the management of the pub go. However, he doubted Max would ever allow Callie to take over the running of it full-time, and in this instance Seth would fully support his brother-in-law. Callie didn\u2019t need to be stuck behind the damn bar every night, nor did she need to be dragging home at all hours of the morning.</p><p>He\u2019d had his doubts about Max being the dominant force in his relationship with Callie. It had pissed him off, truth be told. But Max adored and worshipped Callie, and it was hard to find fault with the hard-ass when he would cut off his right arm before ever allowing any harm to come to Callie.</p><p>\u201cHas she been sick in the mornings?\u201d Michael asked.</p><p>Michael often left early, before everyone else was out of bed, so he wasn\u2019t around when Lily began her day. His workday started early at his veterinary clinic but he always made it a point to be home by the afternoon. It was a schedule they worked out together. Dillon, more often than not, worked evenings at the pub when things were busier. Callie covered some nights for him so he wasn\u2019t always away from home. Seth could be called out at literally any hour of the day or night. His traditional hours were eight to five, but it was rare for him to stick to that schedule. As sheriff he was on call twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, rain or shine, holiday or not.</p><p>But they\u2019d arranged it so that someone was always home with Lily, and now Seth was more grateful than ever that they\u2019d taken those steps.</p><p>Dillon grimaced. \u201cSome, yeah. The problem is that she\u2019s been sick at all intervals of the day.\u201d</p><p>Seth nodded. \u201cSmells seem to do her in more than anything. Painting\u2019s been hard for her in the past few days because the paint nauseates her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe walked by the cat litter yesterday and had to run for the bathroom to puke her guts up,\u201d Dillon said wryly.</p><p>Michael frowned. \u201cWhat the hell is she doing near the cat litter anyway? She\u2019s not supposed to be changing litter when she\u2019s pregnant. I swear I\u2019m going to get rid of that damn cat.\u201d</p><p>Seth snorted in amusement. As if Michael would ever get rid of Lily\u2019s precious cat. The stray had been dumped at the clinic on a day when Lily had been helping Michael, and she\u2019d given Michael puppy dog eyes, and voil\u00e0, the cat found a new home. With them. And it had been with them ever since.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say she changed the cat litter,\u201d Dillon said with a scowl. \u201cI said she walked by it. As in, by the mudroom where the litter is. The cat had just taken a dump and it did Lily in.\u201d</p><p>So deep were they in their discussion that they hadn\u2019t realized that Lily had awakened. Only when she moved to sit up did Seth notice.</p><p>Her eyes gleamed with amusement and a soft smile curved her lips. She leaned her elbow on the arm of the couch and rested her face in her palm as she stared at her husbands.</p><p>\u201cIf you could only hear yourselves,\u201d she teased. \u201cLike a bunch of mother hens.\u201d</p><p>Dillon moved toward the couch until he loomed over her. \u201cI highly doubt a mother hen thinks how much she\u2019d like to see you naked right about now.\u201d</p><p>She arched one dark brow and then her smile broadened.</p><p>\u201cOr what kind of vulgar, indecent things she\u2019d like to do to you,\u201d Michael offered as he went to sit beside her on the couch.</p><p>She laughed and then her gaze found Seth\u2019s. \u201cAnd you? Not going to add your two cents?\u201d</p><p>His let his gaze stroke silkily over her until she was well aware of just what occupied his thoughts. \u201cMy brothers talk too damn much. While they\u2019re telling you what they want to do to you, I\u2019m going to be showing you.\u201d</p><p>To prove his point, he pushed forward, pulled her to her feet before Dillon or Michael could react, and swept her into his arms, heading for the bedroom.</p><p>She laughed out loud at the what-the-fuck looks on his brothers\u2019 faces and it hit Seth right in the gut. She sounded and looked so damn beautiful. She looked happy. Her eyes were full of joy and warmth. The worry was gone, even if the signs of her fatigue were still etched in the lines of her face.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her forehead and closed his eyes as they entered the bedroom. How much had his life changed over the last year and a half? Not only had he found the love of his life in Lily, but he was closer than ever to his family. Surrounded by his brothers, his sister, and his mom and dads.</p><p>Now his child would grow up sheltered by the love and support of his family. The same love he and his siblings had been given as children.</p><p>\u201cSeth, are you all right?\u201d Lily asked softly.</p><p>He refocused his attention to see Lily staring up at him, her blue eyes shadowed with worry. Then he smiled. He honest to God wanted to spin her around in a dozen circles and do something crazy like let out a series of whoops, but it wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do with a pregnant woman who had a queasy stomach.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cI\u2019m just so damn happy.\u201d</p><p>He laid her on the bed with a gentle bounce. Dillon and Michael stood to the side as if waiting for him to finish his piece. Hell, what else was there to say? How could you possibly put words to indescribable joy?</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you know that.\u201d</p><p>The worry faded, replaced by warmth and answering love. \u201cI love you too, Seth. I hope you know I trust you.\u201d She moved her head to include his brothers in her gaze. \u201cI trust all of you. I know you\u2019ll help me through the pregnancy and afterward. Our child will be so loved. I don\u2019t doubt that even for a moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Michael said as he moved onto the bed beside her. He lay on his side, head propped in his palm as he gazed down at her. He put his hand over her belly, cupping protectively as if he were sending a silent message, a pledge of protection. And love.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered, in turn seeking each of her husbands\u2019 gazes. \u201cShow me your love.\u201d</p><p>Seth put both hands on the bed and lowered himself until their faces were just an inch apart and her lips delectably close. \u201cIf I have my way, you\u2019ll know our love every single day for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>MAX slipped from the warmth of his bed, reluctant to leave Callie. She was exhausted and worn down both physically and emotionally, and she\u2019d only just gotten over her bout with strep throat. Having her mother in the hospital and seeing how frightened her fathers had been had shaken Callie to the core.</p><p>Now that Holly was back home, the family breathed easier. The collective sigh of the entire town could be heard through the mountain air. Holly Colter was home. All was well.</p><p>But Max was driven to make Christmas extra special. More so than it would already be. He knew the Colters, and especially Holly, were thrilled to have all their children home for the holidays.</p><p>He and Callie had traveled last Christmas. He\u2019d taken her to Paris and London, where they\u2019d marveled at the Christmas lights and festivities, and then they\u2019d gone on to Germany, where they\u2019d spent days just absorbing the atmosphere.</p><p>Callie had been born a free spirit. It was how he\u2019d met her. She\u2019d been backpacking in Greece and he\u2019d been there for a short vacation of his own. As soon as he\u2019d laid eyes on her, he\u2019d known that she would alter his life forever.</p><p>He hadn\u2019t reacted well. It was shame he\u2019d forever live with. He\u2019d very nearly messed up the best thing that had ever happened to him, but thank God for Callie\u2019s forgiving spirit because he\u2019d messed up not once, but twice.</p><p>Yes, he and Callie both liked to roam. They were restless and eager to explore new places. But one thing he\u2019d realized in the time he and Callie had been married was that she belonged here. With her family. On this mountain. In her meadow, the place where she\u2019d been born. Callie\u2019s Meadow.</p><p>And oddly, he found himself craving the return to the warm embrace of the Colter family when he and Callie were away. It had been he who\u2019d suggested that they spend this Christmas with family. Not just Callie\u2019s family anymore, but his own. And now Lauren\u2019s. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He crept from the bedroom, knowing that if he wanted to get done what he\u2019d planned, it would take care and precision. But most of all, time. Time that was fast running out as Christmas approached.</p><p>When he reached the office in the corner of the downstairs level, just off the living room, he picked up the phone and began making calls. Money was no object. The work would have to be done at night. By the time he was finished, he was short a hefty amount of cash but he was satisfied that he\u2019d been assured that what he wanted would be done.</p><p>Now, however, he needed to go make damn sure that Callie\u2019s dads didn\u2019t end up shooting someone for trespassing in the dead of night.</p><p>If he hurried, he could make it back in time to cook breakfast for his girls. He smiled as the word simmered in his mind. His girls. The woman he loved more than anything and his baby sister. Both here and safe with him. Family.</p> <p>He went for his coat, grabbed the keys to the Range Rover, and headed out the door. Normally he\u2019d make the walk across the meadow to the Colters\u2019 cabin, but he wanted to make it back before Callie and Lauren got up.</p><p>A few minutes later, he pulled up to the Colters\u2019 cabin and slid out of the car. He was almost to the door when it opened and Ethan called out a greeting.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Max. What brings you out so early?\u201d</p><p>Max took the extended hand and shook it before following Ethan inside, where it was a good deal warmer. Already a fire blazed in the big stone hearth and the room was alive with the twinkling Christmas lights strung from the tree and along the mantel.</p><p>It just felt like home in this big, cozy cabin that had once housed hunters when the Colters had operated a guide service for elk hunting.</p> <p>\u201cHow is Holly?\u201d Max asked.</p><p>Ethan was quiet for a moment and his hand shook as he raised the cup of coffee he was holding to his lips. After he took a sip, he turned his gaze on Max. \u201cShe\u2019s doing better. She\u2019s happy to be home. She doesn\u2019t like to be away for long and being in the hospital was driving her crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d Max replied. \u201cI\u2019m glad she\u2019s home, and I know Callie is super relieved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we all are,\u201d Ethan said quietly. \u201cShe scared the hell out of us. It\u2019s a sobering wake-up call when you realize just how close you come to losing someone or how easily they can slip away.\u201d</p><p>But Max knew. He knew all too well because he\u2019d come so damn close to losing Callie that it still hurt him to think about it.</p><p>Adam walked into the living room, his head rearing back in surprise when he saw Max standing there.</p> <p>\u201cAnything the matter, son?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Max was a grown man, but it still gave him a ridiculous thrill when Adam called him son. It made him feel included. Like another of the Colter brothers. His place certainly hadn\u2019t always been assured in this family. He was lucky Callie\u2019s dads and brothers hadn\u2019t wiped the earth with him and ripped his nuts off. It certainly wasn\u2019t because they hadn\u2019t wanted to.</p><p>But now there was warmth and acceptance, and Max soaked it in. With the passing of his mother, he and Lauren had been left alone in the world. Having the Colters was something he treasured greatly, and he\u2019d go to any lengths to protect what he now considered his. They had his loyalty and his love.</p><p>\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d Max said. \u201cI wanted to see how Holly was doing so I could let Callie know when she gets up. She was pretty tired and I wanted to let her sleep, but I know the minute she wakes up, she\u2019s going to be worried about her mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nice of you,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cI know Holly will appreciate your concern. We all do.\u201d</p><p>Max glanced at both men. \u201cI also wanted to discuss something with you. A little surprise I have in mind for the women in the family.\u201d</p><p>At the mention of the women, Max had Adam\u2019s and Ethan\u2019s undivided attention. One thing he\u2019d quickly learned in the two years he\u2019d known this family was that the Colters treasured their women. They pampered them, spoiled them, and loved them beyond measure.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan, and do you need our help?\u201d Adam asked.</p> <p>Max smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t need your help, except in keeping the secret, of course. I will, however, need to make you aware that for the next several nights, you\u2019re going to have a crew crawling all over Callie\u2019s Meadow. I\u2019ve made sure they\u2019ll be coming late and leaving before dawn. Where I have it planned isn\u2019t easily visible from the road so I think we\u2019ll be safe. Plus, I know Holly won\u2019t be getting out and about, and if Callie\u2019s going to come over, I\u2019ll make damn sure I drive her myself.\u201d</p><p>Ethan grinned. \u201cHow well you know us. No, Holly won\u2019t be lifting so much as a damn finger between now and Christmas so you certainly won\u2019t have to worry about her finding out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, so tell us exactly what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Max smiled and then related everything he\u2019d just spent the last hour setting up over the phone. When he was done, both Ethan and Adam were smiling broadly. Adam slapped him on the back.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to love it.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 15</p><p>DO you remember our first Christmas together?\u201d Holly asked softly.</p><p>She was sitting on the couch, blanket hugged up all around her. Only her hands stuck out, clutching the cup of hot chocolate that Ryan had given her moments before.</p><p>The fire roared in the hearth and outside snow was falling at a steady pace. If she was feeling better, it would have been a wonderful day to get the sleigh and play. Her husbands would have heart attacks if she even suggested stepping foot outdoors.</p><p>Adam was sitting next to her while Ethan was on her other side. Ryan stood by the hearth, poking at one of the logs to stoke the flames.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s hand went to her head, smoothing back her hair, his smile gentle and full of love. His eyes had a faraway look of remembrance.</p><p>\u201cIt was the best Christmas ever,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Emotion glimmered in Ryan\u2019s eyes as he settled into an armchair across from the couch. \u201cSeth was just a baby and we were still reeling and so damn grateful to have you back in our lives.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s arm tightened around Holly. A tremor raced up his body and she turned, smiling tenderly at him. He still hated the mention of the time they\u2019d spent apart. He hated remembering the fear that they\u2019d lost her, that she wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>But she\u2019d known. There was never a question that she\u2019d make her way back home to the men who loved her.</p><p>\u201cSo many Christmases since then,\u201d she said, her voice aching at the memories. \u201cBut you know what? I have a feeling this will be the best yet.\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled indulgently. \u201cYou say that every year.\u201d</p><p>She pulled a face. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that last year when Callie and Max were in Europe. I hated that they were gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis year will be special,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice to have our children home. All of them.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes glittered with tears that she didn\u2019t try to hide. Her life was so full and wonderful. Each and every day. How many people could say that? How many people could say they were loved as Holly was loved?</p><p>She was surrounded by it. It enveloped her. Her husbands, her children. Those who\u2019d joined the family. Max and Lauren. And Lily. Sweet, fragile Lily who\u2019d turned her boys\u2019 lives upside down.</p><p>\u201cIf you start crying, you\u2019re going to hurt,\u201d Adam said gruffly. \u201cDoc said you\u2019d be sore for a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just hate to see me cry,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the side of her head. \u201cI love you, you know.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to include Ryan and Ethan in her view.</p><p>\u201cI think we should take a trip after Christmas.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s brows drew together and Ethan shot her a puzzled look. She couldn\u2019t blame them. She was happiest when she was right here in her own home, surrounded by the people she loved. Callie was the one with wanderlust, always going, wanting to go, waiting for that next adventure.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of trip?\u201d Adam asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe someplace warm. Hawaii or some tropical island somewhere. Someplace private, maybe a private beach where we could just lounge and make love and stay naked all week if we wanted.\u201d</p><p>Ethan blinked. \u201cWell, hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI vote you stay naked,\u201d Ryan drawled. \u201cMaybe the rest of us will at least wear swim trunks, but you, sweetheart, I\u2019d love to keep naked for as long as possible.\u201d</p><p>Her heart fluttered and went soft. After all these years, they still thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. They still desired her. Still wanted her. That had never changed, never slowed. Their love had only gotten better and stronger with age.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re as young as we want to be,\u201d she said.</p><p>Adam lifted a brow at that. \u201cAre you feeling your years, baby? Because I have to say that you damn sure don\u2019t look like a woman in her fifties.\u201d</p><p>She blushed to her toes at the hungry look in his eyes. \u201cI was just reminding myself that age is just a number. It\u2019s all in how you feel, and you know what I feel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The question came from all three men.</p><p>She smiled and kept smiling, the grin growing bigger until her cheeks hurt. \u201cI feel loved, and as long as I feel as loved as I do, I\u2019ll stay young forever. This whole episode made me realize that there\u2019s still a lot I want to do, and I don\u2019t want to miss out on anything. Maybe after we take a trip we can get together with Max and Callie. Plan a family trip for us all. Us, Max and Callie. Even Lauren. Seth, Michael, Dillon, and Lily. Think how much fun it would be to take a big family vacation. We haven\u2019t done that since the children were young.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes went soft. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you wherever you want to go, sweetheart. I can\u2019t imagine a better time than one spent with my family. But first we\u2019ll take our trip. Just us, a beach, and a sunset somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGets my vote,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyes gleamed with mischief as he stared at Holly. \u201cJust think how easy it\u2019ll be to pack. You won\u2019t even have to bring a suitcase.\u201d</p><p>Her brows puckered up as she glanced questioningly up at him.</p><p>He leaned over and kissed away the lines on her forehead. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to pack if you\u2019re going to stay naked for the entire time, and that damn sure gets my vote.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER 16</p><p>LILY sat on the edge of her bed, her bottom lip firmly between her teeth as she stared sightlessly toward the closet. Anxiety ate a hole in her stomach. It was Christmas Eve. They were due at her in laws\u2019 soon\u2014they should have already left.</p><p>They\u2019d decided to tell the entire family tonight. At dinner. A surprise. A wonderful Christmas present.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She wasn\u2019t sure she was prepared. She almost wished she would have gone a quieter route. Told Holly and Callie first. Then maybe the dads. Then she wouldn\u2019t have to face everyone at once.</p><p>But neither did she want to deprive her husbands of their special moment. They were over the moon. Cautious. Worried about her. But over the moon ecstatic at the thought of having a child. She knew they wanted several. As many as she was comfortable having.</p><p>And maybe she did too. She loved the Colter family. Loved everything about them. She wanted it for her family. Her husbands. Her children.</p><p>If only she could move past this paralyzing fear that gripped her every time she dwelled more than a moment on the growing life inside her.</p><p>\u201cLily?\u201d</p><p>She glanced up to see Dillon standing at the door. His stance told her he\u2019d been standing there awhile. Watching her. Probably worrying.</p><p>He walked in without saying anything further and slid onto the bed next to her so that their thighs were touching.</p><p>\u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hesitated a moment, and then sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just nervous. Maybe a little scared. I know everyone will be happy, but they\u2019ll be worried too. I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t want to be too excited because they won\u2019t know how well I\u2019m taking it. I don\u2019t want to suck the joy out of this moment for them like I did with you.\u201d</p><p>Dillon frowned and turned more fully toward her so he could capture her with his glare. \u201cYou did not ruin the moment for me. You\u2019ve got to cut yourself some slack, Lily. You took a hit. You weren\u2019t expecting to become pregnant. It wasn\u2019t something we planned. Under the circumstances, I think you handled it quite well.\u201d</p><p>She smiled wanly. \u201cThanks for saying that.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand and squeezed. \u201cMom and the dads are going to be overjoyed. Of course they\u2019re going to worry about you. They love you. They know what you\u2019ve been through. But they\u2019ll know when you tell them. They\u2019ll be able to see it in your eyes. Nothing will ruin that moment for them. Learning at Christmas that they\u2019re going to have their first grandchild will be a memory they\u2019ll hold forever. And you\u2019re the one who\u2019ll give that to them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She sucked in a breath. \u201cI know it\u2019s stupid for me to be afraid and nervous. I mean, I love them so much and I know they love me. They\u2019ve shown me nothing but support and caring. I couldn\u2019t have ever asked for a better family. I guess I just don\u2019t want to let anyone down. Especially myself and our baby.\u201d</p><p>Dillon touched her cheek and then leaned in to kiss her softly on the lips. \u201cNever that, Lily. You won\u2019t disappoint them or us. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of you.\u201d</p><p>She dove into his arms, wrapping herself around him to hug him tight. He curled his arms around her and held her just as tightly.</p><p>He smoothed her hair and then murmured close to her ear, \u201cWhat do you say we go have the best Christmas Eve this family\u2019s ever seen?\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER 17</p><p>CHRISTMAS Eve was always a big event in the Colter household. Not that Christmas Day was completely overlooked, but Christmas Eve was full of excitement. It was when the family gathered, drank hot chocolate in front of the fire, and laughed and loved as they celebrated another year.</p><p>Christmas Day they would sleep in, eat breakfast in their pajamas, open presents, and then everyone would watch the Christmas parades and football until they ate a midafternoon Christmas dinner.</p><p>This Christmas Eve, just as the sun went down, bathing the fresh covering of snow in the first pale shadows of dusk, the Colters and Wilders gathered at the Colter cabin.</p><p>Presents were piled around the tree and spilled onto the hearth. The living room was aglow with twinkling lights and the sounds of laughter and happiness.</p> <p>Holly sat at the end of the couch, propped with pillows and fussed over endlessly by her husbands and children alike. Adam and Ryan disappeared frequently into the kitchen along with Dillon as they cooked the Christmas Eve feast.</p><p>And what a feast it was.</p><p>The table had been extended over the years, leaves added as the family grew in number. As they gathered at the table, Lily smiled a soft, secret smile, imagining her own addition to the Colter family who would arrive a few months down the road.</p><p>This was her child\u2019s future. This family. This wonderful, loving group of people who had hearts as big as the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>She was going to be okay. Her child was going to be okay.</p><p>She could be happy. Fear uncoiled its tight grip around her heart and slid away, replaced by peace and overwhelming joy. And gratitude. For this second chance\u2014at love, at a life, to have another child to love and cherish.</p> <p>She glanced at her husbands as they sat down, her heart swelling with love and excitement. This was her moment. Her time to shine. After so long in the shadows, afraid to step into the sun, she was ready to burst out, throw her arms wide, and turn her face up to the wonder of heaven and glory in God\u2019s mercy and grace.</p><p>Dillon reached underneath the table to squeeze her hand. Then Seth reached for her other hand, his fingers laced tightly with hers. Across the table, Michael met her gaze and smiled, his eyes suspiciously bright. It was time.</p><p>Lily took in a deep breath to steady her nerves. It wasn\u2019t that she had doubts\u2014she didn\u2019t. But she knew their news would concern her parents-in-law. They all knew of her past tragedy. They constantly surrounded her with love and unconditional support. She didn\u2019t want them to worry that she\u2019d fall apart. This family made her strong. With them behind her, she could do anything.</p><p>She very carefully disentangled her hands from her husbands\u2019 and then rose, tall and strong, and stared down the table at the rest of the family, who were seated.</p><p>Conversation died and the room went silent. All eyes were on Lily as if they realized that something big was about to happen. Holly\u2019s eyes flashed with concern and Lily saw her reach for Ethan\u2019s hand automatically.</p><p>Lily smiled, unsure whether she\u2019d even be able to get this out without becoming a blubbering mess. Her eyes already stung and she fought to know just how to begin.</p><p>Then beside her, Seth stood, reaching for her hand. He gave her a reassuring smile, full of love and strength\u2014his strength that he was lending her.</p><p>Dillon rose on her other side and took her hand as Seth had. Then Michael also stood.</p> <p>Lily didn\u2019t even try to control the tears that slid silently down her cheeks. Her smile was so wide that no one could possibly confuse her tears for sadness or grief.</p><p>Confident in her husbands\u2019 love and support, she faced the rest of the table once more.</p><p>\u201cWe have something special to share with you,\u201d she said softly. It was hard to talk when her smile was so big and tears streamed endlessly down her cheeks.</p><p>Then she looked pointedly at the end of the table where the older generation of Colters sat.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a grandchild. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>A series of gasps flew around the table. Concern immediately flashed in the eyes of the Colters, but so did utter happiness and excitement.</p><p>Tears filled Holly\u2019s eyes. Callie wiped at her own eyes as she glanced back at Lily. Lauren smiled but her smile was wistful, almost poignant, as if it reflected her own wishes and dreams.</p><p>And the dads\u2019 reactions ranged from shock to satisfaction.</p><p>The silence abruptly ended as everyone reacted at the same moment. Whoops went up. Cheers erupted. A barrage of congratulations flew. Despite her husbands\u2019 attempts to keep her seated, Holly jumped from her chair and dashed around to where Lily stood.</p><p>She enfolded her daughter-in-law in her arms and whispered in her ear, \u201cOh my baby, I\u2019m so very happy for you. You know it\u2019ll be all right this time.\u201d</p><p>Lily clung to her mother-in-law, closing her eyes as emotion knotted her throat. There were so many differing feelings to sort through. But best was this hug. This hug told her that she was loved and supported unconditionally. That her child would have the best the world could offer him or her. That her child would grow up in a family as strong and enduring as time itself.</p><p>\u201cI do know,\u201d she whispered back. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m more than okay.\u201d</p><p>Holly pulled away and suddenly the dads were there, pulling her into big, bone-crushing hugs. Seth, Michael, and Dillon all got slaps on the back, hugs, handshakes.</p><p>Callie and Lauren crowded in and hugged Lily next, and Lily absorbed the moment, so very different from her first pregnancy, when she\u2019d been so alone and isolated. This time would be different. This time she was loved.</p><p>Max came forward to hug her. He kissed her wet cheek and then shook the hands of Seth, Michael, and Dillon. Everyone was talking at once. Exclaiming. Such happy sounds. Laughter. Joy. It was a balm to a soul that had long suffered the agony of silence.</p><p>Adam cleared his throat to get everyone\u2019s attention, and to Lily\u2019s surprise, tears gleamed in his eyes. He looked shaky. Happy. A little unbalanced. He kept staring at his sons with such love in his eyes that Lily felt the answering sting of tears once more.</p><p>Seth wrapped his arm around her and pulled her close as Adam motioned for quiet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best damn news I\u2019ve had, apart from your mother being okay after she gave us such a fright.\u201d His expression grew more serious and he stared at Lily, singling her out. \u201cLily, honey, I just want you to know that we\u2019re all going to be here for you. You never doubt that for a moment. You and our grandchild will be loved and cherished and covered up with support, so much so you\u2019ll probably want to tell us all to buzz off.\u201d</p><p>Laughter filled the room and Lily smiled through the ache of tears.</p><p>He reached for his glass, wiped absently at his eyes, and then faced his family again. He held up his glass and enveloped Lily and his sons in the warmth of his gaze. \u201cTo the first Colter grandchild. May he or she grow up surrounded by love. May he or she grow up to become as wonderful as my own children are. And may he or she have the resiliency and indomitable spirit of his mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHear, hear.\u201d</p><p>The soft murmurs of agreement broke Lily. She could no longer hold back the sobs that welled in her throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat would I do without all of you?\u201d she asked tearfully. \u201cNo one has ever been as protected and loved as I have. My baby will be the luckiest child in the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the most spoiled,\u201d Callie said dryly.</p><p>Laughter met her declaration. Holly let out a humph. \u201cIf I can\u2019t spoil my grandchildren, who can I spoil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit, everyone,\u201d Adam said, motioning everyone down. \u201cLet\u2019s eat before the food gets cold.\u201d</p><p>Dishes were passed around. Chatter buzzed in Lily\u2019s ears. Questions flew. There was already the question of names. So much that she hadn\u2019t allowed herself to contemplate yet.</p><p>It felt good to have it out in the open. Real. Excitement squeezed her insides, and she slid a hand over her belly.</p><p>She was having a baby, and this time, she was surrounded by so much love and support that she\u2019d never have to worry about being alone, struggling, desperate. Never again.</p><p>\u201cThank you, God,\u201d she whispered, her eyes burning again. \u201cThank you for saving me. Thank you for sending me this family and for your love and mercy. I won\u2019t forget. I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d</p><p>After an hour of eating, lively discussion, and much laughter, the plates were finally pushed away.</p><p>Max cleared his throat and then stood, much as Lily had done at the start of the meal. \u201cI have a surprise for Callie. Well, for everyone,\u201d he amended. \u201cIt seems even more appropriate in light of all the good news we\u2019ve recently received. We have much to be grateful for this year. I have the most won-derful, giving wife, and my sister is home where she belongs. Holly is well and back home where she belongs, and now we\u2019ll welcome a new addition to the Colter family.\u201d</p><p>Sounds of agreement echoed on all sides.</p><p>\u201cWhat surprise?\u201d Callie squeaked out.</p><p>Max smiled indulgently. \u201cPatience, dolcezza. You\u2019ll all need to get your coats on and come with me.\u201d</p><p>Callie grabbed Lauren\u2019s hand and dragged her toward the door. Her brothers laughed and shook their heads.</p><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d Callie said impatiently. \u201cI\u2019m dying to know what the surprise is!\u201d</p><p>Everyone smiled and laughed as they trekked to the closet. Coats were pulled on. Holly was surrounded by her husbands, each of them determined that she wouldn\u2019t have to walk solo through the snow. Lily\u2019s husbands were every bit as attentive as they stepped outside.</p><p>Cold blew over Callie\u2019s face and she closed her eyes, inhaling the clean mountain air. Snowflakes danced across her nose and she laughed out loud, mesmerized by the magic of the night.</p><p>Max directed them down the pathway that led to her and Max\u2019s house. But they stopped in the meadow, halfway between the two houses. He leaned down to kiss Callie, his mouth melting sweetly over the coldness of her lips. Then he drew away and pulled a glow stick from his pocket. After breaking it so that it lit up, he waved it in the air before returning it to his pocket.</p><p>There was a silent pause as everyone waited breathlessly. There was anticipation in the air and the only illumination cast on the meadow was the thin slash of moonlight that hovered over distant trees.</p><p>Suddenly lights twinkled and lit up, cascading from tree to tree, from bush to bush. Shapes came to life in the meadow. A Christmas tree. Several Christmas trees. Angels. Reindeer. A manger scene.</p><p>Callie caught her breath, dazzled by the display of lights, as if a million fireflies had suddenly descended.</p><p>\u201cOh Max,\u201d she breathed in a soft voice. \u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d</p><p>Lauren stood next to Callie, her eyes wide. Everyone seemed transfixed, even Callie\u2019s fathers and brothers, who surely were in on the surprise. Her mom stared in wonder, mouth open as she stared from tree to tree.</p><p>The meadow had been transformed into a winter wonderland worthy of any childhood fantasy.</p><p>In the distance, the sound of sleigh bells chinked softly, growing louder, the rhythm in sync with the trot of horses. Callie whirled around, straining to see. And then a six-horse-drawn sleigh burst into the clearing. The horses were adorned with bells. The sleigh was shiny red, and it reflected the light of thousands of bulbs.</p><p>Callie gaped as the sleigh drew even closer. She turned to Max, her mouth working up and down, but nothing would come out. Max chuckled.</p><p>Callie flew into his arms, hitting him with such force that they both fell back into the snow. Max\u2019s back hit the ground, and he wrapped his arms around her to cushion her fall. He laughed helplessly as she peppered his face with excited, breathless kisses.</p><p>Around them, the rest of the family laughed, the sound joyous in the air. Lily clapped her hands in delight and Lauren\u2019s smile was so brilliant that it made everyone stop and take notice. How long had it been since she\u2019d really smiled? With everything inside her. With her whole heart.</p><p>Gone for a moment were the shadows of her past and in its stead was a beautiful, sparkling young woman.</p><p>\u201cLet me up, dolcezza. We have a sleigh ride to take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of us?\u201d Callie asked as she got up and literally danced around Max in the snow.</p><p>Max stood and brushed the snow from his clothing. \u201cAll of us. The sleigh is big enough, and what is Christmas Eve without a sleigh ride?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCome on, Lauren!\u201d Callie shouted, taking her sister-in-law\u2019s hand and pulling her toward the sleigh.</p><p>The rest followed behind and Adam fell into step with Max. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen my little girl so excited.\u201d</p><p>Max smiled. \u201cI plan to spend the rest of my life making her smile just like she did tonight.\u201d</p><p>Adam slapped him on the back and then returned to his wife. They ushered her into the sled while Max slid in beside Callie and Lauren. When everyone was tucked underneath the blankets, the man Max had hired to drive the sleigh urged the horses forward.</p> <p>They glided over the snow, through the meadow, and higher into the aspens and pines that surrounded the Colter cabin. Max wrapped his arm around Callie and pulled her in close. Lauren sat next to Callie, her eyes aglow with happiness.</p><p>Everything that mattered most to Max was right here, in his arms, sitting close to him. Seeing Callie\u2019s and Lauren\u2019s smiles had been worth every bit of planning and money he\u2019d put into having the meadow lit up.</p><p>There was nothing more beautiful than the woman resting against his side, and he\u2019d go to hell and back to make her happy. Always. Every damn day for the rest of his life.</p><p>CHAPTER 18</p><p>CHRISTMAS morning dawned clear and cold. Everyone began to crawl out of bed and make their way downstairs in their pajamas. Ethan had gotten up early to set the fire, and by the time everyone gathered in the living room, flames danced merrily in the hearth.</p> <p>Snow was coming down harder. Big, fat, fluffy flakes descended, covering the ground in a fresh blanket of white. The windowpanes were frosted over and the women snuggled into the couches with their husbands.</p><p>Lauren seemed hesitant to barge in. She paused, feeling a little silly in her pajamas as she stared at the Colter family enjoying cups of hot chocolate while they waited for breakfast to be served.</p><p>Then Max looked up, a smile softening his face. He patted the spot beside him and she quickly moved forward, eager and yet afraid all at the same time to find her place in this family Max had married into.</p><p>\u201cHey kiddo,\u201d Seth said, leaning over to give her head an affectionate tousle.</p><p>She smiled and murmured a greeting before settling back to grip the cup Ryan Colter handed her.</p><p>Christmas with the Colters had instilled a fiery ache so deeply rooted that it seemed to take her over completely. She was filled with longing for what they had. Love. Caring. Deep and abiding loyalty.</p> <p>These men adored their women. Unapologetically. Unabashedly. They didn\u2019t give a damn who knew it.</p><p>She wanted that. She deserved that. It had taken her long enough to believe it, but damn it, she did.</p><p>A few minutes later, Adam came in with cinnamon rolls and buttery croissants. Ryan followed with a pitcher of milk as well as juice that he set on the coffee table.</p><p>No one was shy about diving right in. It was a free-for-all that nearly developed into a food fight before Adam eyed his offspring sternly and said, \u201cNow, children.\u201d</p><p>Lauren found it amusing that even at the Colter children\u2019s ages, they immediately snapped to attention and adopted a meek attitude when their father took them to task.</p><p>But the good times and teasing resumed, and after they polished off the light breakfast, Holly announced that it was time to open presents.</p><p>\u201cI want to be Santa!\u201d Callie exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be Santa. That\u2019s the dads\u2019 job,\u201d Dillon protested.</p> <p>Callie glared at her brother. \u201cSays who? I want to pass out presents this year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can, baby,\u201d Holly said.</p><p>\u201cMama\u2019s baby,\u201d Dillon mouthed at her.</p><p>Callie shot him a smug smile and then scrambled up to start passing out the gifts.</p><p>The living room was soon covered in torn wrapping paper, pieces of ribbons, and bows strewn from one end to the other. Everyone oohed and ahhed over each gift, but it was Lily\u2019s gift that stole the show.</p><p>After everything had been opened, Dillon and his brothers rose, conspiratorial smiles on their faces.</p><p>\u201cWe have one last gift for Lily,\u201d Michael said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right back with it.\u201d</p><p>Lily watched them go, her brow furrowed in confusion. A moment later, they tromped back into the house from outside, shaking the snow from their boots and pajamas.</p><p>They carried a blanket-covered object into the living room and placed it front of Lily, and then Dillon carefully pulled the covering away.</p><p>Lily gasped as she stared in wonder at the magnificent handcrafted cradle. She knew immediately that Dillon had done this. Probably with his brothers\u2019 help.</p><p>Her fingers slid over the stained finish with reverence, taking in all the intricate lines and designs that had been carved. But when she got to the end, her vision blurred and she swallowed hard to keep the emotion at bay.</p><p>There at the head of the cradle, at the top of the curve, was a simple rose. A gentle remembrance. Letting her know that they hadn\u2019t forgotten, that they understood.</p><p>She touched it, running her finger over it again and again, so choked up and filled with overwhelming love for her husbands that she couldn\u2019t have spoken if she wanted to.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she finally managed to whisper. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Everyone beamed at her, though Holly sniffled and Callie hastily dabbed at her eyes. Even the dads\u2019 eyes were suspiciously wet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a fine piece,\u201d Adam proclaimed. \u201cYou boys did good.\u201d</p><p>His declaration lightened the mood and everyone returned to sorting the gifts, collecting the paper, and stacking boxes in a corner.</p><p>When all was done, Holly pushed herself up from between Ethan and Adam. \u201cI have an announcement of my own to make.\u201d</p><p>She stood before her family, a serene smile sliding across her pretty features. Holly Colter reminded Lauren of an angel. The very best kind of angel.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cooking Christmas dinner today.\u201d</p><p>There was a series of chokes and wheezes. Spasms crossed the faces of the rest of the Colter family as they tried very hard not to react to her announcement.</p><p>Lauren watched them all in puzzlement, not understanding why such an announcement was not only odd but greeted by such an arresting array of responses.</p><p>There were even groans. Ryan\u2019s face whitened. Ethan looked panicked. The Colter offspring just dissolved into raucous laughter.</p><p>Holly glared at them all, hands on her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t cooking,\u201d Adam said sternly. \u201cYou just got out of the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot to mention we don\u2019t want her to put us in the hospital,\u201d Ryan muttered.</p><p>Holly scowled at her husband. \u201cI heard that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a wonderful cook,\u201d Lily said, rising to throw her glare in with Holly\u2019s.</p><p>Holly slid her arm around Lily\u2019s waist and beamed at her daughter-in-law. \u201cThank you, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. Everyone looked like they were preparing to face their executioner.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want to hear the menu or shall I just surprise you all?\u201d Holly asked, her eyes brimming with excitement.</p><p>Another series of groans echoed over the room.</p><p>She pursed her lips and shook her finger at all her naysayers. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. I\u2019ll expect apologies from each and every one of you.\u201d</p><p>She turned and marched toward the kitchen but stopped midway there to turn and frown at everyone. \u201cNo one better set foot in my kitchen until you\u2019re called for dinner. Is that clear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod help us,\u201d Adam said wearily.</p><p>\u201cHer kitchen?\u201d Ethan choked out. \u201cWhen has it ever been her kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Feeling compelled to show support for a woman who\u2019d been nothing short of wonderful to her, Lauren stood and fixed the rest of the room with a disapproving frown. \u201cHow could you all be so mean to her?\u201d</p><p>For a moment they all stared at her like she\u2019d lost her mind. Then they dissolved into laughter. Callie wiped at her face and attempted to explain through her merriment.</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t being mean, Lauren. You have to understand. My mom is a disaster in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Seth grimaced. \u201cThat\u2019s one way to put it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ... terrible,\u201d Callie went on. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to explain her culinary skills, or lack thereof. In the thirty-plus years she and the dads have been together, she\u2019s never cooked. It\u2019s not that she hasn\u2019t occasionally tried, but in an effort to prevent her from burning down the house or poisoning the offspring, the dads banned her from the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>Another round of laughter filled the room.</p><p>With a sigh, Lily shot them all reprimanding looks. \u201cI don\u2019t care how awful this meal is, you\u2019ll eat it and you\u2019ll love it,\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cShe\u2019s worked hard for the last several weeks learning this menu. All she wants is to make Christmas dinner one time for her family.\u201d</p><p>Understanding dawned in Ryan\u2019s eyes. \u201cSo that\u2019s what she\u2019s been up to. Hell, we had no idea why she\u2019s been sneaking off to your house all the time and refusing to allow us to drive her.\u201d</p><p>Lily nodded. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent countless hours in the kitchen while she labors over this meal. It\u2019s actually quite good. If she doesn\u2019t get flustered and can remember everything I taught her, I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.\u201d</p><p>Adam turned to fix each of his children with a menacing glare. \u201cYou\u2019ll not say a word to your mother no matter how bad it is. I want her happy, and if making us a meal makes her happy, then by God, we\u2019ll sit down and enjoy it even if it kills us.\u201d</p><p>Ryan coughed and Adam turned his glare on his brother. \u201cThat goes for you and Ethan too.\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always leftovers from last night if things go really bad,\u201d Callie said.</p><p>\u201cJust everyone sit like your mother said and wait for her to come get us,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>It was hard to sit in the living room when the kitchen might indeed be in peril. Every once in a while, someone could be seen sniffing delicately at the air as if trying to discern whether anything was burning. But after an hour, delicious smells floated through the living room.</p><p>At the end of two hours, the smells were so wonderful that the rest of the family began to grow restless and check the time as if they were impatient for dinner to be served.</p><p>And then Holly appeared in the doorway of the living room, her smile triumphant even if she looked decidedly harried and bedraggled.</p><p>\u201cDinner is served,\u201d she declared, her smile bright enough to rival the meadow the night before.</p><p>Everyone scrambled up and jockeyed for position going into the dining room. It was as if they all wanted to be the first to see the results of Holly\u2019s cooking.</p><p>When they all crowded into the doorway, exclamations and sounds of surprise rose. The table was set with a red tablecloth and a beautiful poinsettia centerpiece. Each place was set with sterling silver utensils and Holly had dragged out her rarely used fine china for the occasion.</p><p>But what everyone focused in on was the mouthwateringly fragrant food.</p><p>\u201cSit, sit,\u201d she urged. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to get cold.\u201d</p><p>Neither did anyone else.</p><p>They scrambled into their seats and discovered steaming bowls of lobster bisque accompanied by an appetizer of crawfish-stuffed shrimp. Homemade rolls were passed around and then silence descended as everyone glanced around to see who would be the first to try it.</p><p>Max didn\u2019t hold back, but then he\u2019d never been a victim of Holly\u2019s attempts at cooking. He spooned a mouthful of the bisque into his mouth and then took a bite of the hot roll.</p><p>He looked up when he realized everyone was staring at him. He laughed. \u201cI suppose I could pretend to keel over and die an agonizing death, but that would probably get me banned from any future family meals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn right it would,\u201d Holly muttered.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s excellent, Mrs. C.,\u201d Max said. \u201cYou outdid yourself.\u201d</p><p>The others looked surprised and then suddenly they were all dipping into their bowls and the reactions were comical.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, this is heaven,\u201d Ethan groaned. \u201cMy wife made this?\u201d</p><p>Holly huffed at him and shot him a quick glare.</p><p>No one spoke for a long moment as they all savored the wonderful-tasting bisque. When they all finished, Holly began dishing up the grilled fish fillets. When she opened the covered bowl containing the \u00e9touff\u00e9e, there were looks of amazement all around.</p><p>She carefully ladled the \u00e9touff\u00e9e onto the plates, covering the fillets.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell did you do to our mother?\u201d Dillon demanded as he forked another bite into his mouth.</p><p>The entire table cracked up at his irreverence. Even Holly grinned. \u201cYou like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike? I damn well love,\u201d Dillon said around another mouthful. \u201cDid my wife teach you how to make all this?\u201d</p><p>Holly shot a proud glance in Lily\u2019s direction. \u201cShe sure did.\u201d</p><p>Adam, Ethan, and Ryan all looked over at Lily, and Ethan said in mock reverence, \u201cHow can we ever thank you? You\u2019ve performed a miracle. We never thought we\u2019d see the day she didn\u2019t burn the house down after two hours in the kitchen.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body>  <p>\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Holly said in exasperation. \u201cI\u2019m not that bad!\u201d</p><p>When silence greeted her defensive statement, she burst into laughter. \u201cOkay, so maybe I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is wonderful, baby,\u201d Adam said with a smile. \u201cYou did an amazing job. This will be a Christmas we\u2019ll never forget for many reasons.\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled back at him, her cheeks flushed with pleasure.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, Mom,\u201d Seth assured her.</p><p>One by one, her children and her husbands, Max, and Lauren all chimed in with their compliments until Holly beamed from ear to ear, and really, even if it had been horrible, who would have wanted to wipe away that kind of smile?</p><p>It had been a year of many milestones and events, changes and renewals, scares and rejoicings. The next year promised to be even sweeter.</p><p>But no matter what else would be recounted from this point forward, this would always be remembered as the year Holly Colter finally managed to conquer the kitchen. </p>  </body></html>"]
