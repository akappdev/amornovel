The rolling waves, the smooth, warm sand, turned white beneath the light of a glistening silver moon.</p><p>The dream continues to haunt me because on that beach I said good-bye to everything I\u2019d been and welcomed the woman I would become.</p><p>Once I was a stay-at-home mom with a big house in the Southern California suburbs. I drove an SUV</p><p>that was far too large for carting a five-year-old girl to ballet lessons; I was married to a man I thought was my soul mate.</p> <p>Then, in the way of a picture-perfect life, everything went to hell and I became a voodoo priestess. When I change lives, I do it right.</p><p>I did have a little help from the witness protection program. Although they weren\u2019t the ones who suggested I spend years studying an ancient African religion, travel to Haiti and be initiated, then style myself Priestess Cassandra, owner and operator of a voodoo shop in the French Quarter. No, that was all me.</p><p>I chose the name Cassandra because it means \u201cprophet.\u201d Voodoo priestesses are often called on to see the future, but I\u2019d never been the least bit psychic. Despite the name, I still wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Voodoo is a fluid religion, adaptive and inclusive. Practitioners believe in magic, zombies, and love charms. I like pretty much everything about it, except one thing.</p><p>Their stubborn insistence that there are no accidents.</p> <p>Me, I have a hard time believing it, because if there are no accidents that means my daughter died for a reason, and I just can\u2019t find one. Believe me, I\u2019ve looked.</p><p>I\u2019m not the first person to have trouble with certain tenets of their religion. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t believe.</p><p>In Haiti, on that beach, I committed myself to voodoo wholeheartedly. I had a very good reason.</p><p>I planned to raise my daughter from the dead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter One</p><p>I got off the plane in Port-au-Prince for the second time in my life about midafternoon on a sunny Thursday in October. Not much had changed. Heat wavered above the asphalt, shimmering, dancing, making me dizzy.</p><p>Inside the airport, a man whose starched white short-sleeved shirt and khaki trousers emphasized the ebony shade of his skin hurried over. \u201cPriestess Cassandra?\u201d</p><p>I winced. What had been good business in New Orleans sounded pretentious in the shadow of the mountains where voodoo had first come into its own.</p> <p>\u201cJust Cassandra, please,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>I wondered momentarily how he\u2019d known me. Perhaps my being the only white woman who\u2019d gotten off the plane was a pretty good clue. I\u2019m sure my blue eyes and short dark hair weren\u2019t all that common around here, either. But what usually made me stand out in a crowd was the slash of pure white at my temple.</p><p>The oddity, which had appeared in my hair shortly after my daughter died, had gradually lost pigment from its original gray. I probably should have covered it with dye\u2014I was, after all, in witness protection</p><p>\u2014but the white strip served to remind me of my daughter and my mission. As if I needed reminding.</p><p>The streak also served as my penance. I hadn\u2019t done the one thing a mother was supposed to do\u2014 protect her child against everyone. Even her father.</p> <p>The man in front of me dipped his head. \u201cI am Marcel, Miss Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>His accent hinted at France. A lovely lilt in English; in Creole, the language of the island, he\u2019d sound fabulous.</p><p>I opened my mouth to tell him my last name, then realized I no longer had one. Once I\u2019d testified against my scum-sucking, drug-dealing pig of a husband I\u2019d become Priestess Cassandra, one name only\u2014a la Cher, the Rock, Madonna.</p><p>WITSEC, short for witness protection folks, had been unamused when I\u2019d refused to acknowledge the need for a last name. Of course very little amused them. They\u2019d slapped Smith on my records, but the name wasn\u2019t any more mine than Cassandra.</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Mandenauer has arranged for a room at the Hotel Oloffson,\u201d Marcel said, taking possession of the single bag I\u2019d carried onto the plane.</p><p>I\u2019d recently j oined a group of government operatives known as the J\u00e4ger-Suchers. That\u2019s Hunter- Searchers if your German is as nonexistent as mine.</p> <p>The J\u00e4ger-Suchers hunt monsters, and I\u2019m not using the euphemism applied to so many human beings who belong in a cage. I mean monsters\u2014the type whose skin sprouts fur, whose teeth become fangs \u2014beasts that drink the blood of humans and only want more.</p><p>Edward Mandenauer was my new boss. He\u2019d sent me to Haiti to discover the secret of raising a zombie.</p><p>I loved it when my personal and work interests collided. Almost made me give credence to that \u201cthere are no accidents\u201d theory.</p><p>\u201cThis way, please.\u201d Marcel awaited me at the door of the airport.</p><p>I hurried after him, leaving behind the shady, cool interior of the building and stepping into the bright, sunny bustle of Port-au-Prince.</p><p>Though Haiti is horrendously overpopulated\u2014the newest estimates say 8.5 million souls\u2014there is also a vast amount of uncharted, unexplored, and nearly unexplorable land in the mountains. I was certain any secrets worth uncovering lay in that direction.</p><p>I glanced at the teeming crowd of humanity that made up the capital city. Secrets certainly couldn\u2019t be kept here.</p><p>Marcel had parked at the curb in direct defiance of the signs ordering him not to do so. He held the passenger door, and I climbed inside, nearly choking on the scalding air within. After tossing my bag into the back, Marcel jumped behind the wheel, cranking the air conditioner to high, before setting off at a speed meant to crush any slow-moving bystanders.</p> <p>In a very short time, we squealed to a stop in front of a large Victorian mansion. The Hotel Oloffson was originally built as a presidential summer palace. Used by the marines as a hospital during the initial U.S.</p><p>occupation of 1915, it became the first hotel in Haiti.</p><p>Marcel led me up the steps and into the foyer. The hotel was expecting me, and in short order I followed Marcel into one of the veranda rooms with a view of the city.</p><p>He dropped my bag to the floor with a thud. \u201cMonsieur Mandenauer has arranged for you to meet a friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward has friends here?\u201d</p><p>Marcel slid me a glance. \u201cHe has friends everywhere.\u201d</p><p>Of course he did.</p><p>\u201cThis friend will help you find what you seek.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cYou know what I seek?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a little trouble with a curse, oui?\u201d</p><p>I wouldn\u2019t have referred to the beast ravaging New Orleans as a \u201clittle\u201d trouble, but it sounded as if Marcel knew the basics.</p><p>In the Crescent City I\u2019d seen amazing things, but none as fantastic as a man changing into a wolf and back again.</p><p>Werewolves are real. You might think this would be an upsetting bit of knowledge for a former PTA member, but it wasn\u2019t. Because if the werewolves of legend exist, doesn\u2019t it follow that zombies do, too?</p><p>\u201cEdward told you why he sent me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo remove a curse, you need the voodoo queen who performed it, and she is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor about a hundred and fifty years.\u201d</p><p>Marcel lowered his voice to just above a whisper. \u201cYou must raise her from the grave. Zombie.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly. To raise a shuffling, decaying, frightening nightmare was not what I aspired to do. Though a George Romero Night of the Living Dead type zombie might be enough to satisfy Edward, it was not enough to satisfy me. I couldn\u2019t sentence my child to become such a creature.</p><p>I\u2019d been searching for a way to bring life from death since I\u2019d left here the last time. All I\u2019d found was more death. Then I began to hear whispers of incredible power in these mountains, an ability beyond the mere reanimation of a corpse. However, I hadn\u2019t had the means to return to Haiti, neither the funds to search the island the way it needed to be searched nor the cash to pay for what a secret like that must cost.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>I strolled onto the veranda and stared at the distant hills. Somewhere out there was a voodoo priest who, according to the latest rumors, could raise the dead to live again.</p><p>As if they\u2019d never been dead at all. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>Can you imagine? No more death.</p><p>I had a hard time believing it myself. But I wanted to.</p><p>In New Orleans I\u2019d often spouted platitudes about death being the beginning, not the end, a new plane, a different world, an adventure. Maybe it was.</p> <p>I still wanted my daughter back.</p><p>I turned away from the city, moving into the room where Marcel waited. \u201cWhen will I meet Mandenauer\u2019s friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe friend will come to you, Priestess.\u201d At my scowl Marcel corrected himself. \u201d Miss Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cWhen it is time.\u201d On that helpful note, Marcel opened the door and disappeared.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t bother to unpack. As soon as I had a direction, I was out of here.</p><p>Exhausted, I fell asleep across my bed still wearing my travel outfit of loose j eans, a black tank top, and black tennis shoes. When I awoke, night had fallen.</p><p>The noises of Port-au-Prince seemed louder in the still, navy blue darkness. Under a new moon, the sky was as devoid of shining silver as my j ewelry box had been before I discovered werewolves.</p><p>My beringed fingers sought out the shiny crucifix around my neck, worn not for religious purposes but for protection. These days I overflowed with the stuff. I\u2019d once thought it best to keep protective amulets hidden, but I\u2019d learned it didn\u2019t hurt to have them displayed, either.</p><p>I turned on my side and froze. The door to my room was open, and someone stood on the veranda.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Slowly I sat up. \u201cI\u2019m Cassandra.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPriestess.\u201d</p><p>The word was a hiss, reminding me of Lazarus, the python I\u2019d left in New Orleans. He\u2019d been my only friend until the crescent moon curse had brought Diana Malone into my life.</p><p>A cryptozoologist sent to New Orleans to investigate tales of a wolf where one didn\u2019t belong, she\u2019d gotten the surprise of her life when she\u2019d found a whole lot more than a wolf. She\u2019d wound up in my shop investigating the voodoo curse, and we\u2019d bonded, as women sometimes do.</p><p>The hovering shadow continued to hover, so I murmured, \u201cCome in, please.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the words left my mouth, the figure glided over the threshold. I flicked on the light, my eyes widening at the sight of the woman in front of me.</p><p>Tall and voluptuous, she was also gorgeous and ancient. Her skin caf\u00e9 au lait, her eyes were as blue as mine. She was clothed in a long, flowing purple robe, and a matching turban covered her head. This was what a voodoo priestess should look like. Too bad I\u2019d never be able to carry it off.</p><p>\u201cI am Renee,\u201d the woman murmured. \u201cYou wish to learn about the curse of the crescent moon?\u201d</p><p>Her accent was French, her diction upper-class. She might be from here, but she\u2019d learned English somewhere else.</p> <p>That, combined with the shade of her skin and eyes, marked Renee as mulatto\u2014a nonoffensive term in Haiti, referring to the descendants of the free people of color from the Colonial era. Their mixed race had afforded them great wealth, as well as the rights of French citizens.</p><p>Why I\u2019d expected Mandenauer\u2019s friend to be a man I wasn\u2019t quite sure. Maybe because he was so old the idea of a lady friend kind of creeped me out. Like catching your grandparents in flagrante delicto on the kitchen floor. I wanted to stick a needle in my eye to make that image go away.</p><p>\u201cUh, yes. The crescent moon,\u201d I managed. \u201cIs it true a voodoo curse can only be removed by the one who did the cursing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if that person is dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Her head tilted; the turban didn\u2019t move one iota. Impressive. \u201cYou have come to learn of the zombie.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of any reason to be secretive about it. \u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>A crease appeared in Renee\u2019s nearly perfect brow. She didn\u2019t have many wrinkles, so why did I think she was ancient? Must be something in the eyes.</p><p>\u201cRaising the dead is a serious and dangerous proposition,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cBut it can be done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>I caught my breath. \u201cHave you done it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch a thing is against the laws of both man and God.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t worry about either one anymore. There was nothing the law could do to me that was worse than what God had already done.</p><p>You\u2019d think that after what happened to my child I wouldn\u2019t believe in God. And for a while I hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d begun to study voodoo for one reason\u2014Sarah\u2014but I\u2019d been seduced by what I\u2019d found there.</p><p>Voodoo is a complex religion\u2014adaptable, tolerant, monotheistic. A lot of what I\u2019d learned made sense.</p><p>For instance, there can\u2019t be evil unless there\u2019s good.</p><p>And I believed in evil. Much more than I\u2019d ever believed in anything else.</p><p>Renee frowned, as if she\u2019d heard my thoughts. She\u2019d probably just read my expression. I cared about nothing but raising life from death. That kind of obsession could be hazardous to everyone\u2019s health. I knew it, but I couldn\u2019t change what I felt, what I needed, who I was.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever raised the dead?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I released my breath in a hiss of disappointment.</p><p>\u201cBut I know someone who has.\u201d</p><p>Anticipation made me dizzy. \u201cWhere can I find this person?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRaising the dead is an act performed only by a bokor. You know what that is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA houngan who serves the spirits with both hands\u2014an evil priest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are no absolutes,\u201d Renee murmured. \u201cAny houngan must know evil to fight it, just as a bokor must at one time have embraced good to hold any hope of subverting it.\u201d</p><p>Sometimes I longed for the days of black-and-white, or at least their illusion.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you\u2019re raising the dead for good?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing good can come of such a thing. In death there is peace everlasting. Though the living fear it, the dead embrace it. They do not wish to come back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve talked to many dead people?\u201d I snapped. \u201cThey\u2019ve told you this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath comes to all of us when it is our time. There are no accidents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that!\u201d</p><p>My voice was a little too loud, a little too strident. Renee\u2019s eyebrows lifted.</p><p>I needed to be careful. The woman wasn\u2019t stupid.</p><p>She\u2019d figure out I was in Haiti for a reason other than J\u00e4ger-Sucher business, and I\u2019d discover nothing.</p><p>\u201cWhat I believe doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d I said more calmly. \u201cEdward wants me to find a way to end the curse of the crescent moon. From what I\u2019ve been able to discover, that means bringing back from the dead the voodoo queen who did the cursing so she can remove said curse. Can you help me learn how to do this?\u201d</p><p>Renee studied me for several ticks of the clock, then lifted her long, slim hands\u2014which didn\u2019t appear very old, either\u2014and lowered them. \u201cThere is a man in Port-au-Prince\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard there was one in the mountains,\u201d I interrupted.</p><p>Renee\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cHe is not someone you wish to learn from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNames have power,\u201d Renee whispered. \u201cI will not give voice to his.\u201d</p><p>I agreed with the names-have-power sentiment. In legend and myth, many curses could be broken by the use of someone\u2019s name, although in practice, I\u2019ve never found this to be true.</p><p>You could call a werewolf\u2019s human name until you were three inches from dead and the beast would not change form. I\u2019d heard it said that a key part of the ceremony for raising a zombie involved calling the departed\u2019s name three times. Since I didn\u2019t know the rest of the ceremony, I\u2019d never been able to discover if that particular name game was true.</p><p>\u201cI need to meet this man,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo, you do not. To raise the voodoo queen you must only learn the ceremony. Bring her out of the grave for an instant; she will do as you ask; then you will put her back where she belongs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the man in the mountains?\u201d I tried to keep the eagerness from my voice, but I doubted I was successful. \u201cHe does something different?\u201d</p><p>Renee turned toward the veranda. For an instant I thought she might glide right out the door, and I took a single step forward. Foolish, really. I doubted I\u2019d be able to stop her from doing anything she wanted to do. I sensed great power in Renee. Though it wasn\u2019t voodoo, it was something.</p><p>However, she didn\u2019t move, merely stared at the distant rolling hills, turned the shade of evergreen beneath the ebony skies.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard of the Egbo?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the bad times, when the people of Africa were stolen away and sold into bondage, there was a tribe known as the Efik of Old Calabar. They came to control all the slave trade on the coast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tribe that sold its own people?\u201d This I hadn\u2019t heard.</p><p>\u201cNot its own. In Africa, then and now, there are divisions, wars, hatreds. One group would fight another; then the victor would sell his prisoners to the Efik, who in turn sold them to the white traders.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. People, regardless of color, just weren\u2019t very nice to one another.</p><p>\u201cThe Erik had a secret society known as the Egbo. They began as a group of judges, but eventually the Erik had so many slaves in their possession, they had to find a way to keep them under control. The Egbo became a feared clan who imparted vicious punishment for the slightest wrong. The very whisper of their name was enough to cow captives into submission.\u201d</p><p>I could see where that would be helpful. Slave revolts were a reasonable fear when the population of the oppressed was often double that of the oppressor. In fact, Haiti had been the location of the only successful slave revolt in history.</p><p>\u201cThis is all very interesting, Renee, but what does it have to do with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man in the mountains is said to be of the Egbo.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Three</p><p>\u201cWhy would there still be an Egbo? There aren\u2019t any more slaves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain of that, Priestess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlavery\u2019s illegal. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThings are only illegal if you are caught doing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. They\u2019re always illegal.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cSo young and innocent despite the pain in your eyes.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to discuss the pain in my eyes with her or anyone else.</p><p>\u201cAre you trying to tell me the bokor is a slave trader?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course not. That is definitely illegal.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not tell you of the bokor. I will not take you to him. You are to stay away from the man. He is wicked and, I have heard, not quite sane.\u201d</p><p>Too bad he sounded like just the guy I needed to see.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d I lowered my hand. \u201cWhen can I learn how to raise the voodoo queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will send a houngan to meet with you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought only a bokor could raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a bokor would. Any priest or priestess may know how.\u201d</p><p>Too bad I\u2019d never met one.</p><p>\u201cIs raising the dead worth losing yourself?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>I lifted my chin, met her eyes squarely. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Renee held my gaze for a moment, then gave a sharp nod and stepped onto the veranda. By the time I followed, she was gone.</p><p>I returned to my empty room. I had to find the bokor, and I needed to get out of Port-au-Prince before Renee figured out what I was up to, if she hadn\u2019t already.</p><p>She\u2019d tattle to Edward. He\u2019d come down here, or send someone else. Then we\u2019d have the shouting and the arguing and the dragging me home.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t know Edward well, but I knew that much. He didn\u2019t like his orders disobeyed. I had not been sent to confront a possibly insane, violent man. I wasn\u2019t trained for it.</p><p>I\u2019d be yanked out; one of Edward\u2019s minions would be sent in, and the only hope I had of getting my daughter back would explode in a burning ball of fire\u2014the common J\u00e4ger-Sucher method of dealing with problems. Although, come to think of it, werewolves exploded when shot with silver, I wasn\u2019t sure what happened to evil voodoo priests.</p><p>I could not allow that to occur before I found out what I needed to know, so I locked my door and snuck out of the hotel.</p><p>Money talked, everywhere, and thanks to Edward I now had quite a bit of it. Less than two hours and several hundred dollars later, I entered a bar in a seedy section of Port-au-Prince\u2014though, really, most of the city was iffy at best.</p><p>Blocked roads, huge potholes, open drains, and burning piles of garbage\u2014I\u2019d have been scared if I cared all that much about living. However, since I did care about my daughter, I carried the knife Edward\u2019s influence had allowed me to bring into Haiti in a sheath at my waist. I wasn\u2019t much good with guns, but the knife was a different story.</p><p>After my whole world fell apart I\u2019d been understandably twitchy. I\u2019d learned a little karate and how to handle a knife. I could even throw the thing, end over end, and hit a target on a tree eight times out of ten.</p><p>So if a tree ever attacked me, I was in excellent shape.</p><p>Over the last few hours, I\u2019d discovered there wasn\u2019t a Haitian alive who\u2019d go near the bokor. But Devon Murphy would. For the right amount of cash, he\u2019d sell his soul.</p><p>While the description made my lip curl\u2014my husband had been obsessed enough with money to throw everything worthwhile away\u2014nevertheless, I needed just such a man to lead me into the mountains.</p><p>Inside the Chwal Lanme\u2014Creole for Seahorse if the icon on the sign was any indication\u2014the scent of beer was overwhelming, and the crowd was thick. The tavern resembled an old-time sailors\u2019 haunt, with a teakwood bar and a ship\u2019s wheel as a chandelier. A lone white man slumped at an empty table, eyes half-closed, beer mug half-full.</p><p>\u201cMurphy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>His black gaze was beady in the bloated confines of his face. His beard gray and scraggly, he had to be fifty, maybe sixty. If he knew where the bokor lived, I didn\u2019t care if he was a hundred.</p><p>\u201cMay I?\u201d I pulled out the empty chair.</p><p>He drained the last of his beer, then, setting the glass down with a click, motioned to it.</p><p>Lifting my hand for a refill, I sat. After the bartender brought the drink, waiting at my elbow until I paid\u2014</p><p>I guess running a tab wasn\u2019t an option in a place like this\u2014I got right to business. \u201cI hear you\u2019re the man to see if I need to go into the mountains.\u201d</p><p>Murphy grunted.</p><p>\u201cHow much will it cost to take me to the bokor?\u201d</p><p>White, bushy brows slammed together as he drained the beer in one long sip. His mouth opened; no sound came out. His eyes rolled back, and he passed out, slumping forward until his forehead kissed the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way for a lady to be talkin\u2019?\u201d</p><p>I spun around, and then I gaped. The man in the doorway was\u2014</p><p>My mind groped for a word; all I could think of was exotic. His hair hung to his shoulders. Once light brown, it had been streaked nearly blond by the sun. Tangled in the strands were beads and feathers of unknown origin.</p><p>His skin had darkened to just short of bronze. Burnished gold bracelets were clasped around the honed biceps revealed by the torn-out sleeves of his once white shirt. Khaki trousers had been similarly attacked below the knees, leaving his sinewy calves as bare as his feet.</p><p>But what really drew my attention was his face. With sharp cheekbones, a square chin, and eyes that hovered between blue and gray, he was stunning.</p><p>When he tilted his head, a hoop flashed in his left ear. Before I could stop myself my hand lifted to my own pierced but no longer adorned lobe.</p><p>He smiled and instead of softening his face, the expression, combined with the hoop, made me think of marauding pirates and Errol Flynn.</p><p>\u201cWere you looking for me, mademoiselle?\u201d</p><p>His first words had sounded Irish; now his accent had traveled to France. I glanced at the sloppy drunk spread out on the table in front of me. \u201cGod, I hope so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes two of us. Step into my office.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared through the door. I hesitated only long enough to stroke my fingertips over the hilt of</p><p>my knife before following.</p><p>As I entered a narrow alleyway, the heat of a tropical night caressed my face. The man leaned against a chain-link fence that separated the Chwal Lanme from another business of unknown origin. He lifted a bottle of beer to his mouth and drank.</p><p>Fascinated, I watched his throat work, captivated by a single drop of liquid that raced down his neck before disappearing into the collar of his shirt. I swallowed, the sound an audible click in the silence that stretched between us.</p><p>He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and offered the bottle to me. The idea of putting my lips where his had been unnerved me so much I stuttered. \u201cWh-who are y-you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho do you want me to be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the right amount, I\u2019ll be whatever or whoever you want.\u201d</p><p>His accent was American now. He made me dizzy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He lifted the beer, drank, then lowered the bottle. \u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve come to the right place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Murphy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>I was no longer sure if I was happy about that or not.</p><p>He took a step closer. I took a step back. My shoulders skimmed the wall of the tavern. He towered over me, which wasn\u2019t hard since I wasn\u2019t tall, but I figured he was well over six feet of wiry muscle.</p><p>My fingers crept toward my knife. His closed over them before they got there, and my gaze locked with his.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said softly, squeezing to a point just short of pain before releasing my hand.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, continuing to crowd me, his body so close I swore it brushed against mine. All I had to do was bring up my knee, fast, and he\u2019d go away\u2014or perhaps go down\u2014but I didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>What was it about Devon Murphy that fascinated me? His beauty? His mystery? His strength?</p><p>Perhaps it was just my deprivation. I hadn\u2019t been with a man since I\u2019d learned the truth about my husband. Before that, there\u2019d only been Karl. I\u2019d thought I was dead inside, but I guess I\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>\u201cBack off,\u201d I ordered.</p><p>His eyes widened; his lips twitched, but he moved. Suddenly I could breathe again. Unfortunately, all I could smell was him.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t he stink like a half-naked tavern-dwelling beer drinker should? Why did he smell like soap, rainwater, and sunshine? I had a thing for sunshine.</p><p>I shook my head hard enough to make it ache. When my vision cleared, he was still gorgeous and right in front of me. I thought of my daughter and why I had come.</p><p>\u201cI heard you know the mountains.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAs well as any man can know them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you take me somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends upon where that somewhere is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where it is. I only know what I need to find.\u201d My lips tightened. \u201cMake that who.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re searching for someone in the mountains? I haven\u2019t heard of any tourists being lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I look like a tourist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept for the knife, I\u2019d say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cMy mistake. There aren\u2019t a lot of tiny white women running around Haiti. What are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of your business. All you need to know is that I can pay, if you deliver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeliver what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe. To the bokor.\u201d</p><p>His mouth flattened as the light in his eyes brightened. \u201cMezareau?\u201d</p><p>I experienced a sudden chill despite the heat of the night, as if someone were staring intently at the center of my back. I glanced around, even though no one was here but us.</p><p>I shook off my unease, excited to hear the man\u2019s name at last. \u201cYou know him?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot personally. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where he is?\u201d</p><p>His face became guarded. \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>I tried to refrain from sneering. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hundred thousand.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. \u201cDollars? Try again.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cNo skin off my nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard you\u2019d do anything for money.\u201d</p><p>While that should have been insulting, Murphy merely smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about the mountains?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhy won\u2019t anyone go there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the mountains that keep people away, but Mezareau. He\u2019s... not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d</p><p>Murphy tilted his head again, and I was distracted by the glint of his earring. Was the thing hypnotizing me? \u201cWhat happened to make your eyes so sad and your voice so sharp, Miss... ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d I supplied.</p><p>He continued to wait for my last name, but he\u2019d be waiting a long time.</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said when I didn\u2019t answer. \u201cSecrets, mon cher?\u201d</p><p>This time he spoke French with the accent of the Irish.</p><p>\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>He spread his hands, trying to appear innocent but failing. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou change accents every other minute. Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere. Nowhere. Here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecrets?\u201d I mocked.</p><p>\u201cYou tell me yours,\u201d he winked, \u201cand I\u2019ll tell you mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen hell freezes over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to share?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSharing always gets me into trouble.\u201d</p><p>He smirked and my cheeks heated.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019ll tell me anything anyway,\u201d I continued, \u201cor at least not the truth.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand against his chest in a dramatic gesture. A silver ring encircled one thumb. \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet you want me to lead you into the darkest jungle,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t a jungle anymore.\u201d</p><p>The maj ority of Haiti was marked by a complete lack of tree cover. Deforestation caused by a total reliance on wood as energy and charcoal for cooking had decimated the country before the twentieth century. There were only a few forests left, and they were national parks.</p><p>\u201cFigure of speech.\u201d Murphy\u2019s mouth curved. \u201cHow do you know I won\u2019t take the money and run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I won\u2019t be giving it to you until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do I know you have it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI have a better idea.\u201d</p><p>His gaze wandered over me and I rolled my eyes. \u201cGet another idea.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cSadly, that one seems to be stuck in my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and most men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. We are a disgusting lot.\u201d</p><p>Now he sounded English. I resisted the childish urge to kick him in the shin. \u201cIs there anyone else I can hire?\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the fence, crossed his arms. His muscles bulged against the golden bracelets. The jewelry, the beads, the feathers, should have made him effeminate, but they strangely had the opposite effect.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to answer. I\u2019d already been from one end of town to the other. Everyone was terrified of the bokor, if they would even admit to knowing what one was or that one existed. The single person who didn\u2019t seem afraid, merely wary, was Murphy. He was also the only man who\u2019d known the bokor \u2019s name or seemed to have any idea where to find him.</p><p>What was a hundred thousand dollars compared to both the life of my child and the death of the crescent moon curse? I was certain Edward would agree. I\u2019d just opened my mouth to accept Murphy\u2019s terms when he spoke first. \u201cYou tell me why you want to meet Mezareau, and I\u2019ll take you to him for a reasonable fee.\u201d</p><p>My teeth snapped together, narrowly missing my tongue. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and glanced away. \u201cYou seem desperate.\u201d</p><p>And he didn\u2019t seem the type to care.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s reasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen thousand plus expenses.\u201d</p><p>That was reasonable. If you didn\u2019t count baring your soul to a stranger in the mix.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, offering my hand.</p><p>His fingers enveloped mine, so long, so supple and clever, I was reminded of a pianist, until heavy calluses rubbed against my skin. My gaze flickered over the numerous cuts, scrapes, and scars on his.</p><p>Murphy held on too long, and when I realized I was letting him, I yanked my hand away, making no effort to hide my unease as I rubbed the tingling appendage against my j eans.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem insulted. Not that I cared. He now worked for me.</p><p>\u201cDo you want to do it here or inside?\u201d</p><p>I gaped as images of \u201cdoing it\u201d spilled through my head.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>His grin told me he\u2019d misled me on purpose, just because he could. This trip was not going to be easy, but then I\u2019d never expected it to be.</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d tell me why you want to meet the _bokor\u201d _ he said.</p><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d I strolled toward the door. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t say when.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>I figured Murphy would argue semantics. Instead he murmured, \u201cTouch\u00e9,\u201d and followed me into the tavern.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as I buy supplies.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to hand over the cash and believe you\u2019ll come back?\u201d</p><p>Anger flashed across his face. \u201cI agree to do a j ob, I do it; otherwise I wouldn\u2019t live very long in a place like this.\u201d</p><p>Third-world countries such as Haiti did possess a \u201chang the horse thief\u201d mentality. I couldn\u2019t say I blamed them. People had very little; they protected what they did have with a vengeance. Literally.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d I reached under my shirt to extract money from the belly bag where I kept it. Murphy\u2019s gray-blue eyes followed every move.</p><p>\u201cWhen can we leave?\u201d I repeated.</p> <p>\u201cSunup.\u201d</p><p>My watch read well past midnight. He obviously wasn\u2019t going to patronize any of the retail establishments in town.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiring bearers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one would come.\u201d His eyes met mine. \u201cYou still want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could make me stop.\u201d</p><p>He continued to stare into my face for several seconds more, as if trying to figure me out. Good luck.</p> <p>\u201cAll right then, I\u2019ll see you at sunrise.\u201d</p><p>I returned to the Hotel Olafsson, stopped in the lobby, and roused the manager. Edward had made certain I\u2019d be able to draw funds whenever I might need them. I obtained a money order for the agreed-upon amount, then headed to my room.</p><p>As soon as I flicked on the light, I knew someone had been inside. Not the maid, either. They usually didn\u2019t draw symbols on the wall over the bed.</p><p>Bright red. Could be blood.</p><p>I crossed the floor and swiped my index finger against the plaster, then stared at the glistening residue.</p><p>Probably was.</p><p>I didn\u2019t plan to wait around for an analysis. I didn\u2019t plan to call the authorities and tell them about it. I had to meet Murphy, and the police would not be amenable to letting me leave once they saw this.</p><p>In Haiti, everyone and their grandchild knew that drawing the icons of a coffin and a cross called the loa Baron Samedi, Lord of Death, gatekeeper to the other world.</p> <p>Loas are the immortal spirits of voodoo. A bridge between God, known as the Gran Met, and humankind, they resemble the saints, angels, and devils of Catholicism.</p><p>And in a coincidence that probably wasn\u2019t, Baron Samedi also oversees the process of changing the dead into zombies and the shape-shifting of animals.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what this meant, but I was sure I wanted to get out of here before I found out. I turned away from the wall and something crunched under my shoe.</p><p>Dirt lay strewn from the doorway to the bed. I\u2019d been dancing in the stuff since I walked in.</p><p>The whisper of a thousand voices surrounded me. I staggered, feverish and dizzy. Someone had sent the dead.</p><p>Not just any someone. Only a bokor can perform this most feared of all black magic spells.</p><p>The sorcerer gathers a handful of graveyard dirt for every spirit sent to enter the body of his victim. The amount spilled on the floor of my room explained why I heard so many voices, why I felt innumerable hands pushing, pulling, and pinching me, the pressure in my head as the spirits attempted to invade my mind.</p><p>If they succeeded, I\u2019d go insane and then I\u2019d die. The only way to end such a spell was by the interference of a powerful voodoo practitioner.</p><p>Wait! That was me.</p><p>Struggling to think past the pain, the voices, the confusion, I searched for an answer and thought of a plan.</p><p>Each loa has a light and a dark side, Rada and Petro, respectively. To call the dark side requires blood, usually of a large animal, often a pig.</p><p>My gaze went to the drawings on the wall. I bet the owner of that blood had oinked at one time.</p><p>Baron Samedi is a Gede, a spirit of death. To send him away, I needed to summon a spirit of life, and there was none stronger than Aida-Wedo, goddess of fertility. Conveniently she was also the wife of</p><p>my guardian spirit, Danballah. I had never had a problem summoning either one of them, sometimes even when I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Muttering a prayer that tonight would be no different from any other, I thrust my hand into my bag, sighing with relief when my fingers closed around the tiny piece of chalk I kept there.</p><p>Gasping and grunting against the pain, fighting the insane images of blood, darkness, and isolation that flickered through my mind, on the floor I drew a rainbow\u2014the symbol of Aida-Wedo, who rules the realm of new life.</p><p>\u201cHelp me,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>The spirits howled inside my head until my eardrums ached. For an instant I thought I\u2019d only pissed them off; then light fell over my face.</p><p>A rainbow spilled into the room, the colors so bright I could see nothing else. Soft music drowned out the grating voices as peace surrounded me. Aida-Wedo\u2019s rainbow was the calm that followed every storm.</p><p>The whispers and the pain faded. When the colors went away, so had the bloody symbols on my wall.</p><p>As soon as I stopped shaking, as soon as I could breathe normally again, I called Edward. Though he preferred e-mail for updates\u2014the old man had a powerful fixation with the Internet\u2014I\u2019d put my foot down at taking a laptop to Haiti. What was I going to do with it while I was trekking up a mountain?</p><p>Since I hadn\u2019t brought a cell phone, either\u2014as if one would work here\u2014I placed the call from my room.</p><p>\u201cMandenauer,\u201d he barked. Edward never bothered with \u201chello\u201d or \u201cgood-bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir.\u201d I resisted the urge to stand up straight and click my heels. Edward always had that effect on me.</p><p>\u201cHave you found the answer?\u201d</p><p>I very nearly said, What was the question ? but Edward had a serious humor deficit.</p><p>No doubt being a spy in WWII had cured him of the urge to laugh long ago, and fighting monsters for the past sixty years hadn\u2019t improved his disposition. I\u2019d been told he\u2019d lightened up lately, but I found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t even been here a day,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a man who knows how to raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need to tell Edward the guy could be evil personified, at the least slightly insane, or that I was</p><p>headed into the mountains with an opportunist to find him. I also didn\u2019t need to tell Edward I\u2019d been threatened. What was he going to do about it?</p><p>\u201cHas something happened?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>How did he always know everything? Perhaps it was just the wisdom of age, though I doubted it.</p><p>Sometimes I wondered if Edward was human himself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, though that wasn\u2019t what he\u2019d asked.</p><p>\u201cTell me, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice made my eyes prickle. Before I burst into tears and lost my J\u00e4ger-Sucher membership card, I blurted out what I\u2019d found in my room, and what I\u2019d done about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure you didn\u2019t imagine the symbol? You\u2019ve had a long trip, a difficult life.\u201d</p><p>I stilled. No one was supposed to know about my life. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I would allow just anyone to work for me? That I would not investigate your background before you appeared in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey promised\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always promise.\u201d</p><p>Though only the U.S. marshal who\u2019d relocated me, and maybe his boss, was supposed to know who I really was, where I now lived, Edward had powerful connections. There was little he couldn\u2019t do or discover. So why was I surprised he\u2019d been able to discover me?</p><p>\u201cTrust no one, Cassandra. You will live longer.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. His warning seemed prophetic, but what didn\u2019t around here?</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t trust you?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThat is your choice. Know that I will give anything to destroy the monsters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy \u2018anything,\u2019 you mean \u2018anyone.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>At least he was honest. I couldn\u2019t throw stones. I\u2019d give anything, and anyone, to have my daughter back.</p><p>\u201cReturning to the bringing of the dead,\u201d Edward continued, \u201cwhat does this mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEither there\u2019s a very powerful bokor who isn\u2019t too happy with me or I\u2019m nuts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich do you choose?\u201d</p><p>I drew the toe of my shoe through the dirt on the floor, then lifted my index finger. Blood had dried on my skin.</p><p>\u201d Bokor,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cThat would be my choice, as well. But how does this man even know you are there?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, how did he?</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d Edward asked, and it hit me.</p><p>Renee had refused to speak Mezareau\u2019s name. I had a feeling her reticence was not just because she disliked him.</p><p>When Murphy had spoken the bokor \u2019s name aloud, a bizarre sensation of being watched had come over me. I didn\u2019t think that had been merely a goose walking over my grave but rather Mezareau opening his eyes, wherever he was, and seeing me.</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d Edward said. \u201cHow does he know?\u201d</p><p>Quickly I told him my thoughts, being careful not to utter the word Mezareau.</p><p>\u201cThis man sounds more like a legend than a reality.\u201d</p><p>My heart stuttered. I needed Mezareau, and all that I\u2019d heard about him, to be real.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t dealing with legends turned to reality the main thrust of the J\u00e4ger-Sucher j ob description?\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cJa. Which is why you are in Haiti.\u201d</p><p>Touch\u00e9, I thought, the word bringing Devon Murphy to mind. I glanced at the window. The eastern horizon was growing lighter, as was my mood at a new realization.</p><p>\u201cBringing the dead is serious voodoo,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Someone who could perform such magic, at such a distance, was very powerful indeed.</p><p>\u201cIn other words,\u201d Edward said, \u201cif he can bring the dead, he can also raise them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say yes.\u201d My voice came out so chipper, you\u2019d think we were discussing a surprise party.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mountains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve camped before.\u201d In a state park.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t what I asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mountains are remote, but I hired a guide who knows where to take me.\u201d Or so he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there and back before you know it.\u201d</p><p>I could tell by Edward\u2019s silence he didn\u2019t like the idea, which was why I hadn\u2019t planned on telling him.</p><p>Until being possessed by the spirits of the dead had made me far too chatty.</p><p>\u201cThe man is powerful and evil,\u201d Edward said. \u201cI should send someone to kill him instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>I could almost see Edward lift his brow at my insolence, but I didn\u2019t need him sending one of his minions down here. I\u2019d only met a few, but they\u2019d all scared the crap out of me.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do it,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve had to cut back.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what he meant, and I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cAre you certain that raising the voodoo queen is the sole way to end the curse of the crescent moon?\u201d</p><p>Edward asked.</p><p>\u201cAccording to all the legends, as well as your pal Renee, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegends are made to be broken. Once I believed only silver would end a werewolf\u2019s existence, but I learned differently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I have a lead on this particular method, I don\u2019t think I should waste time searching for an alternative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll expect a full report the instant you return to Port-au-Prince.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>Silence drifted over the line. I\u2019d have thought Edward had hung up without a good-bye, again, except</p><p>I hadn\u2019t heard a click and I still heard him breathing.</p><p>\u201cYou spoke with Renee?\u201d</p><p>His voice was different. No longer brusque, there was a softness, and a wariness, which hinted that his question was not merely chitchat. As if Edward ever made chitchat.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with her,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cShe was helpful?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery.\u201d</p><p>Since he was asking questions, I decided to ask one of my own. \u201cHow do you know Renee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in the resistance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn France?\u201d My voice went up in pitch and volume.</p><p>\u201cWhere else?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t get my mind around the idea that Renee, a black woman familiar with voodoo, had been a member of the French Resistance. But was that any more bizarre than werewolves, zombies, and bringing the dead? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cDid you two have something going?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>\u201cWe had a war going,\u201d he said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you called it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat is what everyone called it.\u201d</p><p>I felt bad about teasing him. Especially since Edward didn\u2019t seem to get my j oke. Not a big shock since I\u2019d never been all that funny. Even before my life went to hell ahead of me.</p><p>\u201cThat is in the past,\u201d he muttered. \u201cOver.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure if he was referring to the war or to him and Renee. Probably both.</p><p>\u201cYou will discover what we need to know,\u201d he ordered. \u201cThen report to me.\u201d</p> <p>I opened my mouth to agree, but he\u2019d already hung up.</p><p>Shaking my head, I went into the bathroom. The old man was strange, but he had good reason to be.</p><p>I washed my hands, my face, brushed my teeth, and left. I could have used a shower, but I wasn\u2019t willing to remain any longer in a place where the dead had swirled through the air, as well as my head. The symbol of Baron Samedi might be gone, but I wasn\u2019t taking any chances.</p><p>I checked out of the hotel. If Renee\u2019s houngan came, he wouldn\u2019t waste time searching for me, and if Renee tattled to Edward about where I\u2019d gone, it wouldn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d already tattled on myself.</p><p>The tavern was open, Murphy nowhere to be seen. A few stragglers lounged in dark corners, nursing the hair of the dog. A smattering of Creole filled the air. I understood a little of the language, but not enough to keep up in a normal conversation.</p><p>The bartender appeared to be the same one on duty as before. Maybe he was the only one they had, or even the owner. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Devon Murphy.\u201d</p> <p>The man shrugged.</p><p>Swell. I\u2019d given Murphy enough money to buy supplies, figuring he wouldn\u2019t disappear if there was the promise of much more. Maybe I\u2019d figured wrong.</p><p>\u201cI talked to him last night,\u201d I pressed. \u201cIn the alley?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKoboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He made the motion of shooting with both hands. Bang-bang. \u201cJohn Wayne. Roy Rogers. Koboy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou call him Cowboy? Hell.\u201d That could not be good.</p><p>\u201cHe like to fight. More fists than gun. He very good at the fighting.\u201d The bartender grinned, revealing only a few working teeth.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>The bartender pointed at the ceiling.</p><p>I stomped upstairs, the force of my steps an attempt to assuage my annoyance that I\u2019d hired a man called Cowboy to take me into a remote wilderness. Why couldn\u2019t his nickname be Helpful Harry or Gentle George? Of course a man like that would probably not be very useful out where the wild things roamed.</p><p>Perhaps Murphy\u2019s penchant for using his fists would come in handy\u2014as long as he didn\u2019t use them on me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem the type. Of course, they never did.</p><p>I stroked my knife. If Murphy got pushy, punchy, or even too friendly, he\u2019d discover just how talented with the weapon I was.</p><p>Several doors lined the second floor; only one was open. I headed there first and wished I hadn\u2019t. If I\u2019d pounded on a few, Murphy would have heard me coming and had time to put on some clothes. As it was, I got an eyeful.</p><p>He was just pulling up his pants, more loose-fitting khakis, except these covered him from hip to heel.</p><p>Underneath he wore nothing but skin. I should have known Murphy would be the type to go commando.</p><p>I should also have figured he\u2019d be the same bronze shade all over, and that his ass would be as incredible as his arms.</p><p>I should have known, probably did, so why was I standing in the doorway staring as if I\u2019d never seen a naked man? Because I\u2019d never seen one like him and I hadn\u2019t seen any for a very long time.</p><p>He wore no shirt, and my eyes were drawn to the rippling muscles of his back. Long, sinuous, defined \u2014he\u2019d gotten those from reps, not weight. The way he moved reminded me of the jungle cats Sarah had always loved at the zoo. Lions, tigers, leopards, j aguars, they all flowed with the same loose, muscular grace.</p><p>He slipped a faded green T-shirt over his head; his palm skated over his ribs, his belly, his hip, just ahead of the cloth, and the image of that hand touching me in just that way, of my mouth replacing his fingers, made me bite my lip before a moan escaped. I should have gotten laid before I\u2019d come down here.</p><p>The floor creaked, and Murphy glanced back, eyebrows lifting at the sight of me just inside the doorway.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>He had no idea.</p><p>Or maybe he did. The expression in his eyes, the twist to his mouth, said he knew exactly what he was doing and he liked it. Had he known I was there all along?</p><p>I remembered stomping on the steps and wondered for an instant if he\u2019d pulled his pants down just so he could pull them up when I got to the doorway. But why?</p><p>I might have been pretty once, but anguish and guilt had put lines where they hadn\u2019t ought to be. And my body... well, it got me where I was going. But my sharp edges far outweighed my curves\u2014in more ways than one. There was nothing about me that would entice a man like Devon Murphy to seduction.</p><p>I forced the foolish thoughts away. Murphy was a game player. He liked to have the upper hand, and since he was working for me, he had to get it some way. No doubt he\u2019d figured out, in the way of scam artists and opportunists everywhere, that I hadn\u2019t gotten naked in a helluva long time.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBorn, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGack.\u201d I pantomimed gagging; it wasn\u2019t that hard. \u201cSpare me the infantile endearments.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the bed and began to put on his socks\u2014heavy, white, athletic, as if he planned to do some j ogging. Maybe he did.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d call you Mrs. Whatever, but you won\u2019t tell me your last name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know I\u2019m a Mrs.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got that look.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stuffed his right foot into a worn hiking boot. The boot soothed my nerves more than anything else had. He\u2019d hiked before. I only hoped he\u2019d done it here.</p><p>I lifted my gaze from his foot to his face and found him watching me.</p><p>\u201cWhat look?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018some man done me wrong look.\u2019 I\u2019m betting you\u2019re divorced. He screwed around. You after the bokor to kill him?\u201d</p><p>I merely smiled. If I\u2019d wanted Karl dead I could have killed him myself, many times. But death would have been too easy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you why I need to see the bokor when you get me to the bokor,\u201d I said.</p><p>Murphy shrugged and finished with his left boot. \u201cCan\u2019t blame a man for trying.\u201d</p><p>Trying what? To seduce me, or to find out what I was after? Either way, he\u2019d failed, and he\u2019d continue to fail until I decided he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>I frowned. I meant I wouldn\u2019t let him discover my secrets until the time was right. I was never going to decide he could seduce me. Sleeping with a self-serving cheat of a liar once in my lifetime was quite enough, thank you.</p><p>Murphy leaned over and snagged two large packs from behind the bed. He handed one to me and swung the other onto his back. I occupied myself taking the things I needed out of my travel bag and stuffing them into the new backpack.</p><p>\u201cI rented a Jeep,\u201d he said. \u201cToday we drive; tomorrow we\u2019re on foot.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, struggling to hoist the heavy pack. Murphy studied me while he secured the straps over his shoulders and around his waist. Then he plucked the thing out of my hands and whirled me around.</p><p>His fingers brushed my arms, and even through the cotton of my blouse I felt the calluses. He stood too close; his hip brushed mine, and I caught the scent of rainwater. Was he bathing in the stuff?</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d I protested, inching away.</p><p>He yanked on the straps, and I stumbled backward, my rear end bumping his crotch. He grunted, the sound more interest than annoyance or pain, and I resisted the urge to stomp on his foot. Though he might act laid-back, even lazy, there was a latent violence in Murphy that made me think stomping on his toes would be like poking a panther with a stick: I wouldn\u2019t like what happened next.</p><p>With quick, clever fingers he secured the backpack, then gave me a little shove. I spun around too fast and the weight of the pack kept swinging. I nearly toppled over, but he caught my elbows and steadied me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve hiked before?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I shrugged, hoping he\u2019d let that go.</p><p>\u201cCassandra. Have you hiked before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep up. Don\u2019t worry about me.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been in the mountains, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about a forest, a hill, even a dale? Anywhere besides a shopping mall?\u201d</p><p>My lips tightened. \u201cI\u2019ve been places you couldn\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>They just weren\u2019t the wilderness. More like hell on earth.</p><p>Murphy said something in a language I didn\u2019t recognize, but a curse sounds like a curse, regardless. \u201cThe mountains are dangerous,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to know what you\u2019re about up there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I knew what I was doing, I wouldn\u2019t need you.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stared at me for several seconds. \u201cJust do what I say when I say it.\u201d</p><p>Like that was going to happen, but I managed to nod anyway.</p><p>\u201cHow many days until we reach the bokor?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDepends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he wants us to find him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Murphy brushed past me and headed for the stairs.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019re dead.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Six</p><p>I let the comment pass. Maybe he was trying to scare me. Maybe he wasn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>I followed Murphy into the hall. \u201cI hear you\u2019re called Cowboy.\u201d</p><p>He flinched, shoulders drawing in, backpack shifting. \u201cNicknames like that get people killed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot John Wayne,\u201d I muttered. \u201cHe never died. In his movies anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure he did. The Cowboys. How\u2019s that for irony? I think he died in one of his war movies, too. Green Berets maybe. Or Sands of Iwo Jima.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a John Wayne fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought John Wayne was an American icon. Don\u2019t the Europeans consider him a sad commentary on our cowboy nation?\u201d</p> <p>Now I was fishing\u2014trying to get Murphy to admit where he was from. He merely shrugged, and I was forced to try harder.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they call you Cowboy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey call me Koboy.\u201d He gave the name a Creole twist.</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d I snapped. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey call all Americans that.\u201d</p><p>Aha! I thought. What I said was: \u201cNot me.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy let his gaze wander from the tips of my brand-new hiking boots to the top of my bare head. I\u2019d have to dig out my hat before too long or risk sunstroke. See, I knew a few things about the tropics.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a Cowboy,\u201d he said.</p><p>I eyed him down and up, the way he\u2019d eyed me. With the feathers in his long hair and the earring in his ear, he looked more like an Indian\u2014even if he was nearly blond. He\u2019d taken off his arm bracelets, but not his silver thumb ring. After the bartender\u2019s comments about fighting, I wondered if that was more a brass knuckle than an adornment.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re American?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>He gave me a cocky smile. \u201cYou\u2019re thinkin\u2019 so?\u201d</p><p>The brogue was back, thicker than ever. God, he was annoying.</p><p>Without waiting for my answer, Murphy started downstairs. I followed, bumping into his backpack when he paused only a few steps down.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d I began.</p> <p>He lifted a hand, silencing me. His head tilted as he listened to something, or someone, below. From the tension in his body I knew enough to shut up.</p><p>\u201cUpstairs,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cBut he is with a woman.\u201d</p><p>I made a face, which Murphy, when he whirled and practically shoved me onto the landing, ignored.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He pushed past me, grabbing my hand as he went, then dragged me after him down the back stairs, which were narrow, creaky, and dangerous. We burst out of the tavern and into the alley where a battered Jeep waited.</p><p>Murphy let go of me and jumped into the driver\u2019s seat. I scooted around the hood and barely managed to dive in before he floored it, scraping the passenger door against the chain-link fence.</p><p>We spilled onto the street. He flicked a glance into the rearview mirror. \u201cDuck,\u201d he said, the tone so casual I could only stare at him dumbly.</p><p>He reached over and shoved my head into his lap, dipping his own just as gunfire erupted. He didn\u2019t stop, didn\u2019t flinch, just kept driving, and in a moment we\u2019d left our pursuers behind.</p><p>His thigh pressed against my cheek; his zipper scraped the back of my head. We\u2019d jumped into the car still wearing our backpacks and mine was twisted awkwardly between my shoulders and the seat. His had to be shoving him practically into the steering wheel.</p><p>I sat up; he let me. I removed the pack and tossed it backward, then helped him do the same. Silence settled between us, a silence I couldn\u2019t let stand. \u201cFriends of yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t seem very friendly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe dead, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand the sentiment, but what did you do?\u201d</p><p>He gave a short bark of laughter and cast me a speculative glance. \u201cYou want me dead, sweet thing?\u201d</p><p>Southern accent this time.</p><p>\u201cMaybe not dead,\u201d I allowed.</p><p>He was, after all, the only one willing, or perhaps able, to take me to the bokor.</p><p>\u201cIf not dead, then what?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cTruthful.\u201d</p><p>Did he really know how to find the bokor? Or was he taking me into the mountains with nefarious designs, if not on my person, then on my money or my life?</p><p>My fingers crept to the knife at my waist. I really wished I could trust him, but I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cThe instant you\u2019re truthful with me, sugar, I\u2019ll be truthful with you.\u201d</p><p>I scowled. He had a point; however, I wasn\u2019t going to tell him what I was really after until we were too far away from Port-au-Prince for him to take me back and dump me at the nearest insane asylum.</p><p>\u201cThe way you switch accents gives me a damn headache,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cA damn headache?\u201d Southern. \u201cWell, we cannot have that.\u201d English. \u201cWhich accent should I use?\u201d</p><p>American.</p><p>I didn\u2019t answer. I wanted to slug him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pick one,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican seems to get me the farthest around here. Can\u2019t imagine why, since you people invaded the place not too long ago.\u201d</p><p>Over ten years ago, but who was counting? Probably the Haitians.</p><p>\u201cWe do that,\u201d I said drily. \u201cInvade. But we\u2019re only trying to help.\u201d</p><p>Murphy snorted.</p><p>His words\u2014 you p eop le\u2014made me rethink his nationality. I wasn\u2019t sure what he was all over again.</p><p>He stared into the rearview mirror and frowned. I turned around so fast my neck crackled, but the road behind us was empty.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know them,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cThen why did we run?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI owe some money. I planned to pay as soon as we got back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStiffing people is not healthy in these parts.\u201d</p><p>I thought of my drug-dealing husband and the enforcers he\u2019d employed. \u201cIt\u2019s not healthy in any parts.\u201d</p><p>He cast me a quick glance. Oops. Must have let too much emotion shine through. A mistake I rarely made anymore. I schooled my face into the polite mask I\u2019d perfected since I\u2019d become Priestess Cassandra. But I doubted the expression fooled Murphy.</p><p>\u201cAnyone who comes to Chwal Lanme asking for me is usually someone I owe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was a refreshing change of pace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet. Let\u2019s get back to the goons with guns. Who were they if not the people you owe or their minions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMinions?\u201d His quick grin was infectious. I very nearly smiled back. \u201cGotta love that word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless you\u2019re a minion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He concentrated on making a tight turn and avoiding a stray dog taking a nap in the middle of the road. \u201cThey could have been after you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept they asked for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps because you were asking for me. All over town from what I gathered.\u201d</p><p>Could the men who\u2019d come to the tavern have been Karl\u2019s? It had been so many years since I\u2019d changed lives, with not a hint that anyone had found me, I\u2019d begun to feel safe, and maybe I\u2019d made a stupid mistake.</p><p>My coming to Haiti was an invitation for them to dispose of me. No one would ever figure out what had happened. Or at least that was what the assassins thought. I doubted they knew about Edward and his own army of minions.</p><p>Still, it wouldn\u2019t do me a whole helluva lot of good if Edward figured out I\u2019d been killed for my previous life rather than my current one. I\u2019d still be dead. And so would my little girl.</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s after me,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m just Priestess Cassandra, your friendly New Orleans voodoo practitioner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I neglect to mention that?\u201d</p><p>He shot me a glare.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d Funny, I didn\u2019t sound sorry at all. \u201cIt\u2019s just my j ob. No worries.\u201d</p><p>His j aw worked as he ground his teeth together. I\u2019d finally annoyed him, and I wasn\u2019t even trying.</p><p>\u201cYou come to Haiti,\u201d he said in a voice gone deep with fury, \u201cand ask me to take you into the mountains to meet an evil voodoo sorcerer, but you f orget to tell me that you\u2019re a voodoo priestess, and I\u2019m supposed to think nothing of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not paying you to think anything of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with some people; they can\u2019t help but think. Even if they aren\u2019t being paid for it.\u201d He slid a glance my way. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a voodoo priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I get that a lot.\u201d</p><p>We left Port-au-Prince behind, driving north along the coast, before turning inland toward more distant mountains.</p><p>No further shots were fired; no one tried to stop us. Of course Haiti had only two main roads. The one we were on eventually led to Cap Haitien. Le Cap, the former capital, was the main launching place to the nearby beaches of the Labadie Peninsula. Sun, sand, and surf\u2014too bad we didn\u2019t have the time.</p><p>A second road curved southwest, ending at Les Cayes. All other thoroughfares required a Jeep or a truck or one\u2019s feet to traverse.</p><p>As the day wore on, my j aw ached from clenching it to avoid biting off my tongue as we lurched over every bump and rut in the country. When dusk approached, Murphy wheeled onto a hard-packed dirt track.</p><p>We stopped at the base of a tree-covered mountain, the foliage such an unusual sight I could do little but stare. My skin tingled at the loss of sensation and my ears rang at the loss of sound.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll camp here,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me, no doubt trying to figure out if I was being sarcastic. I wasn\u2019t sure myself. The trip had been long, but we hadn\u2019t been walking. We still had about an hour before dark.</p><p>\u201cNo point in going on tonight,\u201d he answered, taking my question at face value. \u201cBetter to get a fresh start in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrees,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just... there aren\u2019t that many trees here and suddenly\u2014\u201d I pointed.</p><p>\u201cThis is the south side of a national park near Citadelle La Ferriere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fortress?\u201d I stared at the midnight blue mountain rising above us.</p><p>In the early nineteenth century, King Henri Christophe built the largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere three thousand feet above sea level. The 12-foot-thick walls and 140-foot-high ramparts had to have impressed everyone who\u2019d managed to climb high enough to see them.</p><p>\u201cThe bokor lives in a national park?\u201d I found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Murphy said, and grabbed his backpack.</p><p>I stepped out of the Jeep and promptly fell on my face.</p><p>Murphy hunkered down next to me. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy legs are asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t stop to eat. That was a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t notice.\u201d Ever since there\u2019d been no one to worry about but me, food had lost its allure.</p><p>Murphy helped me to my feet, but he didn\u2019t let go. \u201cYou want to die, sweetie pie?\u201d</p><p>His blue-gray gaze remained steady on mine. If I wasn\u2019t careful, he\u2019d wrest every secret from my head, and there were some in there I didn\u2019t ever want to examine again.</p><p>\u201cRhyming now?\u201d I kept my voice light as I inched out of his grip. \u201cPlease stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you start. Eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSkipping meals has never bothered me before. I\u2019m not sure why it did now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe heat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t heat. Try living in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound like you\u2019re from New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause sounding like you\u2019re from somewhere means that you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoint taken,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not eating, combined with the adrenaline rash of being chased and shot at, means dizziness and eventual fainting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I should be just dandy from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe lost those guys. So we shouldn\u2019t be chased or shot at again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom your mouth to God\u2019s ears,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we get out there,\u201d he pointed to the trees, \u201cit\u2019ll be open season for anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think no one else would take you where you want to go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t know where the bokor was?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, and his earring sparked orange in the light of the setting sun. \u201cThe locals know better than to come to this place. They call it Montagne sans retour. Mountain of No Return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do they call it that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause people have a nasty habit of disappearing whenever they go looking for Mezareau.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound good, but I refused to be intimidated by rumors and a nickname. Nevertheless, I cast a wary glance at the steadily darkening shadows. \u201cWe should probably stop using his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a bokor, a sorcerer. Speaking his name out loud could allow him to see us, maybe hear us. He\u2019ll know we\u2019re coming before we even get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else do you explain the disappearing people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know ...\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cGreat big guards who dispose of any and all trespassers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d</p><p>But I didn\u2019t think so. I\u2019d felt watched from the moment Murphy had said the bokor \u2019s name. I might be paranoid, but that didn\u2019t mean someone wasn\u2019t spying on me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Night settled over us like a cool, velvet curtain. I\u2019d never slept under the stars. I wasn\u2019t sleeping now.</p><p>Despite my exhaustion, oblivion would not come.</p><p>Murphy wasn\u2019t having any problem. After we\u2019d partaken of cold sandwiches and warm water\u2014no camp-fire in this heat\u2014he\u2019d rolled into his sleeping bag, and I hadn\u2019t heard another word out of him. At least he didn\u2019t snore.</p> <p>In the years since I\u2019d lost everything, I\u2019d had trouble sleeping. Every time I closed my eyes I saw my daughter the way I\u2019d seen her last.</p><p>In a coffin. No mother should have to see that.</p><p>I tried to count stars. There had to be a trillion. If assigning them a number didn\u2019t bore me into unconsciousness, what would?</p><p>I\u2019d reached 810 when a rustle from the foliage made me tense and lose track.</p><p>I held my breath, strained my ears, waited. Then I waited some more. Just when I\u2019d begun to relax, figuring I\u2019d heard nothing, or if something only a snake or a rodent, the sound came again\u2014closer this time\u2014much bigger than any rodent, much heavier than any snake.</p> <p>My knife was on the ground next to me, but only a few feet away lay Murphy\u2019s rifle. He had a pistol somewhere, too. I\u2019d seen him take it out of a cavernous pocket in his cargo pants, making me wonder what else he kept in mem.</p><p>I was thinking far too often and too fondly of what Murphy kept in his pants. I wished I\u2019d never seen</p><p>I wasn\u2019t wishing all that hard. A girl had to have some fantasies.</p><p>The rustle continued, slow and stealthy, from the far side of the camp. I had an intense desire to turn and look, except I doubted I\u2019d be able to see. Only a faint sliver of a moon shone so despite the trillion stars, there wasn\u2019t much light.</p><p>Nevertheless, I walked my fingers across the ground until my hand closed over the rifle, then drew it toward me, wincing at the scratch of metal against dirt.</p><p>Sleeping Beauty slept on. I felt so safe.</p> <p>My other hand crept toward the flashlight I\u2019d commandeered in case I had to hit the outdoor bidet sometime in the night. However, considering the sound of what was out there, I\u2019d do better to hold it until morning.</p><p>Slowly I turned my head, just as a faint rumble broke the night. Distant thunder? Or the growl of a predator much closer than that?</p><p>Considering the number of stars in the clear night sky, I was pretty sure I was in trouble.</p><p>I hit the button on the flashlight. A bright yellow beam brushed the trees and the foliage, highlighting a single pair of eyes.</p><p>\u201cShit!\u201d I exclaimed, sitting up, fumbling with the gun. I hadn\u2019t really expected to see anything!</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Murphy had awoken at last, but I didn\u2019t have time to explain. The bushes shook, the eyes never blinked, as whatever waited there crouched and crept closer. I dropped the flashlight, and the glare splashed across the ground.</p><p>There came a rush of movement, the crack of twigs, the crunching of rocks. Though I knew it was foolish, I fired.</p> <p>The report was obscenely loud, the silence that followed even more so.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Murphy yanked the rifle from my hands.</p><p>I scrambled to my feet, figuring I\u2019d have less chance of getting my throat ripped out if I was standing.</p><p>\u201cThere. There.\u201d I couldn\u2019t seem to do anything but point and repeat myself.</p><p>Murphy got my meaning immediately and spun toward the threat, lifting the rifle to his shoulder. I was impressed with his speed, his agility, his fearlessness, as he stalked toward the shadowed trees.</p><p>I expected something large and fierce to erupt. Something I\u2019d really pissed off by shooting at it.</p><p>Nothing happened. Maybe I\u2019d hit the thing.</p><p>I snatched the flashlight off the ground and hurried after Murphy.</p><p>\u201cStay,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>I ignored him, shining the light on the area where I\u2019d seen the eyes. Murphy reached out and shoved back the foliage.</p><p>I yelped, and the beam of light j iggled, revealing grass, dirt, a lot more trees, but little else.</p><p>He shot me a disgusted look. \u201cYou sure you didn\u2019t have a bad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t even asleep, which is more than I can say for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping is what we\u2019re supposed to be doing in the middle of the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to be protecting me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t recall protection as part of the deal. I\u2019m taking you to the bokor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t take me if I\u2019m dead!\u201d</p><p>Well, he could, but that would be kind of sick.</p><p>\u201cI woke up,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cAfter I took care of things.\u201d</p><p>Murphy continued to frown into the night. \u201cYou sure you weren\u2019t dreaming?\u201d</p><p>I scanned the shadowy darkness, traced the flashlight across the ground. No blood, no paw prints. Hell.</p><p>Maybe I had been dreaming.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t think so.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t shoot at people,\u201d Murphy said \u201cIt gets you in trouble, especially when you hit them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else would be creeping up on us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething that growled, with shiny eyes\u2014yellow, maybe green, hard to say in the dark. About so big.\u201d</p><p>I leveled my hand near my waist.</p><p>Murphy stared at me as if I were crazy. \u201cYou think you saw an animal out here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I did. I\u2019m not nuts.\u201d Lately . \u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t dreaming.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head and returned to his sleeping bag, placing the gun nearby.</p><p>I followed. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to stand guard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgainst what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe... um...\u201d I frowned.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d he said, and put his hands behind his head, closing his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWolf?\u201d</p><p>His lips twitched, but he kept his eyes closed. \u201cIn Haiti?\u201d</p><p>Wolves did tend to hang around cooler climates. Unless they were werewolves.</p><p>I glanced at the trees again. If a werewolf had been out there, it would have run toward me rather than away. They were funny like that.</p><p>I turned back. \u201cJaguar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCougar. Leopard. Coyote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do they have?\u201d</p><p>He opened one eye. \u201cFlamingos are pretty common.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was not a flamingo.\u201d</p><p>Unless it was a very, very big one. In this new world I\u2019d discovered a few months ago, such a thing was actually possible. Still, no matter how huge flamingos got, I didn\u2019t think they growled.</p><p>\u201cAnything furry?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>\u201cMost of the wildlife was hunted into extinction centuries ago, but even before that, Haiti had no large mammals-\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what they all say. Then there\u2019s the death and the bodies and the werewolves.</p><p>Take the situation in New Orleans\u2014a place where wolves had been extinct for about a century. Yet \u2014surprise!\u2014there\u2019d been some, but only when the moon rose.</p><p>But in defiance of popular legend, the New Orleans werewolf was a loup-garou, cursed to run as a wolf beneath the crescent moon instead of the full. This made for twice the bloodshed, since that particular phase waxed and waned on both sides of full.</p><p>According to Edward, the werewolves were evolving\u2014using magic of many kinds to become more numerous, more powerful, more deadly. Perhaps they\u2019d begun to use voodoo here.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Murphy murmured. \u201cFrom now on it\u2019s just you, me, and our feet.\u201d</p><p>My gaze was drawn to the mountains rising above us.</p><p>Somehow I doubted that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>I didn\u2019t go back to sleep that night. How could I?</p><p>I did lie down, after scooting my sleeping bag closer to Murphy\u2019s. Not because I wanted to be nearer to him, but I had developed a sudden fondness for his gun.</p><p>As soon as the sun peeked over the eastern horizon, Murphy awoke. \u201cWe need to get a move on.\u201d</p> <p>The guy had a decent work ethic, despite his laid-back, beach bum persona.</p><p>\u201cThe earlier we disappear into the mountains,\u201d he said, \u201cthe easier it\u2019ll be to stay ahead of whoever\u2019s chasing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we lost them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Better to get out of here before we find out, oui?\u201d</p><p>\u201d Oui,\u201d I said, then scowled. \u201cI thought you were going to stick to a nationality.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat I was,\u201d he said with a touch of the Irish.</p><p>The more I was with Murphy, the more curious I became about him, which was probably not a good thing considering the length of my sexual deprivation. While I should have been rolling my sleeping bag tightly and cinching it onto my backpack, instead I watched him move, fascinated with the long, lithe length of him, the way the sun cast golden streaks through his hair and sparked shiny flames off his earring.</p><p>The feathers were still there, but tangled from the night, and that image gave me all sorts of other ones.</p><p>His hands flexed as he filled his backpack, the long, agile fingers making me shiver despite the early heat of the day. How would that silver thumb ring feel if he ran it all over my body?</p><p>Pretty damn good.</p><p>I forced myself to turn away from the intriguing sight of Devon Murphy bending over and got busy. I had no business fantasizing about the man. I had no business fantasizing about any man. Sex was part of a life that was dead to me.</p> <p>So why did I keep thinking about it?</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>We\u2019d loaded our packs and partaken of gourmet granola bars and some exquisitely warm water.</p><p>\u201cYou just going to leave that there?\u201d I indicated the Jeep with a lift of my chin.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t figure out a way to take it along.\u201d</p><p>To me, leaving the vehicle behind was like a big arrow pointing where we\u2019d gone.</p><p>\u201cThis is a crossroad,\u201d he said more seriously. \u201cI\u2019m sure you know what that means.\u201d</p><p>I nodded my understanding.</p> <p>Crossroads and cemeteries were where black magic lived. No self-respecting Haitian would come anywhere near here.</p><p>Murphy and I traveled steadily, the slight incline causing my legs to grumble. The tropical heat made sweat drip from beneath my New Orleans Saints cap onto my pricey new hiking boots.</p><p>Though most of Haiti had been cleared for farming, then farmed often and badly, so that the land was dying, I saw no indication of it here. As we moved farther and farther above sea level, the trees grew closer and closer together, with sections of foliage so dense Murphy had to hack a path with his machete.</p><p>By midafternoon, my sense of direction was shot. The sun would have helped, but only a few sparkles of light managed to penetrate the dense cover. By my calculations, we should have walked off a cliff several miles back.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know where to go?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019d have taken the j ob as your guide if I didn\u2019t know what I was doing?\u201d</p><p>For money I figured he\u2019d do anything, and I had to wonder why. He\u2019d been educated... somewhere. He obviously had a gift for languages. Without the feathers and the beads, he could work at the UN. So what was he doing here?</p><p>\u201cWhy not here?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>Whoops. Guess I\u2019d said that out loud.</p><p>\u201cLiving above a tavern in a slum, hacking your way up a mountain, dodging creditors and bullets, there has to be something more.\u201d</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. \u201cSeems exciting enough to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re looking for excitement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m looking for something,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>For the rest of the afternoon the heat, the pace, the strangely omnipresent jungle, made conversation minimal. As dusk threatened, I smelled water.</p><p>At first I thought it was Murphy\u2019s maddening scent combined with my continual thirst. We\u2019d been drinking steadily but sparingly. On a trip like this we couldn\u2019t carry as much water as we should.</p><p>When I realized the aroma was actual water and not his skin\u2014thank God; I\u2019d begun to have fantasies of licking his flesh and tasting a crystal-clear lake\u2014then I had to struggle against the urge to shove Murphy to the ground and run right over his back.</p><p>He gave a last mighty hack with his machete, and the vines fell away to reveal a secluded pond surrounded by ferns. The gentle lap of the water against the banks, the scent of mist, the pleasant chill in the air, caused me to wonder again if we\u2019d stumbled onto a place out of time.</p><p>I took several quick steps forward and Murphy flung out an arm to stop me.</p><p>\u201cMove that or die,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cMight be snakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a pet python. Snakes I can handle.\u201d</p><p>He gave a long, slow blink, the movement only emphasizing the dark length of his lashes. \u201cYou have a what?\u201d</p><p>I suppose that did sound weird to the uninitiated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a voodoo priestess,\u201d I said. \u201cI need a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so.\u201d</p><p>Actually, I hadn\u2019t needed a snake; I\u2019d wanted one.</p><p>Lazarus wasn\u2019t cuddly, but after my husband\u2019s betrayal and my daughter\u2019s death, being touched had made me twitchy. A snake companion seemed like good idea at the time. Lazarus was loyal, and he rarely peed on the rug.</p><p>\u201cJust be careful around the water.\u201d Murphy lifted his arm.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any poisonous snakes in Haiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo they say.\u201d Murphy didn\u2019t appear convinced.</p><p>I lifted the amazingly cool, clear water to my mourn and drank for several long, wondrous moments, then dunked my head, splashed my neck, and let my wrists dangle beneath the surface until the heat melted away.</p><p>When I felt almost human again, I glanced around, figuring Murphy was doing the same, or making camp.</p><p>Instead I found him staring at me.</p><p>Droplets of water sparkled in his hair, ran down his neck, and dampened the collar of his shirt I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth and his eyes, gone misty green as if they\u2019d taken on the hue of the trees, followed the gesture.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know, do you?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cKnow what?\u201d</p><p>He walked toward me, his gait easy, his manner calm, yet he seemed edgier than ever before. \u201cHow goddamn sexy you are with your skin all hot, and your mouth all cool.\u201d</p><p>My cool mouth fell open. \u201cI didn\u2019t; I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Who \u2019s sexy now? my mind mocked.</p><p>Not that I wanted to be sexy. I had no time for dates, for men, for anything but my mission to save Sarah.</p><p>Except this man made me think of sex all the time. Wild jungle sex, on the ground, in the water, against a tree. Hell, anywhere, everywhere, any way that he wanted.</p><p>He came so close I felt heat rise off of him like steam. His gaze wandered away from my face, and I followed it.</p><p>My ablutions had soaked the front of my shirt. My bra, nothing more than a wisp of cotton meant to keep my nipples from thrusting obscenely against my tank top, was not doing its j ob. No wonder Murphy couldn\u2019t stop looking at me. At them. They were practically begging to be looked at. And touched.</p><p>I tried to turn away, but he stopped me with just a brush of his fingertips on my arm. \u201cWhat are you searching for, Cassandra?\u201d</p><p>The question was so out of place, I very nearly answered him. Why was he so interested in what I was doing in the jungle?</p><p>\u201cNice try,\u201d I said, and inched back.</p><p>Instead of letting go, he yanked me into his arms.</p><p>Maybe his show of interest wasn\u2019t just an act after all. Probably , if the force of his kiss and the thrust of his erection were any indication.</p><p>I knew next to nothing about men, but I\u2019d heard they could become aroused with very little encouragement like \u201chello,\u201d or perhaps a single glimpse of a woman\u2019s hardened nipples.</p><p>I was certain Murphy wanted me, but he also wanted the truth. Too bad I wasn\u2019t going to give it to him.</p><p>Although I might give him something else.</p><p>Because he could kiss like the devil himself. Or how I imagined the devil would kiss if he ever bothered to do so.</p><p>And why wouldn\u2019t he, if he could kiss like this? Satan would rack up a huge tally of souls if he traded kisses instead of wishes, or whatever it was he traded for souls nowadays.</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t bother at finesse; he had no reason to convince me of anything. Within seconds his mourn devoured mine; I clung to his shoulders, my breasts pressed against his chest, my hips cradling his erection as his hands explored my backside.</p><p>He tasted of the water and, amazingly, the night, despite the sun and the sweat and the heat His tongue was as clever kissing as it had been speaking, and I traced the length of it with my own.</p><p>His teeth grazed my lower lip, sharp, almost painful, but the sensation only enticed me more. I bit him back and he growled. Or at least I thought he did.</p><p>The sound did not vibrate against my mourn. I did not feel its echo in his chest, and I should have, considering that chest\u2019s proximity to my own.</p><p>The low rumble sounded again, and I was reminded of the beast in the jungle last night. The one Murphy had insisted was nothing but a dream.</p><p>I tore my mouth from his and glanced toward the trees.</p><p>Looked like my dream had followed us here. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>Murphy hit the dirt and so did I. The thing coming out of the trees stumbled over us and slammed into the ground.</p><p>Not a wolf or a bear or a cat but a man. That didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t a beast\u2014or that he hadn\u2019t been one last night.</p> <p>Why did I think our attacker not quite human? Must have been the growling that continued to emanate from his mouth.</p><p>He also moved a helluva lot faster than the average Haitian. By the time Murphy and I regained our feet, and neither of us was slow about it, the guy was already coming back for a second pass.</p><p>In his dark face his eyes shone eerily light\u2014gray, green, or a faded blue; it was hard to tell when I was riveted by the way they rolled and twitched, as if he was hopped on something, or perhaps just insane.</p><p>Murphy shoved me behind him. If I hadn\u2019t been focused on the strange, snarling Haitian, I might have been impressed with his chivalry.</p><p>Considering Murphy had no weapon, having left the machete and his guns by the pond when he decided to kiss me, I was irritated. At least I had a knife.</p> <p>Lowering my hand to my waist, I cursed. The sheath was empty.</p><p>Before I could wonder how or why or where, the man launched himself at Murphy and the two tumbled to the ground. The attacker was big, bulky, but Murphy held his own. Lucky he\u2019d been to bar fight school, because the other guy did not play fair\u2014if there was \u201cfair\u201d in a fistfight.</p><p>The two men grappled for dominance, locked in a struggle of will and strength. Then the Haitian began snapping his teeth directly in front of Murphy\u2019s nose, as if he was trying to bite it off.</p><p>\u201cWhat in hell is the matter with you?\u201d Murphy exclaimed.</p><p>I had a pretty good idea. Certain zombies of legend had a craving for live human flesh.</p><p>I scrambled toward the pond.</p> <p>Instead of grabbing one of Murphy\u2019s guns, which wouldn\u2019t be loaded with silver or salt or anything that could work on what that man might be, I tore through my backpack until I found a zombie- revealing powder I\u2019d made myself.</p><p>Not that it had ever worked before.</p><p>\u201cBut those were werewolves,\u201d I muttered, yanking open the bag and pouring some into my hand.</p><p>\u201cCassandra!\u201d Murphy shouted. \u201cYou mind?\u201d</p><p>I ran, lifting my palm, positioning my lips at my wrist, so I could blow the powder into the attacker\u2019s face.</p><p>Just as I did, Murphy threw the man off with an impressive heave and got a snoot-full of zombie- revealing powder for his heroics.</p><p>Dust coated his skin. He blinked and particles tumbled from his eyelashes. He coughed.</p><p>\u201cOops?\u201d I said sheepishly.</p> <p>\u201cDuck!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I did, and a fist whooshed through the air above my head. Murphy shoved me aside and leaped to his feet, tackling the man and driving him into the ground once more.</p><p>\u201cThe gun!\u201d Murphy yelled.</p><p>I took one step in that direction and paused as the Haitian flipped Murphy onto his back and started snapping at his nose again. I yanked my silver crucifix over my head and j ammed the end into the Haitian\u2019s neck.</p><p>He howled and I thought, Uh-oh. Werewolf .</p><p>Except he didn\u2019t explode. He backhanded me, and I flew several feet to land on my ass with a teeth- j arring thud.</p><p>\u201cQuit screwing around and get the gun!\u201d Murphy repeated.</p><p>I shook my head, wincing as pain shot through my cheek. I was going to have a shiner, but it wouldn\u2019t be the first time.</p><p>I crawled to Murphy\u2019s pack, yanked out his pistol. I wasn\u2019t sure it would work, but I didn\u2019t have much choice. Then something sparkly at the water\u2019s edge caught my eye.</p><p>My knif e.</p><p>I grabbed it, and headed back the way I\u2019d come.</p><p>The Haitian was centimeters away from chewing off Murphy\u2019s nose. I wasn\u2019t going to reach them in time.</p><p>Without thought, I drew back my arm and threw the knife. The weapon thunked into the attacker\u2019s back, right between the shoulder blades. Once again\u2014no flames, no smoke, no werewolf. Oh well.</p><p>The guy made a horrible sound\u2014I couldn\u2019t blame him\u2014and began to claw for the knife. He yanked it out, and I realized my mistake. Now he had the knife and Murphy.</p><p>\u201cCassandra!\u201d Murphy roared as the man rose above him, the blade flashing red with both blood and the setting sun.</p><p>The report of the gun was obscenely loud in the stillness of the partially shrouded glade.</p><p>The attacker j erked once. The knife fell; so did he. Right on top of Murphy.</p><p>\u201cOoof,\u201d Murphy said, then scrambled frantically out from under the body.</p><p>The attacker didn\u2019t move; he wasn\u2019t breathing. Either bullets worked on zombies or maybe he wasn\u2019t a zombie.</p><p>Nausea rolled over me. If he wasn\u2019t already dead, then\u2014</p><p>I stared at the first person I\u2019d ever killed and felt... not good. I\u2019d had to do it, but that didn\u2019t stop me from shaking as if I\u2019d suddenly caught jungle fever.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Murphy stalked toward me, yanking the pistol from my hand and stuffing it into his pants. \u201cHe was going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t notice my near catatonia or my shivering. He was too wound up.</p><p>\u201cGuy had to be on something,\u201d he muttered, turning away and throwing his arms up theatrically. \u201cTrying to chew off my nose. What\u2019s with that?\u201d</p><p>I thumped to the ground, my legs suddenly too shaky to hold me upright. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off the dead man.</p><p>The thud made Murphy face me; then he fell to his knees at my side. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>I started to laugh, and the sound wasn\u2019t quite sane. How could I be OK after this?</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d Murphy muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re shivering. Hold on.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the backpacks, yanked his sleeping bag free, and tossed it around my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure what, so I stopped talking and sat there\u2014shuddering and staring at the body.</p><p>Murphy sat, too, directly in my line of vision. \u201cHey.\u201d He touched my already sore cheek. \u201cYou had to do it.\u201d</p><p>Which didn\u2019t make what I\u2019d done any less awful.</p><p>My eyes burned, and Murphy cursed again, then pulled me into his arms.</p><p>He was as good at giving comfort as he\u2019d been at kissing, and I was surprised, considering the source.</p><p>Murmuring nonsense, he rubbed my back, then held me tightly until the shivers faded away. Even when they were gone he didn\u2019t let me go, and I found I didn\u2019t want him to.</p><p>Twilight descended as I sat there, feeling unreasonably safe in Murphy\u2019s arms. The scent of rain in his hair, the strength of his hands, the shape of his shoulders, became as familiar as the shadow of the trees above our heads.</p><p>Minutes, hours, days later, he started to draw back and I clung. I glanced into his face, appalled at my weakness, and he smiled, then pressed his lips to my brow right where my hair grew white.</p><p>He didn\u2019t speak, and for that I was grateful. I wasn\u2019t ready to talk. I wasn\u2019t ready for much except...</p><p>Oblivion.</p><p>Reaching up, I wrapped my hand around the back of his neck, my knuckles brushing beads and feathers, my thumb striking his earring and making it swing. Murphy frowned, opened his mouth as if to protest, and I kissed him.</p><p>He shut up, although I doubted he\u2019d have been able to say much with my tongue down his throat.</p><p>I give the man credit; he was certainly adaptable. One moment the embrace was all soft murmurs and comfort, the next pure sex.</p><p>Mouth hot, wet, hands hard, roving. He made me forget... everything. Which was the whole idea, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>The sleeping bag slithered from my shoulders. I no longer cared; I wasn\u2019t cold. My fingers crept beneath his shirt, palms grazing the smooth skin, grasping his hips, drawing him near. His fingers were equally clever, finding pressure points that both relaxed and revived me.</p><p>His mouth left mine, scoring the line of my j aw, the vein in my neck, teeth scraping my collarbone, then tugging at the collar of my tank top before moving lower. He mouthed my breast through my shirt and I arched, wanting more, wanting everything. I was empty inside\u2014had been for so long. All I wanted was to fill that hollow, aching space.</p><p>I tugged at the waistband of his khakis, and the button gave way. With nothing beneath but skin, it was easy for me to cup him, stroke him, make him want the same thing. Judging by what I found there, he already did.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I drew my fingernail gently up the underside of his erection, then ran my thumb over the tip. Waiting was not an option.</p><p>His j aw worked; he seemed to be struggling for control. \u201cWait,\u201d he repeated, and grabbed my wrist.</p><p>Leaning his forehead against mine, he sighed. His hair drifted over my cheek, and I winced at the memory of being hit. Then I winced at the memory of who had done the hitting.</p><p>\u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>Murphy lifted his head; his gaze was still a little unfocused, his mouth wet and swollen from mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this. Not here. Not now. With... him right mere.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t look in the direction of the dead Haitian. Instead I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and hated myself.</p><p>Murphy shifted, then stilled. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d</p><p>Something in his voice made me open my eyes.</p><p>The body was gone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>We practically threw each other aside as we leaped to our feet Any softness, any sex, forgotten, we crossed to the trampled, bloody grass and gaped.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Murphy\u2019s gaze flitted nervously to the surrounding trees. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t dead, why didn\u2019t he try and kill us again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he was dead. Probably from the beginning.\u201d</p> <p>Silence was the first clue that I\u2019d spoken my thoughts out loud. Murphy\u2019s guarded expression was the next.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>I shouldn\u2019t tell him, but he\u2019d risked his life for me. He had a right to know what we were dealing with.</p><p>\u201cOur friend was already dead, which was why it was so damn hard to kill him. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready dead,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhich means?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSilver didn\u2019t cause fire, so not a werewolf.\u201d I frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think. Could be something new. And the crucifix\u2014\u201d</p><p>Hell, he\u2019d run off with my necklace still stuck in his neck. I doubted I\u2019d be able to find another out here.</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t work, either,\u201d I continued, \u201cso not a vampire. Probably a zombie, though I can\u2019t be sure since the zombie-revealing powder got blown into your face.\u201d I brushed a last bit from his eyebrow. \u201cAt least you\u2019re not one.\u201d</p><p>Murphy put his palm against my forehead, just as I used to do with Sarah. I j erked away. \u201cI\u2019m not sick!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot physically.\u201d He lowered his arm. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were nuts I wouldn\u2019t have been seduced by your sad eyes and that lovely tight ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me, Murphy. You were seduced by the money.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t seen your ass lately,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I made a derisive sound. I knew what I was and what I wasn\u2019t. I also knew what he was and wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Great comfort and the promise of excellent sex aside, Murphy was an adventurer to say the most, an opportunist to say the least, and I really shouldn\u2019t trust him. But he was all I had.</p><p>\u201cThe guy could have walked off.\u201d Murphy hunkered down and peered at the ground.</p><p>Unfortunately, night had fallen and the ground was hard to see. I couldn\u2019t discern any tracks. From the tightening of Murphy\u2019s lips, he couldn\u2019t, either.</p><p>Which screwed up my theory. A zombie would walk off; only other things disappeared. I\u2019d even heard tales of invisible werewolves.</p><p>I glanced at the steadily darkening forest. I just hoped there weren\u2019t any here.</p><p>Murphy straightened. \u201cJust because I can\u2019t see footprints doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t there.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you explain his resistance to stabbing and shooting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilling people isn\u2019t as easy as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your word on it,\u201d I said, my mood much lighter now that I hadn\u2019t killed someone.</p><p>\u201cGuy looked awful good for a zombie,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>My mood lightened even more. He had looked good, which gave weight to the rumor that Mezareau was a very talented man.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you have to meet the bokor,\u201d Murphy blurted. \u201cYou want to learn how to raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>I guess Murphy had picked up a little knowledge of voodoo and the nature of a bokor while living in Haiti, men put two and two together.</p><p>I shrugged and didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>That I wasn\u2019t telling him.</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to raise the dead?\u201d I asked. \u201cSeems like a handy talent to have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t the type who\u2019d do anything for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said anything about money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy else would you want to raise the dead? Can you imagine the kind of cash you could rake in on that scam?\u201d</p><p>Only Murphy would make the leap from raising the dead to making money on the practice.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t a scam,\u201d I said.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe the dead can be raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t actually believe the man who attacked us was just a man?\u201d</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t seem to have anything to say to that.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you seen things in your life for which there\u2019s no explanation?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverywhere.\u201d</p><p>Which kind of explained the accents.</p><p>However, his answer surprised me. If Murphy hadn\u2019t seen anything amazing anywhere that he\u2019d been, then Edward and crew were doing their j obs better than I imagined.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in magic?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSweetie, there\u2019s no such thing. I believe in what I can touch. Wine, women, and cash.\u201d</p><p>His opinion disturbed me; I have no idea why. I knew there was magic; I\u2019d seen it. So what did I care if Devon Murphy had no hope, no faith, no soul?</p><p>Maybe because I\u2019d kissed him, nearly let him try to fill the great big empty inside of me. Discovering that Murphy was more empty than I was... why wouldn \u2019t that be disturbing?</p><p>\u201cYou believe in monsters?\u201d Murphy asked. \u201cEvil beasties that go bump in the night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich explains why you were shooting up the trees.\u201d</p><p>How could I have forgotten our visitor of the night before? The memory brought a measure of relief. Not an animal stalking us but a person.</p><p>If a zombie could be called a person.</p><p>My relief was short-lived, however. The man who\u2019d stalked, men attacked us had never spoken, only growled, which didn\u2019t bode well for the completely human zombie I was interested in. Although he was moving pretty well for a dead guy\u2014no shuffling and stumbling\u2014and he\u2019d appealed as alive as anyone else.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go back to Port-au-Prince in the morning,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>My gaze snapped to his. \u201cWe will not!\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any zombies, Cassandra. If I\u2019d known that\u2019s what you were after I never would have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off and looked away.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Tried to screw me?\u201d</p><p>His gaze snapped back. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen whose tongue was down my throat ten minutes ago?\u201d</p><p>He shoved his fingers through his hair, lips tightening when they tangled in the feathers and the beads. \u201cI meant I wouldn\u2019t have taken the j ob if I knew you were...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWacko?\u201d I suggested, and he shrugged. \u201cYou said you\u2019d do anything for money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not part of the deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeemed like you were ten minutes ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why did you say \u2018wait\u2019?\u201d</p><p>My question brought him up short. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me to wait. I find it hard to believe you suddenly had an attack of the Good Samaritans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like a panic attack.\u201d His smile was rueful. \u201cNo condom.\u201d</p><p>Now I was the one in a panic. The very thought of having unprotected sex made me dizzy. Not only from the very real possibility of contracting AIDS in this country but also from the thought of birthing another child, the chance of losing him or her... I didn\u2019t think I could ever do it again. Which only strengthened my resolve to bring Sarah back.</p><p>The one thing I\u2019d been good at was being a mom. I\u2019d loved caring for Sarah, sharing her life, teaching her things. I liked to play Barbies, read books, watch her dance. I was the secretary of the PTA, chairperson of the annual bake and book sale. I\u2019d been prime candidate for mother of the year\u2014until I\u2019d fucked up and let Sarah die.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>Murphy stared at me with an odd expression\u2014wary, as if he thought I might flip out and try to chew his nose. I guess I\u2019d zoned off too long into the land of guilt and recrimination. What else was new?</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make camp,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>I got the feeling he was planning something. Like how to trick me into following him back to Port-au-</p><p>Prince, where he\u2019d turn me over to a psychiatrist.</p><p>I went through the motions of unpacking for the night, even helped with dinner, but all the while I was thinking. I couldn\u2019t trust Murphy anymore, if I\u2019d ever trusted him at all.</p><p>We had to be close to Mezareau\u2019s village, hence the zombie henchman. I\u2019d do better to strike out on my own rather than follow Murphy blindly back to a little white room. But how could I get away without his seeing me?</p><p>Simp le.</p><p>Voodoo sleeping powder. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>The powder was really an herbal remedy I\u2019d been using since Sarah\u2019s death. If it put me to sleep with all my issues, Murphy shouldn\u2019t be any trouble at all.</p><p>Once he crashed, I\u2019d slip away. When he awoke, he wouldn\u2019t bother to follow me, since I\u2019d leave his money where he\u2019d be sure to find it.</p><p>Having a plan made me downright j olly, and I had to tone down my exuberance lest Murphy think I\u2019d lost more marbles than he already did.</p> <p>I needn\u2019t have bothered, since he was preoccupied, staring into the trees, not speaking to me at all. It wasn\u2019t even a challenge to slip the sleeping powder into his applesauce. He ate it out of the disposable container without appearing to know or care what he was consuming.</p><p>Night descended. A slightly larger sliver of moon appeared as the sounds of the jungle surrounded us.</p><p>Murphy lifted his rifle onto his lap. \u201cI\u2019ll keep watch.\u201d</p><p>I doubted he\u2019d be watching much but the inside of his eyelids. I also doubted a gun would be of any use if the Haitian, or some of his friends, decided to come back.</p><p>As expected, within fifteen minutes, Murphy\u2019s head bobbed, then he mumbled and j erked upright, eyes wide as he searched the darkness. Soon he couldn\u2019t fight any longer, and his chin dipped to his chest. I waited fifteen minutes more, just to be sure, then grabbed my things.</p> <p>I poured a circle of salt around Murphy to protect him until he woke up. No zombie could pass over salt.</p><p>Interestingly enough, my zombie-revealing powder contained not a hint of it\u2014which might be why it had never worked.</p><p>Before I left, I tossed the money order onto the ground in front of Murphy. There\u2019d be no reason for him to come after me now. We were square.</p><p>As I headed into the trees, I refused to feel sad about that. I had plenty of other things to be sad about.</p><p>Like where the hell I was going. Since we\u2019d been heading steadily up the mountain in a northwesterly direction I continued that way. I experienced a moment\u2019s unease that this was too easy\u2014kind of a reverse yellow brick road, leading me away from the wizard rather than to him. But what choice did I have?</p><p>Only one: Give up or go on. Which really wasn\u2019t a choice at all.</p> <p>I traveled all night, never once needing to stop and hack at a vine or squeeze through an area of densely grown trees. I was definitely on a trail leading somewhere. Hopefully not off the edge of a cliff.</p><p>I heard nothing but insects\u2014no growling, no voices, no paws, no footsteps\u2014until the darkest part of the night, right before sunrise, when the moon and the stars disappeared and the sky went as black as the pits of hell. I hated that time. It was then that my dreams of Sarah came.</p><p>\u201cNo dreams tonight,\u201d I murmured. \u201cNot going to sleep.\u201d</p><p>I paused because I could no longer see the trail and pulled out my canteen. Leaning against a tree, I drank slowly and watched the sky, waiting for the telltale lightening of the ebony night, which signaled the arrival of the sun, but nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cMaybe it takes a little longer here,\u201d I whispered, the sound of my own voice not as soothing as I\u2019d hoped.</p><p>The rustle from the underbrush was so slight I wouldn\u2019t have heard it if I\u2019d been walking. Something light, small, probably furry.</p><p>My right hand crept toward my knife, sliding away when a figure stepped through the trees. \u201cSarah.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to touch her, but I didn\u2019t dare. This couldn\u2019t be real, even though I wanted it to be very badly. If I touched her would she disappear in a puff of smoke?</p> <p>She wore the outfit she\u2019d died in\u2014her private school uniform, all navy blue and white. She\u2019d loathed that skirt. Her dark hair, so very much like mine, was combed, her cheeks flushed with health\u2014with life\u2014her brown eyes, too much like Karl\u2019s, shone. The only oddity was her lack of socks and shoes.</p><p>I had to be dreaming, yet here I stood, back against the tree, the damp air of Haiti pressing against my skin.</p><p>I shifted and the earth scratched beneath my boots. I slammed my hand against the tree trunk. Pain exploded up my arm.</p><p>Mommy ? murmured the wind.</p><p>Ah, hell, I thought as tears threatened. Was I crazy or wasn\u2019t I?</p><p>Every thing \u2019s all right.</p><p>Not really. Nothing had been all right since she had gone.</p><p>Mommy , she said again, and ran toward me.</p><p>I went down on one knee, held out my arms, and she blew through me, like the first chilly wind of autumn.</p><p>I closed my eyes, and I could smell her. That particular scent that was Sarah\u2019s alone\u2014both sweet and sharp, soft white light and hot pink neon, sunshine, shadow, and the earth. I hadn\u2019t smelled it for a very long time.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>My eyes snapped open. I was sitting on the ground, my back against the tree. The sun was up, creating a halo around Murphy\u2019s head as he squatted in front of me.</p><p>I blinked at the sky. \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you can say?\u201d He shifted, plopping himself down at my side. \u201cYou drugged me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did something.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d fallen asleep and dreamed of Sarah. I wasn\u2019t sure why that thought caused a shaft of disappointment so deep I ached with it. If she hadn\u2019t been a dream, she\u2019d been a ghost. Which was the entire reason I was in Haiti\u2014or at least one of them.</p><p>I\u2019d also lost several hours of travel time and allowed Murphy to catch up to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the bokor, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were taking me to the funny farm.\u201d</p><p>I startled a laugh out of him. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard that expression since me poor sainted mother died.\u201d</p><p>His brogue was back. Instead of being irritated, I was intrigued. I knew so little about him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about your mother.\u201d</p><p>His expression became shuttered. \u201cThat was long ago and far away, my wee colleen, no reason to have your sad eyes grow sadder on my account.\u201d</p><p>My irritation returned. \u201cIf you pat me on the head, I\u2019ll slug you.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s better. Now, tell me what you drugged me with and why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSleeping powder. Herbal. Obviously it didn\u2019t work very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was asleep until dawn, which I believe is what you had in mind.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the sky again. From the position of the sun it was midafternoon. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d zoned out that long.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care,\u201d I said. \u201cI paid you. Why did you come after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot of things, but a murderer isn\u2019t one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurder? Am I missing something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d take your money and trot back to Port-au-Prince, leaving you to wander the enchanted forest until you die?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you being a little melodramatic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Oooo-K.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you call it the enchanted forest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was trying to be funny. How come you never laugh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMust be silent laughter. I\u2019ve never heard you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see much to laugh about in this world.\u201d</p><p>Murphy tilted his head, then touched my cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d still like to kick that guy\u2019s ass for hitting you.\u201d</p><p>I realized then that he wasn\u2019t apologizing for my lack of laughter but my black eye.</p><p>\u201cDamn near impossible to kick a zombie\u2019s ass,\u201d I said.</p><p>He sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re back to that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid we ever leave it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can I convince you there\u2019s no such thing as a zombie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t, because there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know there was a Harvard ethnobotanist who proved the zombie phenomena is real?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously. In the early eighties there were two documented cases of people who showed up alive here in Haiti years after they were declared dead. Wade Davis, the ethnobotanist, discovered a poison derived from the blowfish which caused the victim to appear dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about this,\u201d Murphy said slowly. \u201cThe victim \u2018died,\u2019 then was called from the grave by the bokor and sold into slavery far away from home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when he returned he was labeled a zombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept he\u2019d never truly been dead,\u201d Murphy pointed out, \u201cwhich means he wasn\u2019t a zombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. But I\u2019m not interested in the zombie poison.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are we having this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said there was no such thing as zombies, but there is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose those werewolves and vampires you mentioned\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cExist, too. There\u2019s a whole world out there most people don\u2019t even know about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t exist outside your own head.\u201d My lips tightened, and he lifted one hand to forestall my tirade. \u201cCassandra, you worry me. Mezareau is not a nice man.\u201d</p><p>I winced at his use of the bokor \u2019s name, waited for the telltale chill and the sensation of being watched. I didn\u2019t feel it. Of course that didn\u2019t mean Mezareau wasn\u2019t snooping.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t have any patience for your fairy tales,\u201d Murphy continued. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to disappear like all those others did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe man is a bokor,\u201d I said. \u201cThe very word means my request won\u2019t cause him to bat an eye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already sent a man to kill us.\u201d Murphy frowned. \u201cAnd the more I think about those guys in Port- au-Prince, the more I wonder if he sent them, too.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d figured they were hired guns, but I\u2019d kind of thought my ex-husband had hired them. Either way, guns were guns and dead was dead.</p><p>Sometimes.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know what I want from him,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cWhy get his knickers in a twist already?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to you, just saying his name gives him power. He knows who we are, where we are, and exactly what we want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cBut if you care to take the saner point of view, the man has people everywhere and every one of them would love to get on his good side.\u201d</p><p>That still didn\u2019t explain why someone had tried to kill me three times. I thought of the bringing of the dead to my hotel room. Make that kill me twice, drive me insane once.</p><p>I glanced around the small clearing. Or maybe drive me insane twice.</p><p>Had Mezareau sent Sarah? How could he know about her? Was he able to read minds?</p><p>If the bokor was that powerful there was no telling what he could do. I was both excited and terrified.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want us to find him,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>\u201cAll I need is a little knowledge. Is that so much to ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want to share.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t considered that Mezareau wouldn\u2019t want to teach me. The religion of voodoo was inclusive \u2014full of gentleness, love, and sharing. But a voodoo sorcerer probably didn\u2019t follow the rules.</p><p>I got to my feet. Murphy held out a hand and without thought I took it, leaning back as he levered himself upward. I tried to release him, but he held on tight. I glanced into his face, confused.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Sarah?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Suddenly I couldn\u2019t breathe. I thought about her all the time. I called out for her in the night. But no one had spoken Sarah\u2019s name in my presence for so long the word tore at my heart.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d</p><p>My voice was hoarse, harsh. Murphy frowned. \u201cYou were mumbling it when I got here.\u201d</p><p>Oh, right. The dream. Vision. Visitation.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d he pressed.</p><p>\u201cMy daughter.\u201d</p><p>His fingers tightened on mine until I winced, but he didn\u2019t let go. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalifornia.\u201d</p><p>Bellehaven Cemetery, true. But that was in California.</p><p>He turned over my left hand, passed a thumb over my bare ring finger. \u201cHusband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRelief?\u201d I peered into his face as he continued to rub my knuckles.</p><p>\u201cI try not to put my tongue in the mouths of married women.\u201d</p><p>I winced at the reminder of how I\u2019d practically begged him to take me. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type to care.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cYou have no idea what type I am.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I was angry with myself, not Murphy. I didn\u2019t want to want him, but I couldn\u2019t seem to stop.</p><p>I withdrew my hand from his and he let me. Turning away, I bent to grab my backpack, and my gaze was caught by a mark on the ground, half-obscured beneath a low-lying bush. I reached out and swept back the foliage, just as thunder rumbled from above.</p><p>\u201cStorm\u2019s coming,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe should probably stay here until it passes. Shouldn\u2019t be long. They never last.\u201d</p><p>The sun was gone; shadows flickered. I could do nothing but stare at the footprint that seemed to waver first closer, then farther away the longer I stared at it Very small, tiny, perfect toes and a teeny round heel.</p><p>Slowly I got to my feet, took a step into the trees, and I saw another one, then another.</p><p>I was running. Murphy was shouting. He let me get pretty far before he came after me. By then I\u2019d seen ten footprints, all leading up the same trail I\u2019d been following all night.</p><p>\u201cCassandra!\u201d Murphy shouted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t stop. I couldn\u2019t. Not even when the sky opened and the rain came tumbling down\u2014hard, harsh, chilling needles that soaked us in minutes.</p><p>I skidded in the mud, and Murphy caught me before I fell. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFootprints.\u201d</p><p>He shook the rain from his eyes. \u201cWhat footprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you.\u201d</p><p>Murphy followed me back in the direction we\u2019d come. I squinted at the dirt, went down on my knees in the mud.</p><p>There were no footprints. Not anymore. Had there ever been any at all?</p><p>What did it matter since they were now as gone as Sarah herself?</p><p>I became aware of another sound, louder than the whoosh of rain and the distant rumble of thunder.</p><p>Water rushing\u2014a lot of it.</p><p>Hell. We were on a mountain and the rain was coming down in sheets.</p><p>\u201cFlash flood,\u201d I shouted above the storm, but Murphy shook his head.</p><p>Instead of running, which would have been my vote, he kept hold of my hand and dragged me toward the sound.</p><p>I struggled, not ready to die before I\u2019d tried everything I could to get my life back, but Murphy was strong and for some reason determined.</p><p>He shoved me through a tall sheaf of what appeared to be palm fronds, and I stumbled to the other side, bracing myself, expecting a wall of water to sweep from on high and end everything.</p><p>Instead, I gaped at the hugest waterfall I\u2019d ever seen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>\u201cThis is it,\u201d Murphy murmured. \u201cThe bokor lives here.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLegend says there\u2019s a cave behind the waterfall and on the other side of the cave... the bokor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLegends begin in reality,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>I\u2019d known that even before I\u2019d j oined the J\u00e4ger-Suchers.</p><p>There was a bokor with enough power to bring the dead, to send Sarah\u2019s ghost or, considering the footprints, something a little more corporeal, which made one part of the tale a reality. Why wouldn\u2019t the part about where he lived be true, too?</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be OK now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve come this far; I\u2019m going, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy risk your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy risk yours?\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze, refusing to look away.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d His eyes widened, then narrowed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me your daughter was dead.\u201d</p><p>I should have known a man like Murphy was adept at reading faces, putting together a few bits of info, and guessing the truth. He wouldn\u2019t have survived as long as he had otherwise.</p><p>I turned away. The rain continued to beat down, as if it were trying to compete with the force of the waterfall.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d I asked, my voice too high and falsely bright.</p><p>\u201cA better question would be why I didn\u2019t think it before.\u201d</p><p>He put his hands on my shoulders. Despite the rain, the warmth of his skin seeped into mine, and I had to force myself not to lean on him. Murphy was still a stranger, and now he knew my deepest, darkest secret.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>I curled my fingers into my palms so tightly my nails bit crescent moons into my flesh. \u201cIt will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeath is the end; there\u2019s no coming back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Death is a beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s the beginning of something else. Something she won\u2019t want to come back from.\u201d</p> <p>I heard the echo of Renee\u2019s words but ignored them now as I had then.</p><p>\u201cOf course she will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven if it were possible to raise the dead, is a zombie existence one you\u2019d wish on anyone?\u201d</p><p>I spun around. \u201cThis bokor can raise the dead to live again. Just as they were before.\u201d</p><p>Murphy shook his head, the storm\u2014or maybe just concern for my sanity\u2014darkening his eyes nearly to black. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t believe that. I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure losing a child is a terrible thing, but what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t going to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. Raising Sarah will fix everything.\u201d</p><p>Including me.</p><p>\u201cThe bokor is a dangerous man. He\u2019s up to something out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant drugs. Gunrunning.\u201d He frowned. \u201cMaybe slavery. Which would explain the disappearing visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlavery. Are we still in the same century?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of white slavery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but I don\u2019t think there are too many white people out here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>I bit my lip. Whoops.</p><p>\u201d White slavery doesn\u2019t actually refer to race anyway,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s sexual slavery\u2014all races.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve lost your mind,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cNo, that would be you.\u201d</p><p>I lost my patience. \u201cIf you\u2019re so worried about what the bokor will do to me, why did you bring me here at all?\u201d</p><p>Murphy glanced away.</p><p>Hmm. He was hiding something, too. But what?</p><p>I had a moment\u2019s unease. Perhaps Murphy was in league with Mezareau in his white slavery scheme, which meant I might find myself locked in a foreign brothel come next week.</p><p>My fingers stroked my knife. Or not. Either way, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make Murphy nervous.</p><p>\u201cI work for the government,\u201d I blurted. \u201cThey know I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>Not here, here, but Haiti here. However, Murphy didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>I had no doubt Edward would find me if I disappeared\u2014or at least send someone to try. If he let his agents get sold into white slavery how would that look?</p><p>I was grasping at straws, but right now straws were all I had.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you do for the government?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a J\u00e4ger-Sucher. Monster-hunting society. Very hush-hush.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stared at me for several seconds; then he laughed. \u201cYou had me going there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><p>His laughter died; his eyes had gone gray in the misty half-light that preceded dusk. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to make up stories. I\u2019m not going to kill you and toss you over a cliff, or keep you alive and sell you to the highest bidder.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d never convince Murphy the J\u00e4ger-Suchers existed until I convinced him the monsters did. I had a feeling that wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem once we reached the other side of the waterfall. I waded into the pond.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d</p><p>I heard a loud, annoyed sigh, followed by a splash; then Murphy was at my side.</p><p>\u201cAre these backpacks waterproof?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cA little late to be asking that, but yes.\u201d</p><p>About a hundred yards later we reached the falling water; I braced myself to dive through.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d Murphy grabbed my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s do this together.\u201d</p><p>I was touched by the gesture. I should insist he stay behind; we could be going to our deaths. Instead, I tightened my fingers, and we went into the waterfall.</p><p>By all rights, we should have been driven to the bottom of the pond by the force of the cascading water, or at least pummeled hard enough to get a headache. But I popped out on the other side with nothing more than a momentary lapse in breathing.</p><p>I still held Murphy\u2019s hand, but he seemed to be stuck. I tugged; nothing happened. The spray from the falling water made it hard for me to see; the wetness made it hard to hold on. If I lost my grip, what would happen? I didn\u2019t want to find out.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t touch bottom, so I had no leverage. Was he on the other side, or stuck in between? If it was the latter, I didn\u2019t have much time before he drowned.</p><p>Was the waterfall a trial by faith? Like the Indiana Jones movie where Indy had to step into the abyss and then the bridge appears? If so, how would I ever get Murphy through\u2014oh, he of little faith?</p><p>My own would have to be enough.</p><p>Reaching forward, I clasped my hands around his. \u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered, and yanked with both my mind and my body.</p><p>Murphy erupted, landing on top of me, dunking me in midgasp. My mouth filled with brackish water and I struggled, kicked, then shot to the surface choking and spitting. I could swear I had a minnow in my mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks to you. What happened?\u201d</p><p>He started to cough as if he\u2019d swallowed half an ocean. I eased my frustration by whacking him on the back. After a few good ones, he grabbed my wrist and made me stop. Spoilsport.</p><p>\u201cYou went through,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was stuck in between. My mouth kept filling up; I had to swallow or drown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you drop my hand?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me as if I were nuts. \u201cI couldn\u2019t let you go on alone.\u201d</p><p>Murphy had risked drowning for me? He was almost like a hero.</p><p>\u201cThen I heard you say, \u2018Please,\u2019\u201d he continued, \u201cand suddenly I was flying.\u201d</p><p>His wet hair kept falling in his eyes, and the feathers hung limply by his cheek. Murphy snatched them out and tossed them aside. The beads were still braided firmly in place.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were that strong,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNeither did I.\u201d I contemplated the water. \u201cIt was like... magic.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThat was adrenaline, sweet thing, pure and simple.\u201d</p><p>Some hero. I don\u2019t know why I bothered to confide in him at all.</p><p>Murphy slogged toward the rocky rim of the pond. We\u2019d landed in a cave, just as he\u2019d predicted. Very dark, the only light came from the fading sun beyond the waterfall. A single tunnel led onward\u2014 a black gaping maw that promised answers, or perhaps more questions.</p><p>I was momentarily distracted by the flex of Murphy\u2019s biceps against the sleeves of his T-shirt, the ripple of muscle appearing particularly fetching beneath wet skin as he hoisted his body upward.</p><p>Remember, I admonished. You \u2019re in the land that condom f orgot.</p><p>Then I dunked myself.</p><p>When I resurfaced, Murphy helped me out of the water without mentioning my sudden penchant for it.</p><p>He lifted me up as if I weighed no more than a twig, and my foolish heart went pitter-pat.</p><p>As soon as my feet touched the cave floor, complete darkness descended along with utter silence. That silence bothered me more than the darkness ever could.</p><p>Murphy slid off his backpack, rustled around. Then a click was followed by a white beam of light splashing from one rock face to the next.</p><p>\u201cNo such thing as magic, huh?\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Murphy continued to flash the light from wall to wall and back again, but he couldn\u2019t change the truth.</p><p>The waterfall was gone.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be a logical explanation,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFor water morphing into rock? If you can find one, I\u2019d love to hear it.\u201d</p><p>My voice was annoyingly cheerful. I couldn\u2019t help myself. If the entrance to the cave was magic, there had to be a lot more magic to come.</p><p>Murphy shot me a glare. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so all-fired happy about it if I were you. How the hell are we going to get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about that when the time comes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll worry about it now.\u201d</p><p>He took a step toward the water, and I grabbed his arm. The flashlight plunked into the pond, and the cave went black again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that was waterproof?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Murphy\u2019s answer was a curse.</p><p>\u201cGot another one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d I shifted my pack.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t very good planning, was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d throw mine into the drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t throw it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may throw you,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I laughed. It felt good.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I will?\u201d His voice was dangerously low.</p><p>I stopped laughing. \u201cWhat happened to \u2018full speed ahead, damn the torpedoes Murphy\u2019 ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe drowned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like small, dark, enclosed spaces, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone?\u201d</p><p>I reached out, smacking him in the chest. He was closer than I\u2019d thought.</p><p>\u201cOomph,\u201d he said. \u201cWatch it.\u201d</p><p>I ran my hand over his shoulder, down his arm, then entwined our fingers. \u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><p>He held back. I tugged, but he wouldn\u2019t budge.</p><p>\u201cWe should wait here,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIn case the waterfall magically reappears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is probably how all those people disappeared. They\u2019re stuck. Somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that makes me feel a whole lot better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I tugged again. \u201cThere\u2019s a tunnel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTunnel?\u201d His voice\u2014at first hoarse and low\u2014went higher.</p><p>\u201cRelax. It\u2019s big enough to drive a car through. You\u2019ll be fine.\u201d This time Murphy let me lead him away from the water.</p><p>The dark had never bothered me. I\u2019d always been able to find my way. Unless it was theoretical darkness of the soul, of course; then I was lost.</p><p>Free hand in front of me, I walked forward until I reached the far wall, then trailed my fingers across it until my arm fell into space. \u201cHere we go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should use some matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave them. You never know when we might need a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would we need a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo scare something away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill not helping,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>I smiled into the darkness. He was sounding more like himself and less like a scared little boy. Although I\u2019d begun to find that little boy just as appealing as the muscley man. My smile faded. I needed to get a grip.</p><p>Together we went on.</p><p>And on. And on.</p><p>Hours, days, weeks later, Murphy paused. \u201cThis is ridiculous, Cassandra. For all we know we could be walking in circles.\u201d</p><p>He was right, but I couldn\u2019t go back.</p><p>\u201cA little farther,\u201d I pleaded.</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d His hand tightened on mine. \u201cA little.\u201d</p><p>Onward I went, both tired and exhilarated; the combination caused a buzzing in my ears. A buzzing I ignored until it started to remind me of something.</p><p>I stopped and Murphy bumped into me. \u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201d Shh,\u201d I breathed.</p><p>My ears were still buzzing. In the darkness I was disoriented; I couldn\u2019t tell if the sound was coming from inside of me or not.</p><p>\u201cLook,\u201d Murphy whispered, and I saw them.</p><p>Just eyes, nothing else. They seemed to be floating in the air about fifty feet away. There was something off about them, but I didn\u2019t have time to figure out what.</p><p>An unmistakable growl rumbled through the cave\u2014more animal than human, though the echo made it hard to tell for sure.</p><p>In a distant corner of my mind I remembered Murphy telling me there were no large mammals on the island. He\u2019d told me that after I\u2019d seen the last pair of eyes, which had turned out to be human after all \u2014or as human as zombies get.</p><p>\u201cYour knife,\u201d Murphy whispered.</p><p>I almost said, What about your gun? But he didn\u2019t dare fire inside the cave for fear of a deadly ricochet.</p><p>Not that a gun had done any good the last time.</p><p>My hand lowered to my waist and hesitated. The silver blade hadn\u2019t been any help, either. I needed the zombie-revealing powder, which, if it worked, should turn any zombie back to the dust from which it came.</p><p>My fingers traveled to the bag I\u2019d concealed in my pants. I winced as I encountered my soaked j eans and prayed what was in my pocket wasn\u2019t as ruined as I was.</p><p>I shook some powder into my palm, sighing in relief when the granules scratched against my skin. \u201cGet a match. Don\u2019t strike it until I say so.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t need whatever was there to get spooked by the flare before I was close enough to toss the zombie-revealing powder in its face. Zombies didn\u2019t much care for fire, either.</p><p>One hand out, one on the hilt of my knife, I inched forward, Murphy at my side. Before we\u2019d moved five feet, the eyes blinked once and disappeared.</p><p>I was so startled I dropped the powder. Cursing, I thrust my hand forward and felt fur. I immediately yanked it back, afraid I\u2019d get my fingers ripped off.</p><p>\u201cMatch,\u201d I said.</p><p>A snick was immediately followed by a faint glowing light. My eyes, unaccustomed to it, struggled to focus. Something slid around the next curve, and without thinking, I ran.</p><p>I came around the bend just as the match went out. Tense, I waited for a sound, a movement, an attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you see?\u201d Murphy lit another match.</p><p>The wavering, golden glow illuminated rock, dirt, and nothing else. My gaze met his.</p><p>\u201cA tail.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>The darkness could have been playing with my mind when I\u2019d heard the growl, felt the fur, but it hadn\u2019t been dark when I\u2019d seen the tail.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d I tilted my head. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to explain why I couldn\u2019t have? Check me for fever again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe later.\u201d He hissed and dropped the match. Eternal night descended once more. \u201cWhat kind of a tail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBushy or thin?\u201d</p><p>I thought hard. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLong or short?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI only saw the tip. Maybe it was nothing.\u201d I wanted it to be nothing.</p><p>\u201cWe both heard the growl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p><p>I took a deep breath, then let it out. \u201cI felt fur.\u201d</p><p>Several beats of silence followed my statement, then: \u201cThe guy could have been wearing fur, or what felt like fur.\u201d</p> <p>Gotta love a logical mind.</p><p>\u201cWas he wearing a tail, too?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou said you weren\u2019t sure about the tail, and who knows\u2014\u201d He made a movement that was most likely a shrug. \u201cMaybe he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re talking crazy guy, zombie, or a big furry growling thing where one isn\u2019t supposed to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is it whenever you talk I get a headache?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have that effect on a lot of people.\u201d</p><p>Silence fell between us for several minutes, and then: \u201cDid you find anything strange about those eyes?\u201d</p><p>I had, but I\u2019d brushed off my unease, and now I couldn\u2019t quite recall why I\u2019d felt it. I hadn\u2019t been able to distinguish a color beyond light\u2014blue, green, gray, maybe yellow. But that wasn\u2019t what had bothered me about them.</p> <p>\u201cThey had whites,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>That was.</p><p>Because only people have whites around their irises; animals don\u2019t. Unless you\u2019re talking werewolf.</p><p>Hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat do human eyes mean to you?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t slow. Even without seeing my face he sensed I was hiding something.</p><p>\u201cHuman,\u201d I said. Some of the time.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to it than that.\u201d</p><p>Murphy had already fit me for a straitj acket. One more bit of insanity wouldn\u2019t change that. \u201cIn wolf form, werewolves retain their human eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any wolves on this island.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere never are.\u201d I grabbed Murphy\u2019s hand and started forward again.</p><p>He hung back. \u201cHold on. You want to chase the scary unknown being?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a werewolf in Haiti doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t something here I\u2019m not wild about facing. I certainly don\u2019t plan on chasing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot chase. Follow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChasing involves running; following is... slower.\u201d I tugged. He still didn\u2019t move. \u201cMurphy, we need to go on. Behind us is nothing but a dead end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the waterfall came back.\u201d His voice was wistful.</p><p>\u201cYou want to spend hours finding out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he muttered. \u201cI guess I\u2019d rather fight the unknown creepy thing than stay in the small enclosed dark place until the end of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the cheery fellow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s me. Regular Mr. Chuckles I am.\u201d</p><p>I was still smiling as I turned, amused now by his British accent rather than annoyed, and I saw it. A light at the end of a tunnel. Literally.</p><p>I began to run again.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s chasing!\u201d Murphy shouted. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t going to be any chasing.\u201d Except he was running, too.</p><p>I burst out of the cave and into a clearing shadowed by a crescent moon. Moist heat slapped me in the face, startling after hours of cool darkness. The scent of greenery, of flowers, surrounded me. The moon\u2019s glow caused the trees, the shrubs, to glisten with an ethereal light, and the blossoms shone with colors both muted and vivid.</p><p>On this side of the cave lay a true jungle, dense and damp; I\u2019d never seen anything quite like it. Uneasily I wondered where we\u2019d popped out.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t like Murphy. I believed in magic\u2014white, black, and everything in between. I had to. And if magic existed, hell, we could have come out of that cave anywhere.</p><p>He reached my side, his grunt of surprise revealing the differences were as obvious to him as they had been to me.</p><p>A rustle drew my attention to the dense underbrush. Slowly I removed my knife from its sheath. At the slight rasp, Murphy reached for his rifle. I only hoped it worked after being doused in the waterfall.</p><p>Though his gun was loaded with lead, he might be able to slow something down and give me a chance to use the silver blade before the thing ripped out my throat or Murphy\u2019s.</p><p>Out of the jungle stepped a man. I give Murphy credit; he didn\u2019t put away his gun. Maybe he was learning.</p><p>There\u2019d been a growling furry beast in the cave a few moments ago. In my world, that beast might be right here, minus only the fur and the growls.</p><p>He was tall, very thin, dark skin, light eyes, wearing ancient loose khaki trousers and little else. Because of the heat, the destitution, or the need to dress quickly after shifting from one form to the next?</p><p>\u201cKi j an ou ye?\u201d Murphy gave the traditional Haitian greeting. How are you?</p><p>\u201cM\u2019pa pi mal,\u201d returned the man. I \u2019m not worse.</p><p>Also the traditional answer. In a land where poverty was a given, I \u2019m not worse was often the best that could be hoped for.</p><p>The man\u2019s voice was strong and clear. Not a zombie. Or at least not a typical zombie who could do little but mumble and shuffle. Which was good.</p><p>Or maybe bad, because then he might be\u2014</p><p>I stepped forward and before the stranger knew what I was about pressed the silver knife against his bare arm.</p><p>He didn\u2019t react, which was odd in itself. Wouldn\u2019t a normal person be disturbed by my behavior?</p><p>Murphy was. I sensed his tension, his disapproval, but he kept the gun steady. Just because the guy wasn\u2019t a shuffling zombie or a snarling werewolf didn\u2019t mean he wasn\u2019t dangerous.</p><p>\u201cPardon me.\u201d I stepped away from the man. \u201cDid you see an animal?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, a chillingly canine gesture. \u201cAnimal?\u201d</p><p>At least he spoke English. \u201cAbout so high.\u201d I set my hand at my waist. \u201cDog? Coyote? Wolf?\u201d</p><p>His smile flashed, a bit condescending but still a nice smile\u2014even if he was missing a few teeth. \u201cThere are no coyotes or wolves here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered. \u201cHaiti.\u201d</p><p>I had my doubts. \u201cSomeone got a big dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>I blinked, then glanced at Murphy, who shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know who I am?\u201d The man turned away without answering. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><p>He paused. \u201cYou wish to meet the bokor, you must come with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>Murphy caught my elbow. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to follow a stranger into the jungle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI followed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? How so?\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d I tugged on my arm; Murphy only held tighter. \u201cWhat else should I do, Murphy? Wander around wherever the hell we are shouting Mezareau\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t supposed to say his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he knows we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s known from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>Murphy released me, then stared over my shoulder at the stranger, eyes narrowed, j aw working. I discovered I was nervous at the thought of going into this new, denser jungle without Murphy. I didn\u2019t like the feeling.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I let out the breath I\u2019d been holding and together we followed our new friend into the trees.</p><p>\u201cYou think this guy\u2019s a werewolf?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>I glanced at our guide, but he didn\u2019t appear to hear our murmured words, just kept shoving aside fronds and low-hanging tree branches, moving in the direction of the moon with a determination that comforted me. At least one of us knew where we were going.</p><p>I wiggled my knife, then put it away. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m asking this,\u201d Murphy muttered. \u201cBut why would you think that? The moon isn\u2019t full.\u201d</p><p>Since we appeared to be following the Haitian for longer than a minute and the terrain wasn\u2019t too rugged to walk and talk, I gave Murphy the lowdown as I knew it.</p><p>\u201cWerewolves can change at dusk, any day of the month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the full-moon thing is a myth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes and no. Under the full moon, they\u2019re compelled to change\u2014and to kill. Under any other moon, it\u2019s their choice. Though most choose to shift and to hunt whenever they can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain I\u2019ll be askin\u2019 why?\u201d</p><p>His Irish was back. Murphy must be really worried, and he hadn\u2019t even heard the best\u2014make that the worst\u2014part yet.</p><p>\u201cThe way it was explained to me, the lycanthropy virus destroys a person\u2019s humanity. They look like people, but deep down there\u2019s a demon panting to get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDemon?\u201d He stopped walking and I did, too. \u201cYou can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to hear this or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo.\u201d</p><p>I swept out my arm in a \u201cbe my guest\u201d gesture, and he began to walk again. Our Haitian friend was now farther ahead of us, since he\u2019d continued on when we\u2019d paused.</p><p>\u201cThe demon is pure selfishness\u2014even in human form. Me first, screw the other guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Gepetto, how then can you tell a werewolf from a real boy?\u201d</p><p>He was catching on. \u201cExactly. The world as it is now is a perfect breeding ground for evil. People behave like psychopaths and we call it ambition.\u201d</p><p>Just look at my husband.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying there are werewolves in every walk of life, masquerading as people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are people, most of the time. Just not people you want to hang out with. Unless you like to turn furry and murder the innocent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should start wearing silver.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one hand. \u201cLike this?\u201d</p><p>His thumb ring gleamed blue in the moonlight.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll work.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d</p><p>I followed Murphy\u2019s gaze.

We moved forward, shoulder to shoulder through the foliage.</p> <p>I half-expected to confront a slavering, human-eyed beast. Instead, our Haitian friend waited patiently at the outskirts of a picturesque village.</p><p>With no evidence of the sickness or poverty Murphy and I had viewed in all the others we\u2019d passed on our way to the mountain, the structures were solid, many new.

Women kneaded bread on flat rocks; men repaired tools; some whittled. The only concession to the clock was the lack of children, who must be in bed. At our appearance, several people stopped what they were doing and came toward us.</p> <p>\u201cPierre,\u201d they murmured with eerie harmony.</p><p>Our guide dipped his head. \u201cTake the priestess to her quarters.\u201d</p><p>Two extremely tall, equally stout women stepped forward. They were alike enough to be sisters, if not twins, right down to the bracelet of colorful beads that encircled the somewhat manly wrist of each\u2014blue for the woman on the left, red for the one on the right.</p><p>Together they reached for my hands. I still held the knife, but they didn\u2019t seem to care, Red Bracelet grasping my fingers with the blade still clutched tightly within.</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d I reared back, crowding closer to Murphy.</p><p>No one seemed disturbed by our weapons. No one asked us to give them up or even put them down.</p> <p>Which was just weird if you ask me.</p><p>I glanced at Pierre. \u201cWe\u2019re searching for a man named Mezareau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may see him when he returns.\u201d</p><p>Murphy and I exchanged glances.</p><p>\u201cHe lives here?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201d Oui. This is his village.\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d thought we\u2019d find the bokor alone. Once initiated, a voodoo priest creates his own community, functioning as a counselor, a healer, a social worker, as well as a religious leader. His followers come to him for advice on everything.</p><p>A houngan existed to guide his people. Mezareau\u2019s trip to the dark side wouldn\u2019t negate his leading them.</p> <p>I let my gaze wander over the villagers and got that chilly, creepy feeling again. But into what was he leading them?</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time will he return?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he does.\u201d</p><p>My teeth ground together, and a low ache began behind my left eye. That kind of talk always made my blood pressure spike toward migraine.</p><p>\u201cRest, Priestess. The trials could not have been easy.\u201d</p><p>My headache intensified. \u201cWhat trials?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think you could just walk into our village?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He smiled as if I were a foolish child; maybe I was. \u201cYou were prevented, but you prevailed. Only the worthy may pass beyond the falling water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorthy of what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shall see when the master arrives.\u201d</p><p>The master? Oh, brother.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know she\u2019s a priestess?\u201d Murphy demanded.</p><p>\u201cThe master knows all because he sees all.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Murphy, tempted to say, I told you so, but he just rolled his eyes. I had to admit that \u201cknow all and see all\u201d stuff sounded hokey, but that didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t true.</p><p>\u201cMay we show you to your hut?\u201d Pierre asked.</p><p>Since I wasn\u2019t going to leave without talking to Mezareau, why not? Besides, I was tired.</p><p>Sensing my acquiescence, the women reached for my hands again. I quickly sheathed my knife and let them lead me. Since either one of them could have picked me up and carried me, my letting them was merely a formality.</p><p>I looked for Murphy. Two very large men were taking him elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I paused, and my handmaidens paused with me. \u201cWe stay together.\u201d</p><p>Pierre shook his head. \u201cPriestess, you cannot stay in the same hut with a man to whom you are not wed.\u201d</p><p>A sinking sensation caused me to demand, \u201cWhat century is this?\u201d</p><p>Murphy snorted, but I ignored him. For all we knew the cave could have been a time warp\u2014and wouldn\u2019t that just be special?</p><p>\u201cThe twenty-first,\u201d Pierre answered, with his usual calm. \u201cHowever, we have chosen to live a certain way.</p><p>Purity of body leads to purity of mind and the granting of every desire.\u201d</p><p>I certainly liked the sound of that, but I still wasn\u2019t sure if being separated from Murphy was the best idea.</p><p>\u201cWe could get married,\u201d Murphy suggested with a quirk of his brow.</p><p>\u201cDream on, pal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSweetie, you have no idea what I dream.\u201d</p><p>I cast him a quick suspicious glance and he smirked. Would the man never be serious? Did I really want him to? He made me laugh, or at least think about it.</p><p>\u201cFine. We\u2019ll stay in separate huts.\u201d I needed some sleep anyway.</p><p>Not that I planned to sleep with Murphy. At least not now, not here. Probably not ever. My eyes wandered over him, and I gave a silent sigh of disappointment. He really was hot, and I was so deprived.</p><p>I was led to a hut on the far end of the village. Murphy was led to one on the opposite side. I guess they weren\u2019t going to take any chances. Not that the village was all that big, not that I couldn\u2019t sneak over there any time I wanted to.</p><p>I just didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>And if you believe that, I have a very expensive love charm to sell you.</p><p>\u201cAll is for you, Priestess.\u201d The woman swept back the curtain that covered the doorway.</p><p>I stepped inside. The curtain fell behind me and I was alone.</p><p>A candle sat on the table, so I lit the wick. The room was small enough for the golden glow to penetrate every corner. Table, candle, pallet with a blanket and pillow. I guess all wasn\u2019t very much.</p><p>I didn\u2019t care. I stripped off my wet, dirty, torn clothes and crawled beneath the covers. The world went black as soon as I closed my eyes.</p><p>Deep in the dark of the night the furious snarl of a wild animal sounded. I shifted\u2014uneasy, uncertain.</p><p>Something was off about the sound; something didn\u2019t make sense. But in the morning I couldn\u2019t recall what I\u2019d heard, why it had bothered me, or if the sound had even been real.</p><p>Besides, in the morning I had better things to worry about. Like where were my clothes?</p><p>Sunlight streamed through the hole in the hut that passed for a window. I was naked beneath the blanket and my clothes had been removed from the building. So had my backpack and my knife.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I hoped someone was close enough to hear. I really didn\u2019t want to leave the relative safety of my bed and venture out wrapped in nothing but a blanket sari.</p><p>Who knows, the sight of my naked shoulders might be an offense worthy of immediate execution. If memory served, the boniness of my collarbone was not at all attractive.</p><p>The door was swept aside, and the women who\u2019d escorted me last night appeared. One held a colorful skirt and white cotton blouse common to Haiti. The other carried a bowl of water and dry cloths. They placed everything on the table, smiled, bowed, and left without a word.</p><p>I wasted no time washing my face, rinsing my teeth, and donning new clothes. Wrapped inside the skirt was a pair of underwear, but no matter how many times I shook it, the outfit did not yield a bra.</p><p>Oh well.</p><p>In the village, people hurried to and fro, fetching, carrying, building, sewing, fixing, cooking, so industrious I wondered if they were preparing for something special. Perhaps they were being watched and judged, though I saw no one resembling an overseer or the equivalent.</p><p>For an instant, I could have sworn I glimpsed the nose-eating zombie man lurking at the edge of the trees.</p><p>But when I blinked he was gone, and since I didn\u2019t think anyone, especially a zombie, could move that fast, I figured I was mistaken. But it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask.</p><p>My ladies-in-waiting awaited me near the cook fire in front of my hut. Breakfast\u2014fried plantains and warm flat bread\u2014had been set on a low, table-like rock.</p><p>\u201cIs there a guard for the village?\u201d</p><p>The twin wearing the red bracelet glanced up from the fire. \u201cPierre is the guardian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot him. Big guy, likes noses. He attacked us on the other side of the waterfall.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cAnyone on the other side is of the other world, Priestess. He would not be of this one.\u201d</p><p>I guess that answered that. Or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to my things?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYour clothes are being washed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy bag?\u201d I continued. \u201cMy knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a safe place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll will be returned.\u201d</p><p>I snapped my mouth shut. I couldn\u2019t blame them for taking my weapon. It\u2019s what I would have done, although I would have done it sooner.</p><p>My gaze was drawn to the hut where Murphy had slept. Nothing moved beyond the window; the place appeared deserted. Trust him to snooze away half the day.</p><p>I ate quickly, happy to partake of cooked food after several days of camp rations. But the bread was as bland as baby crackers and the plantains equally flavorless. Perhaps sugar and spice had also been placed on the list of village no-nos.</p><p>My request for tea was met with a wrinkled nose and shake of the head. \u201cNot allowed, Priestess. Such things are for the loas only.\u201d</p><p>Since when? Sure, coffee and tobacco were left for the loas, but I\u2019d never heard of tea being offered.</p><p>Even if it were, that didn\u2019t preclude the living partaking as well\u2014or at least it didn\u2019t anywhere else but here.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t complain; this wasn\u2019t my community. There is no supreme ruler of the voodoo church to tell us we aren\u2019t doing it right. Each houngan makes his own rules and rituals.</p><p>In the slave days of Haiti, every African society contributed a bit of their religion to the new one evolving among those held in chains. They couldn\u2019t all become Nigerian, they hadn\u2019t all been born in the Congo, but they could all become voodoo practitioners.</p><p>When the slaves had been forced to convert to Catholicism, they\u2019d shrugged and adopted some of those practices along with the rest. Therefore, voodoo wasn\u2019t one thing but everything.</p><p>Considering all the rules here, Mezareau ran a tight and slightly anal ship, which was his business and not mine. I needed to do what I\u2019d come for, then get out. Back to the land of coffee, tea, and condoms.</p><p>I cursed beneath my breath. I also had to stop thinking like that.</p><p>\u201cWill Mezareau be back today?\u201d</p><p>The handmaiden closest to me winced. \u201cHe is the master?\u201d</p><p>There was no way I was calling him master.</p><p>\u201cRight. Can I see him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will send for you when he is ready.\u201d</p><p>I was gritting my teeth again. I had to stop that, too, or I\u2019d have nothing but stubs by the time we left.</p><p>I strode across the center of the village in the direction of Murphy\u2019s hut. The women scurried after me. I couldn\u2019t decide if they were guards or assistants. Either way, they were getting on my nerves.</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d I swept the curtain aside.</p><p>I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d been hoping to catch him naked and tousled in bed\u2014or perhaps naked and tousled out of bed\u2014until my stomach fell at the sight of the empty room.</p><p>The place appeared as if it hadn\u2019t been inhabited for months. Either the bed hadn\u2019t been slept in or someone had remade it already, then redeposited a fine layer of dust over everything.</p><p>\u201cWhere is he?\u201d</p><p>The handmaidens exchanged confused glances. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy?\u201d More confusion ensued, and I made an impatient, nearly obscene gesture. \u201cThe man I came with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Priestess,\u201d said the one who seemed to do all the talking. \u201cYou came alone.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cDid he put you up to this?\u201d I asked. \u201cHa-ha. Very funny. Murphy! You can come out now.\u201d</p><p>The two women stared at me as if I were crazy\u2014which was nothing new. However, this time, I was certain I wasn\u2019t.</p><p>I turned in a slow circle, expecting Murphy to pop out of the trees, earring swinging, grin flashing. But he didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m starting to get annoyed,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cPriestess.\u201d</p><p>I turned so fast the woman flinched, and I realized my hands were clenched into fists. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said, and forced myself to relax. \u201cJust show me where he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know of whom you speak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMurphy. Tall, white, and\u2014\u201d I stopped short of saying \u201chandsome.\u201d \u201cPirate earring? Blondish with beads in his hair. Kind of hard to miss.\u201d</p> <p>She spread her hands helplessly.</p><p>I had not imagined traveling through the mountains with Devon Murphy. That was as impossible as...</p><p>Zombies? Werewolves? Disappearing waterfalls?</p><p>I began to glance inside every hut and beat the bushes surrounding the village. Murphy was here someplace. But was he hiding from me or were they hiding me from him?</p><p>The handmaidens followed, speaking softly in Creole to the villagers who peered at me with varying degrees of pity.</p><p>I made a complete circle with no sign of him. Then I stared, stumped, into a dense jungle that really wasn\u2019t supposed to be here. Did I dare go walking around without him?</p> <p>\u201cPriestess, you came alone.\u201d</p><p>I met the dark eyes of my talkative guard. Either she was an accomplished liar or she really believed what she was saying, and that just didn\u2019t make sense. Unless they were all brainwashed.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI am called Helen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen. I did not imagine Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain?\u201d</p><p>Her question made me think. Some very strange things had been happening since I\u2019d come to Haiti. What was real and what was not? I was pretty sure Murphy had been a flesh-and-blood man\u2014or at least I hoped he was, for more reasons than one.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have gotten here without him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you could not have gotten here with him.\u201d</p><p>My head was starting to hurt and it was only... I glanced at my watch, which had stopped. That figured.</p><p>\u201cI want to see Mezareau.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will.\u201d She and her evil twin turned and walked back to my hut.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day searching for Murphy. I even stepped into the trees, thinking I\u2019d take a walk on a trail. But there was no trail, which was going to make it damn difficult to get out of here. Especially if I had to go alone. My sense of direction was shit.</p><p>By suppertime I was worried\u2014about Murphy, about myself and my sanity. I picked at the food\u2014 someone really needed to teach Helen how to cook\u2014then faked a huge yawn as an excuse to retire before the sun.</p><p>I had to think. To plan... something. But several days passed, and I was still there\u2014no Murphy, no Mezareau, no plan.</p><p>I\u2019d gone into the mountains and disappeared like so many others. Edward would try to find me, but I doubted he\u2019d have much luck. With Murphy I\u2019d believed I had a chance of getting out. Now I wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>What if Mezareau never came back? What if he was a myth? What if I couldn\u2019t learn what I needed to know? What if I could, but I was unable to escape and return to California and Sarah?</p><p>Wouldn\u2019t that be the ultimate torment? Knowing how to bring her back but being unable to do so?</p><p>Perhaps we\u2019d entered hell instead of an enchanted land.</p><p>Another night passed, and I was getting desperate.</p><p>The village quieted but not completely. When I glanced out my window, people still moved about. Was there really that much to do? Their industriousness bordered on obsession.</p><p>Along with that oddity, I\u2019d discovered everyone in the village was young and strapping. The children</p><p>I\u2019d thought asleep the night we\u2019d arrived did not exist, nor did the elderly. I started to have visions of a Stepford Village\u2014created solely for a single purpose, though I couldn\u2019t figure out what that purpose might be.</p><p>I lay on my pallet at a loss. If I couldn\u2019t search the jungle in the daylight I certainly wasn\u2019t going to do it under the light of a gibbous moon. I had little choice but to wait until Mezareau deigned to speak with me or my imaginary friend showed up.</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d I whispered. The single word sounded frightened, lonely, lost.</p><p>I must have dozed, because I awoke and knew I was no longer alone. A slight hiss made me turn my head, and I came face-to-face with a snake.</p><p>Most women would freak, but even before the pet python, snakes had never bothered me. I\u2019d been fascinated by them. This one appeared to be some kind of vine variety\u2014skinny, green, and very long.</p><p>The snake was the symbol of the loa Danballah, my met tet, a term meaning \u201cmaster of the head.\u201d Like the guardian angels of Christianity, a person\u2019s met tet watched over them for life.</p><p>I eyed the snake in front of me. I guess I had asked for help.</p><p>Slowly I sat up, and the reptile slithered toward the door, pausing at the threshold as if waiting. I got to my feet and followed.</p><p>The village was quieter, emptier than before, though not completely deserted. I waited for an outcry at my appearance. Where were my handmaidens? But no one seemed to notice me following the snake into the trees.</p><p>Though no path had magically appeared, the serpent knew where he was going, winding across sticks and stones, beneath bushes, and out the other side. He moved slowly so I was able to follow without too much difficulty.</p><p>I wondered momentarily if I were still asleep, which would explain the lack of interest in my leaving, as well as the ease of my travels through a previously impenetrable jungle. Then I stepped on a stone, right in the center of my foot. As pain exploded up my leg and I had to bite my tongue to keep from sniveling, I knew I was as awake as I\u2019d ever be.</p><p>We continued on, into the night, the dark, the unknown. Perhaps this was punishment for my recent lack of attentiveness to my met tet. I\u2019d been a little busy with the werewolves to leave offerings of food, rum, and shiny things. I\u2019d definitely forgotten to wear Danballah\u2019s color, white, on his day of days, Thursday.</p><p>Loas could become extremely snarky when ignored. It would serve me right to be led into the wilderness and abandoned.</p><p>Just when I thought that was exactly what he had in mind, the trees parted and a hut appeared so suddenly I stumbled over my own feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I said aloud.</p><p>The snake didn\u2019t answer. Looking down, I discovered the snake was gone.</p><p>\u201cSwell,\u201d I muttered. \u201cI get to reflect on my sins in the middle of a great big nowhere.\u201d I guess I should be thankful I\u2019d have a roof over my head, if no food in my stomach.</p><p>Shoving back the curtain across the door, I stepped inside. The hut was occupied; however, the body near the far wall wasn\u2019t moving.</p><p>I peered into the jungle. Maybe I wasn\u2019t supposed to be in here. Maybe this was the home of some hermit, a crazy man who would chop me into a million pieces for trespassing. Hey, it could happen.</p><p>Uneasy, I glanced at the shadowy figure again, even took a step inside, I\u2019m not sure why, and the change in angle allowed the moonlight to illuminate the beads woven into sun-streaked hair.</p><p>\u201cMurphy!\u201d I shouted, rushing forward, falling to my knees, reaching out. As soon as my fingers touched his skin, I j erked back.</p><p>He was cold, stiff, and\u2014</p><p>Dead? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. Murphy could not be dead. I wouldn\u2019t let him be.</p><p>I rolled him onto his back, put my fingertips to the pulse point just beneath his chin. His hair, soft and free, drifted across my wrist. I closed my eyes, concentrated, and felt the featherlight flutter of a pulse.</p><p>\u201cHalleluj ah,\u201d I whispered, leaning down to press my cheek against his chest. He wore no shirt and his skin was slightly clammy.</p> <p>Though I\u2019d felt a pulse, I couldn\u2019t hear a heartbeat, maybe because my own was beating far too loud and fast in my ears.</p><p>I sat back. His chest rose and fell with slow, shallow breaths. Perhaps too slow and too shallow; he seemed almost drugged.</p><p>\u201cMurphy!\u201d I slapped his cheeks lightly.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>I glanced around for some water to toss in his face.</p> <p>Again, nothing.</p><p>How had he gotten here? Why had he stayed? Unless he\u2019d been drugged from the beginning.</p><p>I shook him, pinched his arm, smacked the bottom of his feet, everything I\u2019d ever heard of to wake someone up, but he didn\u2019t and I began to get scared. What if he was dying?</p><p>\u201cHelp,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Leaning over, I lifted one of his eyelids, trying to see if his pupils were fixed, but it was too dark to tell. I sighed and let my head droop until we were nose to nose.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Murphy,\u201d I murmured, and his eyes opened, staring directly into mine.</p> <p>I yelped and straightened so fast my spine cracked. I tried to skitter backward, but he sat up as if he\u2019d been j abbed with a cattle prod, then grabbed me by the arms, dragging me across his lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d was all I managed before he kissed me.</p><p>Since I was damn glad to see him, too, I didn\u2019t struggle; I didn\u2019t want to. He was real, he was alive, and man, could he kiss.</p><p>He tasted like licorice, sweet and dark, as his tongue teased my lips, then dipped inside to explore.</p><p>Sighing, I let him, wrapping my arms around his neck and holding on.</p><p>His skin was still cool, but his hands warmed as he trailed them up my arms, then back down, settling at my waist and shifting me so I rolled over his erection. Together we moaned, the sound vibrating against our j oined lips, making mine tingle.</p><p>My fingers tangled in the hair at his nape, pressing him closer, angling his head so I could experience every nuance of his mouth.</p><p>The broad, bare expanse of his chest gave off a chill, and I ran my hands across it, rubbing back and forth, trying to warm him. My thumbs were drawn to his hardened nipples, brushing over them once, twice, three times.</p> <p>As if in answer his palms swept from my hips, up my ribs, to my breasts, unfettered beneath the loose cotton blouse. His thumbs ran over the peaks in the same stroking rhythm.</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d he murmured against my mouth. \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d both been under the same misconception, which only made what we were doing more a celebration of life than usual. I\u2019d been so frightened, so alone; I had to be with him right now; then I could put every fear and loneliness behind.</p><p>I wiggled, uncomfortable. Our angle was all wrong. I attempted to swing my leg across his and straddle him, but my skirt got tangled with my knees. Cursing impatiently, I yanked the thing above my waist and settled across his lap, pressing us intimately together.</p><p>He leaned against the outer wall, eyes closed, hair tangled. I ran my hands across his chest again, down his arms, tracing a fingertip below the waistband of his pants.</p><p>His lips quirked; one eye opened. Reaching out, he took a fistful of my blouse and yanked me forward, pressing our mouths together again.</p><p>I was draped all over him, lips nibbling, teeth nipping, hands exploring. Then we slowed things down and, in doing so, only served to rev things up.</p><p>The less he gave, the more I wanted. What had seemed like a bad idea once seemed like a great idea now. My body was afire, drawn to the lingering chill of his.</p><p>His icy fingers felt exquisite on the heated skin of my stomach, tracing a delicious pattern across my rib cage. When he cupped my breasts I shivered, leaning back and lifting my blouse over my head, tossing it aside without thought, baring myself to him and the moonlight slanting through the tiny window.</p><p>I didn\u2019t stop to think that I was behaving out of character because right now I seemed to be more me than I\u2019d ever been before. Or perhaps this was the new me, a woman born from the ashes of the old.</p><p>His tongue did an innovative swirl around my nipple, as our bodies rocked together in a way that was</p><p>ordained long before we\u2019d been born.</p><p>My legs spread wide, knees clutching his hips, I rode his erection, our clothes at first creating a delicious friction and then an unacceptable barrier. I was on the verge of something spectacular, and I existed only to find it.</p><p>I fumbled with his zipper. He shoved my hands aside, performing an acrobatic maneuver that freed him, even as I performed similar feats to remove one leg from my panties so he could plunge inside.</p><p>My skirt fell in a curtain around us as I clutched his shoulders; he grasped my hips, and we strove toward the conclusion of what we\u2019d begun all the way back in that alley in Port-au-Prince.</p><p>My spine arched, body straining; he tugged on one nipple with his teeth, the sharp sensation causing me to gasp, clench, then shudder as the release broke over me, then he suckled to the gentle rhythm of the pulse deep inside.</p><p>He tugged me forward, my cheek against his hair, his face cradled between my breasts. His lingering chill seeped into me, and I groped for a blanket, tossing it over us, creating a cocoon that soon filled with our warmth. We stayed that way, arms around each other, bodies still j oined, as our breathing evened out and we slowly came back to the earth.</p><p>But we couldn\u2019t stay that way forever. Eventually I had to climb off him, sit next to him, and ask questions. \u201cYou went into that hut in the village; then the next morning you were gone and everyone told me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I was dead? They told me the same thing about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, they told me you didn\u2019t exist. That I\u2019d come into the village alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes no sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes anything around here?\u201d I asked. \u201cLike how did you wind up in a hut in the middle of nowhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I woke up here the morning after we arrived\u2014or at least I think it was the morning after. I was dizzy, had the shivers. Pierre was here. He said I needed to stay away from the village. I had a fever.</p><p>Then he told me you\u2019d already died of it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled me into his arms again, and I was touched.</p><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>I ignored the question, not wanting to get into the snake being my guardian and so on. We had more pressing concerns.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they leave any water? Medicine? Food? Did you see a doctor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt they have one. Pierre told me to fast. Only when I was purified would I be healed.\u201d</p><p>They were big on purification around here\u2014no tea, no spices, no water, no food.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit if I ever heard it,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t care for it much myself. But every time I tried to stand, I ended up on my ass. So I decided to sleep as much as I could and maybe I\u2019d get stronger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout food or water?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much choice.\u201d</p><p>Something wasn\u2019t right. I could understand isolating Murphy, but dehydrating and starving him? That sounded like they were trying to kill him. Why not just kill him? I guess there was only one way to find out.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the village.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>I expected an argument from Murphy, a demand to get the hell out of Dodge, but as usual he surprised</p><p>me.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s,\u201d he said, and started to get dressed. \u201cHave you seen the bokor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo. They keep saying he\u2019ll arrive when he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that\u2019s annoying,\u201d he muttered, and my lips curved.</p><p>Murphy stood, swaying a little. \u201cWhoa. Head rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d brought some food and water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p> <p>We stepped out of the hut and I scanned the area. No snake; I guessed we were on our own. I started off in the direction I\u2019d come.</p><p>Murphy fell in beside me. I slowed my pace. He was paler than I liked. Several days in the heat without food or water\u2014whether he\u2019d had a fever or not\u2014would make anyone woozy. If he passed out, I wouldn\u2019t be able to drag him.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should go back and bring help,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cBecause the people who left me here, the same ones who told you I didn\u2019t exist, have been so helpful?\u201d</p><p>I hated it when he was right.</p><p>\u201cJust tell me if you\u2019re faint,\u201d I ordered.</p> <p>\u201cIf I can satisfy a woman, I can certainly walk back to the village.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, hell,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>We were still in the land that condom forgot, and I\u2019d forgotten one.</p><p>\u201cI thought heaven m\u2019self.\u201d</p><p>Irish accent. I wasn\u2019t charmed.</p><p>\u201cCondom,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d he repeated, and stopped walking.</p><p>\u201cToo late.\u201d I tugged on his hand. \u201cSpilled milk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot milk, more\u2019s the pity.\u201d</p><p>England had returned. Poor guy. He looked a little green. I squeezed his fingers. \u201cTiming-wise, we\u2019re</p><p>good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you say \u2018good,\u2019 you mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor getting pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He started to hyperventilate.</p><p>\u201cBreathe!\u201d I ordered. \u201cI meant for not getting pregnant. We\u2019re good for not getting pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, taking a few more seconds before speaking. \u201cA baby isn\u2019t the only issue. But you shouldn\u2019t worry... I mean, I\u2019ve never done this before.\u201d</p><p>I choked on surprised laughter. \u201cYou were not a virgin, Murphy. Even you can\u2019t expect me to believe such blarney.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment. I meant, I\u2019d never had sex without a condom before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your entire life?\u201d I also found that hard to believe.</p><p>\u201cI swear.\u201d He held up one hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat got into you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking,\u201d he admitted. \u201cAnd usually I am. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t plan on telling him so. We were being adults here, I couldn\u2019t admit that I\u2019d needed him so badly I hadn\u2019t been thinking, either. That was the quickest way to a broken heart, and I didn\u2019t have much heart left to break.</p><p>\u201cNo harm, no foul,\u201d I quipped.</p><p>\u201cMmm. It\u2019s common courtesy to return the favor, sweet thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tell you my sexual history and then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Obviously I was no good at this; my grand total of men in my bed now stood at a whopping two.</p><p>\u201cI... uh... haven\u2019t been with anyone since...\u201d My voice trailed off. He could figure it out.</p><p>\u201cYour husband,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d</p><p>I started to walk again, fast, any consideration of Murphy\u2019s weakness forgotten. He caught up easily, though, grabbed my arm, and held on tight. \u201cI think I deserve to know, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>He did, but that didn\u2019t mean I had to be nice about telling him.</p><p>\u201cKarl betrayed me, got our daughter killed, and is now in prison. May he rot in pieces.\u201d</p><p>Murphy kept pace at my side. \u201cWhat did he do?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to talk about this. However, I\u2019d just shared my body with this man; why couldn\u2019t I share my past?</p><p>\u201cHe lied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho he was, what he did.\u201d</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t answer at first. When I looked up, he looked away. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarl was a businessman. I never asked what kind of business. He was successful. We had money\u2014a lot of it. He paid the bills; I ran the house and took care of Sarah.\u201d</p><p>My voice wavered and my steps slowed. Murphy took my hand. I\u2019d never have figured him one for comfort, but I\u2019d have figured wrong. I\u2019d figured a lot wrong in my life.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a businessman?\u201d Murphy rubbed his thumb back and forth across my palm.</p><p>\u201cHe was the biggest drug dealer on the West Coast.\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see it. I guess I just didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Sarah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKarl got in a dispute with a supplier. They took her and they killed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>Then I spent a lot of time in a quiet place drugged out of my gourd, but I wasn\u2019t going to mention that.</p><p>Instead I skipped ahead several months. \u201cThen the Feds came, and they wanted to know things.\u201d</p><p>Murphy frowned. \u201cBut you didn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot then. But I found out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, and his fingers tightened. \u201cI pretended to forgive him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cI learned all I could, then testified and put him away forever.\u201d I hop e.</p><p>Prolonged silence made me glance at Murphy. I couldn\u2019t read his expression.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you mean vindictive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think twice before crossing you.\u201d</p><p>Though the words were flippant, his expression wasn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t say I blamed him for being worried, but what did a guy like Murphy have to hide?</p><p>\u201cHow did you get involved in voodoo?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI dreamed of a snake, over and over and over again.\u201d At his blank expression, I continued, \u201cDreaming of a snake, of Danballah, means you\u2019re destined for the priesthood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Haiti!\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, anywhere if you\u2019re studying to be a priestess. Danballah is a very powerful loa. My teacher was impressed.\u201d</p><p>At first I\u2019d gone through the motions, wanting something from\u2019 my new religion without giving anything back. Believing in voodoo hadn\u2019t been easy for a rich Catholic white girl from the land of sun and surf.</p><p>After Danballah had appeared often enough I\u2019d come to believe I was doing the right thing, the only thing that I could do.</p><p>\u201cI was lost,\u201d I explained. \u201cConfused, uncertain, alone. I went searching, and I found something to hold on to. I\u2019ll discover a way to bring Sarah back. I know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, that\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it? I guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d I took a deep breath. \u201cAt the least, I needed a new identity, and Priestess Cassandra was a doozy.\u201d</p><p>Murphy shot me a quick glance. \u201cYou\u2019re in witness protection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I say that?\u201d</p><p>Even if I had just taken this man into my body and done things with him I\u2019d never done with anyone else, I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell anyone about witness protection.</p><p>I\u2019d been drilled in the rules. The only way to disappear was to leave my past behind. Of course I wasn\u2019t completely able to do that because of Sarah.</p><p>But I could follow every other rule\u2014namely, never tell anyone I was a witness, never share my real name. Not even with the people I dated, not even with my new husband, should I remarry. Since I didn\u2019t plan on doing either, it had been easy to agree to those conditions.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your real name?\u201d Murphy pressed.</p><p>\u201cNothing half as wonderful as Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like sleeping with a woman whose name I don\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s beside the point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a man who wears beads in his hair and a ring in his ear you\u2019re very closed-minded.\u201d He stared at me without any lightening of his expression. \u201cMy name is Cassandra, Murphy, and it always will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe name\u2019s Devon. You\u2019d think after we did the tongue tango you could at least call me by my given name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can.\u201d He cursed in what sounded like French. \u201cHow many languages do you know?\u201d</p><p>Murphy shrugged. \u201cA few.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d bared my soul, or what was left of it; now it was his turn. \u201cWhy do you change accents all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why can you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer, and he wouldn\u2019t meet my eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think after we did the tongue tango you could at least tell me where you\u2019re from,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like to know,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He remained silent so long, I didn\u2019t think he was going to tell me; then the words tumbled out, as if he couldn\u2019t say them fast enough. \u201cI was born in Tennessee. The mountains. I\u2019m a gen-u-ine hillbilly.\u201d</p><p>He said the words just like Jethro Bodine, but something in his eyes kept me from laughing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re American.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs coal, which is what my daddy mined. Ten kids. We had nothing. Then the mine closed and Momma died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old were you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen. I left the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? I was practically on my own already. I wasn\u2019t going down in those mines, even if they hadn\u2019t closed. I figured I could be a model.\u201d His lips quirked. \u201cAt home I was considered mighty nice looking.\u201d</p><p>I could imagine. He was still mighty nice.</p><p>\u201cAll of my life I\u2019d dreamed of being rich.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cTry being dirt-poor and hungry, then choose.\u201d</p><p>He was right. I had no idea what it was like to have nothing to eat, no j ob, very little education.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>I had to wonder if the beads and feathers, the hoop and the thumb ring, were an unconscious rebellion against his childhood. Or perhaps he just liked pretty, shiny things, having had so few of them.</p><p>\u201cNever mind.\u201d He took a deep breath, let it out. \u201cI get riled up sometimes.\u201d</p><p>While talking about his past he\u2019d reverted to a soft, country accent that flowed over my skin like warm water. He shifted his shoulders and cleared his throat.</p><p>When he spoke again, it was with the flat, unaccented tones of a nightly newscaster.</p><p>\u201cI made my way to New York with high hopes, but in the big city I wasn\u2019t all that. Pretty faces, dime a million. So I wound up on the streets for a while, did some things I wasn\u2019t proud of.\u201d</p><p>I could imagine that, too.</p><p>\u201cI discovered I had an ear for accents and languages; there are plenty of them to be heard in New York City. I found a j ob and got off the streets, but I was always just one step away from winding up there again.\u201d</p><p>Considering he\u2019d left home at fifteen, Murphy hadn\u2019t turned out so badly. To have picked up so many accents and languages, to be as savvy and articulate as he was, he had to be extremely intelligent.</p><p>\u201cHow did you wind up in Haiti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe j ob was construction, and after that last hurricane kicked the crap out of the Caribbean I was asked to come down and help out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor free?\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cDo I seem the free type? Government subsidized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe last hurricane?\u201d I frowned. \u201cThat was a year ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJob ended; I stayed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He glanced into the trees. \u201cI like it here.\u201d</p><p>For someone who professed to love money, Murphy had come to the wrong place.</p><p>Suddenly he stumbled and I reached for him. Luckily he recovered on his own, because otherwise we\u2019d have both ended up on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re weak,\u201d I said. \u201cHungry.\u201d</p><p>He straightened. \u201cThis isn\u2019t hungry. I\u2019ve been hungry. Hell, I could run a few miles yet before I pass out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just keep walking, skip the running, shall we?\u201d</p><p>Murphy\u2019s smile made me smile, too. I don\u2019t know what it was about him\u2014maybe the great sex\u2014but he made my spirit lighter.</p><p>He was honest about who he was, what he wanted. No secrets or hidden agendas with Devon Murphy.</p><p>For a woman whose life had been ruined by secrets, who now lived in hiding, a man like Murphy was too novel to resist.</p><p>Though the snake had led me to the abandoned hut, I was having no problem finding my way back. My feet seemed to be drawn along a path no one else could see. I figured we\u2019d reach the village in a few minutes; then we pushed through a particularly dense band of trees and into a clearing I\u2019d never seen before.</p><p>As I\u2019d said, my sense of direction was shit.</p><p>The fading moonlight filtered through the trees, turning to silver tiny bits of new growth dotted here and there throughout the recently tilled field. In less than an hour the sun would rise. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d been wandering about all night.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>On the opposite side of the clearing stood a hut.</p><p>Murphy took off, skirting the edge of the overturned earth, and I hustled to catch up.</p><p>I reached him just as he pulled back the curtain on the door and ducked inside. I tensed in expectation of an outcry. We might be in the boonies, but that didn\u2019t mean you just walked into someone\u2019s hut uninvited.</p><p>When I heard nothing, I crept closer. \u201cMurphy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better get in here.\u201d</p><p>After glancing around uneasily, I did.</p><p>Inside was a bed, furniture\u2014handmade, but a chair was a chair and those were few and far between around here\u2014bookshelves with real books, an altar. The hut must be the property of a very wealthy Haitian.</p><p>A leopard skin hung on the wall. Not just a cape but also the head, mouth open and snarling, yellow- green eyes bright, shiny; they looked almost alive.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that for?\u201d Murphy asked, never taking his eyes off the thing.</p><p>\u201cDecoration?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a voodoo costume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one that I\u2019ve ever seen, although that doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be. Still...\u201d I shook my head.</p><p>\u201cVoodoo symbolism leans more toward inanimate obj ects\u2014rocks, trees, hearts, crosses. If we really want to go wild, there\u2019s thunder, lighting, the rainbow, or a snake. Large, vicious animate\u2014not so much.\u201d</p><p>However, something he\u2019d said tickled my memory. \u201cRemember when I felt fur and a tail in the cave and you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe someone was wearing fur.\u201d</p><p>We both returned our gazes to the leopard skin.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d Murphy murmured.</p><p>I had to agree. \u201cWe should probably get out of here.\u201d</p><p>If someone was strange enough to wear a leopard skin around for whatever reason, I really didn\u2019t want to meet him or her.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute.\u201d Murphy began to search the place.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never know what you might find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is breaking and entering!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe place was open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a hut, there is no closed.\u201d</p><p>He ignored me and continued with his search. I was drawn to the altar. Next to it lay an ason, a rattle used in voodoo rituals. Made from a gourd, an ason was filled with snake vertebrae and decorated with brightly colored strands of beads.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Murphy reached for the rattle.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I grabbed Murphy\u2019s hand before he could touch it. \u201cAn ason is only to be touched by the priest or priestess it belongs to. They\u2019re the sacred symbol of our service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPriest?\u201d Murphy stared over my shoulder with an odd expression, and I suddenly realized what the ason meant.</p><p>\u201cMezareau,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cWere you looking for me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>The voice was deep and rich; a touch of France nudged it toward mesmerizing.</p><p>I turned. The man in the doorway wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d expected.</p><p>He was slim and elegant in a linen shirt and trousers, and his erect carriage gave him the illusion of height, though in truth he had to be several inches shy of six feet.</p> <p>His hair was short, dark, without a hint of gray, though there were lines around his thin lips and green eyes. The caf\u00e9 au lait shade of his skin revealed someone on his family tree had arrived here in chains.</p><p>\u201cPriestess Cassandra, oui?\u201d A sharp tilt of his chin brought me out of my stupor.</p><p>\u201cOui. I mean yes. Sir.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his teeth white, straight, and numerous. Or perhaps they just seemed that way because they were so small. He couldn\u2019t have more teeth than he should. I was just tired, nervous, embarrassed. He\u2019d caught us going through his home.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014,\u201d I began, and Murphy gave me an elbow in the ribs. I coughed.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mezareau?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cJacques Mezareau, oui, and you are the man who should be dead.\u201d</p><p>Murphy started but recovered quickly. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the one who\u2019s been trying to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he meant the fever,\u201d I interj ected.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mezareau bit off the word with a sharp French twist. I half-expected him to click his heels, but he wasn\u2019t wearing any shoes. \u201cMonsieur Murphy is right; I have been trying to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you so.\u201d Murphy inched in front of me.</p> <p>I shouldered him back. We struggled for an instant, but Murphy was stronger and he won.</p><p>Mezareau watched the exchange with obvious amusement. \u201cWhy are you protecting him, Priestess? He has betrayed you.\u201d</p><p>Though I knew that was impossible\u2014the tongue tango aside, I barely knew the man, how could he betray me?\u2014nevertheless I stiffened. One betrayal in a lifetime was one too many.</p><p>\u201cCassandra\u2014,\u201d Murphy began.</p><p>\u201cSilence!\u201d Mezareau thundered.</p><p>For such a slim man he had the deepest, loudest voice I\u2019d ever heard. A chill rippled along my skin, making my hair stand on end. That voice was almost surreal.</p><p>Mezareau strode forward and grabbed Murphy by the throat, lifting the larger man onto his toes. His fingers were impossibly long, the nails even more so. They pressed into Murphy\u2019s neck, drawing blood.</p><p>\u201cStop that!\u201d I protested.</p> <p>Mezareau ignored me, shoving his hand into one of the voluminous pockets of Murphy\u2019s cargo pants and yanking something out. Then he let Murphy go with a shove.</p><p>Murphy stumbled, and I caught him before he fell. My gaze went to his neck, where tiny red welts had already sprung up.</p><p>\u201cTold you he was a nut,\u201d Murphy managed.</p><p>\u201cActually, you said he was dangerous.\u201d I glanced toward Mezareau, whose eyes blazed like emeralds. \u201cI think you were right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is a thief and a liar, Priestess. He deserves to die.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau opened his hand, revealing what he\u2019d removed from Murphy\u2019s pocket\u2014a diamond the size of a golf ball.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but gape. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. The j ewel was exquisite.</p><p>\u201cHe came for this,\u201d Mezareau spit. \u201cNot you.\u201d</p><p>I knew Murphy hadn\u2019t brought me out of the goodness of his heart; I was paying him. However, I had wondered why he\u2019d decided to do so for such a reasonable price.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s tried to get through the waterfall before,\u201d Mezareau said.</p><p>Which explained how he\u2019d known where it was.</p><p>\u201cBut only the worthy may pass, and he is not one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did he get through?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cDid he hold your hand when you went beneath the water?\u201d</p><p>My gaze met Murphy\u2019s; his expression was carefully blank. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau gave an elegant yet derisive snort. I felt like an idiot. I\u2019d thought Murphy was being sweet, helpful, heroic. But I\u2019d been wrong about a man before.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you let him fuck you.\u201d</p><p>I flinched\u2014from the language and the truth.</p><p>\u201cFool,\u201d Mezareau muttered. \u201cHe has been using you from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Murphy said nothing in his own defense, so I had to. \u201cBut... I found him.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s lip curled. \u201cYou went into the city. You asked about me. Even I heard you were asking way out here.\u201d</p><p>My ears perked up. How had he heard? With his own magical ears? Or from his own low-life spies?</p><p>\u201cYou think Murphy didn\u2019t get word? That he couldn\u2019t send someone to you and have them send you to him?\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019d said, I was no good at the cloak-and-dagger stuff. Probably never would be.</p><p>\u201cWhat made me worthy?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou came not for yourself but for another.\u201d</p><p>Murphy spoke at last, his voice stronger but still hoarse. \u201cWouldn\u2019t seem like a bokor would give a shit about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what I give a shit about, monsieur. Now, it is best if you are gone.\u201d He snapped his fingers and two burly villagers appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d I said, a little too loudly.</p><p>\u201cYou will protect him after what he has done?\u201d Mezareau asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that all women who are betrayed wish death on the betrayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me.\u201d</p><p>Liar, my mind whispered. I wanted Karl dead.</p><p>But there was betrayal and then there was betrayal. Murphy hadn\u2019t done anything other than what I\u2019d asked. Even if he\u2019d been playing me, I\u2019d gotten what I wanted. I\u2019d particularly wanted the sex.</p><p>Mezareau said something to his minions in French too complicated to catch, and they grabbed Murphy.</p><p>\u201cWait\u2014,\u201d I began, but Murphy interrupted, \u201cHe just told them to incarcerate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil I figure out what to do with you.\u201d Mezareau smiled thinly. \u201cYou are very hard to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, don\u2019t believe what he says.\u201d The minions began to drag Murphy away. \u201cHe lies more than I do.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s smile widened as Murphy disappeared through the door.</p><p>\u201cYou sent that man to our camp,\u201d I murmured.</p><p> \u201cOut. \u201d</p><p>\u201d He was pretty hard to kill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid he is not quite right in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got that when he tried to chew off Murphy\u2019s nose.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau made a \u201ctsking\u201d sound. \u201cAs I said...\u201d He twirled his finger near his ear in the universal hand gesture for \u201ccrazy.\u201d \u201cBut he takes orders very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen didn\u2019t seem to know who he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelen knows only what I wish her to.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d also said the guy couldn\u2019t possibly be from here; now Mezareau was saying he was. Someone was lying. Big shock.</p><p>\u201cSo where is he?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou injured him very badly\u2014knife in the back, gunshot to the shoulder, stabbed in the neck with a crucifix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet he got up and walked away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmazing what the human body can withstand, is it not?\u201d</p><p>I had my doubts he\u2019d been human, but I let it go for now.</p><p>Mezareau tossed the diamond into the air; the large, heavy j ewel made a thwack when he caught it in his palm. \u201cMurphy is a thief, Priestess, and has been for a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople in glass houses,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cAre you insinuating I stole the diamond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Why should I lie? \u201cYou\u2019re a bokor?\u201d I pressed.</p><p>He dipped his chin.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Confusion flickered in his eerie eyes. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou enj oy being evil?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been listening to the wrong people, Priestess. Embracing the dark side doubles your power.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet,\u201d I said drily.</p><p>\u201cA houngan, or a mambo like yourself,\u201d he said, using the word for \u201cpriestess,\u201d \u201cwho only studies the light side of magic is reaping but half the benefits. There is power beyond your dreams if you embrace all</p><p>\u2014white, black, and every shade in between. You must know this deep down or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u201d</p><p>I hated it when evil sorcerers were right.</p><p>Silence descended, broken only by the trill of insects calling to one another outside the hut. I wasn\u2019t sure what else to say. How did one ask about raising the dead?</p><p>My gaze returned to the leopard skin. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>Mezareau crossed the room and stroked the pelt. \u201cA family heirloom. You have heard of the Egbo?\u201d</p><p>I remembered what Renee had told me. \u201cThe secret society of Old Calabar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery good. The Egbo was the judicial arm of the Efik.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho were slave traders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn unfortunate truth. The Egbo was known as the leopard society. The leader wore this while he passed judgment on transgressors. Usually horrific and unusual punishment followed, to make the others desist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got more slaves than captors, you have to make a statement,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Mezareau beamed at me as if I were a prize pupil.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the leader,\u201d I said, and Mezareau clipped his chin. \u201cAnd these people are your slaves?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy would you ask such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey work day and night, in a place from which there\u2019s no escape.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose in the village chose to come here, to make a better place than the one they had.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey call you master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a courtesy title. I lead them, but they are free to go at any time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d I asked. \u201cThe waterfall disappeared.\u201d</p><p>His head tilted. \u201cYou must have been overtired. I\u2019m sure if you return to the cave, the waterfall will exist right where you wish it to.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d see about that.</p><p>I lifted my chin to indicate the leopard skin. \u201cDo you wear that like a costume? Walk on all fours?</p><p>Growl?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cThat has been on the wall since I built the place. It is an antique. I would never treat an heirloom with such disrespect.\u201d</p><p>OK, next question.</p><p>\u201cHave any of your people seen a wolf in the night? Maybe heard some howls they can\u2019t explain?\u201d</p><p>His frown became a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were a J\u00e4ger-Sucher, too.\u201d</p><p>I schooled my face into an expression of curiosity. \u201cWhat\u2019s a J\u00e4ger-Sucher?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome now, Priestess. Wolves in Haiti? I don\u2019t think so. Unless they\u2019re werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He lifted his right hand, palm facing me. \u201cI swear there isn\u2019t a wolf--were- or otherwise--on this island.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure I believed him, but I hadn\u2019t come here for wolves.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know about the J\u00e4ger-Sucher society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know more than you could ever believe possible.\u201d</p><p>Hope fluttered to life in my chest. \u201cDo you know how to raise the dead to live again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>\u201cWill you teach me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish.\u201d</p><p>Oh, I wished.</p> <p>\u201cYou do realize that raising the dead is an act performed only by a bokor?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if I teach you, and you perform the ritual, you become like me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d known that; I\u2019d just chosen not of think about it for fear I\u2019d chicken out. But now, faced with the end to my quest, the prospect of life after death, hope from the ashes, I knew it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d</p> <p>His smile widened. \u201cI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\u201d</p><p>Unease sparked, a trickle of gooseflesh across my neck, then down my arms. I felt as if I\u2019d agreed to a devil\u2019s bargain, and I probably had.</p><p>\u201cCan you teach me now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ritual may only be performed beneath the full moon.\u201d</p><p>Rats. I didn\u2019t want to wait another week until the lopsided moon became round, but I doubted even Mezareau could speed up that process.</p><p>\u201cUntil then,\u201d he snapped his fingers again, \u201cyou will be my guest.\u201d</p> <p>The minions returned. They grabbed me by the arms and hauled me to my hut, about three hundred yards away. We had been close.</p><p>The goons shoved me inside, then stood guard at the door. I guess Mezareau\u2019s idea of guest and mine were pretty far apart.</p><p>The day passed, the night, too, and then several more. They didn\u2019t starve me at least. I wasn\u2019t so sure they were being as nice to Murphy. I asked after him, but if my guards understood English, they weren\u2019t letting on, going about their duties with silent, stoic precision.</p><p>My handmaidens had disappeared. I hoped they weren\u2019t being punished for allowing me to escape.</p><p>Punishment around here was probably not pretty.</p><p>At last the moon arose complete, and my guards supplied me with a robe of red. The color was worn only in Petro rituals, when the more violent loos were summoned. These never took place in a temple but outside at a crossroad in an open field or a forest.</p><p>They led me to the recently tilled field, surrounded by trees. Mezareau stood at the edge garbed in a robe similar to mine, his ason in one hand and a knife in the other. Murphy lay gagged and bound at his feet.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cYou wanted to learn the ritual.\u201d He knelt next to Murphy, whose eyes widened at the sight of the knife.</p><p>More a dagger really\u2014shiny, j eweled, pretty, if it wasn\u2019t going to be used on you. \u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, my dear, you said you\u2019d do anything.\u201d</p><p>My heart gave a sudden thud and the night turned cold. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you do. You donned the red robe, which symbolizes the blood sacrifice necessary to appease the Petro spirits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chicken or a pig, not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe goat without horns?\u201d Mezareau suggested, using a common reference to a human sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cHow about just a goat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think the raising of the dead is a simple prospect? That it happens just by wishing, without the sacrifice of blood?\u201d</p><p>I guess I hadn\u2019t thought that far. I shook my head, put my hands out as if to stop him, backed up, and bumped into the minions. They shoved me forward and I stumbled, righting myself just as Mezareau raised the knife.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, but he didn\u2019t hear me, or he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>With a lightning-fast movement, Mezareau slashed downward. Black dots danced in front of my eyes.</p><p>What had I done? Given a life for a life? Murphy for Sarah? I\u2019d said I\u2019d do anything, but had I really done this?</p><p>\u201cLucky for you both,\u201d Mezareau murmured, \u201cthis ritual requires only blood and not the soul.\u201d</p><p>The dots parted. Murphy wasn\u2019t dead, just bleeding. Mezareau caught the blood dripping from</p><p>Murphy\u2019s forearm in a shallow wooden bowl.</p><p>Murphy was pale; I felt sick. Mezareau smirked. He was enj oying himself.</p><p>A quick j erk of his head and the guards scooted around me, dragging Murphy away.</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t use your own blood?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cI could, but where\u2019s the fun in that? Besides, Murphy needs to be good for something, or he\u2019s good for nothing.\u201d His cool, light eyes met mine, and I understood the threat. When Murphy ceased to be worthwhile to him, he\u2019d be dead. We needed to get out of here.</p><p>The shadows cast by the moon made the field even more eerie. The place was too quiet\u2014a gathering of ghosts. The tiny shoots dotting the earth looked like fingers reaching for heaven.</p><p>Shivering, I turned away only to meet Mezareau\u2019s eyes, which appeared greener then ever before. \u201cGet on with it,\u201d I said.</p><p>His smile was sly. \u201cMirror my movements; say what I say\u2014exactly.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau set down the bowl of blood and picked up one of water, then he shook his ason.</p><p>I spread my empty hands, and he pointed to a second gourd nearby. I\u2019d never used an ason that was not my own; nevertheless, I picked it up and followed Mezareau\u2019s lead, shaking the gourd as I followed him around the field.</p><p>He sprinkled the water, giving nourishment to the earth. Halfway, he handed the bowl to me. I did as he had, continuing on the same path until we\u2019d closed the circle, the two of us on the inside.</p><p>I had so many questions: Why were we here? Did the ritual have to be performed on newly turned ground? How long did this take? Where was the body?</p><p>But I kept my mouth shut and concentrated on mirroring Mezareau\u2019s every move so I could do this myself when the time came.</p><p>He began to chant in English, surprising me a bit. In Haiti the rituals have always been performed in French and Creole, perhaps a little Latin. However, the language wasn\u2019t as important as the words, the emotions, and the power of the one reciting them.</p><p>\u201cCome back to us now. Come back. Death is not the end. Live again as you once lived. Forget you ever died. Follow me into the world. Come back to us now. Come back.\u201d</p><p>At Mezareau\u2019s urging I repeated the chant as we walked in steadily smaller circles toward the center of the field.</p><p>I didn\u2019t understand how we could raise the dead when they weren\u2019t here. And didn\u2019t we need a name?</p><p>How else would the dead know whom we were calling from the grave?</p><p>\u201cDrink.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau held a cup in each hand; one he extended to me. Where had they come from?</p><p>I hesitated, but when he drained his I had no choice but to do the same. I recognized the flavor\u2014 kleren, raw white rum made in Haiti. A particular favorite of the Gede, it was not a favorite of mine. The stuff tasted like rotten sugar, which was kind of what it was, being made from fermented cane.</p><p>Grimacing, I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand. Mezareau tossed the empty cup over his shoulder; so did I. They bounced with a soft, plastic thud.</p><p>\u201cWhoops.\u201d I giggled. Was I drunk?</p><p>The world spun. The moon seemed to grow larger, come closer, and whisper, Soon. Very soon. You \u2019ll do any thing.</p><p>Mezareau didn\u2019t seem affected. He appeared before me, this time with the bowl of blood.</p><p>His robe parted, revealing the diamond strung around his neck. I guess I wouldn\u2019t leave that lying around, either.</p><p>\u201cOne last thing,\u201d he murmured, and tipped the bowl.</p><p>The air seemed to thicken. Time slowed. The blood fell in a crimson stream toward the earth. The moon glinted off the j ewel at the center of his chest.</p><p>I knew I shouldn\u2019t speak, but I couldn\u2019t seem to help myself. \u201cWhere\u2019s the body?\u201d</p><p>My tongue was heavy; the words came out in a voice that wasn\u2019t my own. I\u2019d been possessed before, by my met tet, but this was different. When Danballah was driving the controls, I spoke in a hiss, not words, a sacred language that had originated in Africa, akin to speaking in tongues, which only the loa could understand.</p><p>Mezareau didn\u2019t answer. In the end, he didn\u2019t have to.</p><p>The blood splashed against the earth, springing up, then plopping down, turning black beneath the full silver light of the moon just before midnight.</p><p>My gaze was drawn to the tiny shoots that looked like fingers sprouting from the ground, and I suddenly understood that the plants didn\u2019t look like fingers.</p><p>They were fingers. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The earth shook.

A hand shot out of the dirt right next to me; a red beaded bracelet encircled the wrist.</p><p>I watched, mesmerized, horrified, as Helen\u2019s face emerged from the dirt. On her other side lay her twin. I guess they\u2019d been punished more severely than I thought.</p> <p>I dragged myself to my feet, glancing around for Mezareau, but he was gone. I stood alone in a graveyard that was spitting up people all around me.</p><p>Concerned they\u2019d start to grab my ankles, or chase me as I ran screaming, I staggered toward the hut.</p><p>However, no one followed. No one was moving. They still looked pretty dead.</p><p>Maybe Mezareau had needed something more to reanimate the corpses. I shoved aside the curtain, caught my feet in the long red robe, and practically pitched headfirst into the room.</p><p>Whatever he\u2019d put into my ram kicked in with a vengeance. Swirling colors appeared at the edge of my vision, along with wispy tendrils like smoke. I heard a whisper behind me, spun around, but nothing was there.</p> <p>My body became coated with a light sheen of sweat. I could hear my own breathing, a labor in my lungs.</p><p>I was both hot and chilled, uncomfortable. I wanted nothing more than to lie down and sleep until this all went away.</p><p>I probably would have, too, except drams began to pulse on the air. I ran outside, but the clearing was empty\u2014except for the bodies.</p><p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d I plunged into the jungle, determined to find out.</p><p>I wandered to and fro, round and round; I couldn\u2019t get a bead on where the sound originated. At times I thought the bone-j arring thuds were merely echoes of my racing heart inside my aching head.</p><p>My skin felt too small for my body. My fingernails itched. My nose burned. Perhaps I had a fever.</p> <p>\u201cMezareau!\u201d I shouted, my voice barely audible above the beat of the drams. \u201cCome and get me!\u201d</p><p>I threw out my arms, spun in a circle, my hands smashing against branches, sending leaves cascading every which way. I began to giggle\u2014definitely drunk, if not dragged\u2014then I caught my toe on something and fell to my knees.</p><p>The growl reverberated from the ground through my palms, making my teeth rattle. Slowly I lifted my head and came face-to-face with a leopard, lips drawn back in a snarl, just like the one on the wall of Mezareau\u2019s hut.</p><p>The wispy smoke swirled across my vision; all of the colors collided. My eyes rolled up; I went down.</p><p>Face-first into the ground as I fainted.</p><p>My dreams were fevered visions of death, blood, and the eyes of a jungle cat. Voices whispered, reciting names I didn\u2019t know, the echoes dying away into a swirling, colored midnight.</p><p>Corpses rose from the earth and marched across the land like an army, destroying everything in their wake.</p><p>Wild animals prowled\u2014wolves, coyotes, lions, tigers, and leopards\u2014all with human eyes. The night came alive with their calls.</p> <p>The moon pulsed behind my closed eyelids to the beat of the drums in my head. I came awake with a sharp gasp into a night gone still and silver. I lay on the ground; the leopard was gone. Instead I saw Sarah. Far away in the jungle, she beckoned me.</p><p>I sprang to my feet and ran, but so did she. The farther I went, the farther away she seemed. Her laughter filled the night; the scent of her skin filled the air; the ache of missing her spurred me onward.</p><p>I was almost close enough to touch her when she turned. One look at me and my little girl screamed, and then she wouldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>Glancing down, I saw that I was a leopard and my fur was covered in blood.</p><p>I awoke next in a hut bathed in moonlight. Naked, my body tangled with that of another. I stiffened, prepared to struggle, but the low, throaty murmur made me pause.</p><p>I knew the scent of his hair, the slide of his skin, the taste of his mouth against mine. \u201cMurphy.\u201d</p><p>I doubted he was any more real than Sarah, but right now I needed a better dream. I clung to him as if my life hung in the balance. My sanity certainly did.</p><p>The room darkened as the moon fell down. Urgency overcame any unease. I needed the darkness, the total night; I wanted to do things to him that weren\u2019t done in the sun.</p><p>As I tangled my fingers in his hair, my knuckles brushed the beads, and my thumbs traced the line of his j aw, the curve of his neck. I pressed him backward until my body sprawled over his. His erection brushed my stomach as I explored with my mouth the soft skin stretched taut over his collarbone.</p><p>With gentle nips of my teeth and swirls of my tongue, I took my time moving downward; the longer this dream continued the better. He quivered with anticipation as I brushed my cheek over his stomach, then drew my thumbnail along the hollow at his hip.</p><p>His penis j erked against my breasts\u2014eager, edgy\u2014and I leaned forward letting my warm, moist breath brush the tip. I put my tongue out slowly, stopping just short of touching him before I leaned back.</p><p>He groaned and I took pity, rubbing my thumb over him, then taking him in my palm and stroking him \u2014at first slowly, gently, then harder, faster, replacing my hand with my mouth, relishing the flavor of strength, the power and the heat.</p><p>Suddenly I flew onto my back, and his body covered mine. He filled me in a single deep thrust. I arched, bowing off the blanket to meet him.</p><p>I wanted him rough, demanding. I couldn\u2019t afford to think of anything but this. He lifted my legs, hooked my knees over his hips, and drove into me, the slap of flesh an enticement, reminding me of the beat of the drums in a far-off jungle.</p><p>I j erked my mind off that memory, forced myself back to this one. Reaching up, I hooked my hand around his neck and drew him downward.</p><p>I wanted to mark him as mine forever. Foolish\u2014he wasn\u2019t a forever kind of guy. But this was my dream and I could do as I wished, so I buried my face in his neck as he buried his body in mine, again and again.</p><p>My teeth scraped the pulsing vein just above his collarbone; I drew his skin between my lips and tasted life, salt, and man. I could hear the rush of his blood, and for just an instant, I wanted to taste that, too.</p><p>He stiffened, stilling inside of me. The release began\u2014his, mine, I wasn\u2019t sure, and it didn\u2019t matter, because suddenly it was both of us.</p><p>Best of all, deep in the thralls of a dream orgasm, I forgot all about the moon and the leopard, but strangely, I still wanted the blood. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>The sun warmed my face. I stretched, surprised at how achy I felt. Last night had been a dilly for dreams.</p><p>I opened my eyes and stared straight into Murphy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cAarck!\u201d I squeaked, and scrambled backward. Realizing I was naked, I yanked the blanket off of him and over me.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou can suck me off until I nearly explode, I can screw you until you scream, but I can\u2019t see you naked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2014that\u2014was a dream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Then what\u2019s this?\u201d He lifted his hair away from his neck to reveal a whopper of a hickey.</p><p>Now that I took inventory of my body, the aches and pains told the tale. I hadn\u2019t dreamed of sleeping with Murphy; I\u2019d actually done it.</p><p>I groaned and covered my face with my hands. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you bummed a condom off a friendly neighborhood villager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe villagers haven\u2019t exactly been neighborly,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least not to me.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head. There were worse things to worry about than waking up in Murphy\u2019s bed. I\u2019d had more than one dream last night, and if this one had been real, then\u2014</p><p>\u201cHow did I get here?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea. After the bloodletting,\u201d he lifted his arm, which sported a disturbingly dirty bandage, \u201cI was a little woozy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lived. Though with Mezareau around, I can\u2019t say how long that condition will continue. I passed out, and next thing I knew you were naked in my arms. Being a guy, I couldn\u2019t complain.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t stop, either, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI half-thought I dreamed you, too, until I woke up.\u201d He rubbed a hand through his hair, and his silver thumb ring flashed gold in the sunlight blaring through the window. \u201cI was pretty out of it.\u201d</p><p>Drugs or blood loss, either way, we\u2019d both been loopy. We\u2019d behaved stupidly, though not completely of our own accord. What I couldn\u2019t understand was why it was suddenly OK for the two of us to inhabit the same hut.</p><p>Catching sight of my backpack in the corner, I pounced on it, thrilled to find my extra pair of clothes.</p><p>Also inside were the remnants of the herbal sleeping draught and my zombie-revealing powder, as well as my knife\u2014why did no one seem to fear sharp and shiny silver around here? However, the salt was suspiciously absent.</p><p>I got dressed, stuffed the zombie-revealing powder into my j eans, never could tell when I might need some, then fastened the knife at my waist. I felt much better in my own clothes, with my favorite weapons. \u201cWhat did Mezareau tell you about me?\u201d Murphy was dressed, too, but he sat hunched in a corner, appearing very un-Murphy-like. Since when did he care what people said?</p><p>\u201cHe said you were a thief, had been for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThe truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought you were a construction worker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d He glanced up. \u201cBut I was a thief\u2014as a kid, after I left home. Sometimes I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>I saw him as he\u2019d once been\u2014young, alone, starving\u2014stealing was understandable. Then. \u201cI was very good at it.\u201d</p><p>He appeared to be good at everything he set his mind to. Lucky me.</p><p>\u201cI could have gone professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to believe that you haven\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been working for a living. Seriously,\u201d he said when I lifted my brows. \u201cLook at my hands.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d felt his hands. He\u2019d definitely been using them on rougher things than me.</p><p>\u201cI came to Haiti and I heard rumors about the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought no one ever got out of this place?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone must have, or there\u2019d be no rumors.\u201d</p><p>Good point.</p><p>\u201cSo instead of leaving when the j ob ended, you stayed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his shoulder. \u201cI figured... one last time. Then I\u2019d never have to worry about money again. I\u2019d never wake up in the night thinking I was back on the street, that someone was going to kill me, or worse. I\u2019d never be so hungry I ached with it. And what\u2019s so bad about stealing from a sorcerer anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStealing\u2019s stealing, Murphy,\u201d I said softly. \u201cYou know that.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his gaze, and his hair shrouded his face.</p><p>I went to the window and glanced outside. The number of villagers appeared to have doubled. They were all milling about, socializing. No one was paying any attention to us.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d I slipped out the door and into the trees. No one raised a hue and cry, even when Murphy followed.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLast night Mezareau showed me how to raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stopped. One glance at his face and I knew he planned to argue with me.</p><p>\u201cJust look, listen, then decide,\u201d I urged.</p><p>He nodded and we continued on until we reached the clearing. I stepped into the field, which seemed to have been rototilled recently, or perhaps just excessively jumbled by the newly arisen dead.</p><p>Nowhere could I see any signs of growth, not a stray finger to be had. I went on my knees where Helen\u2019s body had sprouted forth, pulled out my knife, and started to dig.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou remember when we found this place, it looked as if they\u2019d planted something here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey planted bodies.\u201d</p><p>His j aw clenched, so I quickly told him what had happened. As I spoke I continued to dig, and when I was done, I had a big hole but not a single bone or even a skull.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing here,\u201d Murphy said in a voice that told me he didn\u2019t believe there ever had been.</p><p>\u201cI think we raised them. That would explain the sudden increase in villagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the leopard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Mezareau does run around with that costume on his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas the skin still on the wall when you went into his hut last night?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember. \u201cI was a little dizzy, drunk, drugged\u2014maybe all three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d He stalked across the field and ducked inside the hut. I tensed, expecting an outcry, a gunshot, something. Murphy came back out. \u201cIt\u2019s there now.\u201d</p><p>I followed him, glancing inside, discovering that what he said was true; however, that didn\u2019t mean what I\u2019d seen wasn\u2019t real. Or even that it was.</p><p>\u201cWeird things happen in Haiti,\u201d Murphy murmured.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut raising the dead? That\u2019s a little weird even for here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you stand there and say you don\u2019t believe? Your blood was what raised them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because some psycho cut me open and poured my blood on the ground proves nothing. You need to give up this obsession, Cassandra. Go home. Maybe see someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m crazy?\u201d</p><p>Why did I keep asking that? The answer had always been yes.</p><p>\u201cI think you miss your daughter,\u201d he said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable. But you need to let Sarah rest in peace and move on with your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. Without her there is no life.\u201d</p><p>Something flickered in his eyes. I thought it might have been sorrow, but that was probably just a reflection of my own.</p><p>\u201cMake a new one,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. You never had a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of.\u201d</p><p>How could he be flippant at a time like this? Because he was Devon Murphy\u2014rogue, charmer, thief.</p><p>He\u2019d risked his life and mine for a hunk of rock. He had no right to take the high ground. I doubted he even knew where it was.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve obviously never loved anyone,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cRight you are, and no one\u2019s ever loved me.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between us. He was breathing hard; his hands clenched. So did mine. This was getting us nowhere.</p><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s a chance in a million of having her back, I\u2019ll find it.\u201d I stared at the empty field. \u201cLast night something happened.\u201d</p><p>If only I could remember what.</p><p>\u201cYou were drugged,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cYou imagined everything. People don\u2019t come back from the dead.</p><p>It\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>I was furious now, probably because I was a little bit scared that he was right and if he was, then what would I do?</p><p>I stalked back to the village, leaving Murphy to follow or not; I didn\u2019t care. I had to talk to Mezareau, and since he wasn\u2019t here, he must be there, or I\u2019d find someone who knew where he was.</p><p>I stepped into the common area between the huts and froze at the sight of my handmaidens. They no longer looked dead. Instead they smiled and chattered in the midst of what appeared to be the Haitian version of a block party.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll show you impossible,\u201d I muttered, and reached into the pocket of my j eans for the zombie powder.</p><p>I dumped what was left into my palm, creating a tiny hill. Too much, really, but I was in a hurry.</p><p>I headed toward the crowd, but before I reached them, the wind whipped in from nowhere, lifting the particles into the air. Like a cartoon cloud, they expanded, flying into the face of every villager milling in the vicinity.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what I expected. Most likely the nothing that had happened every other time I\u2019d used the stuff. If my powder had been of any worth, why had Mezareau allowed me to keep it?</p><p>What I hadn\u2019t planned on was two dozen people screaming in agony as they melted like the Wicked Witch of the West.</p><p>Their flesh pulled away from their bones as then-eyes lost all signs of life. Fingernails lengthened, hair, too. The wounds that had killed them reappeared. I had never seen anything like it, nor did I ever want to again.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat I can\u2019t explain.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s thunderous voice made both Murphy and me jump, then glance up from the pile of flesh and bones at our feet.</p><p>The bokor didn\u2019t appear happy. Several villagers who hadn\u2019t been in the village before now cowered at the edge of the trees as if they planned to run should I produce more powder. Too bad I was all out.</p> <p>Mezareau stalked toward us. When Murphy stepped in front of me Mezareau backhanded him so hard he was lifted off his feet and flung across the yard.</p><p>My eyes widened. That kind of strength wasn\u2019t quite human.</p><p>Mezareau grabbed me by the throat. Without thinking, I ground my palm against his cheek, leaving the remnants of the powder stuck to his skin. The only reaction was a tightening of his fingers until I saw stars.</p><p>I grabbed my knife, but he shook me like a dog with a rope, and the weapon flew from my hand. I probably didn\u2019t need it. The way he was behaving, silver wasn\u2019t going to kill him, either. And wasn\u2019t that a cheery thought?</p><p>One more brain-j arring shake, and he dropped me to the ground. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>I managed to stay on my feet, barely. A quick glance at Murphy revealed he was unconscious, but I swore I saw him breathing.</p><p>\u201cZombie-revealing powder,\u201d I answered, voice hoarse and wispy.</p><p>\u201cI tested your powder.\u201d He sniffed. \u201cHarmless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell it to your friends.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat is the formula?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLittle of this, a lot of that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAny salt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it cannot work.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s what I\u2019d thought. Until today.</p><p>Of course, until today, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d tried it on an actual zombie.</p><p>Mezareau stared at me with an expression of dawning understanding. \u201cIt is not the ingredients that provide the power, but the one who combined them. You are far stronger than I realized.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my throat reflectively. \u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau threw out his arms to indicate the village, the trees, the land. \u201cThis place is special. That is why I chose it. The longer you are here, the more potent you will become.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSounds like bullshit to me,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>He\u2019d managed to sit up. One eye was already swollen shut. He looked more like a pirate than ever.</p><p>Mezareau turned his gaze\u2014hazel in the early-morning light\u2014toward Murphy. The expression reminded me of wild cats I\u2019d seen on Animal Planet\u2014right after they discovered delectable prey.</p><p>\u201cYou would be the best judge of bullshit, would you not, monsieur?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot that right,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>The two of them stared at each other like two beasts over a single bone. If they fought, I knew who\u2019d win\u2014and who\u2019d die.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem with salt and zombies?\u201d I blurted.</p><p>The staring continued for several more ticks of the clock before Mezareau glanced away. \u201cThey are mutually exclusive,\u201d he said. \u201cA zombie cannot exist if touched by salt; salt cannot exist within a zombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, within?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is amazing how much salt is contained in the human body. However, to be raised from the dead, there can be none within. Therefore, the body must be purified\u2014either by years in the grave or through fasting before death.\u201d He glanced at Murphy. \u201cThe priestess discovered you before we could complete your purification, so there could be no transformation under this full moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were going to make Murphy a zombie?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Murphy mocked. \u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>I guess he was feeling better.</p><p>\u201cYou have qualities I admire,\u201d Mezareau said. \u201cStrength, agility, devotion to a goal, even if it is money.</p><p>Besides, once you were dead, you\u2019d stop trying to steal my diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Murphy\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t count on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you\u2019re a zombie, you\u2019ll do anything I ask.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZombies are slaves, Priestess. Even centuries cannot change that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered. \u201cThey\u2019re human again. As if they\u2019d never been dead at all.\u201d</p><p>He smiled indulgently. \u201cYes and no. My zombies appear human. However, they do not die like normal humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll it takes is a little salt,\u201d Murphy sneered.</p><p>Mezareau and I ignored him.</p><p>Not dying was a good thing, wasn\u2019t it? I didn\u2019t want Sarah to ever die again. All I had to do was keep her out of the ocean. That shouldn\u2019t be hard. We\u2019d just move to Topeka.</p><p>Despite my rationalization, these revelations were making me uneasy.</p><p>\u201cYou said the people of the village could leave whenever they wanted to.\u201d</p><p>Murphy gave a snort of derision. Mezareau cast him a narrow glare before returning his attention to me.</p><p>\u201cI may have stretched the truth a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce they are raised, they do not want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo zombies have to be slaves?\u201d I pressed. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you release them from bondage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not know.\u201d Mezareau\u2019s forehead creased. \u201cI\u2019ve never tried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you plan on zombifying me?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cDeath becomes life.\u201d Mezareau spread his hands. \u201cThe ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would have been easily remedied once you were purified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re killing people in order to raise them?\u201d My voice rose higher and higher with every word.</p><p>\u201cHow else would I be able to populate my army with the worthy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA zombie army.\u201d Murphy gained his feet and only wobbled a little as he returned to my side. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy ancestors ruled here once. I plan to rule again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen was this?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe island was called Saint-Domingue. The French were in control. My great-great-many-times- great-grandfather was the governor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he had a mistress.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau dipped his chin. \u201cThe mulatto elite were society\u2019s darlings. He would have married her if he could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d I said. What I thought was, Yeah right.</p><p>\u201cBut he was killed in one of the revolts and ever since there has been chaos. I will turn that around when I reclaim my rightful place on the throne.\u201d</p><p>Murphy and I exchanged glances. Throne?</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to... ?\u201d I let my voice trail off encouragingly.</p><p>\u201cTake over the country. It won\u2019t be hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with an army of people who can\u2019t be killed,\u201d Murphy said.</p><p>We looked down at the pile of flesh and bones. Except by me.</p><p>Murphy inched in front of me. \u201cI won\u2019t let you kill her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would I?\u201d Mezareau asked. \u201cShe\u2019s the most powerful voodoo priestess I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re confusing me with someone else,\u201d I protested. \u201cI\u2019m new at this.\u201d</p><p>Except I was kind of good at it, and I seemed to be getting better with each passing day. I had to wonder if Mezareau\u2019s claims that his village was \u201cspecial\u201d were true. Maybe that was how he\u2019d become freakishly strong in both a physical and a metaphysical sense.</p><p>The bokor contemplated me with continued amusement. \u201cI\u2019ve never known anyone who didn\u2019t run screaming when I sent the dead, let alone dispersed them. How did you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI called on Aida-Wedo.\u201d</p><p>His brows lifted. \u201cThe loas always come when you call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they should, but that doesn\u2019t always mean that they will.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t realized I\u2019d been doing something extraordinary; I\u2019d only been doing what I\u2019d been taught.</p><p>\u201cYou are the one I\u2019ve been waiting for,\u201d Mezareau continued. \u201cI asked the Lord of Death to send me a powerful partner. I can\u2019t create the army all alone.\u201d He frowned. \u201cEspecially now that you\u2019ve disintegrated an entire month\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d called on the Lord of Death\u2014Baron Samedi, gatekeeper to the otherworld and overseer of zombies. I guess when Mezareau sent the dead I should have known he had an in with Samedi. But there was something about the revelation that bothered me. I just couldn\u2019t put my finger on what it was.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll only kill more of your zombies,\u201d Murphy pointed out.</p><p>\u201cKeep it up,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll convince him yet that he\u2019s better off killing me.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau laughed. \u201cShe won\u2019t be able to make any more of her powder here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d I demanded, then had to refrain from smacking myself in the head. I wasn\u2019t any better than Murphy.</p><p>\u201cBecause if you try anything of the kind, I\u2019ll kill your lover, then embalm him with salt so he can never rise again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not my lover,\u201d I felt compelled to explain. There hadn\u2019t been any love involved.</p><p>Murphy shot me a glance that seemed kind of hurt. What was up with that?</p><p>For that matter, what was up with my racing heart and my extreme unease at the idea of loving another man? I wasn\u2019t going to, and that was that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still certain you wouldn\u2019t want his blood on your hands. And it will be on your hands, Priestess.</p><p>Literally.\u201d</p><p>I flinched, which caused Mezareau to smirk. \u201cExcellent. You will be my guests until I have what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s smirk widened. \u201cThen we shall see.\u201d</p><p>Murphy and I were dumped back into his hut.</p><p>\u201cAmuse yourselves, children,\u201d Mezareau said, and tossed me my knife.</p><p>I stared at the weapon, which had once struck fear into monsters of the night. Mezareau seemed to have no fear of anything, which scared the crap out of me.</p><p>I tossed the knife into my backpack. \u201cHow come it\u2019s all right for us to stay together now? Sudden change of heart on the premarital sex issue?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could care less who you fuck, Priestess. I only wanted you separated so I could kill him.\u201d</p><p>Ask a stupid question...</p><p>\u201cWhy was I told Murphy didn\u2019t exist? Did you actually think I\u2019d believe that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy villagers live only in this new world we\u2019ve created. Once someone leaves their world, they no longer believe the person exists.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. That would explain why Helen didn\u2019t remember crazy nose-eating zombie man, even though he had to have been in the village at one time or another. This place was downright bizarre, and so were all the people in it. Like that was news.</p><p>Mezareau signaled and two guards appeared. \u201cKeep them inside,\u201d he ordered, \u201cor I will feed you a bowl full of salt.\u201d</p><p>The two men took up positions on either side of the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get out of here,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo shit.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at Murphy. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know\u2014maybe I just saw people become corpses right in front of my eyes. Maybe I had a little Frenchman toss me across the yard, then tell me he was going to kill me and make me into a zombie so I could j oin his bloody zombie army.\u201d</p><p>Murphy hadn\u2019t resorted to an accent for quite a while. I guess his whole world had changed; I should really cut him some slack.</p><p>\u201cAt least you don\u2019t think I\u2019m crazy anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends. Are you still planning to raise your daughter from the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I be? You saw them. We had no idea that most of this village was the risen dead. They were alive again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t feed them salt or throw voodoo powder in their faces!\u201d</p><p>Murphy\u2019s voice was different; so were his eyes, the expression on his face. He seemed to have aged.</p><p>I suppose being starved, threatened, and involuntarily giving blood for a zombie-raising ceremony could do that to a guy, especially a guy like him who\u2019d spent his life on the good-time trail. This trip, this place, my problems, had to make him want to run for the hills, or at least the waterfall.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you got caught up in this, Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you did.\u201d</p><p>His sigh was impatient. \u201cYou got what you came for; now it\u2019s time to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>He stalked to the far side of the hut, where he shoved against the corner posts. I followed, hunkering down next to him when he began testing the base of the wall for a weakness.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides the crazy guy who\u2019s threatening to kill me?\u201d</p><p>He straightened and so did I. After a quick glance at the door, where the guards continued to stare in the other direction, he turned, shielding me with his body. \u201cBecause I think he probably will kill me if he finds this.\u201d</p><p>Murphy reached into his cargo pants and withdrew Mezareau\u2019s diamond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>I cursed and grabbed the stone, shoving it down the front of my pants. He tried to go in after it, and I slapped his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>The commotion caused the guards to glance inside. All they saw was Murphy trying to get in my pants.</p><p>Grinning, they turned around again.</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d I whispered furiously.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think?\u201d</p><p>I tried to recall when he\u2019d been anywhere near the diamond.</p><p>Aha! Earlier that morning he\u2019d ducked into Mezareau\u2019s hut to check on the leopard skin.</p><p>\u201cMezareau just leaves it lying around?\u201d I asked. \u201cWith you on the loose?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d His expression was sheepish. \u201cI have some experience unlocking things.\u201d Murphy cracked his knuckles.</p><p>Of course he did.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to stealing is stealing no matter who you steal from?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou said that, not me. I didn\u2019t come all this way\u2014get kidnapped, drugged, donate blood, and become next on a bokor \u2019s hit list\u2014to walk away empty-handed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you plan on telling me about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just did. Now give that back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound like my mother.\u201d He made a face. \u201cCall me Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I didn\u2019t want him remembering his mother when he looked at me, either.</p><p>Murphy glanced at the door. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should keep it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you should? He\u2019ll kill you, but he won\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until he\u2019s got his army anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMezareau\u2019s going to notice his diamond is gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to be here when that happens; do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Have any ideas on how we get out of here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a one. Even if we can sneak past the guards, half a zombie army, and Mezareau, we\u2019re going to have waterfall issues.\u201d He paused, considering. \u201cYou don\u2019t know any spells that would make them all go away? Or even better, one that might transport us back to Port-au-Prince?\u201d He snapped his fingers.</p><p>\u201cPoof?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuddenly you believe in spells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter this morning, it seems foolish not to. So, you know any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoodoo is about religion, not magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurning those zombies to dust seemed like magic to me. Hell, them being alive in the first place is so against any religion I\u2019ve ever heard of it has to be something outside of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>My prattle about religion and magic just wasn\u2019t holding up. As Mezareau had said, the longer I was here, the more magic happened. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a result of me or the jungle, perhaps both. Either way, I was getting kind of scared of my power. Though if things got nasty, my power might be all that stood between Murphy and me and eternity.</p><p>The day passed with agonizing slowness. We sat and stared at each other, the wall, the floor, out the window. Our meals were brought to us. We were allowed to use the facilities\u2014such that they were\u2014 one at a time. When darkness fell, I was no closer to a plan of escape than I\u2019d been when the sun shone.</p><p>I fell asleep, and when I awoke the soft glow of a candle illuminated the hut. Murphy sat on the ground, shirtless, his skin gleaming in the heat and the murky light. I\u2019d have been captivated by the sight, if he hadn\u2019t gone through my backpack and laid out every one of my things in a tidy row.</p><p>I sat up and he glanced at me. \u201cSorry. I just\u2014\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cAll we\u2019ve got is this. I was trying to figure out how we could use it.\u201d He picked up the knife. \u201cNever thought I\u2019d see the day when sharp steel was worthless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>Murphy turned the blade, and the flames of the candle sparked off the polished surface. \u201cFancy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractical. Until recently, silver killed just about anything.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019ve used this to kill things?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019m not that kind of J\u00e4ger-Sucher.\u201d</p><p>I could tell he wanted to roll his eyes and say something derisive, but he couldn\u2019t anymore. \u201cWhat kind are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot much of one, really. I know voodoo, and since the latest werewolf problem involved a voodoo curse, I was asked to help. Most of the J\u00e4ger-Suchers are fighters.\u201d I took a breath. \u201cHonestly, they\u2019re killers. They stop at nothing to get the j ob done, because they know if they don\u2019t, people will die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about them,\u201d Murphy urged.</p><p>I hesitated. The J\u00e4ger-Suchers were supposed to be a secret, but since I had my doubts Murphy and I would get out of here alive\u2014and really, what else did we have to do?\u2014I told him.</p><p>\u201cThe J\u00e4ger-Suchers are a monster-hunting society run by Edward Mandenauer. He was a spy in WW</p><p>II, sent to discover what Hitler was up to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was up to a lot,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>\u201cMore than anyone ever knew. Hitler was fascinated with wolves and werewolves. Maybe because Adolf means \u2018Noble Wolf\u2019\u2014who knows? He chose the title f \u00fchrer because it refers to the leader of a pack of hunting wolves. He even sanctioned a secret terrorist organization known as the werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear the end of the war, when things began to go badly for Germany, recruits were taken from the Hitler Youth, the SS, the army, civilians. In the way of a werewolf they would appear to be normal citizens in the daylight, but at night they were charged to wreak death and destruction on their enemy by any means possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they were really werewolves?\u201d</p><p>Huh. I hadn\u2019t thought of that.</p><p>\u201cEdward never said. I\u2019m not sure if he knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your boss discover about Hitler?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you heard of Josef Mengele?\u201d At Murphy\u2019s blank expression I elaborated. \u201cThe doctor who performed medical experiments on the Jews, the Gypsies, and\u2014well, pretty much anyone he wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNutcake,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>\u201cTimes ten. Hitler ordered Mengele to make a werewolf army, so he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little bit of this, a whole lot of that. No one\u2019s really certain, since Herr Doktor destroyed all the records.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t destroy the werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Those he released. They\u2019ve been multiplying ever since. Along with a lot of other things he devised in his secret lab in the Black Forest. Edward was supposed to eliminate the monsters, but he got there too late. He\u2019s been trying to make up for that ever since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all sounds crazy. Until you see a zombie disintegrate before your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry watching a man turn into a wolf and back again. It isn\u2019t pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine.\u201d His lips tightened. \u201cOr maybe I can\u2019t. What other things did Mengele release?\u201d</p><p>I thought of Edward\u2019s answer when I\u2019d asked the very same question.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s deal with one monster at a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I don\u2019t. The werewolves and the zombies have kept me well occupied.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Mandenauer was a spy in WW II he must be pretty old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s also,\u201d I tried to think of a word to describe Edward, \u201cscary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to be eighty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can still fire a gun.\u201d And he did so with great regularity. \u201cHe runs the J\u00e4ger-Suchers\u2014all divisions\u2014though his granddaughter helps. They also have a lab\u2014\u201d</p><p>I stopped short of mentioning the location, which was supposed to be a J- S-only secret. Although someone had blown the place to smithereens not too long ago, so it couldn\u2019t be that big of a secret.</p><p>The one they\u2019d built since was supposedly impenetrable, a word that always made me nervous.</p><p>\u201cIn this lab they concoct monsters of their own?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Or at least I didn\u2019t think so. \u201cThey try to find cures to the various mutations. Elise, that\u2019s</p><p>Edward\u2019s granddaughter, is a virologist. She\u2019s working on a cure for the lycanthropy virus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLycanthropy is like a cold?\u201d He tilted his head. \u201cOn steroids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a way. The curse is passed through the saliva when a victim is bitten, causing changes in the DNA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t viruses hard, if not impossible, to cure because they\u2019re constantly changing and evolving?\u201d</p><p>The lycanthropy virus had changed all right. Mostly because the werewolves had begun to combine their power with magic in an attempt to rule the world.</p><p>What is it with ruling the world? Every crazy person wants to.</p><p>So far the J\u00e4ger-Suchers had thwarted every attempt. But sooner or later...</p><p>\u201cViruses are tricky,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd lycanthropy even more so. But Elise is pretty tricky herself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you end up involved with the J\u00e4ger-Suchers?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cThere was a loup-garou in New Orleans,\u201d I said. \u201cThat\u2019s werewolf in French.\u201d</p><p>\u201d I know,\u201d he said wryly. \u201cMy French is pretty good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. The loup-garou was created by a voodoo queen around the time of the Civil War.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the thing\u2019s still running around the city making more werewolves?\u201d He scowled. \u201cRemind me not to visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri was captured; then Elise took him back to the lab. Edward sent me here to learn what I could about the curse.\u201d</p><p>Murphy frowned. \u201cI thought you came here to learn how to raise your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConveniently, what I wanted to know and what they wanted to know coincided. From all I\u2019ve been able to discover, we need to raise the voodoo queen who placed the curse and have her remove it.\u201d</p><p>Murphy turned the knife over in his hands again. \u201cWhy does that not surprise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it makes sense?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn an alternate universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe universe isn\u2019t what you thought.\u201d I touched his arm. \u201cWhich takes some getting used to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long did it take you?\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m still not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s a relief,\u201d he murmured, and kissed me.</p><p>His French was really good.</p><p>I don\u2019t know what it was about this man, but every time he touched me, my mind went blank and my body went wild. I didn\u2019t care who he was or what he\u2019d done, as long as he did me.</p><p>Maybe I wasn\u2019t so much reacting to Murphy as this place, our isolation\u2014we only had each other to depend on; that created a bond\u2014and the very real possibility we wouldn\u2019t live to see the other side of the waterfall.</p><p>However, even before we were trapped here, I\u2019d wanted him. Before I\u2019d known anything about him beyond his talent for accents and an intense desire for money, I\u2019d fantasized about the shape of his mouth and the taste of his skin. How could I not when he was so damn beautiful?</p><p>Now, knowing what I did about his past, having trusted him with my life and him trusting me with his, having shared more with him than I\u2019d shared with anyone for a long time, I\u2019d become attached. Despite the deceptions\u2014both his and my own\u2014I wanted to share an embrace, perhaps more. If we could only get rid of the guards outside the door.</p><p>I tore my mouth from Murphy\u2019s. He yanked me right back, began to press his lips to my j aw, then my neck, murmuring my name.</p><p>\u201cMurphy. I\u2019ve got an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. It kind of goes like this.\u201d His palm covered my breast and his thumb caressed my nipple. My body, needy, treacherous as always, responded, the nipple hardening, my head falling back to give him better access to everything.</p><p>My gaze went to the door, where the guards were indeed watching. \u201cWe aren\u2019t alone,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He lifted his head, but I tugged it back, shoving his nose into my cleavage. \u201cMmmph,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cPretend you\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to pretend.\u201d His teeth scraped the swell of one breast; his fingers traced beneath my shirt and across my rib cage.</p><p>\u201cListen to me.\u201d I nuzzled his hair, put my lips next to his ear, and licked the lobe, tangling the tip of my tongue in his earring, making him shudder. \u201cI have an idea of how we can get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>I groaned, and he took the sound as encouragement, dragging me into his lap. The diamond scraped my stomach; something else poked my backside.</p><p>\u201cGet a grip, Murphy.\u201d I shoved my hands into his hair and gave a sharp tug.</p><p>His head lifted, and I pressed our mouths together before he could say anything damning. I meant to give him a quick peck, but when his tongue slipped between my lips, I lost track of my thoughts.</p><p>Several moments passed before I found them again and pulled back just enough to whisper, \u201cI\u2019ve got some of the sleeping powder left.\u201d</p><p>His brow creased. \u201cYou want to put me to sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guards.\u201d</p><p>I waited for the blood to flow out of his cock and back into his head. His frown deepened the instant he understood. \u201cHow are you going to convince them to take it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten that far.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce we make it past them there are still a few more zombies, not to mention Mezareau. Will the powder work on zombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could do with a lot more powder,\u201d Murphy murmured.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d I stroked his shoulder, rubbed my breasts against his chest.</p><p>\u201cYou keep that up, waiting isn\u2019t going to be an option.\u201d</p><p>I ignored him. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to multiply an effect to every like being.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLost me again.\u201d He nibbled at my collarbone. From the brush of his erection against my hip, he didn\u2019t appear to have lost anything at all.</p><p>I grasped his wrist before it could creep up my shirt. There was throwing off the guards and there was just copping a feel.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say a woman came to me for a love charm, but she wanted all the men to love her. By combining this spell with a single love charm on a single man\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll men would adore her,\u201d Murphy finished. \u201cSounds like a handy spell to know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>\u201cWhat do you have to do?\u201d Murphy whispered.</p><p>\u201cI repeat an incantation while the charm, powder, whatever, is being administered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen poof, it works on everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheoretically.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d learned the spell while in training, but I\u2019d never actually used it. According to my teacher, only a practitioner of incredible power could make the magic work.</p><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true,\u201d Murphy said, \u201cthen we\u2019ll fall asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d He shifted, uncomfortable on the hard ground. \u201cWhat if it puts only the male zombies to sleep?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just have to hope it works on all zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich would leave the bokor wide awake.\u201d</p><p>At least Murphy had remembered not to say the man\u2019s name. He was catching on to how things operated around here.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to come to the village much\u2014especially at night. Stays in his hut, lord of the manor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo maybe he won\u2019t know we\u2019ve escaped until breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy then we should be long gone,\u201d I agreed.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can get past the waterfall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne problem at a time.\u201d I rubbed my forehead against his. \u201cHow are we going to get the powder in a guard\u2019s mouth?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean how am I going to do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say the incantation instead.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his head just enough so I could see the glitter of his eyes by candlelight. \u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might. So how will you do it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJump on his back and shove some right in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he smacks you across the island and you land on your head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I can avoid getting my ass kicked by a single zombie long enough for you to say a few words.</p><p>Unless we\u2019re talking a sonnet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of lines. We\u2019ll need to separate the two of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to take a leak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d My voice rose in exasperation. He lifted a brow. \u201cOh. I get it. But how will I know when to start?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCount to one hundred, then begin.\u201d</p><p>The plan was so simple; it had to work.</p><p>Or fail abysmally.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d Murphy stood, and swept the bag of sleeping powder into his hand. He didn\u2019t wait for me to answer, just headed for the door.</p><p>\u201cBuddy.\u201d He tapped the smaller of the two guards on the shoulder. \u201cGotta drain the snake.\u201d</p><p>The man obviously knew what he meant, or maybe he just got the idea from Murphy\u2019s lewd hand gesture. Murphy glanced back and mouthed, One, two.</p><p>I began to count silently to myself as I packed. Turning away from the guard, who wasn\u2019t watching anyway, I tugged the diamond from my pants and tossed it inside, too, then set the bag by the door.</p><p>By the time I reached ninety-eight, cold sweat dribbled down my back. If this didn\u2019t work, Murphy and I were stuck here, and I doubted Edward was going to be able to get us out before I ended up Mezareau\u2019s zombie-making partner and Murphy became a zombie.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred,\u201d I murmured. \u201cHear me, Simbi, master magician.\u201d</p><p>Simbi, the overseer of white magic, was invoked in the making of charms. He was the patron loa of all freshwater, his symbol the green snake. Simbi and I got along great.</p><p>The guard turned when I spoke. I wished I could have said the words silently, but a spell like this must be spoken aloud.</p><p>\u201cGrant me the power!\u201d</p><p>A tingling began in my hands, spreading across my skin. Both hot and cold, kind of electric, a surge of strength and energy. My hair stirred in a nonexistent breeze, and the hut seemed to glow with more light than there should be from one tiny candle and a just past full moon.</p><p>Thunder rumbled. Simbi\u2019s voice. He had heard me, and he\u2019d answered.</p><p>The guard had started walking in my direction, but now he began to back up. He sensed it, too. The night belonged to me now, and there was nothing he could do about it. I stepped toward him, and he ran.</p><p>Outside thunder still rumbled; the air smelled like sulfur, but the sky was as clear as a pure blue lake. Not a hint of rain.</p><p>\u201cLend strength to my magic,\u201d I continued, as I followed the guard. \u201cSend it to all of a kind.\u201d</p><p>He crashed face-first into the ground like a tree felled by lightning. I skirted his unmoving body. \u201cThat had to hurt.\u201d</p><p>Murphy was on the ground, too, and for a second I feared he was asleep\u2014like the guard snoring nearby</p><p>\u2014if not dead, which, come to think of it, was also like the guard snoring nearby. But Murphy lifted his head, struggling to get up, and I hurried to help him.</p><p>The strange crackling energy I\u2019d experienced in the hut had disappeared the instant I\u2019d finished the incantation. I\u2019d called on Simbi before in the making of charms. The most that had ever happened was a little bit of thunder.</p><p>Though the ease with which I\u2019d performed this difficult spell and the surge of power that had come with it made me nervous, I was also intrigued. What more could I do?</p><p>I reached Murphy, and my gaze searched his face for bruises. At least there weren\u2019t any new ones.</p><p>Though his black eye looked painful, at least he could see out of it now. The one I\u2019d received from the crazy zombie man had faded fairly quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He shook his head, and his beads clacked. \u201cHe fell like a ton of bricks, and I flew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t hit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wanted to, but he didn\u2019t have the time before he went nighty-night. Since you\u2019re here, sans guard, I\u2019ll assume the spell worked.\u201d</p><p>I put my arm up and pantomimed falling, then hitting, hard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re something else, Cassandra.\u201d He stared into my eyes, seemed about to say more, then just grabbed my hand. \u201cLet\u2019s make some time.\u201d</p><p>My stomach did a flip. \u201cMy bag. I left it at the hut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy papers\u2014,\u201d I began.</p><p>\u201cOne second. Stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I can better.\u201d</p><p>Since I knew he was right, I quit arguing. The trip took him more than a second and it seemed like an hour. Waiting alone in the shadowy jungle, I started to hear all sorts of weird things.</p><p>Rustles, grumbles, growls\u2014maybe the last was my stomach. At any rate, when Murphy burst through the trees, I let out a startled shriek, and he winced. \u201cShh! You want to wake the dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they all asleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anyone milling about like they usually do all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we check?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d He tugged me away from the village in the direction of the cave. \u201cWe\u2019re still out of here as fast as our happy feet can carry us.\u201d</p><p>I kept waiting for a hue and cry, but none came. I still had the feeling we were being followed. From the way Murphy kept glancing over his shoulder, he thought so, too.</p><p>\u201cAlmost there,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Then all hell broke loose.</p><p>Shadows flew out of the night, screeching so loudly I could do nothing but cover my ears. At first I thought the zombies had found us and they were pissed, but the shades that separated from the trees had the forms of animals, not people.</p><p>A cat, a dog, a pig, then a few birds swooped low, brushing the tops of our heads, before flying away. If Mezareau controlled the beasts, that could be a problem, even though, according to everyone, there weren\u2019t any large, vicious animals on the island.</p><p>Of course such rules didn\u2019t hold since I\u2019d met Edward. Usually where there wasn\u2019t supposed to be something was exactly where it was found.</p><p>The greenery rustled and I tensed, expecting that large, furry, vicious creature to burst forth. Instead a misshapen dwarf and a twisted troll j oined the others, and I understood what they were.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s sent the baka.\u201d</p><p>Murphy eyed the troll with distaste. \u201cDon\u2019t sound so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook mighty real to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baka are evil spirits that roam the night; they can steal your life if you let them, maybe drive you insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo even if they aren\u2019t real, they\u2019re still pretty dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least we didn\u2019t drop dead at the mere sight of them.\u201d I glanced at him and shrugged. \u201cIt could happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we get rid of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey grow stronger on fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrific,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>The circle of demons stepped closer. Their eyes began to glow. \u201cStare them straight in the eye,\u201d I said,</p><p>\u201cand they\u2019ll disappear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure they will,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThat always works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it,\u201d I said between gritted teeth.</p><p>Though the glowing eyes were hard to meet, I focused on the troll creeping up on me from the right. I thought of Sarah and what would happen if I didn\u2019t get out of here. Any fear of the thing Mezareau had sent evaporated; the demon went p oof .</p><p>The others advanced. One of the damn birds smacked into my head. Murphy was right. The thing felt pretty real.</p><p>I glanced up, furious, not frightened, and p oof , poof, poof\u2014the birds were gone. When I lowered my gaze, Murphy and I were alone again.</p><p>\u201cThat was... weird.\u201d Murphy\u2019s eyes were bright; he could hardly stand still. Jazzed. I could understand the feeling. Thwarting evil spirits really got the juices going.</p><p>He kissed me, and I could swear his lips sizzled, like we\u2019d both been struck by lighting. As he lifted his head, his forehead creased. \u201cI thought your eyes were blue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh. In this light they look aqua.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my aqua eyes. \u201cNo time for that now. Let\u2019s get out of here before he sends the diab.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know I\u2019m going to be sorry I asked,\u201d Murphy hurried along at my side, \u201cbut what\u2019s the diab?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWild spirits. They resemble gargoyles, except for the protruding red tongues. The only way to get rid of them is with a knife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich we conveniently have, and you seem pretty good with the thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. Except I\u2019d have to use the knife on us.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stumbled, then righted himself. \u201cUs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to get rid of the diab is to carve a gad in the upper arm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is a gad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA guard. The symbols, or tattoo, invoke the has to keep us safe.\u201d I frowned. \u201cThough I\u2019m not sure if it will work without the sacrifice of a rooster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not find out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be my vote.\u201d</p><p>We continued on for what seemed like a very long time.</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t walking this long when we went to the village,\u201d Murphy grumbled.</p><p>\u201cWe have to be getting close to the cave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless it disappeared, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bokor said the waterfall would be right where I wished it to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said a lot of things, Cassandra. I doubt any of them were true.\u201d</p><p>My lips tightened. I had to believe that what Mezareau had told me about raising the dead was real. If it wasn\u2019t, I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d do.</p><p>Murphy put his arm around my shoulders. How had he known I\u2019d needed a little comfort? Maybe he\u2019d just needed some, too.</p><p>I supped my arm around his waist and we continued to walk hip to hip.</p><p>\u201cYou still expecting gargoyles to show up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019ll protect you.\u201d</p><p>Our gazes met. \u201cDitto,\u201d he said, and I got all warm in places I shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>What was it about this guy that kept turning me on? His penis? A lot of guys had them. Since Karl, I hadn\u2019t been interested in a one.</p><p>If we got out of here, I\u2019d probably never see Devon Murphy again. And that was OK. Without the constant threat to life and limb, I probably wouldn\u2019t want to.</p><p>Murphy stopped walking, and his arm slid from my shoulders. I glanced up and my hand fell back to my side.</p><p>We\u2019d found the cave.</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t waste a minute before tugging me into the cool, misty gloom. He no longer seemed to care about enclosed, dark spaces. Amazing what a sorcerer with a little zombie army can cure.</p><p>When we\u2019d traveled in the opposite direction, we hadn\u2019t been able to see two inches in front of our faces, and that had been in the daytime. In the middle of the night, the silvery glow of the almost full moon didn\u2019t penetrate the cave for more than a few yards.</p><p>Murphy kept one hand in mine and one on the wall. We moved at a pretty good clip. I only hoped we didn\u2019t move right into a dead end.</p><p>I strained my ears for a hint of falling water. All I detected was the rattle of pebbles.</p><p>From behind us.</p><p>I tried not to panic. The sound could be anything. Or a lot of things. None of which I wanted to know about.</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t appear to notice, or maybe he just realized we had no choice but to move forward. Unless we wanted to face the unknown scary thing that might or might not be following us in the dark.</p><p>Suddenly he stopped, and I bumped into him, crunching my nose against his back. \u201cHear that?\u201d he breathed.</p><p>I listened, half-afraid there\u2019d be a snarl, right behind us. Instead I caught the lap of water against a shore.</p><p>I could even smell it.</p><p>We rounded a corner, hustled down a long corridor, and turned the opposite way. Murphy let go of my hand and struck a match, illuminating the cavern and the pond. We were still sans waterfall. Mezareau appeared to be a big fat liar.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re fucked,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>The flicker of the flame threw shadows across his face, highlighting his cheekbones, making him appear both older and younger than he was.</p><p>A sweet water-scented brush of a breeze swirled past. The match went out, and in the complete darkness footsteps echoed loudly in the corridor. They made me stop wondering how the breeze had swirled in from a wall.</p><p>I took off my backpack, pulled out both my knife and a ruined T-shirt. I shoved the latter into Murphy\u2019s hand. \u201cLight this.\u201d</p><p>Stones scattered in the darkness, closer now, and I tensed. Murphy struck another match and touched it to the shirt, then dropped the flaming material between us and the gaping black maw of the cave.</p><p>\u201cGive me the knife,\u201d Murphy whispered.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen? After he\u2019s turned us into zombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let him.\u201d I was the only chance that Sarah had.</p><p>\u201cI wish I had my rifle.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau had returned my things, but not Murphy\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d I said. \u201cBut since we don\u2019t...\u201d I moved nearer to the opening.</p><p>A growl drifted down the corridor, followed by the distinct shuffle of a shoe against dirt.</p><p>I glanced at Murphy, who appeared as puzzled as I was. The growl was inhuman; shoes, not so much.</p><p>My gaze returned to the black hole. Eyes shone, coming closer and closer, bobbing much lower than they should have been if Mezareau were walking upright.</p><p>I tightened my grip on the knife as the outline wavered in the light of the flames. Man? Beast? I had no idea.</p><p>A snarl erupted, so loud it seemed to ricochet off the walls. I forced myself to meet the disembodied eyes.</p><p>Help , I thought; what I said was, \u201cI am not afraid.\u201d</p><p>If Mezareau was sending bigger and better baka, the creature should have disappeared. Instead it shot forward, and I threw the knife.</p><p>The weapon struck with a thunk. An unearthly shriek erupted, and Jacques Mezareau fell out of the darkness, my silver knife embedded in his heart. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>As soon as Mezareau hit the ground, the thunder of falling water filled the cavern. I could do nothing but stare dumbly at the waterfall that had appeared in place of the rock face. Mezareau must have used some sort of shielding spell, which disappeared when he became unconscious\u2014or worse.</p><p>\u201cNice shot,\u201d Murphy muttered, and strode to the body.</p><p>Going down on one knee, he checked Mezareau\u2019s pulse, then yanked my knife out of his chest. After wiping the weapon on Mezareau\u2019s shirt, Murphy returned, snatching my backpack as he passed.</p> <p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He tossed my knife in the bag, adjusted the pack on my shoulders, and shoved me into the pond.</p><p>The cool water revived me enough to mount a resistance when he tried to pull me through the waterfall.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Murphy lifted me into his arms and dragged me along.</p><p>The waterfall clouded my vision, soaking me, soaking us, driving both Murphy and me beneath the water.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t breathe\u2014for an instant I thought I\u2019d drown; then we broke the surface on the other side.</p><p>The slightly lopsided moon shone brightly as Murphy helped me out of the water. Together we collapsed onto the bank.</p><p>\u201cDo you think the zombies will come after us?\u201d Murphy turned his head; so did I. Our noses brushed.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I said.</p> <p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he could have sent them, he wouldn\u2019t have sent the baka. I think the zombies are still asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens when they wake up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard to say. With their master dead, they might be a little confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d Murphy asked quietly.</p><p>We were still nose to nose, our breath mingling as the moon cast silvery shadows over both us and the night.</p><p>I decided not to mention what I\u2019d seen\u2014the odd height of the eyes, the indistinct shape that had not seemed entirely human. Murphy might not think I was crazy anymore, but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t think so again.</p><p>I sat up. \u201cHe\u2019d have killed you.\u201d</p> <p>Murphy sat up, too. He lifted his hand, and the diamond appeared between his thumb and forefinger, for all the world as if he\u2019d plucked it from thin air. \u201cYou\u2019re probably right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you\u2014?\u201d Last I\u2019d looked the damned diamond had been in my backpack. Of course so had he.</p><p>I opened my mouth to admonish him for stealing, for risking our lives, then snapped it shut again.</p><p>Mezareau had been a killer. He\u2019d murdered all his zombie minions and would no doubt have murdered many more to fashion an army to take over Haiti. Once he had control of the country, the world was next. It always was.</p><p>He\u2019d have killed Murphy eventually. The diamond had nothing to do with it.</p><p>Murphy brushed his fingers against my hair where it grew white at the temple. \u201cYou OK?\u201d</p><p>He was a liar, a cheat, a thief, yet my stomach did a weird little dance at his touch. If I wasn\u2019t careful, I\u2019d fall for him, and I couldn\u2019t allow that to happen. It was time to leave both Haiti and Murphy behind.</p><p>Our Jeep was right where we\u2019d left it, just as Murphy had predicted it would be. The sun shone bright and hot as he drove me straight to the airport.</p><p>I counted backward. Had I gotten off the plane only two weeks before?</p><p>Murphy came around the front of the car, opened my door, held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll walk you in.\u201d</p><p>We hadn\u2019t taken two steps inside the terminal when three young, buff Haitians dressed in the spiffy uniform of the local police appeared and zeroed in on Murphy.</p><p>\u201cUh-oh,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t even get a chance to turn around before they grabbed him. \u201cYou are under arrest for trespassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrespassing?\u201d I followed as they dragged Murphy toward the door. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany places.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was there, too.\u201d</p><p>Murphy gave an annoyed sigh. \u201cCassandra, shut up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour fine has been paid, Priestess.\u201d</p><p>Priestess? How did they know that?</p><p>\u201cWho paid it?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou have friends in high places.\u201d</p><p>Edward. Figures. Though I wasn\u2019t sure how he could have found out about the charges already, still I wasn\u2019t surprised that he had.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay Murphy\u2019s fine,\u201d I offered.</p><p>\u201cThere are other issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere always are,\u201d Murphy muttered.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d I cried, and they actually stopped dragging him and waited.</p><p>\u201cGo home,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>His brow quirked. \u201cIsn\u2019t that where you live?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>I was impatient to return to California, but if I didn\u2019t return to New Orleans and see to the raising of that voodoo queen, Edward would only follow me west and take me back.</p><p>I\u2019d rather test the raising ceremony on someone other than Sarah anyway.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll clear this up and follow you,\u201d Murphy continued. \u201cMaybe tonight.\u201d</p><p>One of the cops snorted.</p><p>\u201cOr tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, Murphy kissed me before either the police or I knew what he was up to. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d just let you walk out of my life now, did you?\u201d</p><p>Actually, I\u2019d thought exactly that.</p><p>The cops lifted him from his feet and carted him away.</p><p>\u201cSee you in the Big Easy,\u201d Murphy called as they shoved him through the door.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why everyone insists on calling it that,\u201d I muttered. \u201cThe place may be big, but it certainly ain\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d arrived after the last hurricane, which had almost been the last for New Orleans. While California awaits the big one to knock it into the ocean, New Orleans has been waiting for the big one to submerge it in the waters of... Take your pick\u2014river, lake, swamp\u2014the place was surrounded.</p><p>Katrina had been that big one\u2014a category five\u2014the one all the doomsday predictors had said was coming.</p><p>Then it came. New Orleans was devastated. Water, water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink. I used to like that poem.</p><p>Lucky for me, I\u2019d still been in voodoo training and hadn\u2019t made it to the French Quarter yet. Lucky for everyone, the French Quarter was a bit higher than the city proper, because it fared better against the floods, not so well against the crazies and the looters.</p><p>However, with the typical savoir faire of New Orleanians, they picked themselves up, dried themselves off, and were open for business within months. There was even a bar on Bourbon Street that never did close\u2014just served warm beer right through the hurricane. You gotta love that. Cities like New Orleans did not go away.</p><p>Because of Katrina I was able to buy my shop rock-bottom cheap. The place was rumored to have belonged once to Marie Laveau\u2014the infamous voodoo queen of New Orleans.</p><p>Marie had actually been two women, a mother and a daughter, who had greatly resembled each other.</p><p>When the first died the second took her place, which led to the rumors that Marie had great power.</p><p>When you appear to live two lifetimes, that\u2019ll happen.</p><p>Whether Marie\u2014the first, the second, or both\u2014had been powerful was irrelevant. The locals thought she was, and they believed my place had been hers. Both viewpoints had been very helpful in the success of my voodoo shop.</p><p>After the purchase, I\u2019d spent several months fixing the store and the attached living quarters. Just because the building hadn\u2019t flooded didn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t a mess.</p><p>I was amazed to discover that I missed it, along with Lazarus and Diana, my two best friends in the world.</p><p>\u201cMiss Cassandra.\u201d Marcel materialized from somewhere, and I didn\u2019t even think that was strange. \u201cI am to take you to your plane.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been staring at the door through which Murphy had disappeared, and I forced myself to look away.</p><p>Murphy was gone, and despite his words, his kiss, I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d see him again. \u201cI don\u2019t have a ticket.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsieur Mandenauer has taken care of everything.\u201d Marcel beckoned, and I followed.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know I was coming back today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was not certain you would come back at all. So he had me wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I left? Don\u2019t you have a j ob?\u201d</p><p>Marcel paused at security and spoke in soft, rapid-fire Creole to the guards. I lifted my backpack from my shoulders in preparation for a search, but they waved us through without comment.</p><p>\u201cMy true j ob is to serve the monsieur. He saved my life many moons ago, and this I will never forget.\u201d</p><p>Marcel pushed open a door that led onto the tarmac where a small plane idled.</p><p>\u201cHow did he save your life?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is a tale of another time, for another day. Monsieur asked me to ascertain that you and anything you have with you was put on this plane without question of the authorities.\u201d Marcel pressed a boarding pass into my hand. \u201cAnd now I have done so. Priestess, may the has bless you all of your days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you.\u201d I walked up the metal staircase that led to the plane.</p><p>Edward was no dummy. He\u2019d considered I might be bringing back more than myself from the mountains.</p><p>Most voodoo spells, both white magic and black, were augmented with roots, herbs, even the bones of the dead. Things that would not be allowed through commercial security. Not to mention my solid silver knife. But all that I needed for the raising of the dead was water, fresh blood, and the incantation. Which didn\u2019t seem enough, but then the simplest of rituals were often the most powerful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p><p>When I got off the plane at Louis Armstrong International Airport, my friend and fellow J\u00e4ger-Sucher Diana Malone Ruelle was waiting. Without so much as a howdy-do, she hustled me past customs. No one even glanced our way. Working for Edward was great.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you find out?\u201d</p><p>Diana had never been much for small talk, which was one of the things I\u2019d liked about her from the day she\u2019d stepped into my voodoo shop.</p> <p>\u201cNice to see you, too,\u201d I quipped as I followed her to her car.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She put a hand on my arm and when I stopped, she hugged me. \u201cWelcome back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>I would have liked to say it was good to be back, but I wasn\u2019t all that thrilled. I didn\u2019t want to examine too closely why, but it had something to do with Murphy.</p><p>I guess after two weeks in his company I\u2019d gotten used to having him around.</p> <p>I\u2019d just have to get un-used to it.</p><p>Diana straightened, a long trip since she was nearly six feet tall, even in low-heeled shoes. She had the lovely pale skin of a true redhead, and her curly hair tumbled past her shoulders, ending just above her waist. She was curvy, sexy, and just funny enough that I didn\u2019t have to hate her. She was also the second-best friend I\u2019d ever had.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Lazarus?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Diana clicked her key chain and the locks on her SUV thunked open. \u201cHow would I know? It\u2019s not as if I visited your python and took him for a slither.\u201d</p><p>My lips twitched. Despite her being a cryptozoologist\u2014with a degree in zoology\u2014Diana did not care for snakes. She and Lazarus had never gotten on, hissing at each other whenever they were in the same room. Lazarus might have been j ealous. I\u2019m not sure what Diana\u2019s problem was, beyond her uncharacteristically girlie aversion to snakes.</p><p>\u201cAdam and Luc?\u201d I asked, referring to her new husband and his son, who was now hers.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re both hunky-dory, Cassandra.\u201d She started the car with an annoyed flick of her wrist. \u201cNow spill the beans.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t blame her for being impatient. The curse of the crescent moon would ruin Diana\u2019s new life if I wasn\u2019t able to stop it.</p><p>Her husband was one of a long line of cursed men, starting with his several-times-great-grandfather Henri. Not a demon yet, Adam would be eventually, as well as his adorable eight-year-old son, Luc. No one wanted to see him turn furry one night.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, please,\u201d Diana murmured. \u201cDo you know how to end the curse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know how to raise the voodoo queen,\u201d I said. \u201cWhether she can end the curse...\u201d I spread my hands.</p><p>We just didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Diana parked in front of my combination voodoo shop, living quarters, and voodoo temple on Royal Street. The late-afternoon sun blared hot, despite the calendar insisting we\u2019d reached autumn. In New Orleans, autumn could still be scalding.</p><p>\u201cDid you find out where the voodoo queen is buried?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat was fascinating.\u201d</p><p>Although Edward had hired Adam to be a hunter\u2014he\u2019d been killing the things his grandp \u00e8re had made for years\u2014Diana was a J\u00e4ger-Sucher more in the searching sense, like me.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a slave cemetery not far from the Ruelle Mansion,\u201d she continued. \u201cI found her there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d</p><p>Most slaves had been buried without benefit of a marker, or if there was one it had been made of wood, which didn\u2019t last.</p><p>\u201cEasier than a lot of other things lately. Have you ever homeschooled an eight-year-old?\u201d</p><p>We were walking down the path that led away from Royal Street toward my shop, set back from all the others. My face turned away from her, thankfully she couldn\u2019t see my expression. I hadn\u2019t told Diana about Sarah. I hadn\u2019t told anyone.</p><p>Except Murphy\u2014and why was that?</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t say as I have.\u201d I set my backpack next to the door and dug out my key.</p><p>Sarah had just started first grade when she died, and she\u2019d gone to private school. Homeschooling gave me the willies.</p><p>\u201cThe kid\u2019s too bright for his own good,\u201d Diana muttered.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they all?\u201d I opened the door.</p><p>Cool air brushed my face. I\u2019d hired a local to run the shop while I was away, as well as take care of</p><p>Lazarus. But it was past closing time, so Diana and I had the place to ourselves.</p><p>I led the way through the shop to the kitchen. Everything seemed in order. I\u2019d check more thoroughly later.</p><p>\u201cCan you pour us a drink?\u201d I asked, not waiting for her answer as I went to greet Lazarus.</p><p>His head was up; he took one look at me and hissed.</p><p>\u201cI was only gone a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Diana stepped through the multicolored beads that hung from ceiling to floor in the doorway between the shop and my apartment. They clattered far too loudly in the silence that followed.</p><p>\u201cHe hissed at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably saw me and got confused.\u201d</p><p>I cast her an exasperated glance. Diana and I were as unalike physically as two women could be.</p><p>Nevertheless, I switched on the light and moved closer to the cage.</p><p>Lazarus struck, smashing his head into the chicken wire. Shocked, I fell back. He continued to strike so violently I was afraid he\u2019d injure himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I went to the phone and dialed the number of the kid I\u2019d hired.</p><p>He answered on the second ring. \u201cYo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBen, it\u2019s Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou back? Excellent. I can party tonight, you don\u2019t need me to open tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Fine. Whatever. I was wondering about Lazarus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s OK. For a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he behaving strangely? Hissing, angry, striking at the cage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy boy? Naw. He was excellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I hung up and dialed the first veterinarian in the phone book. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t up on the latest snake psychosis and couldn\u2019t help me.</p><p>\u201cYour best bet would be to check with a zoologist who specializes in reptiles,\u201d he advised.</p><p>My gaze met Diana\u2019s. She tilted her head, frowning as I hung up. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should check with a zoologist.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows shot up, and she stared at the cage. Lazarus had slithered into a box in the corner and was now hiding his head. Better than the aggressive behavior but still worrisome.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re barking up the wrong zoologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha,\u201d I said.</p><p>Diana\u2019s specialty was wolves, which had come in handy recently.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about reptiles. Except that I don\u2019t like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201d Shh,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>Lazarus seemed to have a sixth sense for those who were afraid of snakes, and he took great pleasure in tormenting them. Which probably explained his animosity for Diana better than any j ealousy over my affections.</p><p>\u201cHe seems better now,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe he was just expressing his displeasure at your leaving him behind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d I agreed, though I didn\u2019t think so. I\u2019d been around Lazarus enough to recognize hate when I saw it. The only thing he\u2019d ever disliked more than Diana had been my neighbor\u2019s cat.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s have that drink while you tell me all you know.\u201d Diana preceded me to the kitchen table, where she poured us both a glass of thick, ruby red Cabernet.</p><p>I stared into the liquid and thought of the blood dripping from the bowl and into the ground, then the bodies shooting up out of the dirt, then\u2014</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Frowning, I took a sip. Diana took one, too, watching me over the rim of her glass. I must have looked pretty tired, probably because I was. Hoping to get this over with quickly, I launched into the tale of my trip to Haiti.</p><p>She didn\u2019t so much as blink when I spoke of the waterfall, the zombies, Mezareau. She\u2019d seen worse.</p><p>\u201cThe spell sounds too easy,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>I\u2019d thought the same thing, but what could I do? The spell was what it was.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t easy if you don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cYou can\u2019t just make this shit up.\u201d</p><p>Diana leaned forward. \u201cCan we try it tonight?\u201d</p><p>I guess I hadn\u2019t told her every detail. \u201cHave to wait for the full moon.\u201d</p><p>Her face fell. \u201cYou\u2019d think in order to break the crescent moon curse, you\u2019d need a crescent moon.\u201d</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t tonight, either, but why point that out?</p><p>\u201cFull moons have great power. Every witch knows that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a witch and neither are you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome would beg to differ on that.\u201d Karl had called me far worse than a witch, but then the last time we\u2019d met, I hadn\u2019t been calling him darling, either.</p><p>Diana smiled as if I\u2019d been kidding. \u201cI guess we\u2019ve waited this long, we can wait a while longer.\u201d</p><p>I only hoped that when I raised the voodoo queen she\u2019d be amenable to removing the curse, or at least telling me how. If not, I didn\u2019t know what we would do.</p><p>I finished my wine in a single gulp. Diana\u2019s was already gone.</p><p>\u201cAnother?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d better get back. The new babysitter is great, but I don\u2019t want to push it.\u201d</p><p>As the last sitter had wound up werewolf lunch, I completely understood her point.</p><p>At the door she paused. \u201cHave you talked to Edward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot since I arrived in Haiti. Is he in New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you\u2019d better get in touch before he shows up. You know how he hates to waste a trip. He\u2019ll want to be here when you raise the dead, but not a minute before. Places to go, monsters to kill, you know.\u201d</p><p>I knew.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you tell him what happened to Mezareau. He might want to send someone to check on the zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept the village isn\u2019t exactly easy to find.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the sorcerer dead, it might be a lot easier.\u201d</p><p>True. The waterfall was at least water and not a wall.</p><p>\u201cYou remember when we asked the moon goddess, Erzulie, for help, and you sent me to voodoo heaven?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cNot you, just your mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet I brought back a very real piece of the goddess\u2019s garden.\u201d</p><p>That had been kind of hard to explain. It had been my finest hour in the realm of magic.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to do this, too,\u201d Diana said. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>She was trying to pump me up, give me some confidence. It was working.</p><p>Diana continued to hover half in and half out of the shop. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about you.\u201d</p><p>Probably the sex. Another thing I hadn\u2019t told her about, and I wasn\u2019t sure why.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t put my finger on it,\u201d she murmured, and left.</p><p>I closed and locked the door, then wandered through the shop, touching things as I went. This was the first place I\u2019d ever had that was truly mine.</p><p>As I passed the chicken wire cage, Lazarus hissed again. In the sudden silence that had followed Diana\u2019s departure, the sound was harsh, almost evil.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t stop that, I was going to hunt down a vet who knew his snakes, even if I had to search the entire state of Louisiana, then take Lazarus in for a checkup.</p><p>I poured another glass of wine, grabbed my backpack, and carried both into the living area on the far side of the kitchen, where I had a bedroom, bath, and sitting room. The kitchen and the office next to it were common areas that separated where I lived from where I worked.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t done much decorating, saving my time and money for the shop and the voodoo temple. I had a bed with a plain blue bedspread and white sheets, a couch, also blue, a chair in brown, and a TV, but no VCR or DVD player. I did not have the time or the inclination to rent movies.</p><p>Before I forgot, as if I could, I placed a call to Edward. His voice mail answered, so I left a message.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in New Orleans, sir. The bokor is dead, but I\u2019m not sure about the zombies. Maybe someone could check and get back to me. I\u2019ll be able to perform the raising ceremony on the night of the full moon.\u201d I hesitated, then ended with a bright and cheery, \u201cSee you then!\u201d</p><p>Edward would love that. Or maybe not. His funny bone wasn\u2019t very well developed. Considering his life, that was understandable.</p><p>I planned to take a bath, sip my wine, go to bed. But before I did, I made the mistake of unpacking.</p><p>Crumpled, damp clothes. My knife. Empty plastic bags. Everything kind of smelled, and I decided to cut my losses and toss it all, except for the knife.</p><p>I reached into the bottom of the pack to make sure I wasn\u2019t throwing out anything important, and my fingers brushed cool, slick stone.</p><p>I thought of my last sight of Murphy being dragged out of the airport\u2014probably to be handcuffed, booked, and searched, everything on his person confiscated, while I was led directly to the plane and ferried out of the country.</p><p>You didn \u2019t think I \u2019d j ust let you walk out of my lif e now, did you?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>I picked up my glass and downed every last drop of bloodred wine.</p><p>I had his diamond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>I wondered when Murphy would show up. It wouldn\u2019t be long.</p><p>I wondered why I was so angry, so hurt, such an idiot.</p><p>Had I secretly been hoping he\u2019d come here for me? Murphy was a thief and a liar. He cared about no one but himself. However, he\u2019d been very good at making me believe he\u2019d cared about me.</p> <p>My eyes burned, and that just pissed me off. I\u2019d cried an ocean over (Carl. I wouldn\u2019t shed a drop for another man just like him.</p><p>I would not let Murphy ruin my homecoming, so I poured another glass of wine and got in the tub. But I couldn\u2019t relax. I wanted to kick something.</p><p>Make that someone.</p><p>Had he been romancing me from the beginning in order to get the diamond out of the country? I seemed to remember a movie with a similar plotline. I\u2019m sure it had ended happily. I didn\u2019t see how this could.</p><p>When I got out of the tub I wavered a bit. The heat, the long plane ride, and three glasses of wine on an empty stomach had made me light-headed. Oh well, I didn\u2019t have anything better to do than pass out.</p> <p>So I tumbled into bed, naked, and fell asleep almost immediately. But in the way of wine-induced slumber, I didn\u2019t sleep well.</p><p>Hot, sweaty, too big for my own skin, I threw off the covers, leaving myself naked to the night. I was thirsty, oh, so thirsty, but there was no water nearby. In truth, I didn\u2019t think water would satisfy the craving. I needed something stronger, thicker, redder even than wine.</p><p>I drifted deeper, drawn into dreamland by the whisper of falling water. I was in the cave, in the pond, all alone.</p><p>Or was I? I heard a low, rumbling growl from the darkness, but instead of being afraid I was intrigued, and strangely aroused.</p><p>The cool water lapped at my breasts, caressing them, making them harden with desire. I walked toward the rocks, toward the eyes that materialized from the night.</p><p>I watched, fascinated, as the shape wavered in and out, just as it had when this had been reality and not a dream, never becoming solid enough for my mind to give a name to the shadow.</p> <p>The snarl echoed off the cave walls, yet still I moved forward, climbing from the pond, walking across the dirt floor as the water streamed down my body. My skin no longer on fire, goose bumps made me tingle.</p><p>The sound of my own harsh breathing kept time with the thud of my heart. \u201cShow yourself,\u201d I whispered, and the beast stepped into the light.</p><p>Expecting a wolf, at first my mind didn\u2019t register what my eyes clearly saw.</p><p>A glistening coat, rippling muscles, black spots on an amber background, the teeth and the eyes of a leopard.</p><p>The beast stalked forward, growling, the sound, now that it no longer echoed, distinctly that of a big cat.</p><p>Nevertheless, I wasn\u2019t afraid. This was, after all, just a dream.</p><p>The cat leaped, hitting me in the chest, driving me to the ground, which in the way of dreams had shifted to soft, sweet grass instead of the hard, rough earth.</p><p>There was no pain, only curiosity. Why a leopard and not a wolf?</p> <p>The answer was simple. The leopard society. The skin on the wall of Mezareau\u2019s hut. Those memories in my subconscious had led me to this dream.</p><p>The beast sniffed my neck, nuzzled my breast. I closed my eyes and wished myself awake.</p><p>Instead a long, lazy cat tongue swirled around my nipple. My eyes shot open, but the cave had gone completely dark. At least I wouldn\u2019t have to watch.</p><p>The tongue continued, both soft and sharp, teasing my nipples to aching peaks before moving down my body, laving my skin, teeth scraping just below my belly button, over my hip, then down the insides of my thighs. Pleasure, pain, the allure of the forbidden, I could barely breathe past the fear and the excitement.</p><p>This had to be a dream. No leopard would lick my neck; such a beast would rip it open.</p><p>Neither would a leopard taste gently between my legs, tormenting me to a screaming core of need. Such a thing would drink of my blood and nothing else.</p><p>I was trapped by unwelcome desire, caged by a dream that seemed far too real. The animal that lived in the darkness crept closer, and its erection slid along my inner thigh.</p><p>I tensed and slammed my legs shut. There was only so far I was willing to go, even in a dream.</p><p>The weight lifted and for an instant I thought it was over; then someone kissed me, open mouth, a lot of tongue. Human lips that tasted of me.</p><p>Confused, uncertain, at first I didn\u2019t respond, but the mouth was so insistent, so skilled, and the hands</p><p>that now caressed me were the same. With a mental shrug, I wrapped my arms around my dream lover\u2019s neck. Tugging him close, I opened my legs to welcome him in. But he wasn\u2019t ready, or perhaps he didn\u2019t think that I was.</p><p>He traced his long, clever fingers over my body, touched me, kissed me, let his tongue and his teeth take me to the edge; then he refused to shove me over.</p><p>The cave filled with the sounds of my desire, no words, only whispers, perhaps whimpers. I was on fire, my breasts, my mound, engorged and throbbing.</p><p>He urged me to my knees. His hands cupped my hips; his thumbs stroked my back, rubbing the base of my spine, making me arch. I rocked against him, wanting him to fill me, hard and fast, and at last he did in a single fierce thrust.</p><p>I moaned as the tip of his penis seemed to nudge my very womb. He leaned over my back, nuzzled my neck, kneaded my breasts with one hand while brushing my exposed center with the other. His long fingers increased the pressure until the orgasm hit, and then his teeth scraped my neck, pain bringing the pleasure into sharp relief.</p><p>As the last quivers of desire faded away, he shoved into me one last time, and the deep pulse of his orgasm drew mine on. He sagged against me, nuzzling my cheek, then licking my earlobe once before retreating.</p><p>I collapsed to the ground, winded, sated. Reaching out, my fingers brushed fur. Bright animal eyes glowed in the darkness, and a slow rumble swirled through the cave.</p><p>The black veil lifted, and I could see again. Next to me lolled a huge leopard, panting as if he\u2019d exerted himself recently. I guess he had.</p><p>I glanced down, wondering if I was bleeding from his claws, shredded from his teeth, and I just didn\u2019t know it. But I was a leopard, too.</p><p>I awoke thrashing, mewling, trying to force a scream past the blockage in my throat that tasted of terror.</p><p>Dawn hovered, filling my room with an unearthly gray light. I patted my body. Thank God. Still a woman.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d I managed, and the weak, frightened sound of my voice disturbed me. I hadn\u2019t been afraid for a very long time.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have to throw back the covers; I\u2019d already tossed them to the floor. I stepped to the window and threw up the sash.</p><p>Fog rolled in from the river, shrouding the buildings, muting the colors. The city appeared to have drifted back in time to a previous century.</p><p>Of course the French Quarter always looked like that, if you could ignore the tourists with the hurricane glasses and the T-shirt shops and the strip j oints. But at this time of the morning, when the sun was just beginning to rise, that was easy to do.</p><p>My body still tingled; my skin still felt too small. The languid aftereffects of an orgasm I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d had made my knees a little shaky. I rubbed at my eyes. \u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>A dream. Nothing more. Nothing less. Though why I\u2019d have a sex dream I had no idea. I\u2019d had more sex over the past two weeks than I\u2019d had in the past five years.</p><p>Maybe that was it. I\u2019d opened the floodgates, and now I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. But sex with a shadowy stranger, sex with a leopard...</p><p>Pretty weird.</p><p>The shower called to me; I wouldn\u2019t sleep any more. Strangely, I couldn\u2019t bear the hot water and turned it to tepid instead. I let the stream tumble over me like a waterfall, washing away the remnants of the dream along with a sticky sheen of sweat.</p><p>When I was finished, I almost felt human again. Since I had to wait until the next full moon before I could raise the voodoo queen, I\u2019d try to find peace in the day-to-day-ness of my life. And if I tensed whenever the bell rang to announce a customer, that was no more than had happened when I\u2019d first come here and daily expected the arrival of Karl\u2019s minions. Now I\u2019d just be waiting for Murphy.</p><p>I finished brushing my teeth, lifted my head, and froze, staring into the mirror.</p><p>When had my eyes turned green? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>I tilted my chin to the left, to the right. Then I leaned in close, blinked, and gave a little laugh, though it was more uneasy than amused. My eyes were blue. Always had been.</p><p>I was just more spooked than I should be by the dream. The shift in color had no doubt been caused by the angle of the light in the bathroom.</p><p>The rationalization allowed me to breathe easier. I\u2019d had a dream, nothing more. That decided, I dressed, made myself some tea, and tackled the paperwork in my office.</p> <p>Two hours later I was caught up and ready to open the store. I walked into the shop, and Lazarus went nuts, hissing and striking at the chicken wire of his cage over and over. There was definitely something wrong with him.</p><p>\u201cTrip to the vet for you,\u201d I said, and the sound of my voice seemed to infuriate the snake more. He increased the strength and speed of his strikes and only succeeded in bloodying his nose, then knocking himself out.</p><p>I reached in and snatched him while he was unconscious. I knew better than to loll around. Lazarus had a habit of waking up and scaring the crap out of people. He was a regular j okester for a snake.</p><p>Quickly lifting him from his large cage, I placed him into a portable one, then hustled to the yellow pages and started calling people. Eventually I found a snake doctor.</p><p>Half an hour later I took the Crescent City Connection toward Gretna, a historically picturesque suburb across the river from New Orleans. Settled by German emigrants, Gretna had all the amenities of a small town, yet it was within minutes of a maj or metropolitan area.</p> <p>Katrina had flooded them, of course; you couldn\u2019t have a view of the river and not be flooded. However, they\u2019d come back strong. I could see little evidence of the damage as I drove down the main street and parked in front of the veterinarian\u2019s office.</p><p>Lazarus was awake if the furious hissing and the rhythmic thuds against the sides of his prison were any indication. Luckily the portable cage was more of a box with a handle and I couldn\u2019t see him any more than he could see me. So what was he so mad about?</p><p>I stepped into the waiting room, and the three dogs already there began to howl, the sound earsplitting in volume. Their owners tried to shush them, but no luck. All three darted skittish glances in my direction between yowls.</p><p>\u201cCat?\u201d one of the owners shouted above the din, pointing at my box.</p><p>\u201cPython,\u201d I said.</p><p>The man frowned. \u201cHe never cared about snakes before.\u201d</p> <p>The woman next to him tugged on the leash of her German shepherd, but he ignored her. \u201cKing\u2019s never even seen one.\u201d</p><p>I headed for the desk and the flinching receptionist. I hadn\u2019t taken two steps when the dogs crawled under their masters\u2019 chairs and their howls turned to whimpers.</p><p>The noise brought the vet, an older man with tufts of white hair over his ears but nowhere else, into the room. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>The dog owners pointed at me. I lifted my free hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s got a python,\u201d the first man said. \u201cThe dogs whacked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on back,\u201d the vet ordered, and I was happy to. He pointed to an open door, and I entered, setting the cage on the exam table.</p><p>\u201cWeird,\u201d he said, as he j oined me. \u201cI\u2019ve never known dogs to be bothered so much by a snake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought they wouldn\u2019t like snakes at all.\u201d So few mammals did.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say dogs liked snakes; they just don\u2019t howl and hide from them. Dogs are usually curious, which is why I end up treating them for snakebites.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, that makes more sense.\u201d</p><p>The vet smiled. He was tan in a way that suggested the outdoors, not a tanning booth, and his eyes were cheery and dark. His hands were gentle as he opened the cage and drew Lazarus out. \u201cWhat seems to be the trouble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lazarus hissed at the sound of my voice and began to thrash. The vet had obviously handled snakes before, because he held mine behind the head, and Lazarus could do nothing more than that. With a muttered curse, the vet set him back inside and slapped the top shut. The thing rattled against the table, then stilled.</p><p>\u201d That \u2019s the trouble,\u201d I said. \u201cHe won\u2019t stop freaking out.\u201d</p><p>The vet frowned. \u201cHe\u2019s your pet?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t think it prudent, or productive, to explain about my met tet. This might be New Orleans, but I doubted the local vet would know what one was. Besides, p et was as good a description as any, if we weren\u2019t using f riend\u2014also difficult to explain.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I replied. \u201cMy pet.\u201d</p><p>The box shook like fury.</p><p>The vet looked me up and down. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem the type for a python.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAppearances are deceiving.\u201d Since I was exactly the type for a python. \u201cI like snakes. Always have.\u201d</p><p>As a child I\u2019d been fascinated\u2014snake books, snake movies, snake stuffed animals. My mother had drawn the line at a snake pet. So had Karl. One of the best things about becoming a voodoo priestess had been the python.</p><p>\u201cHow long have you had him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree years.\u201d</p><p>Over half as long as I\u2019d had Sarah. No wonder I was so attached.</p><p>\u201cDo you know how old he is?\u201d</p><p>My heart stuttered. \u201cPythons live forever in captivity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot forever.\u201d The vet\u2019s face gentled. \u201cMore like forty or fifty years. However, I wasn\u2019t worried about his dying, just curious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I took a breath. Why was I so nervous?</p><p>Because Lazarus\u2019s love had been the one constant thing in my life since I\u2019d become Priestess Cassandra.</p><p>Until Diana, he\u2019d been the only one who loved me. Now he seemed to loathe me, and if I felt as though I\u2019d lost my best friend that was only because I had.</p><p>\u201cI was told he was two years old when I bought him,\u201d I answered. \u201cSo around five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill young. Might just be snake puberty.\u201d At my blank expression, the vet laughed. \u201cKidding. Though a lady python might help his disposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKnow any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA friend of mine has a female. I could ask about breeding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s what his trouble is?\u201d I\u2019d never considered lack of nooky a big python problem, but what did I know?</p><p>\u201cHard to say with a snake. Still, it couldn\u2019t hurt to set him up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d I reached for the cage, and Lazarus hissed again, rattling the container so hard it nearly tipped over.</p><p>The man\u2019s eternal smile became a frown. \u201cMaybe you should leave him here for a few tests. Parasites.</p><p>Viruses. If my friend is amenable to breeding, he\u2019ll have to be kept isolated at a lower temperature for a few weeks before the big day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few weeks?\u201d</p><p>The thought of being without Lazarus that long disturbed me; however, I seemed to disturb him even more.</p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d I agreed. As I withdrew my hand, the cage stilled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLazarus.\u201d</p><p>The vet\u2019s eyebrows shot up. \u201cBecause he\u2019s going to live so long?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cHe likes to play dead.\u201d</p><p>The vet stared at me, as if waiting for me to laugh, but I wasn\u2019t kidding.</p><p>\u201cHe thinks it\u2019s hysterical when you reach in to check and he suddenly comes back to life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>I turned away, eyes burning. \u201cLet me know if you discover anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the first.\u201d</p><p>I drove back to Royal Street, and my days returned to normal\u2014or as normal as they get when you made your living as a voodoo priestess.</p><p>Most of the people who wandered into my shop were tourists, interested in books, sightseeing expeditions, and recreational gris-gris bags. Of course I was perfectly capable of producing gris-gris of a more potent nature.</p><p>Gris-gris were charms or talismans\u2014small cloth bags filled with herbs and other, more secret, items. The term itself came from the French word for \u201cgray\u201d and referred to the black and white nature of the magic.</p><p>In New Orleans we referred to good magic as juju and bad as moj o. I had never made a moj o gris- gris, though I had been asked countless times. There was enough evil in the world; I didn\u2019t plan on making more of it.</p><p>Did I really believe that a little bag of stuff could hurt or help people? Yes. I\u2019d seen it happen.</p><p>My community was growing slowly, probably because I was a skinny white girl practicing an African religion, but it was growing.</p><p>I was busy day and night, yet still I was lonely. Diana had called, even brought Luc to visit once. The boy had to be the cutest thing on two feet; I wanted to hug him and burst into tears\u2014which just wasn\u2019t like me.</p><p>Diana had been as near the brink as I was. We were both waiting for the full moon, and there was nothing we could do to make it come any faster.</p><p>Murphy didn\u2019t show up\u2014he didn\u2019t call; he didn\u2019t write. I was starting to wonder if he was incarcerated or dead. Those were the only two reasons I could fathom for his not arriving to steal from me the diamond he\u2019d already stolen from Mezareau.</p><p>One good thing, my period arrived right on schedule. So my time in the land that condom forgot could be forgotten.</p><p>If only I could stop dreaming of Murphy\u2019s face I might be less twitchy. At least I hadn\u2019t had the leopard dream again. Great mind sex aside, I think a repeat just might have sent me over the edge.</p><p>And I was getting mighty edgy. Perhaps because the moon was growing larger every night and would soon be a big round November Frost Moon hanging heavy in the sky. I\u2019d have to raise the dead, and if it worked, by the Cold Moon of December I\u2019d have Sarah back.</p><p>You think I\u2019d be happier about it.</p><p>Lazarus remained at the vet. The man hadn\u2019t been able to find anything wrong with him but had set up a date with the lady python. The vet wanted to supervise the session, which seemed a little pornographic to me, but whatever trips your trigger. So the cage where Lazarus usually spent his days remained empty.</p><p>Two nights before the full moon, I sat at the window in my bedroom sipping red wine. Since I had returned from Haiti, I preferred it to white.</p><p>Perhaps the weeks in the jungle had made me slightly anemic. That was the only thing I could think of to explain my sudden attachment to red meat, when I\u2019d been more of a fish and chicken girl before.</p><p>The fog swirled in again, brushing my face with a cooling mist, reminding me of the jungle and the waterfall. But beyond the fog I heard the hum of Bourbon Street\u2014laughter, music, glasses clinking\u2014 then a loud screech that started out sounding like an animal and ended up sounding like a woman.</p><p>I shook my head. The fog played tricks, amplifying noises, enlarging shadows. Nevertheless, in the distance, sirens wailed.</p><p>Nothing new in the French Quarter. Something was always going on, which meant something was usually going wrong.</p><p>I turned from the window, leaving it open to the breeze and the mist. The night was warm, but not warm enough to bother with the air-conditioning.</p><p>I was safe here. Not only was the courtyard surrounding my temple walled and gated, but most people were kind of scared of me. Word had gotten around that I could raise the loas, and while that was helpful to some, to others it was downright creepy.</p><p>After finishing my wine, I tumbled into bed wearing nothing but my underwear and a thin tank top. The sirens followed me into my dreams.</p><p>Basin Street near St. Louis Cemetery Number One, a dicey neighborhood unfit for tourists except in the daytime. I caught the scent of perfume, so strong I fought a sneeze. The click of stiletto heels against the pavement was so loud I twitched with every footstep. The closer I got, the faster she walked, as if she knew I was behind her and she was afraid.</p><p>The woman turned right, toward St. Louis Number Two, an even rougher place to be. I tried to call out, to warn her, but for some reason I couldn\u2019t speak. Instead, I increased my pace and so did she.</p><p>A shadow materialized from the mist\u2014definitely a woman\u2014her breath came fast, a bit panicked. I caught the scent of terror mixed with the perfume. She kept looking over her shoulder, which only slowed her down and allowed me to narrow the gap. I wished I could speak and calm her fears, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>She gave in to her panic and began to run; then I was compelled to run, too, or I\u2019d lose her. Somewhere in the night I smelled food, and my mouth watered almost painfully; my stomach cramped, growling loudly. Dreams are so damn strange.</p><p>I\u2019d never been a fast runner, but tonight I was. I had unending stamina and pretty impressive acceleration.</p><p>I understood me allure of the runner\u2019s high as it slammed into me, making my head light and my heart aflutter.</p><p>The woman stumbled on the ancient cracked sidewalk and cried out, felling. The mist thickened. I couldn\u2019t see any more than a shadow, could only hear terrified gasps, her frantic attempts to stand.</p><p>My steps echoed in the fog, but there was something off about them. At first I thought it was just the magnification that happens to sounds in the night, in the fog. Except mine were muffled, as if I were barefoot, and there seemed to be more thuds than two feet would cause. I glanced behind me, but there was nothing and no one.</p><p>As I turned back, the fog parted. The woman\u2019s eyes went wide, and her scream made me skitter. I opened my mouth to tell her everything would be all right, and a low growl rumbled out instead.</p><p>The shock of that sound should have awoken me, if the terrified screams of my prey didn\u2019t Instead power surged, a heady mixture of strength and magic. I gave myself over to the beast, lifting my head, calling to the night.</p><p>Hunger throbbed in my belly and my blood. I wanted the woman to run again, and she did. I gave her a few seconds\u2019 head start; then I flexed my muscles and followed.</p><p>I let her think she might get away, waited for her breathing to even out, her steps to falter. Then I sprang, sailing through the air, hitting her in the center of her back, driving her to the ground beneath me.</p><p>I tore out her throat before she could scream; her blood tasted better than wine.</p><p>At last, I awoke. Tears had dried on my cheeks. I sat up, staring at my hands, rubbing at the blood I felt but could not see.</p><p>Out in the night, in the dark, in the distance, a small animal died shrieking, and I jumped, then glanced at the window.</p><p>There was a man standing in my room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>I had my knife in my hand before he could speak.

I should have known.</p> <p>\u201cYou have no idea,\u201d I muttered, and returned the knife to the sheath under my pillow. If he\u2019d wanted to hurt me, he\u2019d have done it a long time ago.</p><p>I knew why he\u2019d come; I wasn\u2019t going to give him a chance to ask. I\u2019d hand over the diamond and then he\u2019d be out of my life. I\u2019d no longer be waiting for him to show up\u2014every day, every night\u2014and that would be a good thing. Really.</p><p>Swinging my legs over the side of the bed, I was surprised when he shifted closer and put his palm to the center of my chest. \u201cWhere you off to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo get\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth descended on mine, and I figured, Why not have one more f or the road? I knew the score.</p> <p>He\u2019d come for the diamond and not for me.</p><p>Except he could have taken it and left. Sure, I\u2019d put the thing in my safe\u2014I wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014however, I didn\u2019t think something as simple as a combination lock would stop the man. Maybe it hadn\u2019t.</p><p>I slid my hands down his chest; he reciprocated. My breasts seemed to swell until they fit perfectly into the palms of his hands. I became distracted by the sensations, his tongue in my mouth, his fingers on my skin, mine flitting everywhere.</p><p>I\u2019d missed this; hell, I\u2019d missed him.</p><p>But first things first, I wanted to check his pockets. Pretty easy to do in this situation. I frisked him as fore-play, skating my palms over his ass, then up the insides of his thighs, where I found something hard, but it wasn\u2019t a diamond.</p><p>Maybe he hadn\u2019t been able to unlock the safe. Maybe he figured once he screwed me I\u2019d give him anything.</p> <p>But I\u2019d been screwed before, and it hadn\u2019t made me feel very giving. I do believe the last man who\u2019d tried it was doing twenty to life.</p><p>My lips curved against Murphy\u2019s. He could try to romance the diamond out of me; I didn\u2019t have to tell him I\u2019d gladly give him the j ewel.</p><p>Until after.</p><p>He slid his thumb under the elastic band of my panties, stroking the sensitive skin where my leg became my hip. I yanked on his shirt, wanting to feel his skin, and he drew it over his head, tossing it away.</p><p>Going to his knees on the floor at my feet, he kissed my thigh, opened my legs, and leaned over, mouthing me through my white cotton underwear. I collapsed backward on the bed as he divested me of all my doming, which didn\u2019t take long.</p><p>If I hadn\u2019t already planned to give him the diamond, his performance would have convinced me. Clever mouth, teasing tongue, nimble fingers, I was gasping, begging, clutching his shoulders in minutes.</p><p>He rose, losing his own clothes, and while he did I found a condom and tossed it his way.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a case of closing the barn door after the horse has escaped?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cTime to start all over again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He tore the packet and sheathed himself with a practiced movement. \u201cI\u2019d wondered.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem the type to wonder, or care, but men he hadn\u2019t seemed the type for a lot of things, and I\u2019d been wrong.</p><p>Murphy rej oined me on the bed, filling me so completely, then leaving me so alone\u2014in and out, faster and faster. He was so very good at this. Even better than the leopard in my dream.</p><p>I stiffened, and he murmured in my ear, nonsense words that aroused rather than soothed. He thought I was coming a second time, and as I felt him climax I thought, What the hell? and did.</p><p>He lifted his head, stared into my face. Something in his expression made me catch my breath, a connection more disturbing than the connection of our bodies.</p><p>\u201cJolis yeux verts,\u201d he murmured, and kissed me.</p><p>I guess French was the appropriate language at the time. The flowing words, the sexy accent, made my eyes flutter closed so I could concentrate on the sensations: the slick slide of skin against skin, the softness of his hair beneath my fingers, the scent of rain that forever surrounded him, the taste of his mouth, the shape of his lips.</p><p>He stilled inside of me, the interlude at an end, but I didn\u2019t want him to go. I kept my arms around him, kept his body deep within and my memories close.</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d he whispered, lifting his head again, waiting for me to open my eyes, but I couldn\u2019t. What had happened between us tonight had been both more and less than the times before, and I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, what to do.</p><p>After a second he rolled away and went to the bathroom. The light switch clicked; the toilet flushed; then the water ran.</p><p>\u201cTurn off the light,\u201d I said, not wanting to see his face when he asked me for the diamond, then took it and walked out of my life.</p><p>Cool darkness descended, and Murphy walked back into the room. He came directly to the bed, crawled in, flipped the sheet over us both, then drew me against him. \u201cGo to sleep,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And though I knew it was a mistake, I relaxed in his arms and let the whole world fall away.</p><p>I awoke alone. I don\u2019t know why I was surprised. If it hadn\u2019t been for the telltale traces of sex on me and the sheets, I\u2019d have thought I dreamed Murphy as I\u2019d dreamed everything else.</p><p>After a quick cool shower, I dressed in shorts and a loose gauzy top, then took my cup of tea into the office. My gaze scanned the desk; nothing appeared to have been disturbed.</p><p>I twirled the tumbler on the safe, pulled it open, and stared at the empty space where the diamond should be. I\u2019d known it was gone, yet still my stomach dropped.</p><p>A sudden pounding at the entrance made me jump and slosh tea onto my bare thigh. Grumbling, I slammed the safe shut and spun the dial, then hurried through the darkened store. Who could be pounding at this hour?</p><p>For an instant I imagined Murphy on the doorstep, and my heart lightened pathetically before sense intruded. Why would he knock now when he\u2019d waltzed right in through the open window last night?</p><p>Come to think of it, how had he gotten over the wall? It wasn\u2019t exactly low, and barbed wire protected the top. For Murphy, that had probably been a two-minute hitch in an otherwise stellar day.</p><p>Diana flashed the morning paper up, then down as soon as I opened the door. \u201cDid you see this?\u201d</p><p>Without waiting for my answer, she stomped inside, heading for the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve come to your senses and started drinking coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t taken pity on your dearest human friend and bought a coffeepot just for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrap. Then I guess I\u2019ll have to drink tea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t sound so happy about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeday you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it won\u2019t be today when I\u2019m nursing a lack-of-caffeine headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is why you should stop drinking coffee. What possible good could come from a liquid that causes withdrawal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014bite me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWrong side of the bed this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s still gone.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep when he isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>The two of them were so in love it was painful\u2014especially to a woman who\u2019d thought she\u2019d found love and discovered she had nothing. What would it be like to love a man so much you\u2019d do anything?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awfully cheery.\u201d Her eyes narrowed, and I turned away to make tea.</p><p>I didn\u2019t plan on telling her that Murphy had shown up and screwed my brains out in the night. She\u2019d only scold me for letting him. I had to wonder why I had. Was I that lonely?</p><p>Duh.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the paper?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cAnimal attack.\u201d</p><p>My heart gave one hard thud, then sped up. \u201cWolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Adam got rid of Henri\u2019s leavings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything stuck around New Orleans, which is why he\u2019s gone so much.\u201d</p><p>She slumped, staring at the paper. Adam spent a lot of his time traveling, searching for the werewolves his grandp \u00e8re had made and released into the world, shooting whatever else he found along the way that didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cThe woman died in town, not the swamp,\u201d Diana continued. \u201cOf course that doesn\u2019t mean one of Henri\u2019s werewolves couldn\u2019t have killed her. They go wherever they like.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been walking toward the table, and my hand shook so violently I sloshed tea onto the floor. Luckily Diana was preoccupied and didn\u2019t notice. I swept my foot over the blotch, smoothing it into the vinyl.</p><p>Setting the tea in front of her, I took a seat on the other side of the table.</p><p>\u201cA woman?\u201d I asked, proud when my voice didn\u2019t shake.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Near St. Louis Number One. We both know that area\u2019s a breeding ground for beasties and ghoulies.\u201d</p><p>Black spots danced in front of my eyes. I blinked, several times, then took a huge gulp of tea. The pain from scalding my tongue brought me back to reality.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t have shape-shifted and killed the woman; I\u2019d been here last night. With Murphy.</p><p>Besides, I hadn\u2019t been bitten by a wolf; I couldn\u2019t be a werewolf. Not that biting was the only way to become a lycanthrope these days.</p><p>\u201cHow do they know it was an animal?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThroat torn. The usual.\u201d Diana bit her lip. \u201cI need to call Edward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s check the site first,\u201d I said quickly. \u201cNo reason for Edward to come running until we\u2019re sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t sure? Since when has there been an animal attack in the French Quarter that didn\u2019t involve werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst time for everything,\u201d I muttered, and I really hoped this was it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up for taking a peek,\u201d Diana agreed.</p><p>We locked the shop and set off for Basin Street on foot. One nice thing about the French Quarter, you can walk everywhere.</p><p>Even before we were close enough to distinguish the yellow crime scene tape, I saw the crowd and had to force myself to keep walking. They were gathered at the exact spot I\u2019d dreamed of last night.</p><p>We paused across the street. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to be able to find out anything with all these people around,\u201d Diana said. \u201cThe cops will never let us past the tape.\u201d</p><p>I caught sight of a familiar blond head. \u201cUnless we can get Sullivan to talk.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019d had dealings with the homicide detective before. He didn\u2019t exactly like us\u2014figured we were up to something but couldn\u2019t figure out what. Still, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to ask if he knew anything.</p><p>\u201cDetective!\u201d I shouted, lifting a hand when he glanced our way. From his scowl, he remembered me.</p><p>We\u2019d gotten off on the wrong foot during the loup-garou incident. Bodies had turned up missing, and when that happened the first place to look, at least in New Orleans, was the local voodoo shop\u2014 home of zombies, gris-gris, and magic spells.</p><p>Talking to a voodoo priestess had made Sullivan\u2014the born and bred Yankee\u2014a tad snarky in his interrogation, which in turn had made me snarky right back. Things had gone downhill from there.</p><p>Of course the bodies had turned into werewolves and loped away, but we hadn\u2019t known that at the time.</p><p>Come to think of it, Sullivan still didn\u2019t know.</p><p>The detective glanced both ways like a good Boy Scout, then crossed the street, his gait quicker and lighter than one might expect for a guy built like an offensive lineman. Sullivan had to be six five, about 250, with large hands, tree-trunk legs, and decent teeth, if he\u2019d ever smile. If he hadn\u2019t had a penchant for wearing amusing ties with his dark suits, I\u2019d say he had no sense of humor at all.</p><p>Today the accessory sported pumpkins so small I thought they were orange spots, until I squinted. Each one was, in fact, a j ack-o\u2019-lantern, complete with a different funny face.</p><p>I smiled, then lifted my gaze. My smile died in the chill of his glare. \u201cPriestess,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cDetective.\u201d</p><p>It annoyed Sullivan no end that I refused to acknowledge a last name\u2014as if there were more than one Priestess Cassandra hanging around.</p><p>I was certain he\u2019d checked up on me and discovered my false background, along with the stupid last name of Smith, which must have made him more suspicious than Priestess had.</p><p>However, he\u2019d never be able to prove the lies were anything other than the truth. I had a new Social Security number, a new driver\u2019s license, hell, a new everything. Too bad all I wanted was my old daughter back.</p><p>\u201cFancy you two showing up here.\u201d He glanced between Diana and me. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were out for a stroll,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou just happened to be strolling near St. Louis Number One?\u201d he asked. \u201cWere you perhaps strolling here last night around two a.m.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGot an alibi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I need one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened as he stared at the yellow tape. \u201cIs this body going to disappear, too?\u201d</p><p>Diana and I exchanged a glance.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you think that?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He hesitated, then shrugged. \u201cThe papers already reported this as an animal attack, which I assume is why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>Neither one of us answered.</p><p>\u201cThe rabies expert the department hired assured me there was one rabid wolf in the swamp and he killed it Although he never did explain how in hell a wolf turned up where there hasn\u2019t been a wolf for decades.\u201d</p><p>Whenever there were reports of unexplained animal attacks, Edward was notified. Then he showed up or he sent someone else, giving the standard J\u00e4ger-Sucher excuse of rabies run amok.</p><p>The werewolves were eliminated, and an explanation was levied for the populace. Didn\u2019t sound like Edward had done too great of a j ob with the details on his last trip.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure it was a wolf?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cNot really. We\u2019re waiting for a zoologist from\u2014\u201d He stopped and stared at Diana. \u201cYou\u2019re a zoologist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrypto-,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a wolf expert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got some evidence. I\u2019d like you to take a look.\u201d</p><p>He started across the street. Since Diana and I had come here to do just that, we practically stumbled over each other to follow.</p><p>\u201cWolf tracks resemble really big dog tracks,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cExcept we don\u2019t have tracks; we\u2019ve got spoor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpoor?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cIn layman\u2019s terms, they want me to stare at doggie doo-doo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re familiar with wolf feces?\u201d Sullivan asked.</p><p>\u201cFar more than I\u2019d like to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d He led us past the tarp-covered body, which I did my best to ignore, without success. Blood marred the sidewalk and a single high heel lay in the gutter. The same high heel I\u2019d seen in my dream.</p><p>Dizziness washed over me. How could I have dreamed what happened here last night? Was I finally starting to have the visions I\u2019d longed for when I took this j ob? Right now I\u2019d like to send them back.</p><p>\u201cThere.\u201d Sullivan pointed to a pile of dung in the center of the sidewalk.</p><p>If not for the size, I\u2019d have thought someone walked their dog and forgot a Baggie. Except I\u2019d never seen canine feces that big. Not that I\u2019d studied it or anything. However, Diana had.</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t wolf spoor.\u201d Diana hunkered down, staring at the pile of poop. Suddenly I liked my j ob a whole lot more man usual.</p><p>She glanced up, first at me, her expression unfathomable, then at Sullivan. \u201cThis is from some kind of cat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Sullivan frowned. \u201cIt\u2019d have to be one helluva big kitty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I say \u2018cat,\u2019 I don\u2019t mean domestic,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got bobcats, but not in the French Quarter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooks like you do now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan rabies pass between a wolf and a bobcat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRabies can pass between anything.\u201d The glance Diana shot my way was concerned, and I couldn\u2019t say I blamed her. If I hadn\u2019t been trying to keep from hyperventilating since she\u2019d said the word cat I\u2019d have been more concerned myself. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of a raccoon infecting a dog?\u201d</p><p>Sullivan cursed and stormed off, presumably to notify his superiors that they still had a rabies problem. If Edward hadn\u2019t had to return for the raising of the voodoo queen, he\u2019d have to return to kill whatever it was that had killed this woman. I could only hope it wasn\u2019t me.</p><p>Diana was already striding away, a cell phone attached to her ear. With a last glance at the body, I hurried after.</p> <p>\u201cCan lycanthropy pass between one species and another?\u201d she asked, lowering her voice.</p><p>Obviously she was talking to Edward. Who else?</p><p>She glanced at me and shook her head. Guess not.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d she continued. \u201cSeems to be a big cat. You\u2019ll be getting a phone call shortly.\u201d She listened, then snapped, \u201cI am not going to shoot the body with silver before God and everyone, Edward.</p><p>That\u2019s the quickest way to j ail or a nuthouse.\u201d</p><p>She paused once more. \u201cOK, fine. See you then.\u201d She hung up.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d I asked. Though a lot of it I could guess.</p><p>\u201cSince lycanthropy by definition refers to a werewolf, he\u2019s never heard of it being passed between species. However, that may just be because werewolves like to bite people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he wanted you to shoot the body with silver, just to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t he always?\u201d</p><p>Dumb question.</p><p>\u201cIf this isn\u2019t a werewolf, will silver work?\u201d</p><p>Diana\u2019s expression became contemplative. \u201cInteresting theory. Edward can figure it out when he gets here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich will be... ?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to make some calls, talk to Elise, then come on down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMontana.\u201d</p><p>Which meant he\u2019d probably arrive by tomorrow. I\u2019d better figure out what was going on.</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019re dealing with a bobcat?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I cast her a sharp look. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said it was cat poop. Sullivan said there are bobcats in the area.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t think this was one of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not an expert on large felines, but that seemed like the dung of a much bigger kitty than a bobcat.</p><p>Say a leopard?\u201d</p><p>I winced.</p><p>\u201cSomething you want to tell me, Cassandra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what.\u201d My voice sounded as nonchalant as I wanted it to. God, I was good. But Diana wasn\u2019t bad. She grabbed my elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou go to Haiti to meet with an evil sorcerer. One who has the power to bring the dead back to life, who can make a waterfall appear and disappear, a man who lives in a jungle where there hasn\u2019t been a jungle for a very long time, and this man is a member of an ancient, secret group called the leopard society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you ever see him shape-shift?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Of course that didn\u2019t mean he hadn\u2019t Still\u2014\u201dMezareau is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReasonably.\u201d Murphy had been the one doing the checking. \u201cI stabbed him in the heart with a silver knife. That usually works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he explode?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I lifted my chin. \u201cSo he couldn\u2019t have been a shape-shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou pointed out only a few moments ago that what works for a werewolf might not work for a leopard.\u201d</p><p>Shit. Why did I have to be so damn smart?</p><p>\u201cAnd even if he is dead,\u201d Diana continued, \u201cthere\u2019s something else to consider. The Egbo is a secret society . Definition: more than one.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened. \u201cYou\u2019re saying there might be a pack of leopards wandering around New Orleans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that be wereleopards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Diana.\u201d I threw up my hands. \u201cI cannot believe we\u2019re discussing wereleopards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut werewolves, no problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believed in them before you did,\u201d I pointed out. \u201cBut even Edward said he hadn\u2019t heard of other shape-shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he said he hadn\u2019t heard of lycanthropy being passed between species. There are more things on this earth than we know. Remember Mrs. Favreau?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Favreau had been a sweet little old lady we\u2019d met while trying to find the loup-garou. Sadly, the loup-garou had found her, but not before she\u2019d given us quite a bit of information.</p><p>\u201cShe told us that the wolf creates the werewolf. Other animals create other monsters.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Favreau had said that. I hadn\u2019t been any happier to hear it then than I was now.</p><p>\u201cFine. So there could be wereleopards, but why would they be here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. Is there something in New Orleans that they might want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are people everywhere,\u201d Diana said, \u201cand a lot more in Haiti than Louisiana. I\u2019d think wereleopards would want to stay where there were other leopards, so as not to stand out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any leopards in Haiti. Never have been. Just like there have never been any timber wolves in Louisiana, but that didn\u2019t stop the loup-garou. Right there in the swamp he was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a curse.\u201d Diana bit her lip. \u201cBut if the leopards appeared because of a curse, too, that probably had something to do with the leopard society. Which originated in Africa, where mere are leopards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd that would explain why leopards showed up in Haiti, or even here.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d lost me. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the Egbo is here, or at least one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d I repeated.</p><p>\u201cCould they be after you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLooks like they were after her.\u201d I j erked my thumb over my back in the direction of the crime scene.</p><p>\u201cThat was just food, or maybe companionship, if she rises.\u201d</p><p>The very idea made me twitchy. \u201cWe should probably do something about that.\u201d</p><p>Diana cast me a quick, wry glance and began to walk. \u201cWhat do you suggest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Let Edward handle it, and let\u2019s get back to the problem at hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat possible reason could the Egbo have for following you? What do you have that they want?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t think of anything I\u2019d taken from Haiti but knowledge.</p><p>And the diamond. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-One</p><p>But I didn\u2019t have it anymore. Murphy did.</p><p>Was I actually buying into this whole wereleopard thing? Not completely. However, something strange was going on, and I appeared to be right in the middle of it.</p><p>\u201cAny ideas?\u201d Diana asked as we reached the shop.</p> <p>She deserved an answer, so I made us more tea, and then I told her what I hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cMurphy stole the diamond,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cTwice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might have magical properties the Egbo needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr it might just be worth a freaking fortune.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOr that.\u201d She sipped her tea and made a face before swallowing. \u201cYou dreamed of the attack as if you were the attacker.\u201d</p><p>I shuddered, remembering the thrill of the chase, the need for the blood, and the taste of it. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it couldn\u2019t have been you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheoretically, no. At two a.m. I was having sex with a diamond thief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat sex?\u201d She wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cThat seems to be the only kind Murphy has.\u201d And I was going to miss it.</p> <p>\u201cSo you think the dream was really a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I didn\u2019t wake up covered in blood, I\u2019m inclined to believe just that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have changed into a leopard, killed the woman, shifted back, taken a shower, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeen all cuddled up in bed when Murphy arrived.\u201d</p><p>Diana shrugged. \u201cStranger things have happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s another explanation. You probably won\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like much lately.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know that when a person is bitten by a werewolf, they change within twenty-four hours\u2014day, night, doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d I nodded. \u201cBut what you probably don\u2019t know is during that time they experience a kind of collective consciousness, imagining the coming change, remembering things that have happened to others. They feel the pain, the power, both the terror and the temptation.\u201d</p><p>Uh-oh. That sounded familiar.</p><p>\u201cYou think the dream was someone else\u2019s memory, and I shared it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than it being yours, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure. Because even if I hadn\u2019t killed that woman, I\u2019d be killing someone soon.</p><p>\u201cWhether it was real or not,\u201d Diana continued, \u201cwe should keep the dream to ourselves. Edward would want to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot me in the head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is his usual method for dealing with problems.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to like that about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet for a moment, sipping tea and thinking.</p><p>\u201cYou need to get the diamond back,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>I snorted. \u201cYep. That\u2019ll happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think Murphy will show up again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got what he wanted; why would he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wanted more than the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf that were true, he wouldn\u2019t have left when I was still sleeping. What kind of guy sneaks out before dawn?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly a guy who feels too much would bother to sneak out too soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuys sneak out all the time so they don\u2019t have to face the morning after. It\u2019s a typical sleazy guy thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d Diana frowned. \u201cI\u2019ve only slept with two men in my life, and I was married to both of them. Actually I wasn\u2019t married to Adam at first, but\u2014\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m probably not qualified to give advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, neither.\u201d</p><p>After a few minutes, the silence made me glance up. Diana stared at me with concern. \u201cI\u2019ve never pressed you, Cassandra, about your past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor which I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there\u2019s something that haunts you. You lost someone, too.\u201d</p><p>Diana had lost her first husband, a man she\u2019d loved very much. His mysterious and violent death had set her on a quest that ended here, in New Orleans.</p><p>\u201cWas it your husband?\u201d she asked.</p><p>I shook my head. I had lost him, but not the way she\u2019d lost hers. And while I\u2019d told Murphy about Sarah, I still wasn\u2019t sure why, I didn\u2019t want to tell Diana. She wasn\u2019t a dummy; she\u2019d figure out what I was up to with the zombie raising, and she\u2019d probably try to stop me. If not her, then Edward certainly would.</p><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t talk about it,\u201d I said.</p><p>Which was true. I wasn\u2019t supposed to tell anyone about my past. WITSEC would have a conniption.</p><p>\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\u201d</p><p>I lifted one shoulder, uncomfortable. We were friends; I should tell her.</p><p>But I wasn\u2019t going to.</p><p>Diana called the next morning and woke me out of a comatose sleep. In an effort to prevent another dream, I\u2019d taken some of my sleeping powder. It had knocked me flat.</p><p>\u201cCassandra? You OK?\u201d</p><p>I must have sounded loopy, maybe because I was. \u201cYeah. What time is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTen thirty. You\u2019re still in bed?\u201d</p><p>I sat up, then stood. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Crap, I should have opened the store by now. I went into the bathroom. A quick glance into the mirror made me frown. I looked like hell.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cEdward\u2019s here. He wants to know when we should meet tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I splashed some water into my eyes, not an easy trick when you\u2019re holding a phone to your ear.</p><p>\u201cFull moon? Raise the dead woman? Ask her how to rid my husband of a curse? Ring any bells?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you high?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry. I took a sleeping powder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad dreams?\u201d She lowered her voice, ostensibly so the old man wouldn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cNot when I take the powder.\u201d But there was something...</p><p>I lifted my head, then stared, transfixed, at the mirror. My eyes were bright green.</p><p>I dropped the phone; it clattered to the floor and I automatically bent to pick it up. When I straightened, my eyes were blue again. What the hell was that?</p><p>\u201cYou OK?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cDropped the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better have some coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t drink coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStart.\u201d</p><p>I leaned in close, tilted my face this way and that. My eyes weren\u2019t green. Although they did seem a lot less blue than I remembered.</p><p>\u201cCassandra?\u201d Diana pressed.</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah.\u201d I forced myself to turn away from the image. \u201cI\u2019ll come to the mansion at dusk. Just after sunset, we\u2019ll try the ritual.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>I made the appropriate farewell noises and hung up. Returning to the bedroom, I sat on the mattress and rubbed my forehead. I was so damn tired. I shouldn\u2019t have used the sleeping powder, because now I couldn\u2019t seem to wake up and tonight I\u2019d need all my energy for the zombie raising.</p><p>I took Diana\u2019s advice and walked to the Caf\u00e9 du Monde for chicory coffee. That stuff\u2019ll wake the dead.</p><p>Perhaps I could just pour some on the voodoo queen\u2019s grave and forget about the blood.</p><p>I finally opened the shop around noon. No one seemed to notice or care that I was late. Midweek in early November was not the height of tourist season.</p><p>I used my downtime to call hotels in the area and ask if Devon Murphy was registered. He wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Not that I\u2019d expected him to be. Knowing Murphy, he was in Oahu by now, his pocket full of cash from the sale of the diamond. He\u2019d lounge on the beach for the rest of his life and seldom think of me.</p><p>I needed to get over him. Too bad all I wanted was to be under him.</p><p>About an hour before dusk, I closed my shop\u2014not a customer had appeared all day\u2014then packed a small satchel with the items I\u2019d need: a knife, two bowls, my ason, a cup, rum, a bottle of water, and bandages. I\u2019d get the blood there.</p><p>Diana\u2019s home had once been a plantation of great beauty. Most such structures in this part of Louisiana were located on the Great River Road, which ran from New Orleans to Baton Rouge. Why there was one here no one seemed to know.</p><p>Diana and Adam planned to restore the mansion to its former state, as soon as they had the money and the time. Right now, the place resembled every haunted house I\u2019d ever seen.</p><p>Sagging, listing porch; at least they\u2019d replaced the broken windows and door. The swamp came right up to the yard. I figured she had to keep a close eye on Luc lest an alligator drag him away, although Luc Ruelle could probably best any alligator in Louisiana.</p><p>Luc opened the door, crying, \u201cPriestess!\u201d at the sight of me, the formal address negated by his enthusiastic hug.</p><p>\u201cI told you to call me Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>He took my hand and dragged me inside. \u201cBut it\u2019s so much more fun to call you Priestess.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. His missing front teeth were just starting to grow in, giving him the appearance of a juvenile j ack-o\u2019-lantern.</p><p>The mansion looked much better on the inside. The place was spotless; the floors had been refinished.</p><p>They had furniture now, even a few curtains.</p><p>Diana had never been a housewife or a mother until a few months ago. I wondered how she managed.</p><p>Of course I\u2019d managed to become a completely different person from the one I\u2019d been without too much trouble.</p><p>The things we do for love.</p><p>My eyes misted, and I blinked several times to make them stop. All I needed was for Edward to see me crying. He\u2019d kick me out of his club.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cassandra, how you been?\u201d</p><p>The man leaning against the entry way to the living room gave meaning to the word sexy\u2014shoulder- length dark hair, smooth bronzed skin, bright blue eyes, and a body that had been honed to perfection years ago.</p><p>\u201cAdam.\u201d I cleared my throat, tried not to drool. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming.\u201d</p><p>He shoved away from the wall, then leaned down to brush my cheek with his lips. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss this for de world.\u201d</p><p>That Cajun accent always made everything he said sound both lazy and oh, so important at the same time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014uh, well...\u201d I wasn\u2019t sure how to tell him I didn\u2019t think everyone and their sister should be at the cemetery. This was going to be my first zombie raising; I didn\u2019t need an audience.</p><p>\u201cRelax. I won\u2019t be goin\u2019 along. Someone has to watch de boy.\u201d He winked at Luc, who\u2019d left my side to lean against his father\u2019s. They resembled each other so closely it would be creepy if it weren\u2019t so cute.</p><p>\u201cOh, right.\u201d I wasn\u2019t used to worrying about babysitters anymore. How quickly we forget.</p><p>Sometimes, lately, I\u2019d had to think really hard to remember the shape of Sarah\u2019s face, and that frightened me.</p><p>\u201cI thought I\u2019d better get home,\u201d Adam continued. \u201cIf you find a way to end de curse, we celebrate. If not</p><p>...\u201d He shrugged, but his eyes were far from indifferent.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t find a way to end the curse, I wasn\u2019t sure what Adam and Diana would do.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d I straightened with determination. \u201cI\u2019ll raise her.\u201d</p><p>I had to. Because the next stop was Sarah.</p><p>\u201cOf course you will.\u201d Edward stood at the top of the steps.</p><p>As unlikely a leader of an elite monster-hunting unit as could be imagined, Edward Mandenauer was well over six feet tall and cadaverous thin. His once blond hair had faded, as had his blue eyes. However, his mind was as sharp as anyone\u2019s.</p><p>He j oined us in the front hall, throwing a sharp glance in Adam\u2019s direction. \u201cDid you do as asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She won\u2019t rise.\u201d</p><p>I figured they were talking about the woman I\u2019d dreamed of.</p><p>\u201cSilver?\u201d Edward asked.</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d Adam glanced pointedly at Luc and they let the subj ect drop.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready to go?\u201d Edward asked.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Diana is.\u201d</p><p>Edward frowned. \u201cWhy do we need her? You are the voodoo priestess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really need you, but I have a feeling you\u2019re still coming.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t bother to answer.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m coming, too.\u201d Diana hurried down the hall from the kitchen. \u201cNo one else knows the location of the voodoo queen\u2019s grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could tell us,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot on your life. This I\u2019ve gotta see.\u201d She turned. \u201cPizza\u2019s in the oven, boys.\u201d</p><p>Not only did they have furniture, but they had electricity also. Life was looking up at the Ruelles\u2019.</p><p>Diana kissed Luc, then Adam, running her fingers along her husband\u2019s cheek and staring into his eyes for a long moment Something passed between them that didn\u2019t need words. I practically sighed out loud.</p><p>How could I miss such a connection when Karl and I had never even had it?</p><p>\u201cEnough kissy-face,\u201d Edward ordered, and Luc giggled. Edward\u2019s stoic blue gaze lowered to the boy.</p><p>\u201cWhat is so funny, young man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said \u2018kissy-face.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI say a lot of things. For instance, \u2018go to bed.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Luc wrinkled his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s not even dark yet.\u201d</p><p>Edward glanced at each of the adults in turn, his expression puzzled. \u201cWhat does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Obviously Edward had spent very little time with children. Not surprising. He\u2019d been busy with the werewolves for the past sixty years.</p><p>A short while later we reached a small, enclosed plot of land set back from the highway. Diana turned onto the dirt road, and we made our way to the gate, then climbed out of the car.</p><p>The sun had fallen, though there was still a thin line of red across the horizon. The moon would be coming up soon\u2014full and bright.</p><p>In the hazy light of dusk, the old slave cemetery was a sepia-toned photograph of a time long gone but never forgotten.</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t any crypts,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cFor slaves?\u201d Diana opened the gate, which wasn\u2019t locked, so why have one? \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought people had to be buried aboveground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly in the city, where burying them in the crypts prevents them from popping out of their graves and floating down the street when it floods.\u201d</p><p>Something that had happened in the past but thankfully did no longer.</p><p>\u201cOut here the land is higher,\u201d Diana continued.</p><p>\u201cBy the swamp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes. Besides, folks didn\u2019t much care if the slaves floated away. They weren\u2019t going to spend money on crypts for dead Africans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe inhumanity of man never ceases to amaze me,\u201d Edward murmured.</p><p>I guess he was an expert on that. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Two</p><p>The three of us stood in a half circle around the only stone marker in the graveyard, as the sun dipped below the trees.</p><p>Edward shone a flashlight across the surface. The years of sun and wind and rain had worn off the name, if there\u2019d ever been one there at all.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure this is it?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cOnly someone of extreme importance would warrant a stone,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the voodoo queen was buried here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at this.\u201d She indicated the far side of the marker, and I bent down next to her.</p><p>Chalked Xs marked the white surface, just as they marked Marie Laveau\u2019s tomb at St. Louis Number One. People believed if they drew the Xs, scratched the ground three times with their feet, or rapped three times on the grave, their wish would be granted.</p><p>Obviously the person buried here had enough power to help devotees from beyond the grave. I only hoped she could help us.</p> <p>\u201cOK,\u201d I agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re certain this is our voodoo queen and not another?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know her name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>In the process of unpacking my bag, I glanced up. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018not really\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s referred to only as the woman of great magic. Is that a problem?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCould be. In everything I\u2019ve read it says you must repeat the name of the dead three times to call them out of the grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what Mezareau did?\u201d</p><p>My forehead creased as I recalled the symphony of names swirling through my head. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, you think so?\u201d Edward demanded. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t told Edward much about the night of the last full moon. I liked my head attached to my shoulders just the way it was.</p><p>\u201cI know the ritual,\u201d I said, which wasn\u2019t an answer, but it was all that I had.</p><p>\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t call her name?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cEither she won\u2019t come,\u201d I threw out my arm, \u201cor I might raise everyone here.\u201d</p> <p>Edward cursed in German. \u201cOut of my way.\u201d He elbowed me aside.</p><p>I frowned as he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, then laid it atop the stone. He ran a pencil quickly back and forth across the page. Diana and I exchanged glances; she shrugged.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cGrave etching. I used to do this as a teenager on a boring Saturday night.\u201d</p><p>Which, somehow, didn\u2019t surprise me.</p><p>\u201cHer name was...\u201d He frowned, straightened, and turned the paper in our direction.</p><p>The word Mawu had appeared in the midst of the pencil marks. Creepy.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cMawu was the creator goddess of Dahomey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA great empire in West Africa where most of the slaves in Haiti came from. The Europeans referred to the area as the Slave Coast because the Dahomey had a great army and they conquered most of the tribes surrounding them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen sold their enemies into slavery,\u201d Diana said.</p><p>\u201cAs well as their own people. The Dahomey were way ahead of the pack in getting rid of undesirables\u2014namely sorcerers and priests. They didn\u2019t take orders very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich meant the religion was transported to Haiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd from there it eventually came here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the religion of Dahomey became voodoo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much, with the addition of whatever other gods and goddesses the slaves wanted to add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll fascinating information,\u201d Edward murmured, \u201cbut what does it have to do with us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMawu wasn\u2019t just a creator goddess; she was also a goddess of the moon.\u201d</p><p>We tilted our heads upward and stared at the rising full white moon.</p><p>\u201cI guess that explains why Henri was so freaked out by my name,\u201d Diana murmured. \u201cHe was cursed by a moon goddess; then I show up with basically the same name, different language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFunny he never mentioned the similarity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHenri didn\u2019t mention much beyond how he wanted to kill me, or screw me, maybe both at the same time, drink my blood, bathe in it, yada yada.\u201d</p><p>Henri had been a real laugh riot.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t seem the type to give a shit about the names of his slaves or what they meant,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cKnowing him, he changed her name to Susie and left it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably,\u201d Diana agreed. \u201cNow that we know her name, let\u2019s get moving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you intend to put her back?\u201d Edward asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you raise the voodoo queen I cannot allow her to leave this graveyard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone might notice a dead woman walking,\u201d Diana said. \u201cEven in New Orleans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s, uh, something I didn\u2019t tell you about the bokor \u2019s zombies.\u201d</p><p>Edward lifted a brow and remained silent, waiting.</p><p>\u201cThey aren\u2019t exactly zombie zombies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d Diana said, \u201cyou aren\u2019t making any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey live again, as if they\u2019d never died. They appear completely human.\u201d</p><p>The two of them stared at me as if I\u2019d lost my mind; then they started to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK.\u201d Diana managed to control her mirth; then she pointed to the grave. \u201cShow me.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the sky\u2014completely dark, except for the perfectly round moon. I picked up the knife and slashed my arm.</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Diana exclaimed. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe ritual.\u201d I let the blood drip into the bowl, then quickly wrapped my arm. \u201cBack up.\u201d</p><p>I did as Mezareau had taught me, filling a second bowl with water from a bottle and sprinkling it in a circle around the grave\u2014me on the inside, Diana and Edward on the outside. I shook my ason and recited the chant.</p><p>\u201cCome back to us now. Come back. Death is not the end. Live again as you once lived. Forget you ever died. Follow me into the world. Come back to us now. Come back.\u201d</p><p>I slammed the rum, tossed the cup over my shoulder, and lifted the bowl full of blood. I waited for the dizziness that had occurred the last time, but it didn\u2019t come. Which was just as well. Since I had to complete the ritual on my own, I needed all my wits.</p><p>Tipping the bowl, I watched the blood tumble through the air and darken the ground that comprised the grave.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>\u201cThe name,\u201d Edward murmured.</p><p>Oh, yeah.</p><p>\u201cMawu. Mawu. Mawu.\u201d</p><p>That worked like a charm.</p><p>The ground tumbled outward, the brown dirt marred with what appeared to be white sand. The earth trembled. I glanced at the others.</p><p>Diana was staring, horrified, fascinated\u2014at me. Edward peered calmly at the ground. I followed his gaze and my mouth fell open.</p><p>What I\u2019d first thought was sand had solidified into bones. That hadn\u2019t happened in Haiti, but then those people had been newly dead, not dust.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t tear my eyes from the sight. The bones moved on their own in a j erky march toward one another; when they met, they knit together. At any moment I expected to hear an old-time chorus of \u201cDry Bones.\u201d</p><p>The knee bone \u2019s connected to the thighbone.</p><p>I shook my head. Now I\u2019d never stop hearing it.</p><p>A skeleton emerged atop the grave. Wet, sucking sounds erupted and flesh appeared from nowhere.</p><p>Slowly, the figure took the shape of a woman and rose.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t look right.</p><p>Her hair had grown back in patches, leaving bald spots all over her head. The ebony flesh had returned, but not all of it, so there were holes here and there where white bone shone through. Her teeth were rotted, her eyelids closed. Would her eyes grow back?</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah, that\u2019s gonna pass for human,\u201d Diana muttered.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I said, and my voice shook. What had I done wrong?</p><p>The zombie\u2019s eyelids opened, and her eyes gazed into mine, dark, endless pools of sorrow. Make that: What had I done?</p><p>\u201cMaster,\u201d she said. \u201cHow may I serve you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaster?\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t, either.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Mawu, the voodoo queen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, master.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you calling me master?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou raised me from the dead to be your slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her head tilted and part of her nose fell off. Diana made a gagging sound. I wanted to do the same.</p><p>\u201cThat is the only reason to raise a zombie. It is why we so fear becoming one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy people were slaves. Only death could release us. To become a slave after death is what we fear the most.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsk her,\u201d Diana interrupted. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long we have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMawu, you cursed a man. Henri Ruelle.\u201d</p><p>She wrapped her skeletal arms around herself and rocked. \u201cI called on the moon to make him a beast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we unmake him?\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened and she spit out a tooth. Lovely.</p><p>\u201cHe was evil even before the curse. Why would you release him?\u201d</p><p>Henri had been a people-owning, selfish prick of a rapist. But this wasn\u2019t about him.</p><p>\u201cWe know what he did to you,\u201d I said gently. \u201cHe deserved to be punished. But... Is it true that when Henri dies the next male in line becomes a loup-garou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. That is how these things are done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a hundred and fifty years. There\u2019s a man and his son who don\u2019t deserve this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Henri still suffering?\u201d</p><p>Elise had tried to cure him, but since Henri had been cursed and not bitten, the cure hadn\u2019t worked very well. Henri now spent a lot of time screaming mindlessly behind the bars of his cage.</p><p>\u201cHe suffers horribly,\u201d I said.</p><p>Mawu smiled, not a pretty sight. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were told only you could end the curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake her,\u201d Diana murmured, her face intense. \u201cShe\u2019s your slave.\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, think of Luc, if not Adam. Think of me. Order her to release Henri. That\u2019s why we did this.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to force the poor woman to do anything; she\u2019d been forced enough. But Diana was right.</p><p>This entire fiasco of a zombie raising would be for nothing if we didn\u2019t get what we\u2019d come for.</p><p>Edward encouraged me with a dip of his chin, so I did what I didn\u2019t want to do. \u201cI command you to remove the curse of the crescent moon from the Ruelle family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did not mean I would not, master; I meant I could not.\u201d</p><p>Diana made a soft sound of distress, and I lifted one hand to silence her. \u201cI was told the voodoo queen who did the cursing could remove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is not true. Only by committing the ultimate sacrifice can a curse be lifted. Only then will Henri and his descendants be freed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the ultimate sacrifice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly Henri can decide that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Diana muttered.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Mawu turned her attention to me. \u201cIs there anything else you require of me, master?\u201d</p><p>I waited until Edward and Diana had moved off a few feet, then put their heads together and started to whisper, before I asked, \u201cDo you know why you came back like this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou called me out of my grave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bokor who taught me the ritual raised the dead to live again\u2014as warm, complete, breathing, thinking people.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and her earring came flying off. I moved closer, squinted. Make that her ear.</p><p>\u201cI have heard of this. To change the shape of the dead\u2014their very nature\u2014a bokor who can change his or her very nature is needed. A lougaro.\u201d</p><p>My heart stuttered. The word was both familiar and slightly different.</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cShape-shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWerewolf?\u201d I whispered.</p><p>\u201cA lougaro can be anything.\u201d</p><p>Of course it could.</p><p>Edward was suddenly right next to me. \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>Nothing I wanted him to hear.</p><p>\u201cShe said I was mistaken,\u201d I blurted. \u201cThe dead can\u2019t be raised to live as before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo shit,\u201d Diana muttered, but Edward contemplated me with an expression bordering on pity. I wondered, not for the first time, how much he knew.</p><p>\u201cYou must never raise the dead again,\u201d Mawu said.</p><p>\u201cWhat about those who shouldn\u2019t be dead?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWho are you to say who should and should not die? Only the Gran Met can decide that.\u201d</p><p>In theory, I agreed with her. In truth, Sarah shouldn\u2019t be dead.</p><p>For a walking corpse Mawu was very perceptive. She grabbed my arm. I could feel every bone in her hand pressing against my skin. I fought not to pull away, afraid I\u2019d take several of her appendages with me.</p><p>\u201cDeath is just the beginning,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOf what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next adventure in our path.\u201d</p><p>The far-off shriek of something large and furry made all of us turn our heads.</p><p>\u201cBobcat,\u201d I murmured, really hoping I was right.</p><p>Mawu\u2019s face became fearful. \u201cPlease put me back, master. Quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how to return her to the grave?\u201d Edward asked.</p><p>I lifted my hand and blew salt into her face. A bright light nearly blinded me as she burst into a million silver sparkles. When I opened my eyes again, the voodoo queen was gone. I began to stuff my utensils into my bag.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Renee,\u201d Edward said, \u201conly a bokor can raise the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>He stepped into the circle and pressed a silver crucifix to my forehead.</p><p>I j erked away. \u201cKnock that off!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just raised the dead, which makes you an evil sorcerer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told me to!\u201d</p><p>He sniffed. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make you any less evil.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not evil. Or at least I\u2019m not any more evil than the next person. And you can quit poking me with silver.\u201d</p><p>I wiggled my fingers, which I\u2019d kept adorned in silver rings ever since I\u2019d met Henri. Then I lifted my knife and pointed to the wound I\u2019d made with it.</p><p>Edward shrugged. \u201cWho is to say silver works on a sorcerer anyway.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Three</p><p>Ten minutes later we drove toward the mansion.</p><p>\u201cI really thought it would work,\u201d I murmured.</p><p>\u201cYou raised her,\u201d Diana said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe wasn\u2019t much help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know Henri has to commit the ultimate sacrifice to be cured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what that is.\u201d</p><p>Together we sighed.</p><p>I left them at the mansion and returned to my shop. Letting myself in the front door, once again I missed the sound of Lazarus\u2019s slither. I was so alone here, and it was starting to prey on my mind.</p> <p>Maybe it was all that had happened tonight, or all that hadn\u2019t. I was slightly hysterical at the loss of my dream.</p><p>Which might have been why I didn\u2019t notice there was a man in my room until he grabbed me. Hand to hand was not my thing; I was much better with a knife. Unfortunately, I\u2019d left the weapon in my bag and my bag was still in the car.</p><p>Brains were clearly not my thing, either.</p><p>I stomped on his instep, heard a hiss of pain that sounded familiar, spun with the heel of my hand speeding toward his nose, and recognized the tangle of Murphy\u2019s hair in the silvery light from the full moon shining through my open bedroom window.</p><p>He caught my wrist. \u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDammit, Murphy.\u201d I tugged, but he wouldn\u2019t let me go, instead drawing me closer. \u201cI could have stabbed you.\u201d</p> <p>His free hand patted me down, lingering in places that would have gotten him a lawsuit if he\u2019d actually been a cop. \u201cWith what? You don\u2019t seem to be carrying.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly I was so tired, so depressed, so damned sad and lonely, I wanted to cry. To my horror, I snuffled.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He leaned down to look into my face. Tears spilled onto my cheeks. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014I--I raised the voodoo queen from the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you now? And I\u2019d think that would be makin\u2019 you happy, not sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuit with the Irish,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI raised her, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Quickly I filled him in on the \u201cbut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the only reason Mezareau could raise such nonzombie zombies was because he was a werewolf?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a wolf. Leopard, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Wereleopard. You bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cListen to yourself, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw the zombies, the waterfall, the baka. Yet you balk at believing in a wereleopard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to draw the line somewhere,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI killed him,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd ruined any chance of ever seeing Sarah again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not so bad.\u201d</p><p>I shoved him away. \u201cYou\u2019ve never loved anyone the way that I love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObsessively?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being obsessive; I\u2019m being a mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSame difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you\u2019d be lounging on a beach by now. Where have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround.\u201d</p><p>I lifted a brow. \u201cHow informative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to see me.\u201d He brushed my cheek with his fingertips.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think?\u201d</p><p>I backed away, leaving his hand poised in the air, nowhere near my face. \u201cFor the diamond.\u201d</p><p>He lowered his arm. \u201cI\u2019ve already got the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSafe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiana thinks there\u2019s another member of the Egbo in town looking for the j ewel. We need to give it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinders keepers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou stole it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your point?\u201d</p><p>I ignored the question because I\u2019d had an idea. \u201cIf there\u2019s a member of the Egbo, the leopard society, turning furry and running around New Orleans killing people, that\u2019s a shape-shifter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the J\u00e4ger-Suchers kill them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d I said absently. \u201cBut maybe I can get it to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra,\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to worry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly starting?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t smile.</p><p>\u201cI already know the ritual,\u201d I said eagerly, \u201cand it works; I proved that. But if I need to be a shape- shifter to raise the living dead, then that\u2019s what I\u2019ll become.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow are you going to stop me?\u201d</p><p>He cursed in a language I didn\u2019t understand, shoved his fingers through his hair, then took a few steps toward the window as if he meant to leave. I couldn\u2019t blame him; I was irrational.</p><p>Instead of climbing out, he leaned on the sill, took a deep breath of the silvery night air, then laughed a little and turned.</p><p>He crossed the short distance between us before I realized he was coming, then yanked me into his arms and kissed me. I should have shoved him away, but I couldn\u2019t. I needed him to touch me, to make me forget for just a little while that my life sucked and probably always would.</p><p>His mouth devoured mine, rough, reckless, tongues and lips and teeth at war. He seemed as desperate as I was, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. But I wasn\u2019t going to ask, either, maybe have him decide that this was such a bad idea.</p><p>His hands were everywhere, clever fingers stroking, teasing, arousing. His mouth beat a moist path across my j aw, to my neck.</p><p>\u201cCass,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>I grabbed his head, lifted it, and muttered, \u201cDon\u2019t talk,\u201d then crushed our lips together, tangling my fingers in his hair all the way to the scalp.</p><p>No one had ever called me Cass, probably because Cassandra wasn\u2019t even my name, but having Murphy call me that put an intimacy on this relationship that frightened me.</p><p>Murphy and I were lovers without the love, partners without the trust. Basically we were two ships that banged each other in the night. If I weren\u2019t careful, I\u2019d sink to the bottom of depression ocean when he left. I couldn\u2019t let myself care.</p><p>Sure he\u2019d come back, even after he had the diamond, but that was for sex. I wasn\u2019t so delusional that I thought a guy like Murphy and a voodoo priestess like me could ever find a life. Especially once I became a shape-shifter and raised a living zombie child.</p><p>I shoved that thought right out of my head. Talk about a mood killer.</p><p>In an attempt to feel something other than nothing, I focused on the sensations\u2014his mouth, his hands against my skin, the drift of his hair along my cheek.</p><p>I stroked him through the loose khaki of his slacks, rolling my thumb over his tip, skated my fingernail down his length. He hissed in a breath and grabbed my wrist, but I twisted away.</p><p>Every time he tried to slow things down, I used all that I knew about sex, about him, to speed it up. Soon he was as crazy as I was and needed very little encouragement to toss off his clothes and tumble with me onto the bed.</p><p>Desperation clawed at my stomach, a desire to forget all in a mindless bout of sex, to feel alive when everything about me\u2014my dreams, my child, my life\u2014seemed dead.</p><p>My skin felt on fire, that familiar yet new sensation of being too small for my body. I put it down to the heat, the humidity, the arousal. I wanted to burst free, but I needed some help.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I whispered, and guided him to me.</p><p>At first he followed my lead. Hard and fast, he made me forget everything but him and me, together like this.</p><p>I was close to the edge when he stilled, deep inside. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to, but he refused to move. Even when I arched my back, attempting to create the friction I craved, he just used his superior weight and strength to hold me beneath him in a suspended state of arousal.</p><p>My hair itched; my nose ached; my very fingernails tingled. The only way to make it stop was to come, and unless I looked at him, that wasn\u2019t going to happen.</p><p>I opened my eyes, ready to spit in anger, and he leaned forward, pressing his lips to my brow, my cheek, my chin. The gentleness of the gesture made my throat go thick with an emotion I refused to put a name to.</p><p>He sighed and tipped his forehead against mine. His hair shrouded our faces, creating a curtain that encased only us. Our breath mingled, his brushing my lips, making me shiver.</p><p>As the full moon spilled through the window, sprinkling silvery shadows everywhere, he flexed his hips just a little, just enough to touch me in ways I\u2019d never been touched.</p><p>\u201cDevon?\u201d I whispered for the very first time, sensing something new, something frightening, just over the horizon.</p><p>The orgasm hit us both as the last thread of his name faded into the night. He shuddered in my arms; I shivered in his, and in the distance the shriek of a wild thing called to me.</p><p>Even while forgetting, I could not forget.</p><p>When the last tremors died, he rolled away, and I felt bereft. What was wrong with me? I\u2019d never needed him to stay before.</p><p>I turned my head; he turned his.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, which sounded crass, but he smiled.</p><p>\u201cJolis yeux verts,\u201d he murmured, expression dopey with sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cPretty green eyes,\u201d he said, and drifted away.</p><p>I slid from the bed and hurried to the mirror. Staring out of my face were the bright green eyes of a jungle cat. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Four</p><p>My head erupted with a pain so great I fell to the floor on my hands and knees, writhing as the agony continued. I tried to call for Murphy, but the only sound I made was a feeble, animal-like whimper that was drowned out by the distant bong of a clock striking midnight.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t catch my breath; every inch of me was on fire. I wanted to press my cheek against the cool tile of the bathroom floor, but when I did it was as if something lay between my skin and the smooth surface, preventing me from touching it.</p><p>Another wave of pain hit, and mercifully I passed out.</p> <p>I awoke in an alley. Every voice on the street echoed in my head; every scent made my nostrils flare. I stared at the full moon framed by an ebony sky. The shiny silver disk seemed to ebb and flow, both sound and light; I heard its song in the pulse of my blood.</p><p>And speaking of blood...</p><p>I breathed in deeply. Somewhere nearby, there was a lot of it.</p><p>Slowly I rose and saw the dead man only a few feet away. Something had torn out his throat. My stomach rolled, making a gurgling growl of hunger. Why did I suddenly smell meat?</p><p>I felt so strange, both dizzy and uncertain but at the same time stronger and ultra-aware. My limbs didn\u2019t want to obey my mind\u2019s commands. I could do nothing but crawl on all fours.</p> <p>I tried to remember how I had gotten here, and the pain flared. I hung my head, shut out the bright moonlight until the agony receded and I could open my eyes.</p><p>Only to stare at the bloody paws on the ground in front of me.</p><p>I glanced up, expecting to come face-to-face with a leopard. But I was alone in the alley.</p><p>Once again I looked down. The paws were facing in the wrong direction to belong to anyone else but me.</p><p>I tried to laugh\u2014I was dreaming again\u2014but the sound that came out of my mouth was the furious call of a wild cat.</p><p>I backed away from the man\u2014tempted to smell him, taste him, and that just wouldn\u2019t do. For all I knew, one little taste could make this dream real.</p> <p>But wasn\u2019t that what I wanted?</p><p>I forced myself forward. The thought of what I was about to do excited and disgusted me. I was both leopard and woman. Priestess and J\u00e4ger-Sucher. Two natures, one mind.</p><p>As I lowered my head, my nose brushed the body, and the click of a gun split the silence.</p><p>I glanced up; a man stood at the entrance of the alley. The streetlight cast him in silhouette, but I knew who it was.</p><p>Edward didn\u2019t wait for me to explain\u2014as if I could with my snout problem\u2014he just shot me.</p><p>However, I\u2019d started moving the instant I recognized him, and the bullet that had been meant for my head plowed into my shoulder. The sharp, slicing pain made me stumble, but since I didn\u2019t explode, I kept running.</p><p>I was down by the wharf, not too far from home. I kept to the shadows near the buildings, zigging right, zagging left, leaving Edward behind with ease.</p><p>People brain, cat body\u2014if it weren\u2019t for the blood-lust, this wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p> <p>Moments later I reached my shop and jumped in through the open back window\u2014a lot of things were much easier on cat legs.</p><p>Murphy was gone. Thank goodness for small favors. Because as soon as I was inside, I passed out again.</p><p>I awoke to the sun streaming across my face. The birds were chirping. I had feet, not paws. Life was good.</p><p>I rolled my shoulder\u2014not a twinge\u2014felt for a bullet hole, found nothing. Not only that, but the arm I\u2019d slashed with a silver knife yesterday sported no bandage, no scab, not even a scar.</p><p>I rubbed at my forehead and something crackled. When I lowered my hand, dried blood marred my fingers.</p><p>As I ran into the bathroom, I kicked something small and hard beneath my bed. I didn\u2019t have time to wonder what it was; I barely reached the toilet before I threw up.</p><p>When I was through, I took a shower, brushed my teeth. Even before I looked into the mirror I knew what I\u2019d see. My eyes had turned green, and they hadn\u2019t turned back.</p><p>The phone shrilled; my sharp, shocked intake of breath sounded like a shriek. I hurried into the bedroom and grabbed the receiver before it could ring again. The shrill sound made my head ache.</p><p>\u201cI know what\u2019s wrong with your python.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d forgotten the problem with Lazarus when I started having problems with humanity.</p><p>The vet continued speaking. \u201cYesterday a technician forgot to put back one of the patients. Said patient wandered near Lazarus, and the snake flipped out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not getting you. What patient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He laughed. \u201cA cat. Some snakes hate them. Lazarus seems to be one.\u201d</p><p>This news coming so soon after my nightmare that wasn\u2019t exactly a nightmare explained a lot of things.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a cat,\u201d I said numbly.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you held one? Then you\u2019d smell like one. Snakes can be very perceptive.\u201d</p><p>Lazarus certainly was. He\u2019d figured out what was happening before anyone else had.</p><p>My eyes had become greener even in Haiti, but I\u2019d blown off the change as too much reflective, magical jungle.</p><p>My senses had sharpened. I\u2019d healed a little faster. Of course nothing good genes and healthy living couldn\u2019t explain away.</p><p>Until last night.</p><p>I must have made the appropriate responses to the vet, because he said good-bye, and I hung up, then sat heavily on the side of the bed.</p><p>I\u2019d hoped I\u2019d had another dream, but what about the blood, the speed-of-light healing of my arm, if not my bullet wound? Had there been a bullet wound?</p><p>I slid from the bed and crawled underneath, fingers reaching for something small and hard, the something I\u2019d kicked as I ran. It didn\u2019t take me long to recover the silver bullet. Obviously my body had expelled it when I shifted back into a woman.</p><p>\u201cA handy talent to have,\u201d I murmured, tossing the thing onto my nightstand.</p><p>Looked like I didn\u2019t have to become a shape-shifter; I already was.</p><p>But how? I hadn\u2019t been bitten.</p><p>\u201cNeither was Henri.\u201d</p><p>The sound of my own voice made me jump. Talking to myself probably wasn\u2019t the best idea, but I had no one else. If I told Diana what I suspected, she might tell Edward, and we already knew what he\u2019d do about it.</p><p>\u201cShoot me with silver, although that doesn\u2019t seem to work.\u201d</p><p>There were still some holes in my logic. I\u2019d thought I\u2019d been unable to raise a living zombie because I wasn\u2019t a shape-shifter. Yet I was. So what had gone wrong at the cemetery?</p><p>The doorbell rang, and then it didn\u2019t stop. Either the thing was stuck or there was an emergency, either of which had to be dealt with, so I threw on some clothes and hurried through the store.</p><p>Since I figured the culprit was Diana, I threw open the door, flinching at the sight of Edward. I had expected him to shoot me again, but he was unarmed. How strange.</p><p>\u201cRenee just called.\u201d He shoved past me without being invited. \u201cPeople are still disappearing in Haiti. I thought you said the bokor was dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was. Is,\u201d I corrected.</p><p>\u201cYou checked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t check?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cNot me personally.\u201d I\u2019d been a little freaked over killing a man. \u201cMurphy.\u201d</p><p>Edward scowled. \u201cDid you at least shoot him with silver?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShoot, stab, same difference, right?\u201d</p><p>One of the first things Edward had taught me\u2014silver works for man and beast. Although it didn\u2019t appear to be working on every beast.</p><p>\u201cHe did not explode?\u201d Edward pressed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen like the bokor never die easily. Especially when they are not men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think he was a man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a werewolf.\u201d</p><p>Edward stared at me for a minute, then murmured, \u201cI shot a leopard last night, which didn\u2019t explode, either. The animal had just killed a man.\u201d</p><p>I made a soft sound of distress. The animal was me, and I had killed that man\u2014though I didn\u2019t remember doing it. I didn\u2019t remember a lot of things lately.</p><p>Edward cast me a harsh glance. \u201cYou cannot be squeamish if you are to work for me.\u201d</p><p>I nodded and said nothing, but he didn\u2019t require any commentary. \u201cWe can\u2019t be sure that the victim won\u2019t rise. I shot him with silver, but that will probably not work. I am thinking wereleopards need to be shot with something other than that.\u201d</p><p>I was thinking the same thing.</p><p>\u201cI will call Renee, set Diana to the research.\u201d He opened the door, and sunlight streamed over us both.</p><p>With a scowl, he grasped my chin and lifted my face. \u201cYour eyes. They were blue.\u201d</p><p>Son of a bitch! It wasn\u2019t easy being green. I\u2019d forgotten my sudden change of shade, which was understandable. I didn\u2019t suddenly see everything through green-colored glasses instead of blue.</p><p>\u201cMy contacts,\u201d I blurted.</p><p>He squinted, peering at my irises. \u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou rang the bell before I could put them in.\u201d I stepped out of his grasp, his clawlike fingers seeming to leave a dent in my flesh. \u201cYou know I\u2019m in witness protection.\u201d He nodded; he\u2019d known. \u201cI started wearing blue lenses, figured it couldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d</p><p>Edward grunted and left, but he\u2019d be back. Probably with twenty rounds of whatever it took to kill a wereleopard.</p><p>I had to sit down, so I stumbled to a chair, fell into it, then put my head between my knees and tried to breathe. Sure I\u2019d wanted to be a shape-shifter, so I could shift the shape of my child from dead to alive.</p><p>However, it hadn\u2019t occurred to me that in doing so I\u2019d be changing the shape of countless others\u2014 from alive to dead.</p><p>I shuddered at the thought of killing someone, then drinking their blood, eating their flesh. If I was really a wereleopard, shouldn\u2019t I like it?</p><p>Werewolves turned evil when they turned. Why hadn\u2019t I?</p><p>The front door opened. Edward returning, no doubt, with second thoughts on my blue-contacts explanation. I was surprised he\u2019d bought it in the first place.</p><p>I really should have gotten out of New Orleans while the getting was good, but now it was too late.</p><p>I lifted my head, prepared to explain everything, but the words froze on my lips at the sight of Jacques Mezareau. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Five</p><p>\u201cPriestess.\u201d Mezareau closed the door behind him, shutting out the light. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new world for you today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I could do nothing but stare at him. I\u2019d suspected he wasn\u2019t dead, yet still it was so strange to see him.</p><p>He appeared just as he had in Haiti\u2014linen shirt and trousers, dark hair combed just so, green eyes far too bright in his semidark face. The only differences I could detect in him were his shoes\u2014sandals\u2014 and his turning up alive.</p> <p>\u201cWh-why? How?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour questions will soon be answered.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, and I was struck again by his precise and numerous teeth. I ran my tongue over my own.</p><p>Were there more today than yesterday?</p><p>\u201cFirst, Priestess, I have a question of my own: Where\u2019s the diamond?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>He backhanded me so hard I flew into a shelf of bottles and bones. Everything shattered but me.</p><p>\u201cI know you have it.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. Nothing rattled. Except for the glass in my ass, I was good.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d I wasn\u2019t going to tell him Murphy did, though I was sure he\u2019d figure it out quickly enough. I needed to stall. \u201cGo ahead and look.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau tore the place apart, and I let him. Though I wasn\u2019t sure how I could stop the man, and really what difference did it make? As he\u2019d said, today my world was new, and in it I doubted I\u2019d be able to continue as a voodoo priestess in the French Quarter, even if I managed to escape Edward\u2019s wrath.</p> <p>The knowledge saddened me. I\u2019d liked it here, when I could forget why I\u2019d come.</p><p>\u201cI tried to raise a zombie,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess.\u201d He smashed the glass on one of my display cases and tossed things hither and yon.</p><p>\u201cYour zombie wasn\u2019t quite right.\u201d</p><p>I remembered the voodoo queen\u2019s steadily disintegrating face. \u201cI\u2019ll say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly under a full moon at midnight, during a ceremony performed by a wereleopard, can the living dead be raised.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo other type of shifter will do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are a select club.\u201d</p> <p>No kidding.</p><p>\u201cI was a shape-shifter,\u201d I said slowly. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were not a wereleopard yet. The first transformation takes time. Didn\u2019t you notice the small alterations that came about bit by bit?\u201d He waved a careless hand at my eyes.</p><p>I didn\u2019t bother to answer; I wasn\u2019t blind, although I had been a bit dumb.</p><p>\u201cUntil the midnight moon, when your first complete change occurred, you were not truly one of us and you did not have the power to raise a living zombie.\u201d</p><p>That made sense\u2014or as much sense as anything else did lately.</p><p>\u201cSo, full midnight moon\u2014\u201d I held up one finger. \u201cCeremony performed by a wereleopard\u2014\u201d I flipped up another. \u201cThat\u2019s all there is to the spell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat and the fucking diamond!\u201d</p><p>A chill passed over me. \u201cWe need the diamond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you think I care so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s expensive?\u201d</p><p>He cast me a withering glare. \u201cConsidering I can raise the dead, do you think I lack for money?\u201d</p><p>Good point.</p><p>He crossed the distance that separated us so fast I didn\u2019t see him coming until he was there. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>This time I was ready, and I caught his hand before it smashed into my face.</p><p>\u201cHow did you do this to me?\u201d I shoved him, and he stumbled back several feet.</p><p>He was strong, but now so was I. Being a wereleopard had its uses. If it weren\u2019t for the need to commit bloody murder, I might like it.</p><p>\u201cWhy so angry?\u201d He circled me like the beast he was. \u201cYou came to me. You asked me to share my secret.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t blameless. However, I did think it was common courtesy to tell someone before you turned them into a wereleopard.</p><p>\u201cWhat, exactly , did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little curse.\u201d He tilted his head, the movement more canine than feline. \u201cNothing to be so upset about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t remember a curse.\u201d</p><p>Of course, after I\u2019d drunk the kleren, I didn\u2019t remember much.</p><p>\u201cMore of a potion really.\u201d</p><p>Aha. That explained why I\u2019d gotten loopy after drinking his rum and stayed sane after drinking my own.</p><p>\u201cWhat was it?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cA secret passed down from my ancestors.\u201d I could tell by his smirk he wasn\u2019t going to give me the recipe.</p><p>\u201cAre there more wereleopards running around somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d He leaned in close and took a deep breath. \u201cYou smell so good,\u201d he purred. \u201cPerhaps we can create more of our kind in an intimate way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. That\u2019ll happen.\u201d I shoved him in the chest. This time when he fell back, he stayed there.</p><p>\u201cYou will change your mind.\u201d He licked his lips as his gaze wandered over me. I suddenly felt the need for a scalding hot shower and a bar of lye soap. \u201cThe longer you are a shifter, the more of a shifter you become. Soon you will be like me in all ways. The thrill of the chase, the excitement of the kill\u2014it\u2019s better than sex.\u201d</p><p>His words made me shudder as I recalled dreams that hadn\u2019t been my own. \u201cI remember things that haven\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can walk through your dreams, Priestess. If you wish, you can walk through mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel evil,\u201d I whispered.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cYou will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI killed a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast night? No. I did. But next month you may have the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must partake of human blood on the night of the full moon or go mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did. You just don\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>I thought of how I\u2019d woken up\u2014blood on my hands, my face. I suspected he was right and I wanted to throw up again, but I didn\u2019t have the time.</p><p>\u201cWe may shift any night we wish,\u201d he continued. \u201cOn those nights, the hunt is just for fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we are like werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know nothing of werewolves, nor do I care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSilver doesn\u2019t kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing can.\u201d</p><p>Somehow I doubted that, but I\u2019d come back to it.</p><p>\u201cWhy a potion and not a bite?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t diseased,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cJust cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI prefer to believe I\u2019m blessed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would.\u201d</p><p>I considered what he\u2019d told me. The shift wasn\u2019t the result of a virus, which meant Elise couldn\u2019t cure me, just as she hadn\u2019t been able to cure Henri.</p><p>When had I begun to consider a cure? Probably from the moment I\u2019d seen the blood beneath my fingernails. Really, once I raised Sarah, I couldn\u2019t keep turning into a leopard under every full moon.</p><p>What would the neighbors say?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t shift when the moon came up,\u201d I pointed out.</p><p>\u201cJust as the sun is at its peak at noon, the moon is at its peak at midnight. The first shift requires such power. From that point onward, the power is in you.\u201d He brushed his hands together. \u201cNow, the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought we were all-powerful beings. Why do we need a stone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe diamond focuses the moon and the magic. It was found in the motherland.\u201d</p><p>I frowned. \u201cGermany?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have been talking to Mandenauer too much. The diamond was birthed in the earth of Africa. The power of the ages is in every facet. When the Egbo was first formed, the diamond was the center of all.</p><p>The members learned the secret to changing shape by staring into its sparkling center.\u201d</p><p>Sounded like BS to me, but then a lot of legends did.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying the Egbo was actually a leopard society, with real leopards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you think they kept the slaves in line?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTorture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile that is great fun, seeing a man change into a leopard, tear out a few hearts, drink a little blood, always worked much better. There was also the very real threat they would be turned into a zombie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Egbo turned people into zombies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear, where do you think this all began?\u201d</p><p>My front door rattled, then opened. Devon Murphy strolled in carrying two cups of coffee and a bag of beignets. Since when did he use the front door?</p><p>He didn\u2019t notice Mezareau and me in the shadows of the shop. He didn\u2019t notice the place had been trashed. He was too busy balancing the coffee and the doughnuts, trying to shut the door with his foot.</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s smile became predatory. His too-numerous teeth suddenly looked sharper. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t know where the diamond is, Priestess, but I bet he does.\u201d</p><p>Murphy spun at the sound of Mezareau\u2019s voice. He managed to hold on to breakfast, until the bokor swept everything out of his hands.</p><p>I sprang between them. \u201cNo,\u201d I said firmly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had him detained,\u201d Mezareau said, in a voice that reminded me of Lazarus. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t have the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe still doesn\u2019t,\u201d I said, desperate to make Mezareau believe me. Murphy wasn\u2019t going to give the thing up, if he even had it anymore. He\u2019d probably let the bokor kill him instead.</p><p>Mezareau just laughed. \u201cHe gave it to you, or most likely hid it in your luggage, then romanced it out from under you.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI thought you were smarter, Priestess, but you are still only a woman.\u201d</p><p>I gritted my teeth but let that pass. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the diamond since Haiti.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe this will refresh your memory.\u201d</p><p>I expected him to toss me aside, make a grab for Murphy, who\u2019d been annoyingly silent through this whole exchange. Instead, Mezareau produced a knife made of dark stone, the handle wood. When he pressed it to my throat, my skin began to smoke, and I cried out.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell!\u201d Murphy yanked me backward.</p><p>Slipping and sliding a bit until we got out of the puddle of spilled coffee, he then wrapped his arms around me from behind and tugged me close.</p><p>Mezareau lifted a brow. \u201cI can easily stick this into her chest, and she will explode in a burning ball of fire.\u201d</p><p>I slapped my hand to my aching neck. \u201cI thought you said nothing could kill us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Murphy demanded.</p><p>\u201cHe seems to have turned me into a wereleopard.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stiffened. \u201cCass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have time to argue. Even if you don\u2019t believe it, he does.\u201d</p><p>Murphy\u2019s chest rose and fell on a sigh. \u201cYou want your diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always were sharp. Simply put, turn over my property, and I won\u2019t turn her into flamb\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>I wondered if I could grab the knife before Mezareau buried it in my chest. I was quicker than I\u2019d been yesterday, but Mezareau had been a furry feline longer. I doubted I was quicker than him.</p><p>I needed to move away so Murphy didn\u2019t get turned to ashes along with me. Or maybe I should continue to block his body with mine so Mezareau couldn\u2019t stick him with the knife? Sharp black stone would kill Murphy as easily as it would me, even without the fireworks.</p><p>Before I could decide, Murphy did. \u201cI\u2019ll get you the diamond.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau appeared as shocked as I was at Murphy\u2019s easy capitulation. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I left a j ewel of that size in a hotel room or even a safe-deposit box? I left it somewhere secure, protected. Somewhere that someone I trust will move it the instant anyone else shows up but me, or even if anyone shows up with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve done this before.\u201d Mezareau kept his bright gaze on Murphy\u2019s face. \u201cFine. Bring me the diamond within the hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me,\u201d Mezareau interrupted. \u201cYou think I\u2019d let the priestess out of my sight? You think I give a shit what you need? I\u2019m not stupid. Bring me the diamond or she dies.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. The only hope we had of stopping Mezareau was keeping the diamond away from him. Even though I wasn\u2019t keen on the idea of helping him now, by next month I might be. Together we\u2019d be unstoppable. We\u2019d raise the dead until there weren\u2019t any left; then our army would march across the world.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do it,\u201d I said. \u201cBetter I die than he raises that army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t let him kill you,\u201d Murphy whispered, and then he was gone.</p><p>Hell. I should have told him to find Edward. The old man would know what to do. Now it was too late.</p><p>\u201cMore important than a diamond, Priestess.\u201d Mezareau\u2019s smirk made me want to smash something: How about him? \u201cAren\u2019t you pleased?\u201d</p><p>I stared at the open front door through which Murphy had disappeared. \u201cYou won\u2019t kill me,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d He gave the word that annoying twist that only the French are able to manage.</p><p>\u201cYou had a reason for cursing me instead of someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOui. You were chosen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed my forehead. \u201d I came looking for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted you to.\u201d</p><p>My hand fell away. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe voodoo community may be spread all over the world, but it\u2019s still very small. People talk; I listen.</p><p>They began talking of you almost as soon as you started your training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m white?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical.\u201d He made a sound of derision. \u201cAs if that makes you special. It is what is in here.\u201d He tapped my forehead with one long fingernail. \u201cAnd here.\u201d He did the same to my breastbone. \u201cThat matters. All that has happened was ordained long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou became who you are; you needed what I knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou possess the power necessary to make the dead rise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought that was in the shape-shifting and the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you. I couldn\u2019t turn just anyone into a wereleopard. You are favored by the loas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything more powerful than anyone else,\u201d I protested.</p><p>\u201cYou sent your friend to Ife. Brought her out again with a piece of the moon goddess\u2019s garden.\u201d</p><p>Crap. How did he know about the time I\u2019d sent Diana to voodoo heaven? That was supposed to be our little secret.</p><p>\u201cDo you read minds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But part of the magic in being a wereleopard is being able to see and hear over a great distance \u2014if someone happens to say my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe power will come to you, too, eventually.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, uncertain I wanted to listen in on people\u2019s conversations\u2014seemed a little evil.</p><p>No kidding.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t done anything great since,\u201d I hedged. \u201cIfe was probably just an accident. A burp in the mystical universe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sent the dead and you sent them away. Only a mambo of incredible power can do that.\u201d</p><p>He had me there.</p><p>\u201cThen you conjured your daughter into my jungle.\u201d</p><p>The room was suddenly icy cold. \u201cThat was a dream.\u201d</p><p>Mezareau\u2019s too-green eyes narrowed. \u201cDo your dreams often leave footprints?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d I managed.</p><p>\u201cShe is still dead, Priestess, but for an instant she was with you. She can be again, forever, if you help me on the next midnight moon. Together we will raise my army.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>His smile was a perfect imitation of the cat with canary feathers sticking out one side of its mouth. \u201cThen I will give you the diamond.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Six</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe for a minute that Mezareau would just give me the diamond and let me waltz out of Haiti.</p><p>However, I wasn\u2019t going to tell him that.</p><p>The day passed slowly. Mezareau made me leave the Closed sign in the window. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m foolish enough to allow one of your J\u00e4ger-Sucher friends to just walk in and kill me?\u201d</p> <p>I had been hoping. There was only one problem.</p><p>\u201cThey think you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEdward Mandenauer is no fool, either.\u201d</p><p>True. From the beginning Edward hadn\u2019t believed Mezareau was dead. But would Edward be able to figure out how to kill a wereleopard, then come back here in time to do so? As the day waned toward dusk, I had my doubts.</p><p>Looked like I was on my own. But that was nothing new.</p> <p>I cleaned up the coffee, tossed the beignets, once my favorite food. The scent of fried dough and sugar now turned my stomach. Pretty much everything did. Would I soon be able to eat nothing but raw meat?</p><p>I\u2019d never cared for it.</p><p>I got so bored, I began to sweep up glass and put my shop to rights. Mezareau spent his time paging through my library. I\u2019d accumulated a lot of supernatural texts even before I\u2019d begun to work for Edward.</p><p>I\u2019d always been interested in the bizarre. How else would I have come up with the idea of becoming a voodoo priestess?</p><p>Night fell; the moon rose. I was compelled to enter my courtyard and stare at the nearly perfect orb.</p><p>\u201cSometimes I swear it sings to me.\u201d</p> <p>Mezareau had followed me out. He\u2019d followed me everywhere today. I\u2019d had to put my foot down at letting him follow me into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your friend?\u201d Mezareau asked.</p><p>I\u2019d started to believe that Murphy wasn\u2019t coming. What would Mezareau do once he figured it out? Tear apart the city, the county, the country, as he\u2019d torn apart my shop?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right here.\u201d</p><p>I turned, and there he was in the doorway. Murphy had come back for me.</p><p>My stomach fluttered. He was risking his life and his future. No one had ever done anything like that for me before. What did it mean?</p><p>I glanced at Mezareau and my stomach stopped fluttering. What did it matter?</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the diamond?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cSafe.\u201d</p><p>I thought I was far enough away to avoid getting a knife to my throat again, but I was still unfamiliar with the speed at which Mezareau could move. The blade burned my neck before I knew it was coming.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m through fucking around,\u201d Mezareau snarled.</p><p>\u201cOK, OK.\u201d Murphy removed the stone from his pocket. \u201cPut the knife down, and I\u2019ll do the same with the diamond.\u201d</p><p>The sharp edge lifted just a little.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as he does, Cassandra, get over here,\u201d Murphy ordered.</p><p>The burn returned, and I hissed in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou want this or not?\u201d Murphy snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou seem under the impression that you are in charge here. I could kill you with ease, Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as easily as you think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201d Mezareau shoved me, and I stumbled on the uneven garden path, then fell.</p><p>When I glanced up, Mezareau had lifted his face and his hands to the moon. The silver glow streamed over him like a spotlight, and the edges of his silhouette shimmered, shifted, went indistinct.</p><p>The sheen from above seemed to shoot into his body, so bright I had to blink. When my eyes opened, a leopard stood where the bokor had been.</p><p>The beast appeared larger than the average leopard\u2014not that I\u2019d seen any except in the zoo. However, I didn\u2019t think they ran to six feet, plus a tail, or weighed near 170 pounds.</p><p>His coat was shiny, tawny, spotted\u2014I could see why leopards had once been poached almost to extinction. I wouldn\u2019t mind wearing one of those on my back. Right now I\u2019d kind of like to wear him \u2014then he wouldn\u2019t be staring at Murphy out of hungry emerald green eyes.</p><p>Of all the things that might bother me about this leopard, the eyes bothered me the most, because just like werewolves\u2019 eyes, wereleopards\u2019 eyes were human.</p><p>The growl that rumbled from his throat sounded really pissed off. Murphy didn\u2019t appear scared. He was too busy staring at the beast with his mouth hanging open. I guess he believed in wereleopards now.</p><p>\u201cGet inside!\u201d I shouted, scrambling to my feet.</p><p>He didn\u2019t listen, didn\u2019t even glance my way, before he stepped into the courtyard and circled the leopard as the leopard circled him.</p><p>I looked for a weapon, spied the knife, thought better of it. Me with a knife, Mezareau with his teeth and claws, it wouldn\u2019t be pretty.</p><p>Instead I glanced at the moon and knew what I had to do. Quickly I lifted my face, my hands, hoping, praying, my magic would be enough.</p><p>Silver spilled down my body like a waterfall. I\u2019d thought the moon would be cool; instead it was fiery hot, racing through my blood, bubbling beneath the surface, pushing me toward a change.</p><p>I waited for the pain\u2014a crunching of bone, the shifting of skin, the sprouting from nowhere of fur, snout, and tail. Instead, fireflies of light sparkled all around me\u2014a hundred thousand Tinkerbells. I swayed, closed my eyes, and when I opened them I was shorter.</p><p>Probably had something to do with the paws.</p><p>Mezareau crouched, ready to spring, and I launched myself at him. He ducked, and I flew over his back, skidding in the damp grass, slamming headfirst into a fountain. I wasn\u2019t used to this body yet, but Mezareau was.</p><p>I shook off the dizziness, no time for that, spinning just as the leopard launched himself into the air. They were too close to each other, too far away from me. I\u2019d never reach them in time.</p><p>They say when you stare death in the face your entire life passes before your eyes. As I watched death sail toward Murphy, the times we\u2019d shared tumbled through my mind.</p><p>Traveling through the mountains, sleeping under the stars, sharing our pasts, our pain, our bodies. I\u2019d never shared with anyone else the things I\u2019d shared with him. What would I do if I lost him?</p><p>I started to run, awkward in my new feet, but I couldn\u2019t just stand there and watch him die.</p><p>A second before the leopard hit the man, Murphy thrust his hand toward Mezareau\u2019s chest and the bokor exploded in a blazing ball of fire.</p><p>Murphy stumbled back from the flames, which were so bright and hot, Mezareau would be ashes in minutes. The knife clattered to the pavement as Murphy lifted his arm to shield his face.</p><p>How had he gotten the weapon? He must have taken advantage of the momentary distraction I\u2019d provided by launching myself at Mezareau to retrieve it. Murphy always had been both quick and smart.</p><p>I shied away from the heat, skittery, nervous, though the smell of roasting flesh interested me more than it should. I guess Mezareau\u2019s claim that I\u2019d become more and more leopard, less and less woman, was true.</p><p>\u201cThat worked.\u201d Murphy glanced at me and flinched. \u201cYou wanna change back? You\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d</p><p>Change back? I hoped I could.</p><p>Lifting my snout to the sky, I imagined myself a woman. I remained a leopard.</p><p>I whined and pawed at the ground. The only person who knew the rules was barbecuing in my backyard.</p><p>\u201cMaybe calling to the moon would work,\u201d Murphy suggested. \u201cSeems like I\u2019ve heard the call of the wild a lot lately. Mezareau must have been serenading us for a reason.\u201d</p><p>Probably just to scare everyone, but it couldn\u2019t hurt to try. I lifted my voice to the night, and somewhere in the distance a wolf howled.</p><p>Swell.</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to worry about that, because suddenly I felt the heat, saw the sparkles, and an instant later I crouched in my garden, naked.</p><p>\u201cHave to say I like this direction much better.\u201d Murphy handed me my clothes.</p><p>At least they weren\u2019t torn, as they would have been if I\u2019d been a werewolf. Bursting through seams and shoes must be a real pain. Literally. Magical shifting was so much neater.</p><p>While I dressed, Murphy collapsed on the rim of my fountain, leaning over to splash his face. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect him to shift into a leopard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been paying any attention over the past month? Wereleopard sorcerer. We\u2019ve been over this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta see to believe.\u201d He stood and brushed his fingers against the white streak in my hair. \u201cWhat are we gonna do about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do we make the leopard thing stop?\u201d</p><p>I glanced at the ashes that had once been Mezareau. \u201cYou might have already stopped it.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how I felt about that. If I wasn\u2019t a shape-shifter, Sarah was just dead.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>\u201cA lot of curses are broken when the curser dies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about this one?\u201d</p><p>I lifted my face, my arms, to the moon. Immediately the silver sheen crashed down; I felt the telltale heat, saw the shimmer at the edge of my vision.</p><p>\u201cThen again...\u201d I dropped my arms and thought about England. The heat fell away, and the sparkles died. \u201cA lot of them aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Like the curse of the crescent moon.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t sound too upset about being a wereleopard,\u201d Murphy observed.</p><p>\u201cI need to be. For Sarah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to give that up? You can\u2019t raise your child from the dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I can, if you\u2019ll lend me your diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t able to.\u201d His shoulders slumped. \u201cI meant you can\u2019t. It isn\u2019t right.\u201d He took a deep breath and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t just leave her there.\u201d</p><p>For several long moments there was silence between us. I didn\u2019t know what else to say.</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you start a new life?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAs a wereleopard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure someone with your power, with the resources of the J\u00e4ger-Suchers behind you, could find a way out of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe probably shouldn\u2019t mention this to them. They tend to get all weirded out about shape-shifters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give the diamond back as soon as I\u2019m done,\u201d I promised. \u201cOr you could come with me to California.\u201d</p><p>I was shocked to discover how much I wanted him to. I\u2019d been alone since I\u2019d lost Sarah, alone until I\u2019d found him. And while I couldn\u2019t bring myself to invite Murphy to share a life with me and my living zombie daughter, I couldn\u2019t let him go, either. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019m worried about the damn diamond?\u201d Despite his words, he seemed more defeated than mad. \u201cTake it, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I mean\u2014I will for now. But you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I needed it, but I don\u2019t.\u201d He laughed, though the sound held no humor. \u201cAll I need is\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone cleared his throat, and for an instant I imagined Mezareau had risen from the ashes. The bad guys just aren\u2019t as easy to kill as they used to be.</p><p>But the bokor wasn\u2019t standing in the center of my courtyard, holding the knife made of stone; it was Edward. I wasn\u2019t sure who was worse.</p><p>Edward lifted his gaze from the knife to me, then to Murphy. \u201cWhich one of you is a wereleopard?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Seven</p><p>\u201cMe,\u201d Murphy said, and Edward threw the knife.</p><p>The old man never waited around for explanations. Which was probably why he was still alive.</p><p>Without Murphy, I didn\u2019t want to be. I threw myself in front of him, shoving him in the chest, knocking him to the ground. The knife stuck in my shoulder with a thunk.</p> <p>\u201cOuch!\u201d I turned to Edward, but he was glaring at Murphy, who was glaring at me.</p><p>\u201cDammit, Cassandra.\u201d Murphy jumped to his feet. \u201cYou could have exploded.\u201d</p><p>But I hadn\u2019t. What the hell?</p><p>Without warning, Edward yanked the knife from my shoulder. I gasped at the pain but managed to grab his wrist as it descended toward Murphy.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I demanded.</p> <p>\u201cDiana discovered that only a knife made of black diamonds could end the life of a wereleopard.\u201d</p><p>Edward\u2019s voice came in fits and starts as we continued to struggle for possession of the knife. I was no longer strong enough to take it from him, and I wasn\u2019t sure why. I wouldn\u2019t be able to hold Edward\u2019s wrist away from Murphy much longer.</p><p>Murphy must have sensed this, because he plucked the knife, blade first, from Edward\u2019s hand. \u201cBlack diamonds. Those must be pretty rare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely so in Africa, though more common in Brazil.\u201d The old man scowled at him. \u201cYou are not a wereleopard at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Murphy tossed the gory knife into the fountain.</p><p>\u201cYou touched the blade without burning.\u201d Edward turned his frown on me. \u201cAnd you did not explode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo moss on you,\u201d Murphy muttered, but Edward ignored him to glance around the courtyard. His gaze stopped when it reached the pile of ashes. \u201cMezareau?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He met my eyes. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>I j erked my thumb in Murphy\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cHmph,\u201d Edward said.</p><p>Something soft touched my back. Murphy had taken off his shirt and pressed it to my wound. Sadly, the gash wasn\u2019t closing on its own. I was going to need stitches.</p><p>\u201cTell me what happened,\u201d Edward demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe needs a doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Edward pulled out his gun and pointed it at us both. I told him everything.</p><p>\u201cOnly a wereleopard can raise the living dead.\u201d Edward set down the gun and picked up the diamond Murphy had placed on the low stone bench surrounding the fountain. \u201cWith a little help from the stone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the bokor cursed you to become like him on the next full moon, which was last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the rumor.\u201d</p><p>Edward\u2019s lips twitched. I wasn\u2019t certain if I annoyed or amused him, but right now I didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHowever, the black diamond knife, which killed Mezareau, did nothing to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there a point to this?\u201d Murphy demanded. \u201cWereleopard or not, she\u2019s only got so much blood to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned,\u201d the old man murmured. \u201cCassandra has always had more power than she realizes. That, combined with Mezareau\u2019s knowledge and the near immortality of a shape-shifter...\u201d He spread his hands. \u201cI cannot allow her to walk freely in this world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to say about it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere you are wrong.\u201d Edward snapped his fingers, and the courtyard filled with people. From the number of weapons I guessed they were J\u00e4ger-Suchers.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d I said, fighting waves of nausea, pain, and dizziness. \u201cThe knife didn\u2019t make me go boom. I\u2019m not healing in the blink of an eye. Let me see if I can shift.\u201d</p><p>The sound of several rounds being chambered made me freeze. I glanced at the sea of guns. \u201cLittle jumpy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think we\u2019ll let you shape-shift and tear out our throats?\u201d Edward asked.</p><p>\u201cI doubt you\u2019ll let me do anything of the kind,\u201d I muttered.</p><p>\u201cBut how will we stop you? Silver doesn\u2019t work on wereleopards; the black diamond doesn\u2019t work on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I\u2019m supershifter. Lucky me.\u201d</p><p>A tall, willowy blonde shoved through the crowd. Her electric blue dress and snazzy black stilettos were both out of place and right in fashion. She carried no weapon, but then she didn\u2019t need one.</p><p>Elise was a werewolf.</p><p>You might think it odd that the most feared werewolf hunter had a granddaughter who turned furry; I know I had. However, the story of Elise and Edward was long, involved, and not exactly pleasant.</p><p>I\u2019d met Elise once before, during the incident with Henri. We nodded a greeting, but I wasn\u2019t in the mood to be sociable. Blood loss from a four-inch gash in the shoulder can do that.</p><p>\u201cShe seems exactly the same as she did when I met her the first time,\u201d Elise murmured. \u201cIf she\u2019s evil, I can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause evil shows?\u201d Murphy\u2019s voice was sarcastic.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Elise flicked a glance at him, then away. \u201cBut I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at smelling it.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWho is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Hanover, meet Devon Murphy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me if I don\u2019t shake hands,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m a little bloody.\u201d</p><p>Elise\u2019s blue eyes flared. \u201cYou probably want to lay off on the bloody,\u201d she said. \u201cIt excites me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I should have asked what is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart man,\u201d Elise murmured, but she didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I would have, except Elise suddenly pressed her palm against my forehead, then closed her eyes. Since I\u2019d seen her do this before, with Henri, I let her.</p><p>Seconds later, Elise lowered her hand and turned to Edward. \u201cShe\u2019s clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d he asked. \u201cUsually there is a lot of \u2018Who am I? Where am I?\u2019 when you cure someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t have to cure her,\u201d Elise said. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a wereleopard. At least not anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re certain?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me. \u201cGo ahead and try to shift.\u201d</p><p>Edward made an elaborate \u201cbe my guest\u201d gesture, so I lifted my face, my arms, to the moon.</p><p>No heat, no shimmers. The moon was just a moon, and I was just a woman. I let my hands fall back to my sides and glanced at Murphy. \u201cI changed into a leopard, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd back again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOK. Just so we\u2019re clear.\u201d I suddenly had to sit down, so I did, on the ground at Murphy\u2019s feet.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d He knelt at my side, worry creasing his brow. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne moment,\u201d Edward murmured. \u201cElise, since when do your powers extend to anything other than werewolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can only cure werewolves, and sometimes not even them,\u201d she muttered. \u201cBut I still get the j olt with other shifters.\u201d She put her fingers to her forehead in memory. \u201cSupreme ice-cream headache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know this how?\u201d Edward demanded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been testing them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThem what?\u201d Edward\u2019s voice had lowered, which somehow made him sound even angrier.</p><p>\u201cYou know as well as I do that there are a lot more things out there than werewolves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSadly, yes,\u201d Edward agreed.</p><p>\u201cI had a little time on my hands, so I thought I should check them out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Frankenstein,\u201d Murphy whispered, and Elise\u2019s lips tightened.</p><p>I should probably tell him that Elise could hear just about anything, but I didn\u2019t have the energy.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened in between her shifting and her suddenly being unable to?\u201d Elise asked.</p><p>\u201cBesides the old man trying to kill me?\u201d Murphy asked.</p><p>Elise gave a tired sigh and turned to her grandfather. \u201cWhat have I said about killing first, asking questions later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it is a bad idea.\u201d Edward lifted his nose. \u201cBut I still find it to be a good one.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for several seconds, and he stared right back. Eventually Elise gave up and glanced at Murphy. \u201cIf Edward tried to kill you, then why is Cassandra bleeding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe stepped in front of the knife.\u201d Murphy\u2019s fingers tightened on my arms. I wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to hug me or hurt me. Probably both.</p><p>\u201cUltimate sacrifice,\u201d Elise murmured, and I lifted my head.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI read the report from Diana. Only an ultimate sacrifice will end a voodoo curse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were cursed, too.\u201d</p><p>Damn. Why hadn\u2019t I thought of that. Except\u2014</p><p>\u201cMy life means nothing to me.\u201d</p><p>Elise smiled gently. \u201cBut your daughter\u2019s does.\u201d</p><p>I froze as what she was saying became clear. Tears burned my eyes, and I turned my face into Murphy\u2019s bare chest.</p><p>\u201cCassandra, what is it?\u201d His voice shook; he seemed really scared. I just shook my head, unable to speak.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t raise her daughter now,\u201d Elise explained. \u201cMezareau is dead, and the formula for the curse died with him.\u201d</p><p>Murphy stiffened. \u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe saved you,\u201d Elise continued, \u201cbut the price was Sarah.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Thirty-Eight</p><p>I passed out again, this time from blood loss, or maybe grief. For a woman who\u2019d never fainted in her life, I was making quite a habit of it.</p><p>I awoke in the hospital with Diana at my side.</p><p>\u201cSince when do stitches warrant a bed?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the stitches that worried them but the fainting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorried me, too,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI\u2019m going to lose my J\u00e4ger-Sucher ass-whupping card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>Silence settled between us. A silence full of questions, which I couldn\u2019t let continue.</p><p>\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t tell you everything,\u201d I blurted.</p> <p>\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout Sarah.\u201d I braced to fight the tears, but none came.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d lost a child,\u201d she said gently, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to talk about it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very understanding.\u201d I considered her for a minute. \u201cAm I dying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She got up and went to the window.</p><p>\u201cWhat aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMurphy\u2019s gone. The diamond, too.\u201d</p><p>And that started the tears when Sarah hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d Diana muttered, hurrying back to my side. \u201cI should have kept my yap shut.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I scrubbed my face. \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t stay. I was surprised he came back in the first place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElise really wanted to study that diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe took the black diamond knife instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might amuse her for a while.\u201d Though I doubted it. The black diamond knife was just pretty unless it was used on a wereleopard, and we appeared to be fresh out.</p> <p>\u201cEdward\u2019s in a serious snit,\u201d Diana continued. \u201cHe hates it when people disappear and he isn\u2019t behind it.\u201d</p><p>I had to smile at that.</p><p>The door opened. Edward stepped into the room. \u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I sat up, wincing at the pain in my head and my shoulder. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d That said, he got right back to business. \u201cRenee went to the village\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was able to find it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to her, the waterfall was just a waterfall, the cave just a cave, and beyond that there was more mountain with no jungle at all.\u201d</p><p>I guess that made sense. The waterfall had reappeared when we\u2019d thought Mezareau dead, though he\u2019d only been unconscious. His literal death must have made everything revert to its original state.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the zombies?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cThe village was empty. Nothing but piles of dust, a few shards of bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe magic died,\u201d I murmured, \u201cwhen Mezareau did.\u201d</p><p>Which meant the zombies weren\u2019t really alive after all.</p><p>\u201cSpells often fail when the spell caster dies,\u201d Edward agreed.</p><p>\u201cBut not curses,\u201d Diana muttered. \u201cNoooo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf anyone tries to raise another zombie army,\u201d Edward said, \u201cwe need do nothing except kill the one who raises them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t ever happen again,\u201d Diana interj ected. \u201cMezareau was the only one who knew how to create a wereleopard.\u201d</p><p>Edward sighed. \u201cThere is always another.\u201d</p><p>Diana cast a quick, concerned glance in my direction. She must be worried I\u2019d leap out of bed and immediately try to find another way to become a wereleopard.</p><p>Maybe after I got rid of the headache.</p><p>\u201cI have set my best trackers on finding Murphy,\u201d Edward said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother on my account.\u201d</p><p>If he didn\u2019t want me, I didn\u2019t want him.</p><p>\u201cYour account?\u201d Edward appeared puzzled; then his face cleared. \u201cOh, the sex.\u201d</p><p>Diana rolled her eyes. \u201cMaybe the love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love him?\u201d Edward asked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Diana snorted and Edward\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cI hate it when my agents fall in love. It\u2019s so messy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not messy,\u201d Diana snapped. \u201cYou get two agents where you previously had one. Don\u2019t be an ass.\u201d</p><p>Edward ignored her; maybe he was mellowing. Or maybe he just realized he was an ass much of the time.</p><p>\u201cI was not looking for Murphy for you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut for the diamond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood luck,\u201d I muttered. Edward wasn\u2019t going to find him.</p><p>\u201cMy second concern is you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cNot your health, but your magic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were made a wereleopard because you had power. Even though you are no longer a shape- shifter, you\u2019re still a voodoo priestess. You have raised the dead, which makes you a sorceress.\u201d He lifted his hand, even as I opened my mouth to argue. \u201cI know I ordered you to do it; however, I do not want to be called back here to deal with you if you decide to run amok.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmok?\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you have any desire to rule the world?\u201d</p><p>I snorted. \u201cI can\u2019t even run my own life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not make me shoot you in the head, Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best, sir.\u201d</p><p>Edward left without a good-bye.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to stay in New Orleans?\u201d Diana asked.</p><p>\u201cWhere else would I go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcept you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled; I smiled. All was forgiven.</p><p>I got out of the hospital the same day, returned to my shop, and a week later was open for business.</p><p>I picked up Lazarus, who was going to be a daddy according to the vet, and the snake behaved as if he hadn\u2019t seen me in years, wrapping himself around my wrist and giving me all the love a snake could manage. He behaved as if I\u2019d never smelled like a leopard at all\u2014which worked for me.</p><p>We segued back into our routine\u2014me working, him loving me and hissing at Diana whenever she stopped by. It was their thing.</p><p>I was busy; I was rarely alone, yet I was so lonely. Which was stupid. I\u2019d been alone for years. It had never bothered me before. Of course I\u2019d always had the promise of Sarah in my future. Now I wasn\u2019t sure what I had to look forward to.</p><p>And then one night, I found it.</p><p>I\u2019d actually fallen asleep, a rare occurrence of late. I awoke to a breeze blowing through the open window next to my bed. But I hadn\u2019t left the window open.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d I asked.</p><p>Murphy materialized from the shadows. He was thinner; his hair was longer. He\u2019d found some new feathers. He looked almost like the man I\u2019d met in the bar in Haiti, except that man had smiled and j oked, traded accents. This one didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou hate me for taking her from you.\u201d</p><p>I sat up in bed and hugged my knees to my chest. \u201cShe was taken from me a long time ago, Devon, and it wasn\u2019t by you.\u201d</p><p>I sensed a sudden tension in him as he inched closer. I wanted to reach out, but I was afraid he\u2019d run again. \u201cHow could you say your life meant nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saved me, Cass. I was going nowhere fast until I met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDitto.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>I smiled as I realized the truth. \u201cDitto.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the side of my bed. \u201cAre you going to spend your life trying to find another way to get her back?\u201d</p><p>I drew in a deep breath, then let it out. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>I hadn\u2019t admitted that until just this minute. Sarah was dead, and there was nothing I could do about it.</p><p>Because raising my child from the grave was the act of a crazy person, and I kind of wanted to be sane.</p><p>With him.</p><p>\u201cYou promise?\u201d Murphy whispered.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>His question, my answer, meant more than the words. They were vows we\u2019d consecrate later. We spent the next several hours consummating them. It was what we were good at.</p><p>We were both drifting toward sleep when a final question woke me right back up. \u201cWhere\u2019s the diamond?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat diamond?\u201d</p><p>I tilted my head and caught the shadow of a smile. \u201cOh, Edward\u2019s gonna love that.\u201d</p><p>Murphy\u2019s smile deepened as he fell asleep. Now I couldn\u2019t. The moon called.</p><p>I climbed out of bed and went into the courtyard, where I stared up at the perfectly round orb just as a faraway clock stuck midnight\u2014the most powerful minute of the most powerful moon. I let the silver sheen wash over me as I said good-bye.</p><p>I\u2019d never forget Sarah, but I didn\u2019t have to raise her from the dead for her to live in my heart, mind, and soul. She was my little girl, and no one could ever take that away.</p><p>Mommy ?</p><p>She no longer wore her hated uniform but a frilly white nightgown.</p><p>Are you OK now?</p><p>\u201cI think I am.\u201d</p><p>That \u2019s good. I couldn \u2019t go on to the best p lace until you let me go.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Every thing will be all right.</p><p>She\u2019d told me that in the jungle, but I hadn\u2019t been listening.</p><p>The man with the p retty beads in his hair\u2014 I like him.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>He \u2019ll make a good daddy.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Bye. Sarah began to fade and I let her. It was time.</p><p>I turned and Murphy was there. Something in his eyes made me ask, \u201cDid you see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He tilted his head, and his earring flashed silver beneath the moon. \u201cWhat was that about me being a daddy?\u201d</p><p>I considered what had just happened between us and what hadn\u2019t. Protection.</p><p>\u201cI think we had a little accident.\u201d</p><p>He crossed the short space between us and pulled me into his arms. Leaning down, Murphy kissed my hair where it grew white, then whispered, \u201cThere are no accidents.\u201d</p><p>I smiled because I knew he was right.</p><p>He awakens something wild in her... </p> </body></html>"]
