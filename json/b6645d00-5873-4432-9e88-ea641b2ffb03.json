I\u2019m almost done,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>I ran my fingers one last time through my stick-straight blonde hair, trying in vain to give it the appearance of volume or thickness. One final coat of mascara on my eyelashes and I\u2019d be all set. The purple strappy top I was wearing really brought out the green in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d I muttered to my reflection, admiring the way my low-cut jeans hugged the curves of my butt.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re so perfect, then let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood God, woman. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re heading to the prom.\u201d I walked out of the bedroom and down the hall toward my stressed-out best friend. \u201cIt\u2019s just a party. There is no late at a frat party, you know?\u201d I leaned into the door frame, determined not to hurry.</p><p>\u201cAll the good guys will be taken.\u201d Melissa stuck her bottom lip out in the pout that she had perfected, and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><p>\u201cThis is a frat party, Meli. There are no good guys.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d She frowned, twirling her shoulder-length wavy brown hair around her finger.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cGood. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>I tossed my arm around my pint-sized friend and headed out the front door, locking it behind us. I\u2019d known Melissa since high school. She moved here right after we graduated, while I was forced to attend community college. \u201cYou have to take the same courses the first two years anyway. It\u2019s much cheaper,\u201d my mom had insisted. So I stayed close to home, while Melissa\u2019s parents happily paid for all her expenses at Fullton State.</p><p>After two years of general education, I applied to three universities in Southern California and was accepted at all of them. I knew immediately which one I wanted to transfer to. Not only was my best friend at Fullton, but it also had one of the best photo communications programs in the state, with an award-winning student magazine and newspaper. And since my major was photography, the choice was easy.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s parents insisted on getting an apartment for us to share and refused to let my parents pay for any of it. We weren\u2019t poor, but we didn\u2019t have an overabundance of cash the way Meli\u2019s parents did. They told my folks that college tuition was expensive enough without all the extras and then they paid our rent a year in advance, including the summer. I remember my dad promising to pay them back during one of the many pre-moving discussions, and my eyes met Melissa\u2019s with an all-knowing glance that the repayment would never really come to fruition.</p><p>Her parents had always been overly generous when it came to me. But then again, they were privy to the many times my dad had promised me something and then not delivered. On more than one occasion, Melissa\u2019s mom\u2019s was the shoulder I cried on and whose ears I vented my disappointment and frustrations to. I intended to start paying them back as soon as I graduated and opened my own photography business.</p> <p>The night air was warm on my exposed skin as we walked the five blocks toward the fraternity house. \u201cThat top looks fierce on you,\u201d Melissa complimented me with a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute, right?\u201d I smiled, looking down at the formfitting top hugging my curves and accentuating my tiny waist. \u201cYou look as hot as ever.\u201d I winked before slapping her black-skirt-covered ass.</p><p>Melissa was truly beautiful. Her dark brown hair contrasted with the blue of her eyes, making it hard to look away from her at times. She honestly looked like she belonged on the cover of a magazine, with her stunning figure and flawless features. We were total opposites, what with my five-foot-eight-inch frame and disproportionate body shape. I used to joke and say that God put me together like a Mr. Potato Head toy. One piece for my butt, one for my waist, one for my boobs...all a mismatch of sizes.</p><p>But it worked on me.</p><p>And I worked it.</p><p>The sound of hip-hop music filled the air. \u201cOoooh, I love this song! Let\u2019s dance!\u201d I grabbed Melissa\u2019s hand and dragged her along, jogging closer to the source of the music.</p><p>\u201cYou always want to dance.\u201d Melissa rolled her eyes. I\u2019d smack those perfect blue eyes right off her face if I didn\u2019t love her so damn much.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m a good dancer. And this butt of mine\u2014oh, you know what it does.\u201d I started shaking my hips in the crowded driveway of the fraternity house.</p> <p>\u201cOh, no. Please stop.\u201d</p><p>I laughed and slowed down my booty-shaking when I noticed the number of eyes ogling me. I hated being gawked at. I know, I know. I\u2019m a fucking hypocrite. I scanned the crowd before suddenly stopping on the most delicious pair of chocolate-brown eyes watching me. The fact that the eyes belonged to one of the hottest faces I\u2019d ever seen was merely a bonus. He ran his fingers through his black hair before resting them against his tanned, scruffy face. He smiled lazily at me and I felt my stomach flip.</p><p>Stupid stomach.</p><p>\u201cNo. Tell me you are not looking at him, Cassie.\u201d Melissa stepped in front of me, breaking the eye contact.</p><p>\u201cHey, move.\u201d But every direction I craned my neck, she blocked me with her annoying face.</p><p>\u201cNo freaking way. Don\u2019t you know who that is?\u201d She threw her hand in front of my eyes before I swatted it away.</p><p>\u201cObviously not, or we\u2019d be dating.\u201d I hopped up to steal a peek over her head.</p><p>\u201cJack Carter doesn\u2019t date. He sleeps with girls and all their friends.\u201d Melissa\u2019s mouth curled with disgust.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the infamous Jack Carter, huh?\u201d I was intrigued. This guy\u2019s name was all over the school papers and online.</p><p>Melissa threw an arm over my shoulder. \u201cThe one and only.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he really as good as they say?\u201d Jack would be eligible for the Major League Baseball draft after the season ended. Everyone said he\u2019d get drafted within the first five rounds. And apparently that\u2019s a pretty big deal.</p><p>\u201cHis ego certainly thinks so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical.\u201d If there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s athletes. They\u2019re all the same. Superstitious, cocky, insecure egomaniacs. Yes, I realize the words are contradictory, but most are somewhat normal guys. They just hide behind a hundred-foot-tall brick wall, built entirely on ego. Plus, they don\u2019t know any better. They\u2019ve been baseball players their whole lives; they don\u2019t know how to be anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it with you and assholes, Cass? Jack Carter\u2019s a world class jerk and you need to stay away from him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I stomped my foot and firmly placed my hand against my hip. \u201cThe question isn\u2019t, \u2018What is it with me and assholes.\u2019 It\u2019s more like, \u201cWhat is it with most guys being assholes?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cValid point. But still. You already know up front this guy\u2019s a player, so why bother? You\u2019ll only end up hurt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I hurt him first,\u201d I mumbled under my breath.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you won\u2019t. Jack Carter doesn\u2019t get hurt by girls. Promise me you\u2019ll stay away from him.\u201d Melissa pinned me with a glare to let me know she was serious.</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll stay away from him.\u201d I batted my eyelashes, my tone of voice insincere.</p><p>\u201cUgh! Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d Melissa pushed her way through the crowd and I watched as Jack stopped her before she passed him. He reached an arm out for her and she moved it away, her foot tapping against the ground the way she always did when she was irritated. He turned to eye me and she matched his gaze before gesturing wildly and shaking her head no. A wide smile crossed his face as Melissa threw her arms up in the air before storming inside the front door.</p><p>Jack walked, no, make that sauntered, over to where I stood. His black cargo shorts and tight-fitting gray baseball t-shirt did a number on his body. The definition of his arm muscles rippled against the fabric, accentuating his well-defined shoulders on his six-foot frame as his arms swayed. He tilted his head and narrowed his eyes at me like I was some tiny, helpless creature who didn\u2019t have a clue it was about to get eaten alive by the most beautiful, albeit dangerous, creature in the jungle.</p><p>I almost felt violated.</p><p>Dirty.</p><p>Like I needed a shower to scrub that look off my body.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he got close enough that I could read the writing on his shirt. It said, \u201cNo Glove No Love\u201d with a picture of a catcher\u2019s mitt in the middle.</p><p>What a Pig. Yes, with a capital P.</p><p>Two can play this game.</p><p>Defenses up.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Melissa\u2019s roommate?\u201d The words came out smooth like butter, his voice deep and sexy.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a genius,\u201d I said, going for my most uninterested tone.</p><p>\u201cHey now, don\u2019t be mean. I just wanted to meet you.\u201d He looked me in the eyes with a focused, unbreakable stare. \u201cYou have beautiful eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice shirt.\u201d I gave him a disgusted once-over, trying to cover the fact that I wanted to laugh. It was clever, but I\u2019d be dammed if I would admit that to a guy like him.</p><p>He looked down and smirked. \u201cAh, you like that? I think it\u2019s a pretty responsible message I\u2019m sending out, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I said nothing, questioning whether anything that came out of this guy\u2019s mouth was genuine or not.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Cat got your tongue? You don\u2019t believe in safe sex?\u201d</p><p>Was this guy for real? \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d My lips pursed together, making my tone harsher than I had intended.</p><p>\u201cI told you, I wanted to meet you. I\u2019m Jack Carter.\u201d He reached out his hand and I looked at it, my arms firmly crossed against my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI know who you are.\u201d I pretended not to care. He was beautiful. And he was charming. And a man-whoring pig. God, what is wrong with me?</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve heard of me, huh, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>My lips suddenly felt like they were filled with lead as they turned downward in disgust. \u201cYou did not just call me \u2018Kitten.\u2019 Do I look like a stripper to you?\u201d</p><p>He looked me up and down and then did it again. \u201cWell, now that you mention it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d I pushed past him to walk away, but he grabbed me.</p><p>I tore my arm from his grip. \u201cIt costs fifty cents every time you touch me. Don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re not a stripper, you\u2019re a whore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, so you\u2019re not only an asshole, you\u2019re a piece of shit,\u201d I responded as I stomped away.</p><p>\u201cI like you,\u201d he shouted at my back.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re dumb, too,\u201d I tossed over my shoulder with a glare. \u201cI\u2019ll add it to the list of your many redeeming qualities.\u201d</p><p>I heard him laugh before I entered the house to search for Melissa. I finally found her in the backyard, drinking something out of a red plastic cup and talking to a group of people I didn\u2019t recognize. I appeared at her side before she realized I was there.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Cass, what did he say to you?\u201d She ushered me toward an empty clearing in the yard.</p><p>I grabbed a drink for myself off a nearby table and rolled my eyes. \u201cNothing. He\u2019s a jackass.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI told you.\u201d She smirked and shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWell, he\u2019s clearly gotten over you already. Look.\u201d</p><p>She pointed toward an open window where Jack was attached at the lips to a scantily clad blonde. One of his hands gripped her backside, while the other pulled at the back of her head. I shook my head in disgust at his public display of man whoredom.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? He\u2019ll just never talk to her again?\u201d I asked, trying to figure him out.</p><p>Melissa turned to eye me, curiosity lurking behind those baby blues. \u201cNo. They\u2019ll talk. I mean, unless she gets all pissed off at him for...being him. But he won\u2019t ever hook up with her again. He never hooks up with the same girl twice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the girls...they know this?\u201d I was shocked. Seriously, do these girls have no self-esteem?</p><p>\u201cThey know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPathetic.\u201d I frowned and looked back at Jack just in time to see him leading the girl away by the hand, a smile plastered all over her perfect little face.</p><p>And that was my first introduction to Jack Carter.</p><p>Jack fucking Carter.</p> <p>The next big thing in the world of baseball. Word has it he throws somewhere between ninety-three and ninety-four miles per hour when he\u2019s on the mound. That\u2019s fast. Real fast. Especially for a lefty. And you can\u2019t teach speed. You either have the ability to throw that fast or you don\u2019t.</p><p>And apparently he had it.</p><p>On and off the baseball field.</p><p>Two days later I walked into the student union, scanning the area between the bowling lanes and the bar for Melissa. Everyone on campus seemed to congregate there since it\u2019s where the lone pizza restaurant was located. When it came to college and college students, pizza seemed to be on everyone\u2019s diet menu.</p><p>She spotted me and waved her tanned arms frantically above her head. Melissa looked like a lunatic and it made me laugh out loud. I waved back, then grabbed a tray and bought my lunch before weaving my way through a crowd of other students toward her table.</p><p>\u201cKitten.\u201d</p> <p>The deep, sultry voice stopped me in my tracks as my smile faded. I turned toward the source of the voice with revulsion. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even like cats.\u201d I lifted one brow and fixed Jack with a fierce stare.</p><p>He fiddled with his baseball cap before putting it back on his head and tucking his dark hair underneath. I felt almost mesmerized as he ran his fingers absentmindedly across the white stitching of our school\u2019s initials. I found myself noticing the way his dark blue shirt fit snugly against the muscles in his arms and shoulders. I hated how good-looking he was.</p><p>\u201cActually, I didn\u2019t know. But I\u2019m glad I do.\u201d He smiled and I swear part of my heart melted right then and there at the sight of his dimples.</p><p>I totally suck.</p><p>I tried to walk toward Melissa, who eyed me with piqued curiosity, but he stood his stupid gorgeous body in my path. I quickly moved to the right, but he hopped to his left to block me. I took another step to the left and he quickly moved too.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Jack?\u201d I said, the anger in my voice taking us both by surprise.</p><p>\u201cAre you always this hostile?\u201d His smile told me he was teasing, before forcing his dimples to reappear and my body to flush with heat.</p><p>\u201cOnly to guys like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo tell me, Kitten, what\u2019s a guy like me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot worth my time.\u201d I shoved my tray into his gut and when he let out an ooof, I scurried past him, trying not to spill my soda.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come around,\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t hold your breath.\u201d</p><p>I rushed to our table, throwing down my tray of food.</p><p>\u201cNice scene.\u201d Melissa\u2019s eyes were huge as she fought a grin.</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around.\u201d She waved an arm, gesturing toward the crowd.</p><p>I glanced around the bar and the other tables. All eyes were either on me or Jack. Great. The last thing I wanted was the entire school thinking I was Jack Carter\u2019s latest conquest.</p><p>\u201cIs he always that obnoxious?\u201d I ripped the top off my raspberry yogurt.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, Cass. I\u2019ve never seen him act that way before if that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m asking.\u201d Irritated and annoyed, I scanned the room for Jack\u2019s face. He sat at a table surrounded by giddy girls, tossing their hair, pawing his muscles, and laughing obnoxiously at whatever he said. His eyes briefly met mine before I turned away, and I felt my heart beat a little faster.</p><p>\u201cJesus. How have I never noticed this spectacle before?\u201d I wondered out loud.</p><p>Melissa chuckled. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. Happens every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose girls have no shame. I\u2019m almost embarrassed for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know they all want to be the one he actually falls for.\u201d Melissa sounded sympathetic as she removed the crust from her slice of cheese pizza.</p><p>\u201cGood luck with that, ladies!\u201d I gave the gawking girls a fake salute, then turned my attention to attacking my yogurt.</p><p>Curiosity got the best of me when I heard shouts and the sound of slapping high-fives. I looked back to Jack\u2019s table to see a boy about Jack\u2019s height and build sitting down next to him. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d I asked Melissa, nosy in spite of myself.</p><p>\u201cThe one who just sat down? That\u2019s Dean...Jack\u2019s little brother. He\u2019s a freshman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow the hell do you know that? You\u2019re like a freaking college directory,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in one of my classes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d I said, putting one hand up in the air. \u201cHow do you have a class with a freshman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still have a couple of lower-level classes to take and he\u2019s in one of them. He\u2019s really sweet. Not like Jack at all,\u201d Melissa added with a smile and a faraway look in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you like him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do not!\u201d Melissa whispered defensively. \u201cI barely even know him! I\u2019m just saying he\u2019s nothing like his brother, is all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, calm down. Jeez. It\u2019s okay to like Jack Carter\u2019s little brother.\u201d I glanced back at Dean, admiring his smile, but noting the lack of dimples his brother wore so well. \u201cHe is cute.\u201d I poked her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cHe is, right?\u201d She eyed him from a distance.</p><p>\u201cAt least you like the good one.\u201d I smiled, turning back to see the brothers throwing their arms around each other\u2019s necks.</p><p>\u201cAs if I\u2019d like the other one! Jack\u2019s disgusting.\u201d She pretended to stick a finger down her throat and made gagging noises.</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying,\u201d I said, taking another spoonful of yogurt.</p><p>\u201cI swear to God, Cassie. If you end up falling for his shit, I don\u2019t want to hear it. I\u2019ve watched him the last two years before you got here. I\u2019m telling you, he\u2019s the ultimate playboy.\u201d She silenced her rant with a quick chomp at her banana.</p><p>\u201cI hear you. Okay? Steer clear of Jack Carter. It shouldn\u2019t be that hard, considering I don\u2019t want to go anywhere near him.\u201d</p><p>We both smiled, momentarily satisfied with my promise.</p><p>TWO</p><p>The sun warmed my body the moment I stepped out of the three-story Communications &amp; Arts Building. A gentle breeze swept across my face as I observed my fellow students. Some rushed to get to class, while others fought for sunny areas on the lawn. I smiled as I passed a long-haired kid playing the guitar. He played under the same tree every day, and I started to wonder if he was a student at all or if he just liked being on the large, sprawling campus.</p><p>I passed by the university bookstore and shops, making a mental note to pick up two scantrons for my upcoming tests. Herds of people milled in and out of the student union entrance as I walked in. My eyes immediately fell on Jack and his harem of fans. I couldn\u2019t get over how I\u2019d never noticed it before, but now it was all I saw. He flexed his muscles for a couple of girls who screamed when they grabbed on to his bicep. I heard him say, \u201cHold on,\u201d as he lifted them into the air. I frowned with disgust as he demonstrated his pitching motion in slow speed, much to the delight of the squealing girls.</p><p>\u201cHe is such an attention whore.\u201d I slammed my body down in the seat across from Melissa.</p><p>\u201cThen stop paying attention to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard not to when he\u2019s always creating a spectacle.\u201d I waved my arms toward the gaggle of girls following his every move.</p><p>\u201cHi, Melissa.\u201d A deep voice interrupted my Jack-bashing.</p><p>\u201cOh...hi, Dean,\u201d Melissa responded, her voice all soft and sweet. I shot a quick glance at her under my eyelashes, and smiled to myself.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I sat with you?\u201d Dean smiled when he asked and kept his hazel eyes locked on Melissa\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re much better company than your brother\u2019s table anyway,\u201d she teased, poking him in the ribs.</p><p>He glanced in Jack\u2019s direction, shaking his head. \u201cIt just gets old sometimes, you know?\u201d He placed a slice of pizza on the table and sat down.</p><p>\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dean.\u201d He stretched his hand across the table.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Cassie. I\u2019m Melissa\u2019s roommate.\u201d I grabbed his hand and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean! What are you doing over here?\u201d Jack\u2019s sultry voice echoed throughout the student union, and I felt my stomach lurch. I lifted my gaze to find him staring at me, so I pinched my lips together, hoping my annoyance would be loud and clear.</p><p>\u201cOh, Kitten. I see you\u2019ve met my little brother.\u201d Jack winked before placing his hand on Dean\u2019s shoulder and squeezing.</p><p>\u201cThank God he seems nothing like you. I might actually be able to tolerate him.\u201d I tilted my head and smiled sharply before taking a bite of my turkey sandwich. I noticed Melissa and Jack sharing an amused glance, and I wanted to kick Melissa under the table. The last time I did that it left an ugly bruise on her shin and she didn\u2019t speak to me for days, so I restrained myself.</p><p>\u201cYou need me to work some of that aggression out of you?\u201d Jack offered with a sexy smile.</p><p>My mouth was full, but I didn\u2019t let that stop me. \u201cI\u2019d rather eat dirt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI almost want to see that.\u201d Jack chuckled and one dimple appeared on his cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou would. Go torture someone else,\u201d I begged, nibbling at my sandwich before looking away.</p><p>\u201cBut I like torturing you.\u201d He grinned and moved to sit next to me.</p><p>\u201cUh, no!\u201d I shouted before throwing my bag right where he was about to plop his perfect little ass. He stopped short and stood back up.</p><p>\u201cWhy so angry, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy so annoying, jackass?\u201d I mimicked his tone.</p><p>I had just taken a bite of my pickle when Jack\u2019s warm breath in my ear stopped my chewing. \u201cYou\u2019ll come around. You\u2019ll see. You can\u2019t resist me forever.\u201d</p><p>I suddenly had the urge to spit my half-chewed food all over his arrogant face. The thought of doing it made me laugh, and I accidentally inhaled a little of what I was chewing. As I choked and struggled to swallow, he walked away smiling. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry about my brother. He isn\u2019t really a jerk.\u201d Dean smiled as he defended his brother, his head cocked to one side with sincerity.</p><p>I coughed to clear my throat and picked up a napkin. \u201cHe just plays one on TV?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Don\u2019t take him too seriously. He\u2019s just having fun with you.\u201d</p><p>I half smiled. \u201cBut I\u2019m not having fun.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you are. And he knows it,\u201d Dean added, his expression a mixture of confidence and knowing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond to Dean\u2019s accusation, not wanting to prove him right...or wrong. I took a healthy bite of my sandwich when Jack walked back over to our table. Caught with a mouth full of food again, I couldn\u2019t speak, so I simply narrowed my eyes and glared at him.</p><p>He shoved a napkin into my hand and walked away without saying a word. I started to unfold it before reading #23 on the field, #1 in your heart, followed by some numbers written in black ink. I quickly crumpled it up and threw it in my bag.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Melissa interrupted the thoughts swirling around in my head.</p><p>I swallowed. \u201cHis phone number, I think. I didn\u2019t really look at it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe gave you his number?\u201d Dean\u2019s face appeared puzzled.</p><p>\u201cI think. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019ll look at it later.\u201d I was suddenly embarrassed at the assumption that Jack had given me his number, when maybe it wasn\u2019t Jack\u2019s number at all.</p><p>Melissa turned toward Dean. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t give out his phone number. There\u2019s no point with him.\u201d Dean\u2019s gaze darted from my face to Jack\u2019s, turning his head to scrutinize his brother, now sitting several tables away.</p><p>\u201cHe has a cell phone, right?\u201d Melissa asked, her head bobbing.</p><p>\u201cYeah...?\u201d Dean responded, dragging out the word like a question.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying, caller ID!\u201d She rolled her eyes.</p><p>\u201cHis number is private. It doesn\u2019t show up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Who does that?\u201d Melissa\u2019s face crinkled.</p><p>\u201cSomeone who had to change his phone number fifteen times in high school because it never stopped ringing, or pinging with text messages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifteen times?\u201d I asked, far louder than I intended. I ducked my head as several people sitting nearby stared at me with curiosity.</p><p>\u201cIt might have been more, but it was insane. The girls would post his number online and then his voice mail would fill up within a day. And then they\u2019d all start calling my phone looking for him when he didn\u2019t answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that\u2019s bananas!\u201d Melissa laughed at the insanity.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s weird that he\u2019d give you his number. He doesn\u2019t give anyone his number.\u201d Dean shook his head.</p> <p>\u201cWell, like I said, I could be wrong,\u201d I quickly recanted.</p><p>Melissa gestured toward my bag. \u201cThen get it out and read it now.\u201d</p><p>Heat spread throughout my cheeks and down my neck to my chest. \u201cNo. Not in the freaking student union while he\u2019s right over there, thanks. Later.\u201d</p><p>I rose from the table, grabbed my bag and my trash, and walked nonchalantly past Jack and his pack of groupies. I heard the sound of female voices whining when Jack pulled himself away to jog over and catch up with me.</p><p>\u201cI expect you to call me, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you expect a lot of things,\u201d I said rudely, refusing to look at him as his stride slowed and he let me walk away.</p><p>\u201cCome to my game tonight!\u201d he shouted when I opened the glass doors.</p><p>I turned toward him before walking out. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to see me pitch?\u201d He raised an eyebrow, his voice cocky.</p><p>I tilted my head, holding the door open with one arm. \u201cI saw you pitching earlier. In slow motion, remember? I think I got the gist.\u201d</p><p>The glass door closed behind me with a loud bang and I walked to my next class, wondering how long I\u2019d be able to resist him.</p><p>I opened the door to our two-bedroom apartment, the smell of this morning\u2019s bacon still lingering in the air. Mail and schoolwork were strewn across the top of our table, and I added my backpack to the mess.</p><p>Melissa sat watching TV on our L-shaped couch while eating a bowl full of cottage cheese and green grapes. I smiled at her odd food combination and headed straight into the kitchen, grabbing a bottle of water from the fridge and some chips from the cupboard.</p><p>I took a sip of the water, letting the cool moisture replenish my dehydrated body.</p><p>\u201cSo, we\u2019re going to the baseball game tonight,\u201d she informed me, and the water in my mouth sprayed out all over the carpet.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I laughed and grabbed a towel before bending down to soak up the mess. \u201cYou might be, but I\u2019m staying here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, the whole school goes to the baseball games. It\u2019s like the state of Texas and high school football.\u201d Her head tilted as I looked up from my carpet cleaning, my eyes clearly confused. \u201cFriday Night Lights, hello? Ugh, don\u2019t you watch any TV?\u201d</p><p>I chuckled at her frustration with me as she continued. \u201cAnyway, everyone goes. Especially when Jack\u2019s pitching. It\u2019s sort of a spectacle, really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d I asked, tossing the wet towel into the sink before leaning my shoulder against the wall.</p><p>She glanced up toward the ceiling and pursed her lips together. Then she looked back at me, draping her body over the side of the couch. \u201cWell, a ton of scouts are there for starters. And reporters from all the local newspapers and TV stations. You just have to see it. Even if you only go to one game, Cassie, it has to be one when Jack\u2019s pitching. Plus, you can take some really cool pictures for that Tuck magazine, or whatever it\u2019s called.\u201d</p><p>My eyebrows lifted at the thought of photographing the school\u2019s new stadium and fans. \u201cIt\u2019s called Trunk,\u201d I corrected, referring to the university\u2019s student-run magazine. \u201cAnd someone is already assigned to the baseball team. But I do need to work on my night photography.\u201d I pulled away from the wall and glanced at my camera bag, mulling the idea over.</p><p>\u201cAnd you can work on your action shots too,\u201d she added with a sly smirk.</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cThree hours ago you hated this guy, and now you\u2019re like his biggest fan. What gives?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me!\u201d Her voice was animated as she held up one finger. \u201cJack Carter the guy sucks and should be avoided at all costs. Jack Carter the baseball player is totally amazeballs and should be observed whenever possible. You see the difference?\u201d</p><p>I laughed at her insane logic. \u201cThey\u2019re both the same guy. Just want to put that out there before I agree to go.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes lit up as a grin spread across her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. So you\u2019ll go with me then?\u201d</p><p>I released a breath and closed my eyes. \u201cYes. I\u2019ll go with you,\u201d I promised, doing my best to sound disappointed.</p><p>Her squeals of delight filled the air and I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling of anticipation welling within me. I didn\u2019t want to be excited to see Jack in his element...but I was. But I\u2019d be damned if I was going to admit it.</p><p>THREE</p><p>Our apartment was only a few blocks from campus, so we walked everywhere we could. In the grand scheme of things, it was much easier than dealing with the parking situation. There were too many cars and never enough spaces. Not to mention the fact that the price of a semester parking pass cost more than my first camera. This is partly why my parents refused to let me bring my car to school. So I sit at school, car-less. And my car sits at home, driver-less.</p><p>The lights of the stadium caught my eye before anything else did. The tall fixtures beamed in every direction, giving the school the appearance that it was lit up from the inside out. I stopped quickly and dropped to my knees, unwinding the camera\u2019s thick black strap from around my wrist. I removed the lens cap and tucked it into the back pocket of my jeans. Melissa, used to my photographing ways, had already noticed my absence and silently waited for me.</p><p>I brought the viewfinder to my right eye and closed the left, as strands of my hair dangled in my line of vision. I let out an aggravated breath before gently placing my camera on the ground between my feet and twirling my long blonde mane into a knot at the back of my head. With my hair firmly out of my eyes, I angled the lens to show only the top of the baseball stadium, with the lights and the illuminated sky as the focal point. I manually adjusted the focus and the shutter speed before pressing the shutter release button and hearing the familiar click sound I\u2019d grown to love. Satisfied with the preview on the screen, I stood up and walked over to Melissa.</p><p>\u201cGood shot?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said, reaching in my back pocket to fish out the lens cap.</p><p>I was still learning how to use my new digital camera. I\u2019d saved for two full years to buy it, hoarding every bit of Christmas and birthday money from relatives and doing small photography jobs for local businesses and high school seniors. Oftentimes I thought the picture on the camera\u2019s small preview screen looked gorgeous, only to find out it was blurry or nowhere near as pretty once it was full-sized on my computer monitor. But I was learning.</p><p>We walked side by side toward the stadium\u2019s entrance. Melissa wasn\u2019t joking when she said it was a spectacle. The line to get in exceeded the length of the field and spilled out into the parking lot. We took our place at the end and I removed my lens cap once again, mesmerized by the sea of orange and dark blue that engulfed us. Everyone was decked out in our school colors, some wearing mock baseball jerseys with players\u2019 names on the back. I laughed to myself at the sheer number of \u201cCarter, 23\u201d shirts I saw and couldn\u2019t resist photographing a few.</p><p>\u201cCassie, come on! You can do that once we sit!\u201d Melissa urged, scanning the seat numbers on our tickets.</p><p>I followed obediently behind her. \u201cDon\u2019t most of the students sit in the bleachers?\u201d I pointed toward left field.</p><p>\u201cDepends on what you\u2019re trying to see.\u201d Melissa batted her long black eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cOh no. What have you done?\u201d My legs began to tremble as I watched Melissa lead me all the way down the stairs to the front row, closest to the field.</p><p>She turned around, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cHere we are,\u201d she announced before plopping down and looking left into the team\u2019s dugout.</p><p>I turned my head as well and realized we were practically in the freaking dugout. I leaned toward Melissa, almost knocking some poor guy\u2019s drink in his lap. \u201cSorry,\u201d I said quickly before squatting next to her. \u201cI am not sitting here!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you are. These are our seats and the game\u2019s sold out.\u201d She smiled innocently and patted the empty seat next to her.</p><p>I scowled. \u201cAt least switch seats with me then. I don\u2019t want to be the one closest to their dugout.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d she said before hopping up and flipping her hair.</p><p>I begrudgingly sat and slinked down into my seat, trying to conceal myself behind Melissa\u2019s tiny frame. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Jack to know I was here. Now there\u2019s no way he won\u2019t see me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about you. You\u2019re thinking too much.\u201d She sloughed me off with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cYou better be right.\u201d I sighed, wondering how long I had to stay. I avoided looking anywhere near the team\u2019s dugout, afraid of who might be looking back at me, when Melissa called me on it.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t see you, Cass. You can look in there. Hell, you can even photograph the dugout. He won\u2019t know,\u201d she informed me, her face serious.</p><p>\u201cHow is that even possible?\u201d I gave Melissa my best duh look.</p> <p>\u201cBecause Jack\u2019s all business out here. He doesn\u2019t look in the stands. Ever. And I mean, ever. Last year this girl took her freaking top off and screamed Jack\u2019s name like a lunatic the entire time he was up to bat. He didn\u2019t move a muscle to look in her direction. I could light your ass on fire and he wouldn\u2019t even know.\u201d</p><p>I laughed super loud. \u201cPlease don\u2019t test that theory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook around, Cassie. I\u2019m pretty sure this is the one thing in life he takes seriously.\u201d Melissa leaned back into her seat, taking a sip of the soda she\u2019d just bought from a roaming vendor.</p><p>I scanned the crowd and noticed that we were surrounded by what appeared to be major league scouts. Each carried their own radar gun to measure the speed of Jack\u2019s pitches, and notepads to write everything down. There was a forest of television and press cameras lined up on tripods behind home plate. It was the closest thing to a media circus I\u2019d ever seen. And I currently held my own professional-sized camera, which definitely helped us fit in with all the madness.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to Fullton Field!\u201d The announcer\u2019s voice filled the air, as the cheers slowly died down in volume.</p> <p>\u201cHere to sing the national anthem is our very own Fullton State student, Laura Malloy!\u201d Cheers reenergized the atmosphere as Laura smiled nervously before closing her eyes tightly and singing the opening words in perfect pitch.</p><p>I instinctively grabbed my camera and adjusted the lens, focusing on the emotions of her face, and snapped multiple pictures. When she finished, I watched as she walked toward the players lined up along the third base line and smiled hopefully at Jack. I secretly loved it when he didn\u2019t acknowledge her.</p><p>\u201cWe have a sold-out crowd tonight, folks, and we all know why! Taking the mound against our rivals from Florida is the one and only Jack Carter!\u201d The announcer enunciated Jack\u2019s name like he was the savior of the free world, like he\u2019d cured cancer, or delivered rainbows to colorless skies everywhere.</p><p>No, I take it back.</p><p>He said Jack\u2019s name like Jack was a hero.</p><p>And I guess in a way he was. He brought media attention to the school and recognition to the baseball program. That attention translated into revenue for the school and top baseball prospects all wanted to play here. Jack was this university\u2019s very own marketing machine.</p> <p>The school worshipped him. It wasn\u2019t just the girls on campus who wanted to be around him, it was everyone. I never realized the extent of his popularity before tonight.</p><p>\u201cNow taking the field, your Fullton State Outlaws!\u201d The announcer\u2019s voice paused before continuing. \u201cAnd now taking the mound, Jack Car-terrrrr!\u201d He dragged out Jack\u2019s last name, just like the wrestling announcers on TV.</p><p>The stadium erupted with ear-piercing shouts, howls, cheers, and screams. I looked at Melissa, shock clearly written all over my face, and she laughed, having witnessed this all before.</p><p>Jack walked confidently toward the dirt mound, his white-and-blue pinstriped sliding pants hugging his body in all the right places. I watched as his thigh muscles contracted against his pants with each step he took, and admired how good his butt looked in his uniform. His upper body was unfortunately hidden underneath a loose-fitting dark blue jersey with orange and white lettering.</p><p>His face looked different, more focused. This wasn\u2019t the playful guy from the student union anymore. This was the confident, serious baseball player.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019cha smiling at?\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice cut through my inner dialogue.</p><p>I quickly dropped the smile I didn\u2019t know I was wearing. \u201cNothing,\u201d I snapped, and looked away, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s irritating how good he looks in his uniform, right?\u201d</p> <p>I jerked my head back toward her. \u201cSeriously. Why does he have to be so hot?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause he\u2019s a jerk. Jerks are always hot,\u201d Melissa reminded me with a nod.</p><p>Jack stood on top of the pitcher\u2019s mound, his left cleat kicking at the dirt in front of him. He placed his toes on the white rubber, dropped his glove hand to his knee, and gripped the ball with his left. His eyes focused solely on his catcher squatting sixty feet away. With a brief nod he leaned back, his body performing a motion so fluid and smooth it looked like it was made for him.</p><p>When his left hand released the ball, it flew by at a speed so quick I could barely make out anything but a white blur. The sound of the ball impacting against the catcher\u2019s mitt was so loud it echoed against the backstop. The batter stepped out from the batter\u2019s box and looked nervously at his coach before stepping back in. Two more pitches screamed by and that was out number one of the night.</p><p>\u201cStrike three! You\u2019re out!\u201d the umpire shouted enthusiastically and the crowd cheered wildly.</p><p>The scouts in the stands huddled together, comparing the red \u201c 97 94 \u201d digital readout on their radar gun screens.</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, that was ninety- seven four miles an hour,\u201d I said out loud, my mouth slightly open.</p><p>\u201cI told you he\u2019s good.\u201d</p><p>I focused my camera on the pitching mound, with Jack\u2019s feet and the bottom of his glove dangling in the viewfinder. Click. Then I moved the lens up to view his bare left hand, gripping the baseball between three fingers, the red-stitched seam barely visible. Click. He brought his glove up to his face and all features except his brown eyes disappeared behind it. Click. His face twisted as he released the powerful pitch, his eyes never leaving their target. Click. Sweaty dark hair briefly saw light as Jack removed his cap and wiped the sweat from his brow with his sleeve. Click.</p><p>When the inning ended, I watched Jack jog off the field and into the dugout, never once looking into the stands. He instantly reappeared, a dark blue helmet on his head, two bats in hand. He swung the bats around like a windmill, stretching his shoulders. And when he bent over to stretch his hamstrings, girlish screams filled the air, along with flashes of light.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d I shook my head, looking around at the people taking pictures.</p><p>\u201cSpectacle,\u201d was all Melissa said with a laugh.</p><p>Jack stepped around home plate and into the batter\u2019s box, his demeanor completely relaxed. Since he was left-handed, the front of him was in full view, as opposed to the back of all the right-handed hitters. I started to grab my camera, but then shoved it back on my lap instead. I had enough pictures of Jack for one night.</p><p>The opposing pitcher went through his motion and as he released the ball, Jack took a small step forward before his hips twisted with his swing. The ping of the ball against the metal bat quickly disappeared amidst all the cheering. Jack easily rounded first base and picked up speed as he raced toward second. The outfielder fired the ball at the shortstop as Jack slid headfirst into the bag, a cloud of dust encircling him.</p><p>\u201cSafe!\u201d The umpire shouted his call, his arms outstretched on either side of his body.</p><p>Jack planted both feet on top of the dusty base and brushed the dirt off his chest before dipping down the belt of his pants and allowing clumps of dirt to fall out. I was completely turned on.</p><p>I suck, I suck, I suck.</p><p>I overheard one scout ask another, \u201cWhat did you clock him to first?\u201d Referring to Jack\u2019s base running speed from home plate to first base.</p><p>The other scout glanced at his stopwatch. \u201cFour point one.\u201d The first scout nodded his head in agreement and scribbled down more notes.</p><p>The photographer in me couldn\u2019t hold out any longer. I zoomed in on Jack\u2019s hands, now covered in batting gloves as he stepped away from second base with three long strides. Click. The dark of his eyes, now shadowed from his helmet, gave him an almost ominous appearance. Click.</p><p>\u201cGonna make a Jack photo album for yourself later?\u201d Melissa flicked a finger at my shoulder as she teased me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who said I needed to work on my action shots!\u201d I whisper-shouted.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say they all had to be of Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d I snapped the lens cap on and quickly flipped the power button into the Off position, where it stayed for the remainder of the game.</p><p>When it finally ended, Jack had pitched all nine innings and only gave up one run and three hits. The final score was eight to one, us. I grabbed my camera and shoved it into my purse before looking back at the team celebrating on the field. The coach pulled Jack aside and escorted him over to the press area where he was besieged by reporters, scouts, and fans.</p><p>Jack glanced up from the field and directly into my eyes. That single look stopped me in my tracks, and I was slammed into by the man walking behind me. Jack smiled and turned his attention back toward the cameras and journalists.</p><p>FOUR</p><p>I strolled through the tree-lined campus, following the cement pathway that would eventually lead me to the Trunk offices. I\u2019d joined the award-winning student-run magazine at the insistence of my visual communications professor. Even though I was required to take writing classes with my major, my focus was on the visual reporting side of things. I yearned to improve my craft, bringing life-changing visuals to accompanying articles.</p><p>I spotted the one-story brick building up ahead. All the newer buildings on campus were constructed with red and white brick, while the original buildings were large white stucco structures. It never made sense to me why they wouldn\u2019t at least attempt to match the newer buildings with the older ones.</p><p>I pulled the tinted glass door open and a gush of air conditioning greeted my face. I moved my sunglasses on top of my head, pulling my long hair back with them as I rounded the corner.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dani,\u201d I said as I entered, not wanting to startle Danielle, who squinted at the computer before she looked up.</p><p>\u201cHey, Cassie, come look at this.\u201d She waved me over, her expression still tight. I peered around her puffy brown ponytail and over her shoulder at the photograph on the screen. \u201cI need this picture to have more expression. It\u2019s not giving me what I want. What am I missing?\u201d</p><p>I looked at the eight-year-old boy standing in front of spilled water buckets, his expression sorrowful. \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t think it should be in black and white. The details get lost in this photo. May I?\u201d I pointed at the seat she occupied.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She jumped up from the seat as we switched positions.</p><p>I reopened the original picture in the photo editing software and manipulated the colors before pointing to the screen. \u201cLook at the dirty rug hanging behind him. I barely noticed it in black and white. The cracks in the buckets, and the rubble at his feet,\u201d I paused, \u201cwere all lost before. This picture needs to be in color.

I thought you might want to use them for the feature you\u2019re running on Jack Carter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not one of...\u201d she hesitated, \u201cthem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of...what?\u201d I asked, my eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cOne of the hundreds of girls on campus in love with all things Jack Carter.\u201d She rolled her eyes and let out a sigh.</p><p>I guffawed. \u201cUh, no. I can\u2019t stand the guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell that\u2019s a first,\u201d she admitted with a laugh. \u201cWe have a million pictures of Jack, but in all honesty, I\u2019d love to see anything you shot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Dani.\u201d I sat up a little straighter and smiled, unable to quell the little rise of pride welling up inside me.</p><p>\u201cNow that you saved me from killing myself over this photo, I need to eat. See you later and thanks again.\u201d She tossed her purse strap over her shoulder, catching the ends of her ponytail in it before cursing and tugging the strands free.</p><p>It took longer than I expected to edit the photos from last night, but I had to admit they were good. They were better than good, actually. My stomach rumbled and I wondered if Melissa was still on campus. I sent her a quick text to which she responded, \u201cStill here. In the SU.\u201d</p><p>I wrote back, \u201cI have class in a few, but I\u2019m on my way,\u201d before inserting the memory card into my camera and shoving it into my backpack. I passed some girls and pretended not to notice when they pointed and whispered Jack\u2019s name.</p><p>Irritated, I took a detour through campus, pleased when I noticed the pathway was virtually vacant. I shook my head while I walked, annoyed that Jack\u2019s antics had made me the focus of attention I didn\u2019t want.</p><p>I threw open the heavy glass door and heard the sound of bowling pins crashing. Craning my neck to see the bowler, I smiled when I recognized the guy from my digital foundations class. Quick bursts of light alerted me that he wasn\u2019t bowling for fun and I watched another kid from class taking pictures of him.</p> <p>I diverted my attention and looked around the sparse crowd for Melissa\u2019s face. She tilted her head and stuck out her tongue, catching my eye, before I strolled over to where she and Dean were sitting. I flung my pack on the table before plopping down.</p><p>\u201cThought you weren\u2019t coming to my game?\u201d Jack slid his body into the seat next to mine, his tone sounding a bit arrogant.</p><p>\u201cMy roommate threatened to set me on fire if I didn\u2019t.\u201d I kept my voice cool and avoided his eyes, scooting my body away from his.</p><p>\u201cWell, at least now I know how to get you to go out with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going out with you,\u201d I said, turning my head away from him.</p><p>\u201cAt least give me your number then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Cause I don\u2019t want to.\u201d I breathed out, still irritated about the way other girls acted around him. It just kept eating at me, which was a good thing, because it helped me resist Jack. God help me.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop calling me that!\u201d I rose from the table, grabbing my things. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d I announced, my attention solely focused on Melissa.</p><p>I flung my pack across my shoulder and slipped hastily out a side door. Dropping my sunglasses over my eyes, I headed toward the tall Communications &amp; Arts Building.</p><p>\u201cKitten! Kitten, wait up!\u201d</p><p>I looked back to see Jack racing to catch me, and everyone\u2019s attention drawn toward us.</p><p>\u201cFor the last time, my name isn\u2019t Kitten.\u201d Hiking my bag strap a little higher on my shoulder, I sped up my pace.</p><p>\u201cI know! But you\u2019ve never told me your real name,\u201d he said, slightly out of breath.</p><p>I let out a quick sigh. \u201cCassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to meet you, Cassie.\u201d He said my name all syrupy sweet and his brown eyes danced. It was easy to see why girls threw themselves at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s nice to meet you too, but I haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. A real, hearty laugh and I had to stop myself from doing the same. \u201cAnything I can do to help sway your decision?\u201d He scratched his hair, his bicep flexing.</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me take you out, Cass.\u201d He said it so honestly, I almost believed he genuinely wanted to.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I stood firm, my tone flat.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy my dates to be disease-free.\u201d</p><p>Score one for Cassie.</p><p>Take that, Jack Carter.</p><p>\u201cAs do I,\u201d he quipped confidently before giving a head nod to a passing teammate.</p><p>Now it was my turn to laugh. \u201cRight. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019re not really particular about who you date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you heard wrong, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. Actually, I heard you don\u2019t date at all. You just sleep with any girl who bats her fake eyelashes in your direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really need to meet your sources.\u201d</p><p>He followed me into the white stucco building. When I reached my classroom door, I turned to him and said, \u201cSee ya, Carter,\u201d as I headed down the stairs to my regular seat.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to be this hostile on our date?\u201d he shouted into the packed room.</p><p>All heads turned my direction, curiosity overwhelming them. I swallowed the lump in my throat and willed my cheeks to not turn red. Yeah, like that\u2019s going to work.</p><p>Pausing on the stairs, I pivoted and glared at Jack. \u201cWho said I was going on a date with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t make me beg, Kitten.\u201d I shot him an irritated glare as the classroom filled with whispers and sounds of shock. \u201cDon\u2019t make me beg in front of all these people. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go out with you, Jack,\u201d a busty blonde shouted, poking her shellacked face out from behind her seat.</p><p>\u201cPerfect! I\u2019m sure you two will have a great time together.\u201d I dropped into my seat and slinked lower, wishing for the power to become invisible.</p><p>My eyes closed and I took a few deep breaths before warm whispers interrupted my attempt to relax. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out with her, Kitten. I want to go out with you.\u201d His breath tingled against my neck, causing the small hairs to prickle with excitement and sending goose bumps shooting down my arm.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing? Get out of here,\u201d I whispered, my tough facade cracking.</p><p>Honestly, I\u2019m surprised it lasted this long.</p><p>\u201cPromise me you\u2019ll think about it.\u201d His voice lowered with insistence, then he gave my shoulder a gentle squeeze.</p><p>\u201cPromise you I\u2019ll think about going out with the school\u2019s biggest player? Oh sure, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Seriously?</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d he insisted.</p><p>Either he was actually sincere, or he was a really good bullshit artist and I was completely buying into it. I took one deep breath. I turned my head to the left and looked him dead in the eyes. \u201cFine. I promise I\u2019ll think about it. Will you go away now?\u201d</p><p>A wide grin emerged and his gorgeous dimples appeared, torturing me with their adorable sex appeal. He stood up without another word and walked out of the classroom. I sat in silence, trying to hear anything other than the sound of my heart banging like wild bongo drums in my ears.</p><p>I\u2019m pathetic.</p><p>When class ended, I walked outside to find Jack surrounded by a group of giggling girls. His eyes met mine and he broke from the circle, running to catch up. \u201cStalk much?\u201d I said between breaths.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not stalking when you enjoy it,\u201d he teased, overconfidence oozing from every perfect pore.</p><p>Half of me wanted to punch his gorgeous face, and the other half wanted to make out with it. \u201cI bet you say that to all the girls.\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to say that to all the girls. You\u2019re the only one who gives me crap for things like...breathing.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes.</p><p>Again.</p><p>\u201cWell, you\u2019re an annoying breather.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an annoying eye-roller,\u201d he fired back.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I stopped walking and turned toward his smug face, causing the pack of girls following us to stop as well.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t roll your eyes like that. Didn\u2019t your parents ever tell you it wasn\u2019t good for you?\u201d He shoved a hand into his front pocket as girls walked by, begging for his attention. I had his complete interest, whether I wanted it or not.</p><p>\u201cMy parents said a lot of things,\u201d I responded defensively.</p><p>\u201cOh, I get it now.\u201d His voice was as sweet as Southern iced tea. \u201cDaddy issues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow does any girl stand you?\u201d He made me so mad I wanted to smack his smarmy face, but I just stood there frozen as the wind breezed through my hair.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the dimples.\u201d Jack actually delivered the line seriously, pointing at the indent on his cheek before breaking into a big smile.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take the banter any more. \u201cAt least you\u2019re humble,\u201d I said, before willing my legs to move.</p><p>\u201cJust let me take you out. One date,\u201d he shouted at my retreating frame. \u201cAnd if you hate it and we have a horrible time, you never have to go out with me again.\u201d</p><p>I stopped walking and turned to face him. \u201cSo that\u2019s it? Just one date and you\u2019ll go away forever?\u201d I laughed, actually considering the idea.</p><p>We were making a scene again as girls whispered and guys waited to observe if Jack Carter would actually get shot down.</p><p>\u201cJust one date.\u201d He held up one finger in front of my face before involving the crowd. \u201cHelp me out here, guys.\u201d He turned to face the gawkers. \u201cTell her to go out with me one time. What can it hurt?\u201d</p><p>The crowd roared with encouragement, and I heard shouts like, \u201cAwwww, go out with him!\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s just one date! Do it!\u201d</p><p>I shook my head and rolled my eyes. \u201cFine. Just one.\u201d Loud cheers erupted at my response. You\u2019d think I\u2019d just accepted a marriage proposal the way those idiots were carrying on.</p><p>What had I just gotten myself into?</p><p>FIVE</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe I agreed to this,\u201d I said, burying my face in my hands.</p><p>Melissa plopped down next to me on the floor of my bedroom. \u201cThis is a bad idea. You should probably call him and cancel.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my head and let out a deep sigh. \u201cHe\u2019d never leave me alone then!\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Oh my God, you have to go.\u201d</p><p>I pulled myself up and studied my face in my bedroom mirror. \u201cMaybe it won\u2019t be so bad?\u201d I wondered as I brushed powder across my face.</p><p>\u201cOr maybe it will?\u201d Melissa bit her bottom lip, her face contorted in thought.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>Melissa grinned mischievously. \u201cIf the date is horrible then he\u2019ll go away, right?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what he said,\u201d I responded reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, then all you have to do is be a crappy date! You know, like what\u2019s-her-face in How to Lose A Guy in Ten Days!\u201d</p><p>I leaned away from her, pondering her suggestion while I dropped the brush and picked up my mascara.</p><p>\u201cOh my God! You little slut! You want to have a good date with him. You love him and want to have ten thousand of his little baseball babies! Cassie!!!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere do you come up with this stuff?\u201d I asked through my laughter.</p><p>\u201cMovies. They have the best lines.\u201d Melissa\u2019s eyes twinkled, matching the huge grin on her face.</p><p>The doorbell rang and my laughter caught in my throat. Shit. I wasn\u2019t ready for this. My deer-in-the-headlights look grabbed Melissa\u2019s attention. \u201cI\u2019ll go let him in and keep him occupied until you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>I sighed. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>I could hear the sound of our front door creaking open as his friendly voice reverberated down the hall and into my room, causing me to shake nervously. Gripping the fine liner brush tightly with a trembling hand, I finished lining my lips and brushed a soft seashell-colored gloss on top. I smacked my lips together once, then puckered to make sure the gloss was evenly spread.</p> <p>Before I left my room, I did a quick squat in front of the mirror. I watched as my low-rise jeans went even lower, revealing far too much of my pink underwear. I pulled my black tank top down around my waist and bent over again. My jeans still pulled low in the back, but my top stayed firm.</p><p>I rounded the corner and heard Jack\u2019s voice stop abruptly when he caught sight of me. \u201cYou look adorable, Kitten.\u201d His voice practically purred.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019m not going.\u201d I threw my hands up in the air and turned back toward the hall.</p><p>He stopped me with his laughing response. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cass. I won\u2019t call you that anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure you can help it.\u201d I eyed him narrowly.</p><p>\u201cI might slip up a time or two, but can you really blame me?\u201d He shoved his hands into the pockets of his black and white shorts and then batted his thick eyelashes at me.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Don\u2019t call me Kitten. It\u2019s annoying and it makes me hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she always this argumentative?\u201d he asked Melissa through a one-dimpled smirk.</p><p>She smiled coyly at him. \u201cNot usually. You must be special.\u201d</p><p>Oh my God! She turned into complete mush in two seconds! Traitor!</p><p>I shot Melissa a shocked and horrified glare and turned to see Jack smiling as if he had won the top prize at the fair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t give me that look,\u201d I threatened through gritted teeth.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He shrugged his strong, broad shoulders. \u201cYou think I\u2019m special. It\u2019s cool.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t resist rolling my eyes at him. \u201cThe only type of special I think you are is e-specially irritating. Like a rash.\u201d</p> <p>He let out a quick huff. \u201cCome on, Kit...er, Cassie. Let\u2019s go. It was nice to meet you, Melissa.\u201d He grabbed her little five-foot-two-inch frame and squeezed until she giggled wildly.</p><p>Traitorous bitch.</p><p>\u201cSee you later, Meli.\u201d I shook my head and mouthed, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d at her. She waved me away and blew me a kiss.</p><p>Jack led me in the direction of his car. Since I had no idea which one was his, I followed blindly one step behind. He walked over to the passenger side of a vintage white Ford Bronco covered with dents, scratches, and chipped paint.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure this thing\u2019s legal on the streets?\u201d I asked, eyeing the giant, oversized tires and lack of a roof.</p><p>His eyebrows pinched together. \u201cYou scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you high?\u201d I squinted toward him. \u201cNo, really, do you do drugs \u2019cause I don\u2019t date guys who do drugs.\u201d</p><p>He turned the key and the door unlatched with a pop and squeaked open. Then he took me by the hand and gently helped me up into the seat, placing his hand firmly on my rear.</p><p>\u201cHands off the ass, Carter,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cI was just helping you up. Honest.\u201d He feigned innocence as he closed the door behind me. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re not scared?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared. This car just looks like something that belongs on a sand dune or in a monster truck rally or a repair shop.\u201d I glanced down, noticing the silver-dollar-sized hole in the floor.</p><p>\u201cIs it the tires?\u201d he asked sincerely.</p><p>\u201cThey are massive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like my\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI swear to God,\u201d I quickly interrupted and turned away.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He laughed. \u201cI was going to say heart. The tires are as big as my heart.\u201d He patted his chest for emphasis.</p><p>\u201cYou mean as big as the hole in your chest where your heart\u2019s supposed to be?\u201d The verbal jab dropped out of my mouth before I could stop it.</p><p>\u201cOuch. Can we at least wait until dinner before you decide I\u2019m heartless?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d His brown eyes softened and he grabbed the wheel, put the key in the ignition, and turned. The engine rumbled to life and my seat vibrated under me. I strapped the old seatbelt around my body and gave Jack a wary glance.</p><p>\u201cYou are scared,\u201d he said with concern.</p><p>I shook my head defiantly. \u201cI\u2019m fine, just go.\u201d I gestured toward the road.</p><p>He removed his hand from the stick shift and placed it on my leg. I winced in response.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about the touching?\u201d I asked, giving him a sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cFifty cents. Don\u2019t worry, I got it covered.\u201d One dimple greeted me before quickly disappearing. \u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded as he put the car in drive and it rocked forward as he gassed it.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d He muttered under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Suddenly I was concerned for our well-being. We were going to tip over from the massive tires and die.</p><p>\u201cI meant to ask you this before we left, but I got distracted. You\u2019re so feisty all the time, you make me forget things.\u201d His left arm rested on top of his door panel and he leaned his head into his hand. I watched as his fingers made their way through his hair, grabbing fistfuls as he eyed the road ahead.</p><p>\u201cSo are you going to ask me, or are you going to make me guess?\u201d I tried to hide the snark in my voice, but failed.</p><p>Jack turned to look at me briefly before returning his gaze forward. \u201cI meant to ask you if you eat meat or not?\u201d</p><p>I felt my face contort into a look of confusion and surprise. \u201cSo you want to know if I\u2019m a vegetarian?\u201d</p><p>He let out an exasperated sigh. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I want to buy you a cow. Why do you think?\u201d He tried to keep calm, but his cheeks were slowly turning a nice shade of red.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Where are you taking me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking you to the best burger joint in town and they don\u2019t have a menu for vegetarians.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? They don\u2019t serve salads?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cNo. They don\u2019t.\u201d His tone turned serious as he glanced in my direction again.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t stifle my laughter as I almost choked on my words. \u201cI eat meat.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow and eyed me tentatively before I smacked the shoulder nearest me with the back of my hand. \u201cNot that kind of meat!\u201d I huffed before looking away. \u201cI\u2019m not a vegetarian! You\u2019re so irritating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou keep saying that, yet here you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I had a choice.\u201d I rolled my eyes so he\u2019d notice.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you about that, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do we have to go over this whole \u2018Kitten\u2019 thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many times do we have to go over the eye roll thing? It\u2019s bad for you and I\u2019d hate to see anything happen to those gorgeous green eyes of yours.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to formulate a comeback as his compliment floated in the air. My breath faltered and my mind stopped focusing on anything but the sound of his voice and the look on his stupid, beautiful face.</p><p>\u201cCat got your tongue, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe next red light you come to, I swear to God, I\u2019m jumping out of this death trap and walking home.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, clearly amused. \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes, refusing to believe his words. When we arrived at the restaurant, I hopped out of the car quicker than he could turn off the ignition. The place was a converted old ice cream shop. The few items they offered were written in chalk on the wall when you first walked in. An old cash register sported a handwritten note that read Cash Only, and when I got a look at the number of diners packing the room, my brain quickly went from wondering how they stayed in business to how they kept all their customers happy.</p><p>\u201cIs it always like this?\u201d I asked Jack, shocked at the massive crowd.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack.\u201d A gorgeous brunette rushed passed us, reaching out to touch his arm.</p><p>\u201cHey, Sarah. Busy tonight, eh?\u201d he shouted, trying to be heard over the hum of the crowd.</p><p>\u201cAlways!\u201d she answered with a smile and a wink.</p><p>It figures. \u201cCome here often?\u201d I asked, annoyed already.</p><p>\u201cI told you, it\u2019s the best burger place in town.\u201d</p><p>Sarah reappeared and rested an arm on Jack\u2019s shoulders. \u201cSit anywhere you want, sweetie. You want your usual?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at me before answering her. \u201cCass, you like bacon? Fries?\u201d</p><p>I nodded my head. \u201cMm-hmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it two, please. Thanks, Sarah.\u201d</p><p>She looked at me briefly before turning her attention back to my date. \u201cI get off at midnight,\u201d she whispered in his ear loud enough for me to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on a date,\u201d he said harshly.</p><p>\u201cOh, of course you are. Later then.\u201d She scurried away, her face flushed from embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that.\u201d Jack put his hand lightly at the small of my back, leading us to a small booth in the far end of the room. \u201cOh, I almost forgot! I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>Before I could argue, he hopped from the booth and ran out the front door. I watched through the restaurant\u2019s large plate-glass window as he opened the passenger side of his death trap and reached into the glove compartment. I fiddled with strands of my hair, tucking pieces behind my ear as I watched Jack\u2019s every move. Two water glasses appeared in front of me and I turned to greet Sarah with a smile. She didn\u2019t return the gesture as Jack reappeared and slid into his side of the booth.</p><p>\u201cFirst things first,\u201d he said, pulling a paper bag from his jacket pocket. I heard the sound of metal clanking against fiberglass as he poured the entire contents of the bag onto our table.</p><p>Quarters spilled out in every direction. Several rolled off the table, spilling onto the floor and into my lap, the rest covering portions of the tabletop. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty cents a touch, right? This oughta cover me for a while.\u201d He grinned, obviously proud of himself, as he folded his arms behind his head and leaned into them. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I welcomed the heat rising in my cheeks. \u201cCute,\u201d I admitted reluctantly, gathering the quarters into a pile at the end of the table, fighting a smile.</p><p>One for Jack Carter. Dammit.</p><p>He didn\u2019t respond. He simply sat there smiling, focusing those dark brown eyes on me. \u201cStop looking at me like that,\u201d I said, flustered.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLike I\u2019m a slab of meat and you\u2019re hungry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed loudly and relaxed into his seat, slinging his muscular arm over the back of the booth. He rubbed his hand over his face and looked around, letting his eyes roam the restaurant and then his gaze slid back to me as he sipped his water. \u201cYou\u2019re different.\u201d</p><p>I rested my elbows on the table and leaned toward him, intrigued. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell for starters, you\u2019re sassy. I never know what you\u2019re going to say or do next.\u201d He grabbed one of the quarters and flicked it, watching as it spun in circles.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just sad, Jack.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but be annoyed that my sassiness was so defiant in his world.</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re not impressed by me.\u201d Oh my God...he actually winced.</p><p>\u201cOh, I know how tough that must be for you. I mean, you are just...\u201d I waved my hands in his direction, \u201cso impressive.\u201d My eyes widened sarcastically with the words.</p><p>\u201cI mean it. Every other girl is always clamoring to get near me and you\u2019re the first girl trying to get the hell away.\u201d</p><p>I fell back into the booth laughing, feeling my tense muscles relax for the first time tonight. \u201cWhat can I say? I guess I\u2019m not like every other girl.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head, burying a smile. \u201cSo tell me, Cass, what\u2019s your story?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d I took a gulp of water, casting my eyes away to hide the truth I just might be willing to tell him.</p> <p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I seen you before this year?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI went to community college the past two years. I just transferred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d He took another swig of water and placed it back down. \u201cSo where are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout two hours northwest of here. Lived in the same house my whole life. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI grew up ten minutes from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? So close. Did you even think about going anywhere else? I mean, I\u2019m sure you had a lot of offers for baseball.\u201d I was genuinely surprised, considering what I\u2019d seen of his talent and everyone\u2019s reaction to it.</p><p>He grimaced slightly before his expression softened. \u201cI got offers everywhere. I could have gone to USC, UCLA, Texas, Florida, Georgia, Alabama...you name it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you?\u201d I leaned into the table with interest.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to play for Coach Davies,\u201d he explained. \u201cBut mostly I wanted to stay near my grandparents.\u201d His voice lowered with emotion, his eyes focused somewhere in the distance.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I leaned back in shock.</p><p>\u201cNot the answer you expected?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I mean, it\u2019s sweet and all, but I don\u2019t get it. Why your grandparents?\u201d I craved honesty from him. Honest words, honest thoughts, honest emotions.</p><p>\u201cThey practically raised me and Dean.\u201d</p><p>I smiled at the mention of his brother\u2019s name. \u201cI like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to put in a good word for you? I know him pretty well.\u201d Jack sounded like he was teasing, but there was a bit of a sharp undertone to his offer.</p><p>\u201cNo thanks. He\u2019s not really my type. Too nice,\u201d I added, erasing the worry lines from his face. \u201cHow\u2019d you both get into the same school, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was one of my conditions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConditions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I only agreed to come here if they agreed to let him in too.\u201d</p><p>My jaw dropped. \u201cYou bribed the university?\u201d</p><p>He wagged his finger. \u201cNo. I just said I\u2019d come here as long as when Dean was old enough, they\u2019d let him in too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they agreed to that?\u201d I asked, somewhat horrified. \u201cI mean, obviously they did \u2019cause you\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cDean would have gotten in anyway, but I wanted assurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d I ran my fingers through my hair, tucking the stray strands back in place behind my ear, quietly fighting the sense that this guy might not be so bad after all.</p><p>He leaned across the table, inching closer to me. \u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just different than I expected,\u201d I answered, focusing on his full lips.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019re judgmental.\u201d He leaned back with a smile.</p><p>I closed my mouth and narrowed my eyes, unprepared for the rant that was about to leave my lips. \u201cNo. That\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019re a pig. You\u2019re typical and selfish and pathetic and you treat girls like shit and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he interrupted, his tone offended. \u201cWho says I treat girls like shit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry, Jack, but I don\u2019t know anyone who enjoys being fucked one minute and forgotten about the next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound so heartless when you say it like that,\u201d he admitted, my words apparently stinging.</p><p>\u201cWell it kind of is.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cAnd you wonder why I wanted to stay away from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I\u2019d do the same thing to you.\u201d His eyes widened as understanding settled in.</p><p>\u201cI assumed you wanted to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I want to sleep with you,\u201d he admitted without shame and I felt my inner thighs tingle. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sold on the forgetting about you part.\u201d</p><p>I eyed him warily, my heart racing beneath my shirt. \u201cYou probably say that to all the girls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have to say that to all the girls.\u201d</p><p>I sat in silence, stunned by his honesty.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d He reached over and tapped my hand with one finger, bringing me out of my thoughts.</p><p>\u201cHonestly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t trust myself with you.\u201d</p><p>He folded his arms across his chest. \u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I can\u2019t tell whether or not you mean the things you say.\u201d</p><p>He uncrossed his arms and leaned into the table again. \u201cWhat does your heart tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho cares? My heart\u2019s dumb! It believes anything,\u201d I said, clutching at my chest above my left breast.</p><p>He laughed, his eyes glued to my hand. \u201cFine. What does your head tell you then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy head questions everything and believes nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo your head wants proof and your heart wants reassurance?\u201d A small line appeared between Jack\u2019s eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you just made life a thousand times more difficult.\u201d He grabbed his head with both hands and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I came up with my boy test...to protect myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect yourself from what?\u201d he asked, reaching for another quarter.</p><p>\u201cGuys like you.\u201d</p><p>Our conversation was interrupted by the sound of plates being set on the table. \u201cHere you go, two Titan specials with fries. You two need anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. Kitten?\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes so hard it hurt. \u201cCan I get a side of ranch dressing, please? Thanks.\u201d</p><p>My eyes widened at the sight of my burger. It looked like it could feed the entire football team. And the mound of french fries that sat next to it had to consist of twenty potatoes.</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me you can\u2019t actually finish this?\u201d I looked at Jack, my face shocked.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI can. And you better clean your whole plate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cClean this?\u201d I pointed to the plate with an incredulous look.</p><p>He laughed again before lifting the burger to his face and taking a mammoth-sized bite. Sarah dropped off the dressing and I dipped the hot fries in, biting carefully. \u201cHoly crap, these are amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTold you,\u201d he managed to say, his mouth stuffed with food.</p><p>I hated how cute he was. Even with a mouth full of food, he was still irritatingly adorable.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your boy test.\u201d He picked up his napkin to swipe at a smear of ketchup on his chin.</p><p>\u201cForget I said anything about it.\u201d I waved him off with my hands.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Cass. I want to know.\u201d He eyed me curiously.</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I relented. \u201cBut you can\u2019t make fun of me.\u201d</p><p>Both dimples appeared on his cheeks and my heart fluttered quickly. \u201cI won\u2019t. Promise.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t believe that smile, but I gave in anyway. With a deep breath I rattled off, \u201cThey\u2019re more like rules. Rule number one: Don\u2019t lie. Two: Don\u2019t cheat. Three: Don\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. And four: Don\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d he asked in disbelief.</p><p>\u201cThey may not mean much to you, but they mean everything to me.\u201d I sighed, slightly embarrassed that I\u2019d shared my list with him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean any offense, Kitten. It\u2019s just...well, those seem like pretty normal expectations to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think so,\u201d I agreed, taking a bite of my monstrosity they called a cheeseburger.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut most guys can\u2019t seem to do them. They lie. They cheat. And most people in general can\u2019t keep their promises, or stop themselves from saying things they don\u2019t really mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>My forehead creased. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you follow your own rules?\u201d he asked, his tone serious.</p><p>\u201cI try to live my life following those rules. Otherwise you hurt people.\u201d</p><p>He took a quick, short breath. \u201cSo did people lie to you a lot or something? Some guy break your heart in high school?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s more like my dad can\u2019t seem to follow through on anything he says. He always tells me a lot of things, but he never actually does them.\u201d I hesitated.</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d Jack leaned forward, intrigue written all over his face.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, like everything. He promised he\u2019d be at my graduation, and then he didn\u2019t show. He says he won\u2019t be late to things, but he always is. Or how he\u2019ll buy me something, but then he doesn\u2019t. He makes promises he can\u2019t keep. All. The. Time. But it\u2019s not just to me, you know? He tells other people things and they believe him. And when he doesn\u2019t come through, I\u2019m usually the one left picking up the pieces since he\u2019s nowhere to be found.\u201d</p><p>I paused, suddenly insecure with my admission. \u201cIs that stupid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your dad sounds like an ass.\u201d He frowned, his face twisted with disgust.</p><p>I looked into his eyes and then down at his mouth before continuing. \u201cHave you ever noticed how pretty and beautiful words can be? How easy it is to say the things you think someone wants to hear. How you can affect a person\u2019s entire day with just a few measly sentences?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My slight smile dropped. \u201cBut when you don\u2019t follow them up with any action, they\u2019re completely pointless. They\u2019re just sounds and syllables. But they mean absolutely nothing.\u201d My gaze glossed over as my mind wandered.</p><p>He reached across the table for my hands, but pulled away quickly before he touched them. I watched as he grabbed two loose quarters from the pile and scooted them over to my side of the table. \u201cAlmost forgot.\u201d He smiled before placing his hands on top of mine.</p><p>I tried not to smile, but failed. Heat swirled throughout my hands at his touch and I tried to tame the butterflies that flapped wildly in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cI knew you had daddy issues.\u201d</p> <p>My smile faded as I ripped my hands out from under his. \u201cYou\u2019re such an asshole,\u201d I said defensively, feeling stupid for sharing anything of importance with him.</p><p>\u201cIf you stop calling me names, I\u2019ll tell you something personal about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know.\u201d I folded my arms across my chest.</p><p>He swallowed his food when loud shouts drew his attention. He looked up from our table, grumbling under his breath.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d I asked him, looking around for the source of the shouting. My eyes fell on two muscular-looking guys in baseball hats. \u201cFriends of yours?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>I took another bite of my burger when a loud thwap diverted my attention. I jumped in my seat and noticed one of the guys had pounded his fist on top of our table, causing the quarters to spill out around me. I reached for my drink, steadying it before it toppled over. I looked at Jack, whose face was slowly turning a shade of purple. His hand flexed, his knuckles whitening with each compression.</p><p>\u201cGet out of my face, Jared,\u201d he threatened, his jaw tight.</p><p>\u201cNot so tough sober, eh Jack?\u201d</p><p>Jack looked at me with pleading eyes, as if apologizing for what was to come. Then he glared up at the unwelcome visitors crowding our table. \u201cYou\u2019re just begging to get your ass kicked twice in one week, aren\u2019t ya?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Jared challenged.</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m on a date?\u201d He gestured toward me.</p><p>Jared glanced in my direction. \u201cLike she matters. Just one of many, isn\u2019t that what you always say?\u201d</p><p>Jack jumped out from behind the table and puffed out his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about her like that. Don\u2019t even fucking look at her. You hear me?\u201d He took a step toward Jared, his fist clenched tightly at his side.</p><p>Jared noticed Jack\u2019s intent and offered slyly, \u201cAnother time then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI highly doubt that.\u201d Jack seethed, the veins in his neck throbbing.</p><p>Jared leaned in close to my face before walking away. \u201cAt least you\u2019re pretty. Come find me after he tosses you into the garbage with all the others. I promise to sleep with you more than once.\u201d</p><p>My mouth opened to respond when Jared\u2019s body was suddenly ripped out of view. Jack pummeled him against the floor with a loud thud. Jared tried to kick, but Jack was too quick, moving out of the way before he could make contact. Jared scrambled to get up, but Jack threw his fist into Jared\u2019s jaw as the sound of bones crunching filled the air.</p><p>\u201cI told you,\u201d Jack said as he punched him again, \u201c...not to talk to her.\u201d Another hit and I gasped when Jared\u2019s bright red blood splattered across the clean, white-tiled floor.</p> <p>I shook my head, struggling to make sense of this crazy, unexpected scene. \u201cJack! Jack, stop!\u201d I scooted out of the booth and pulled at the shirt stretched across his back, begging for his assault to end. Jack delivered another blow to the ribs and I threw my body onto his back, leaning as close to his ear as I could get without getting hit. \u201cJack, stop.\u201d</p><p>His head snapped up. He glanced down at Jared, then lifted his head to look around at the gawking crowd and then back to me, his eyes sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>It was the first time that name didn\u2019t piss me off. I helped him to his feet, my body shaking with shock.</p><p>Our waitress, Sarah, hurried over, shaking her head. \u201cYou have to go, Jack. Just get your stuff and go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSarah, tell Carl I\u2019m sorry about the mess.\u201d Jack wiped his face, still red from anger, and now probably embarrassment as well. He scooped the quarters into their paper bag and tossed two twenties on the table before grabbing my hand and pulling me out the door.</p><p>When we reached the car, he opened the passenger door, lifted me in, and then walked over to the driver\u2019s side, his head shaking the entire time. I watched his chest slowly rise and fall with each breath he took. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cassie. I shouldn\u2019t have let him get to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was that even about?\u201d I asked, eyeing his bloody knuckles.</p><p>Jack settled into the driver\u2019s seat and looked out his window, avoiding my gaze. \u201cI slept with his girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>My heart throbbed as his admission caused an ache of disappointment to spread throughout my chest. \u201cRight when I think you might be halfway decent, you say something that fucks it all up.\u201d</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel tightly and turned to me, his dark hair flopping forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit me, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I promise. She said she was single.\u201d</p><p>I sank into my seat as the breath I unwittingly held escaped from between my lips. \u201cWell, she sucks. That girl.\u201d</p><p>He forced half a grin. \u201cYeah, she does.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine and I felt the rumble violently vibrating my seat. I quickly buckled myself in and said a silent prayer that we wouldn\u2019t die on the drive home.</p><p>We spent the drive back to my apartment in silence, the radio providing background noise as we each buried ourselves in our own private thoughts. I watched as the lights of the town streamed past in a neon blur, my mind replaying the events of the evening. Jack pulled his deathmobile in one of the spots marked Visitor in front of my building, and turned the ignition off, but didn\u2019t make any effort to move. I reached for my door handle. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cmy dad\u2019s an ass too.\u201d His voice sliced through the warm evening air.</p><p>I allowed my hand to slide down the side of the door, releasing the grip I held. I turned my body to face him before I leaned back into the seat. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>He avoided my eyes, reluctant to continue. I wondered if he regretted starting to open up to me, but I wasn\u2019t about to let him off the hook.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe took off when Dean was three. He just left one morning for work and never came back. My mom was frantic looking for him. Called every hospital, police station, hotel, but he was nowhere. I remember her tearing through the phone book with such fear and desperation in her eyes. She flipped the pages and tried to dial the numbers, but her fingers were shaking so badly I had to do it for her.\u201d He sighed sadly.</p><p>I wanted to reach out for him, but didn\u2019t. Thinking that somehow my touch would stop his train of thought and I wouldn\u2019t get to experience this side of him again, I kept my hands tucked between my legs and pressed my lips firmly together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really remember my dad. But when my mom left...\u201d</p><p>I could no longer stay silent. \u201cYour mom left you guys too?\u201d My mouth fell open in shock as my heart literally ached for him.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I distinctly remember her saying that we were so bad, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She said she couldn\u2019t raise two bad boys on her own, so she had to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit. She said that? How old were you?\u201d Each breath I took felt like it was being ripped from my lungs.</p><p>\u201cI was eight. Dean was five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t even imagine.\u201d I reached out my hand and settled it on his thigh.</p><p>He eyed it for a split second. \u201cFifty cents, Kitten.\u201d I jerked my hand away, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cI was just joking, Cass. Listen, don\u2019t say anything to anyone, okay? Not many people know that story and I\u2019d like to keep it that way if possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. It\u2019s not my story to tell.\u201d I smiled, hoping he believed me.</p><p>The moment I thought he was done revealing his past, he continued. \u201cMy mom walked out the door just as my grandparents were pulling into our driveway. I remember hearing yelling, car doors slamming, and tires screeching. And I\u2019ll never forget the sound of Dean crying and screaming out for her.\u201d</p><p>His eyes looked like he was a million miles away as I watched him relive his childhood nightmare. \u201cThe next thing I remember was my grandmother\u2019s smiling face walking through our front door. She told us to run upstairs and pack our things so we could sleep over at her house. I think it was really hard on them, suddenly having two little boys around, but my grandparents never complained. Not once.\u201d He scratched the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cHave you seen your mom since?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d His response was sharp.</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t heard from her or anything?\u201d I asked, wondering what kind of mother could just up and leave her two boys and never come back.</p><p>\u201cNot a word.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head in disbelief. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine. So, how rotten of a kid were you,\u201d I asked with a smile, not really meaning the question.</p><p>He reclined the driver\u2019s side seat and focused his gaze on the night sky. \u201cPretty rotten. Dean wasn\u2019t, though. I mean, he was, but he was just copying me. He stopped being bad the minute she left. I think he thought if he was the perfect son, it would bring her back. She\u2019d come home if he was extra good all the time,\u201d he said as he tilted his head toward me, \u201c...or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was so angry. I thought it was all my fault that she left. So I figured if she was never coming back, what was the point in being good? I got into a lot of trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what kind of trouble?\u201d</p><p>He took a deep breath. \u201cI got in a lot of fights.\u201d He looked into my eyes and shrugged his shoulders. \u201cGuess that hasn\u2019t changed much.\u201d His stomach moved in and out as he laughed bitterly and I found my eyes drawn there.</p><p>\u201cHe deserved it,\u201d I whispered, reclining my seat as well.</p><p>\u201cHe did, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI got in a lot of fights. And I got in a lot of trouble with girls. I basically took on the philosophy in high school that if I could either hook up with a girl at every party, or beat someone up, then they wouldn\u2019t talk about the fact that I had no parents. Fucking and fighting were the ultimate distraction.\u201d</p><p>I frowned, my stomach churning slightly at his bold revelation.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He turned his head toward me, his eyes concerned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that you still sort of act like that, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Old habits are hard to break. Plus, I\u2019m good at being bad and screwing things up. Just ask Dean.\u201d</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what to say. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure how I felt. I\u2019d never met anyone who had lost both of their parents except to death. I couldn\u2019t imagine living with that knowledge, or feeling somewhat responsible for it happening. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did you start playing baseball?\u201d</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cMy grandparents signed us up for every sport imaginable when we moved in. They thought it would help.\u201d A slight chuckle escaped from his lips, his mouth curving upward. \u201cI don\u2019t remember, but my grandma said I would cry whenever the season ended.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, imagining the scene in my mind. \u201cThat\u2019s cute. You loved it even then.\u201d</p><p>He released a breath. \u201cBeing on that pitcher\u2019s mound, it\u2019s the one thing I\u2019m really good at. The one thing I haven\u2019t fucked up. And when I\u2019m on the field, everything else fades away. You know?\u201d He turned to look at me, his eyes craving understanding.</p> <p>I smiled and he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s like my mind is clear when I\u2019m out there. It\u2019s not about my mom or my dad or the stupid shit I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s about me, the ball, and the batter. It\u2019s the one place in the world where I feel like I\u2019m in control. Like I have a say in what happens around me.\u201d</p><p>I stopped my head from nodding in agreement once I realized that I was doing it. \u201cI feel that way when I\u2019m taking pictures. Anything that I\u2019m not seeing through my lens fades away in the background. And I get to frame my picture any way I choose. I get to dictate how it looks. What\u2019s in it. What isn\u2019t. Behind that lens I have complete control in how things are seen.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his dimples indenting his cheeks. \u201cYou get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like this side of you,\u201d I said, genuinely meaning it.</p><p>He crossed his arms across his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d</p> <p>I jerked back at his suddenly defensive tone. \u201cWay to ruin a perfectly good moment with your craptitude.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCraptitude?\u201d he mocked.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Your crappy attitude.\u201d I pulled my seat upright and reached for the door handle again.</p><p>\u201c Fuck Shit . I\u2019m sorry, Kitten. Don\u2019t hate me. I just really suck at this.\u201d His hand gripped my shoulder, pulling me back toward him.</p><p>\u201cSuck at what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis.\u201d His finger wagged between my face and his.</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Having a serious conversation? I know, it\u2019s really hard.\u201d It was all I could do not to roll my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really have serious conversations with girls,\u201d he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s seriously pathetic, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I haven\u2019t conveyed to you by now that I have a hard time trusting people\u2014\u201d he started to explain before I cut him off.</p><p>\u201cI know you do. And you have every right. But you have to start somewhere.\u201d He breathed loudly and I finished, \u201cSooner or later you have to let people in.\u201d</p><p>And by \u201cpeople,\u201d I really meant me.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>He leaned toward me and I could feel the warmth of his breath against my face. \u201cI know,\u201d he murmured, closing the small space between us even further.</p> <p>He cupped my cheek in the palm of his hand and looked into my eyes. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d My heart hammered inside my chest as thoughts of stopping him raced through my mind.</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything,\u201d I stammered, my defenses fading.</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything.\u201d He sounded so sure of himself as his soft lips silenced my weak protest.</p><p>My eyes closed and I lost myself in the warmth of his kiss. His cinnamon-flavored tongue gently parted my lips as I allowed him to explore my mouth. He was gentle, the flicker of his tongue soft and slow, causing my heart to expand. His fingers tangled tenderly in the back of my hair, tugging lightly. I lifted my hand to the side of his face, my thumb tracing the lines of his cheek down to his chin before gripping the back of his neck and pulling him closer.</p><p>My mouth was frantic, all sense of composure lost somewhere in the taste of him. He pulled away, our mouths parting with one final, closed-mouth peck.</p><p>\u201cIt changes everything,\u201d he repeated, still cupping my face in his hand.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>SIX</p><p>JACK</p><p>Prove it were the two words she said to me before hopping out of my car and running through her apartment door that night. She didn\u2019t trust people either. Or more to the point, she didn\u2019t trust me. Cassie Andrews didn\u2019t need rescuing, but I still wanted to save her.</p><p>She wanted me to prove that she was different from all the other girls I\u2019d been with. Apparently she didn\u2019t realize she already was. I asked her out on a date and I never ask girls out. Hooking up at a party or a club was one thing. That\u2019s easy. I can do anything with a beer in my hand, or an audience watching.</p><p>But asking Cassie out in the daylight, dead sober, with no one around...that was something I\u2019d never done before. She made me nervous as hell. I knew she wasn\u2019t like other girls the moment I saw the disgusted look on her face after I called her \u201cKitten.\u201d Most girls would have creamed their pants if I called them that. But not Cassie. She looked like she wanted to punch me in the jaw.</p><p>And I\u2019ve wanted to kiss her ever since.</p><p>The first order of business in my prove-to-Cassie-I\u2019m-serious agenda consisted of ditching my usual table filled with random fan-girls to sit with her in the student union. I figured that giving her priority attention in public showed my intent. The whispers and comments were brutal that first month with my teammates bagging on me every chance they got. Not to mention the relentless advances from what appeared to be every female on campus under the age of thirty.</p><p>I never realized how exhausting it was to turn women away. It was one thing to hook up with them and then call it a day, but to be off the market completely was something I\u2019d never dealt with before. To put it simply, girls don\u2019t like being rejected, especially if it\u2019s because of another girl.</p><p>But no one knew what it was like to be me. I\u2019d finally met a girl who didn\u2019t try to impress me. She didn\u2019t care about what I did as an athlete; she cared about what I did as a person. I was jumping into this thing with both feet. Holding on to Cassie with both arms.</p><p>Number two on my list consisted of spending as much time with her outside of school as possible. I made myself a regular at the apartment she shared with Melissa, where Cassie and I had become masters at making out.</p><p>I never knew you could spend hours just kissing a girl. I never knew because I\u2019d never done it before. In the last month, I\u2019d learned just how erotic kissing could be. Many nights I\u2019d left her place unsatisfied sexually, but completely content emotionally.</p><p>I sound like a fucking chick. I want to go drink a beer and punch something.</p><p>That\u2019s better.</p><p>With enough food on my tray to feed an army, I passed a group of panting girls in the student union on my way toward Cassie. A sorority chick named Andrea stopped me with a hand on my arm. I moved away from her touch, scowling at her hand. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked sharply, uninterested in whatever was about to spill from her lips.</p><p>\u201cOur sorority formal is coming up, Jack.\u201d She paused, her eyelashes batting at a ridiculous pace. \u201cAnd I thought you could come with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The huge smile fell from her face.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Is it because of her?\u201d She sneered in Cassie\u2019s direction.</p><p>\u201cNone of your business, Andrea. And if you ever refer to my girlfriend like that again, I\u2019ll find someone to teach you a little respect.\u201d</p><p>She huffed at me, all offended, and I walked away, noticing Melissa laughing in my direction.</p><p>\u201cYou girls are a species all your own.\u201d I shook my head in disbelief as I nudged my tray against Cassie\u2019s.</p><p>She glanced around at the girls whispering and watching us. \u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a month, ladies. Time to get over it already.\u201d Melissa waved her hand into the air, her voice raised.</p><p>\u201cSorry to put you in the spotlight, Kitten.\u201d I knew she hated it when I called her that, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I liked it. I tossed my arm around her shoulder and pulled her into me, my thumb caressing her soft skin. Her hair tickled my neck as it fell around my back and I wished I could hold on to her forever. I kissed the top of her head before letting her go, her green eyes forming half moons as she smiled.</p><p>\u201cI guess it comes with the territory.\u201d She looked at me, her cheeks tinged with pink.</p><p>\u201cThe territory of being Jack freaking Carter\u2019s girlfriend,\u201d Melissa added with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cGlad you\u2019re on board with this, Melis.\u201d I smiled, encouraged by her attitude.</p><p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re still an asshole but you\u2019ve grown on me. And if you hurt Cassie, I\u2019ll break your pitching arm. Capisce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapisce,\u201d I responded, purely to humor Cassie\u2019s fun-sized best friend.</p><p>I leaned into my girl, the smell of her shampoo engulfing my senses. \u201cYou know I\u2019d never hurt you on purpose.\u201d</p><p>Cassie immediately turned to face me, her eyebrows pinched together. \u201cThat\u2019s not really reassuring. You know that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just being realistic. Don\u2019t want to make you promises I can\u2019t keep,\u201d I added, hinting at rule number three of her boy test.</p><p>\u201cSo you can\u2019t promise that you won\u2019t hurt me?\u201d Her tone was annoyed and I instantly wished I could take back my words.</p><p>\u201cCass, I don\u2019t ever want to hurt you, but I can\u2019t promise you that I\u2019ll never screw up or make you mad.\u201d I paused, trying to make the thoughts in my head come out right.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good at pissing people off. Isn\u2019t that right, big brother?\u201d I looked up to see Dean smirking at me, and took a half-hearted swipe at him as he sat down next to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the rumor.\u201d I nodded with a smile.</p><p>\u201cPlus, if he pushes you away, then you won\u2019t be the one who left him. He\u2019ll be the one who made you leave,\u201d Dean added defiantly.</p><p>I glared at my little brother for his openness in such a public space. I glanced around, making sure no one was too close to overhear.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan on going anywhere.\u201d Cassie put her hand on top of mine and squeezed. \u201cSo don\u2019t try to make me.\u201d</p><p>Relief coursed through my body with her reassurance. I had spent so much of my life convinced that no girl would ever want to be with the real me, that I\u2019d never given anyone a chance to prove me wrong. If my own mom didn\u2019t love me enough to stay, how would anyone else?</p><p>\u201cJesus, I\u2019ve never met two people more scared to let someone love them than the two of you,\u201d Melissa remarked with a frown.</p><p>I opened my mouth to protest when she continued, her ponytail bobbing from side to side as she moved her head. \u201cAnd don\u2019t even try to deny it. You\u2019re both all messed up from your stupid parents. Cassie here,\u201d she lifted her hand in Cassie\u2019s direction, \u201cwith her dad\u2019s constant lies and inability to follow through on even the simplest, most mundane thing, has been disappointed and let down most of her life.\u201d</p><p>Her hand pointed in my direction. \u201cAnd you, with your mom up and leaving, telling you it was your fault because you were a bad kid. You\u2019re convinced that no one will ever stick around. That eventually, they\u2019ll leave you too. And somewhere in your twisted, screwed-up psyche, you probably think you deserve it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Melissa had finally dragged my sorry story out of me, late one night when the three of us were hanging out at their apartment. Cassie had kept her promise and hadn\u2019t told her best friend, so it was up to me to fill Melissa in. Damn, it seemed like such a good idea at the time.</p><p>Melissa took a quick breath and then delivered her final assessment. \u201cYou\u2019re both so screwed up alone that together you\u2019re like the perfect mess.\u201d</p><p>The table fell briefly silent as her rant sank in. I thought about protesting, but wasn\u2019t sure she was all that wrong.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an attractive analogy. Thanks for saying I\u2019m screwed up.\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice was sharp, her feelings clearly hurt.</p> <p>I shot Melissa a murderous glare before reaching for Cassie\u2019s chin and turning her face to mine. \u201cI\u2019ll be the perfect mess with you anytime.\u201d</p><p>Cassie quickly swiped under her eye and leaned her head against my shoulder. She released a deep sigh. \u201cMelissa just doesn\u2019t know anything about having messed-up parents. Hers are perfect. She can\u2019t relate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey! It\u2019s not my fault I won the parent lottery.\u201d Melissa eyed Cassie. \u201cPlus, we both know I\u2019m not strong enough to deal with the shit you\u2019ve dealt with. I would\u2019ve had a nervous breakdown by now. I could never handle everything your dad\u2019s put you through.\u201d</p><p>Cassie\u2019s body shook lightly against mine as she released a slight laugh, causing the tension in my chest and back to release. I realized in that moment that her feelings affected my own. I\u2019d never let anyone hurt her as long as I was around. And if they did, I\u2019d sure as hell make them pay for it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because I\u2019m strong or because I\u2019ve gotten really good at turning off my emotions,\u201d Cassie commented, her voice soft.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely both.\u201d Melissa turned to me. \u201cAnd Jack, I\u2019ve never seen anyone completely shut off the way this one can.\u201d Her head tilted toward Cass. \u201cIf you push her too far, she\u2019ll flick off like a light switch. It\u2019s scary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? That\u2019s impressive,\u201d I teased as my fingers caressed her side.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t feel that way if she does it to you. Trust me.\u201d Melissa\u2019s face was the scary kind of serious.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope I never have to see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I didn\u2019t compartmentalize, I\u2019d never be able to function! It\u2019s the only way I can survive without being a total basket case.\u201d Cassie\u2019s face was serious as she defended herself.</p><p>\u201cI get it, Kitten. Still impressive.\u201d I smiled as she looked up at me.</p> <p>\u201cSo when do you leave for Texas?\u201d Dean\u2019s question changed the subject and broke the tension. Thank God for little brothers, especially those who can talk around a mouthful of cheeseburger.</p><p>\u201cWe fly out Thursday morning. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wondering.\u201d</p><p>Cassie sat upright and turned to face me. \u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re there? Like how does it work? Do you practice? Do parents go?\u201d</p><p>Cassie always had a million questions about everything, but it turned me on. She was so damn inquisitive and smart. \u201cWell, we typically fly in the day before our games start. We check in at the hotel. We\u2019ll have practice and work out and have dinner as a team. Some parents go, but not many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes everyone get their own room?\u201d she asked, her voice half impressed, half shocked.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I let out a laugh. \u201cWe share rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have like bed checks and stuff?\u201d</p> <p>I nodded and noticed Melissa\u2019s elbows planted firmly on the table, her ears taking in every word. \u201cWe do. Usually Coach comes by and makes sure everyone\u2019s in their rooms by ten.\u201d</p><p>Her face softened. \u201cAny other rules?\u201d</p><p>I felt my mouth form a half smile. \u201cNo girls and no drinking,\u201d I said with a chuckle.</p><p>She shoved against my shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sure those rules never get broken, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. We\u2019re all complete angels when we\u2019re on the road.\u201d My gaze darted between Melissa and Cassie, then fell on Dean, silently daring him to contradict me.</p><p>Dean let out a hearty laugh. \u201cAngels, my ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, wait wait wait!\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice broke through the chorus of laughter. \u201cDo you guys sneak girls in your rooms? Like random strangers?\u201d</p><p>I felt her eyes pierce mine. She wanted the truth and I didn\u2019t want to lie to her. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes at my one-word response.</p><p>\u201cKitten. The eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pig.\u201d She shook her head with disgust.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t news! But I\u2019m a changed man, Kitten. I swear it.\u201d I took her chin in my fingers and pleaded, wanting her to believe me.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d She stared back at me, her smirk evidence of her disbelief.</p><p>\u201cCare to make a wager?\u201d I offered, dying to loosen up the tense atmosphere.</p><p>Her face crinkled at my suggestion. \u201cPlease, tell me you don\u2019t need a bet to stay faithful. I swear to God, Jack.\u201d</p><p>I felt her body tighten as she angled away from me. With one humorous comment, I\u2019d changed her body language completely. It was as though I could feel her replacing the bricks around her heart that I\u2019d already knocked down. One by one, she cemented them back into place where she felt they belonged.</p><p>This away series was going to be the first real test in our relationship. She wasn\u2019t sure she could trust me. I didn\u2019t blame her though, but I was damn sure going to prove her wrong.</p><p>SEVEN</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>I paced nervously around the kitchen while I waited for Jack to arrive.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you pacing? What the hell\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Melissa looked up from her textbook and eyed me.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorta freaking out,\u201d I admitted, taking a swig from my water glass.</p><p>\u201cAbout what? Seriously, Cass, I haven\u2019t seen the guy even touch another girl since your crazy date that night.\u201d Melissa tried to catch my gaze, her eyebrows raised.</p><p>I shook my head and continued wearing down the kitchen floor. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d She sat up straighter, laying her pencil in between the pages of her book and closing it shut.</p><p>I stopped walking, took another drink, and swallowed forcefully. \u201cI just don\u2019t get why Dean can\u2019t take him to the bus tomorrow. Why does he want me to do it? And why is he leaving me his death machine?\u201d</p><p>Melissa sighed heavily. \u201cJesus, Cassie. Can\u2019t the guy do something nice for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is that nice?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast time I checked, genius, your car is sitting pretty back at home.\u201d She smirked, her head swiveling back and forth in disbelief at my stupidity.</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s leaving you his. That\u2019s nice of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d She had a point, but my defenses were still up. \u201cBut why is he staying over?\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s mouth fell open as she leaned her head back. \u201cI\u2019m such an idiot,\u201d she admitted before smacking her palm against her forehead. \u201cThis is your first sleepover with Jack. You\u2019re scared to spend the night with him. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d</p><p>My stomach flipped and rolled with her words. I stared at the black-and-white-tiled kitchen counter, my eyes losing focus until the pattern became an unrecognizable swirl of hazy dark and light hues.</p><p>\u201cEarth to Cassie, hello?\u201d Melissa snapped her fingers in my direction and my eyes jerked up to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d My stupid voice shook slightly. \u201cI\u2019m just...not ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause once you give your body to a guy, there\u2019s no taking it back. And once you\u2019ve done that it opens up feelings, emotions, and vulnerabilities you never knew you were capable of having. I\u2019m not ready to give him my heart. What if he breaks it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t?\u201d Melissa shot back.</p><p>The quick knock on the door startled us both and Melissa gathered her composure before I did. \u201cCome in,\u201d she yelled behind her.</p><p>The door swung open and Jack walked in, carrying his baseball bag in one hand and an overnight bag in the other. I watched as he dropped the baseball bag next to the door and then disappeared with his overnight bag into my bedroom. I quickly widened my eyes at Melissa before he waltzed back into the room. She stifled a laugh.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kitten.\u201d He nuzzled his lips against my neck and I felt my knees begin to shake.</p><p>I forced a nervous smile. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStarved,\u201d he answered, before his lips met mine.</p><p>All my thoughts scrambled inside my head as I released them and lost myself in his mouth. Warm cinnamon engulfed my senses as his breath and touch consumed me. No matter how hard I tried to fight it, Jack Carter always turned me to mush.</p><p>So much for that wall of yours, Cass. Kiss it good-bye.</p><p>When he pulled away, I braced my hand against the countertop to steady my shaking body. Once I was certain my legs would carry me without falling, I headed toward the refrigerator and opened the door, tearing through every tray and cabinet.</p><p>\u201cYour options are grilled cheese, mac and cheese, or a quesadilla,\u201d I announced, somewhat embarrassed by our lack of food choices.</p><p>\u201cI can only pick one?\u201d Jack teased. \u201cWhat if I want them all?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can make them.\u201d I smirked while holding the door open with one arm. \u201cJack, tell me what you want!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sort of do want them all. Is that bad? I\u2019ll help.\u201d His face crinkled as he braced for my reaction.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cFine. You make the mac and cheese and I\u2019ll make the rest. Deal?\u201d</p><p>I watched as the tension released from his tanned cheeks and those irresistible dimples appeared. \u201cDeal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you two. Cooking in the kitchen like an old married couple,\u201d Melissa remarked from a safe distance.</p><p>I turned toward her wishing I could suddenly shoot darts from my eyes. \u201cOld married couple, my ass. We haven\u2019t even made it through one road trip.\u201d</p><p>Jack put down the pot he held and reached for me. He wrapped his arms around my waist and held on to me tightly. \u201cKitten, are you worried about this road trip? I\u2019m not going to fuck screw up. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I avoided his eyes, looking straight past him toward the white wall in the distance. His fingers were suddenly caressing my cheek, before they forced my chin upward. \u201cLook at me, Cass,\u201d he pleaded softly.</p><p>I closed my eyes tight before opening them and focusing on his. It was so hard to put my feelings into words, all my insecurities and fears coiled inside me, eating away at the trust we\u2019d built.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want any other girl.\u201d He brought my hand to his lips and kissed it gently. \u201cYou hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hear you,\u201d was all I could force out in a whisper.</p><p>\u201cBut do you believe me?\u201d He cocked his head to one side and raised an eyebrow.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulder. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn straight we\u2019ll see.\u201d He jerked his head playfully. \u201cI\u2019ll prove it to you.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes and he pressed his warm mouth against mine, his tongue parting my lips. I jerked away. \u201cIf this is your way of proving it...\u201d</p><p>His mouth instantly found mine again, the heat between us hot enough to start a fire. The taut muscles of his abs pressed tightly against my stomach. I found myself suddenly aware of his fingers and their location against the small of my back, pulling me against him. His body grew harder with every moment that passed and my defenses lowered.</p><p>I maneuvered my hands underneath his shirt and ran my fingers along the curves of his back. His skin was smooth and soft, yet hard and muscular. I found myself unable to stop exploring as I caressed every inch I could reach of his warm skin. Feeling his body this way sent excited tingles shooting throughout my entire body. He pressed the hardness in his jeans against me and I struggled to catch my breath. And even though I wasn\u2019t ready to be one of Jack Carter\u2019s conquests, I found it difficult to resist him when I was this turned on.</p> <p>Melissa cleared her throat. \u201cJesus, you two. I feel like I should leave a tip after watching that.\u201d</p><p>I peeled my tingling body away from his and wiped at my bottom lip, lust blurring my vision.</p><p>\u201cWe take quarters.\u201d Jack smirked before leaning in for one last peck.</p><p>Melissa\u2019s face contorted with confusion at the inside joke I realized I\u2019d never shared with her. \u201cWhatever. I have to finish my homework. Hurry up and make me some food.\u201d</p><p>Jack impressed me by not only helping cook dinner, but cleaning up as well. He attempted to swat me with the dish towel a total of twelve times. It annoyed the hell out of me, but I\u2019ll admit I also found it endearing. I shook my head absentmindedly, lost in thought.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you shaking your head at?\u201d Jack asked, leaning his hip against the counter.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking about us.\u201d I flashed him a reassuring smile as I placed the towel back around the handle of the stove.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah? What about us?\u201d He took a step toward me.</p><p>I put my hand up to stop him. \u201cJust about how differently I feel about you today versus when we met at the party that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how do you feel about me today?\u201d He grabbed my hand and tucked it behind my back, pulling my body against his.</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t hate you today.\u201d I smiled, my heart rate picking up speed.</p> <p>His lips moved toward my face, brushing against my cheek without stopping. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hate me that night either,\u201d he whispered, his breath hot against my ear.</p><p>Excited chills replaced my will to playfully fight back. I pushed him and spun on my heels away from his hot body. \u201cI have to get ready for bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you,\u201d he called out to my retreating back.</p><p>I stopped and turned to face him, my eyes narrowing. \u201cNo, you will not.\u201d I pressed my hand firmly against his hard chest. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay right here until I\u2019m done. Go watch SportsCenter or Baseball Tonight or something.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows pulled together. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously.\u201d</p><p>His face softened, a half smile appearing. \u201cOkay, Kitten. You get ready for bed and I\u2019ll wait here.\u201d</p><p>I assumed he thought I was up to something, but the truth was I had no intention of doing anything sexual with him tonight. I wasn\u2019t ready and before this night was through, I was going to have to admit that to him. It was a conversation I dreaded having. I washed the makeup off my face, brushed my teeth, and slipped into my pink tank top and white boxer shorts before reentering the living room.</p> <p>\u201cYou can come in now,\u201d I announced from the doorway.</p><p>Jack\u2019s gaze slid over my body, then he pushed himself up from the couch and sauntered toward me, a smile plastered across his cheeks. \u201cNight, Melissa.\u201d He smacked my backside with his hand and steered me toward my bedroom.</p><p>\u201cStop it, brat!\u201d I shouted as I ran into the bedroom. I watched as he closed the door behind him and then reached into his overnight bag.</p><p>\u201cI brought you something.\u201d He pulled an empty mason jar from his bag and handed it to me.</p><p>I turned it in my hand, my eyes narrowed in confusion before reading the handwritten note stuck to the opposite side: Kitten\u2019s Quarters. I laughed out loud before placing the jar on top of my dresser.</p><p>\u201cThese too.\u201d He pulled out the bag of quarters from our first date, the sound of them clinking against one another taking me back in time.</p><p>\u201cCute.\u201d I smiled as he poured the contents of the bag into the jar.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me a lot of touches, Kitten.\u201d His lips pursed together, his tone teasing.</p><p>\u201cApparently. Who knew you could be so clever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone except you,\u201d he answered in that cocky tone so uniquely his.</p><p>\u201cOh, here we go,\u201d I said, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cKitten.\u201d Jack\u2019s brows pulled together, his voice stern. \u201cWhat did I tell you about the eyes?\u201d He took two steps toward me and our faces nearly touched. He brushed his hand along my cheek before placing it behind my neck and pulling my mouth to his. His tongue parted my lips and entered. His hand followed the lines of my curves until stopping on my hip with a firm grip. My eyes rolled behind closed eyelids as I lost myself in his touch.</p><p>And as quickly as it began, he pulled away, a satisfied smirk plastered all over his face. He bent down near his overnight bag and pulled out a leather pouch filled with his things. \u201cIs it okay if I jump in the shower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s a towel under the sink.\u201d I smiled, still trying to catch my faltering breath. My eyes refused to look away from him as he ripped his shirt off and dropped it to the floor near my sink. His tanned, well-defined arms caused my insides to stir. He unzipped his shorts before stepping out of them and promptly pressed his body against the counter as he reached for the toothpaste. I forced myself to look away before I started actually drooling at the sight of him in nothing but some well-fitting boxer briefs.</p><p>Staying strong tonight might be harder than I thought.</p><p>When the shower turned off, he opened the door, my green towel wrapped tightly around his waist. Beads of water dripped from his wet black hair as coils of hazy steam swirled around him.</p><p>\u201cKitten, can you throw me a pair of briefs?\u201d</p><p>I tossed off the covers and crept out of bed toward his duffle bag. I opened the flap of fabric and noticed dress shirts, ties, and slacks. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the dressy clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to dress up whenever we travel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause, Kitten, it\u2019s the rules. We have to look presentable. And we\u2019re a professional college baseball team. We have to make a good impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh, I guess that makes sense,\u201d I said, before rooting around for his briefs.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot better than a bunch of rowdy guys in t-shirts and baggy shorts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d I rooted around in his bag and grabbed the first pair I could find. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, throwing the undergarment toward his feet.</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe,\u201d he responded before allowing the towel to drop to the floor. I felt my jaw drop right along with it as my eyes refused to look away. My insides flushed with heat as he turned his head to face me. He smiled confidently before reaching for the briefs and slipping into them.</p><p>Holy shit. This night might kill me.</p><p>\u201cLike what you see?\u201d Jack teased, his eyebrow cocked as he slipped into bed next to me.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just date a mirror?\u201d I shot back, his cockiness forcing my defensive nature to re-emerge.</p><p>\u201cFor starters, I can\u2019t have sex with a mirror.\u201d His mouth formed into a slight smirk that made me want to smack him. Before I could respond his mouth was on mine, his tongue minty from my toothpaste.</p><p>My tough defenses faded as the warmth of his skin penetrated my thin clothing, his lower body grinding against mine. The feeling of his hardness working against me caused a slight moan to escape from my lips.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Cassie.\u201d Jack touched his lips against my neck. His tongue was warm on my skin as he licked his way up toward my ear, his breath raspy and hot. \u201cI want you,\u201d he whispered breathily before nibbling on my earlobe, the grinding between my legs continuing.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I spoke his name between breaths. \u201cJack, stop.\u201d He stopped moving and I felt his heart thumping rapidly against my chest. His thumb rested on the side of my face as I lost myself in the brown of his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I want to...just not tonight.\u201d</p><p>I braced myself for his reaction, unsure of what it would consist of. In the past, it royally pissed guys off if I\u2019d asked them to stop. They acted as if it was their God-given right to have sex with me, whether I was ready or not. Guys seemed to change into different people whenever their dicks were involved.</p><p>All warmth left me as Jack rolled onto his side, his body still facing mine. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kitten. I don\u2019t want to do it if you\u2019re not ready.\u201d He leaned toward me, his lips pressing against the tip of my nose.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I smiled, grateful he didn\u2019t seem angry.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll be ready soon, right?\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep a straight face as the words left his lips. \u201cI\u2019m kidding. No pressure.\u201d He smiled, his voice reassuring and calm.</p><p>I smiled in relief at his understanding as he reached for me. He hugged me tightly before placing my head against his chest, both arms wrapped around me. \u201cWould it help if you knew I was falling in love with you?\u201d</p><p>I tore myself from his grip, my eyes locking on his. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Jack Carter.\u201d</p><p>He stifled a laugh as he reached for me. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>I leaned down to kiss him, my emotions tangling up inside me. \u201cSay it,\u201d I begged as my tongue swept across his bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cSo much for no pressure,\u201d Jack teased, his eyebrows furrowing.</p><p>\u201cSay it,\u201d I begged again.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d he hesitated before looking me square in the eyes, his head nodding, \u201cI love you.\u201d He pulled at the back of my neck, his mouth devouring every part of mine.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I breathed his name as I melted into him, my legs wrapped around his waist. And just like that, those three little words had changed me. Desire overwhelmed me as I longed to be connected to him in every possible way. I wished for the space between us to disappear as I inched my body closer to his. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He pulled back slightly. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do this, that\u2019s not why I said it,\u201d he said, running his fingers down my back.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not, but I want to.\u201d I was actually surprised at myself, my pelvis grinding slowly against his as my desire grew.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d He searched my eyes as he asked one last time.</p><p>\u201cYou trying to talk me out of it?\u201d I teased and rolled away from him.</p><p>His eyes widened as he watched me scoot out of my boxer shorts, revealing the light blue thong hidden underneath. He tossed my shorts onto the floor before leaning over and tenderly kissing the top of my foot. He knelt down and worked his hands and mouth up my calf to my thigh, not an inch of skin left untouched. I practically vibrated with excitement and need, but allowed him to continue to explore. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He shifted upward and continued his way up my belly, lifting my tank top off in one swift motion before lightly kissing the space between my breasts. Lowering his body completely onto mine, he pressed his lips against my neck before heading back to my mouth, where I waited anxiously for him.</p><p>My hands dug into his back, his muscles hard and tense. I tugged at the waistband of his boxer briefs, trying in vain to lower them. He slipped them off and I felt his excitement grow as his body pressed against mine. \u201cDo you have anything?\u201d he asked before taking the final step.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d I asked incredulously.</p><p>\u201cI meant to bring one,\u201d he explained slowly, his breath hot against my ear. \u201cJust in case, you know?\u201d</p> <p>I shifted my weight, turning to look at him, \u201cMm-hmm. Just in case, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t blame a guy for hoping.\u201d His eyebrows arched. \u201cBut I forgot it at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously,\u201d he responded solemnly.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d I hesitated, \u201cI got on the pill when we started dating.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d I smiled sheepishly, embarrassed at the revelation as he pressed his wet lips against mine.</p><p>He pulled away slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve never...\u201d He started to say before stopping short.</p><p>\u201cNever what?\u201d My breaths quickened, his hesitance making my confidence waver.</p><p>His eyes met mine with longing and uncertainty. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it like this before,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>\u201cIn a bed?\u201d I teased, unsure of his meaning.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d He paused. \u201cI mean like this. Without anything else.\u201d</p><p>I was almost awestruck when I realized that like this meant without a condom. Jack\u2019s vulnerability shone through him in that exact moment like a lighthouse beacon in a raging storm. Somewhere along the way, we\u2019d crossed an imaginary line where feelings and emotions blurred into the unknown. A place neither of us dared go before.</p><p>\u201cReally? Not ever?\u201d I slid my hand down the back of his neck, his muscles straining against my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cNever. If I didn\u2019t have one, I didn\u2019t do it. There\u2019s never been anyone like you, Cassie. There never will be.\u201d His admission silenced us both as the weight of the moment sunk in.</p><p>\u201cDo you still want to?\u201d I trembled as the words left my lips.</p><p>He shifted and I felt my panties slide down my legs and leave my body in one fluid motion. That was all the answer I needed as my breathing increased with every kiss, every touch, every electric-filled moment. He stopped and cupped my face with both hands. \u201cYou know this changes things.\u201d His eyes searched mine for acceptance and understanding.</p><p>\u201cProve it,\u201d I said with a slight smile, remembering the words I spoke after our first kiss.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Cassie.\u201d His voice was so sincere that I blinked back the tears pooling in my eyes.</p> <p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I admitted, my protective walls crumbling to piles of dust around my jagged heart.</p><p>His lips were instantly back on mine, his tongue passionately exploring the inside of my mouth. With one easy thrust, I felt him inside me. I inhaled quickly, a pleasure-filled moan escaping my lips.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked, his movement slowing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, keep going.\u201d I closed my eyes, wanting more.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you feel incredible.\u201d He breathed heavily against my ear. \u201cHoly shit, I may never recover from this.\u201d</p><p>His hands pressed against my shoulders, his muscles flexing as he worked his body gently in and out of mine. I moved my hips in time with his, causing a throaty growl to escape from within him.</p><p>I opened my eyes and raked my fingers through his hair. I followed the lines of his body down his back where beads of sweat were pooling. The muscles in his back tensed as I reached my arms around him. My hands came to rest on his backside and I pulled him deeper into me with every thrust. Another throaty moan and he pressed his sweaty cheek against mine, his labored breathing whooshing in and out of my ear.</p><p>His breath was hot against my neck. \u201cI\u2019ve never loved anyone before, so go easy on me.\u201d</p><p>I turned my head to face him and pressed my mouth against his. \u201cJack,\u201d I whispered with a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d I continued pulling him to me as our bodies slid against each other. His thrusts caused a tension to build inside me, growing quickly as I felt myself striving to meet them desperately, grasping for something I\u2019d never experienced quite this strongly before.</p><p>My body tingled everywhere, from my scalp all the way down to my toes. A heated wave of sensation and emotion swept over me, engulfing me as my body seized in a contraction of pulses, all centered at my core.</p><p>His movements quickened with urgency in response to mine, and I lifted my hips to rise and fall in time with his. \u201cCassie...\u201d He stared into my eyes and I smiled bravely, yet for a moment, I felt completely exposed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d I said softly, and tightened my intimate grip around him. He bit his bottom lip and his eyes narrowed as I felt him explode and pulsate inside me. He quivered before relaxing and allowing his body to fall on top of mine.</p><p>\u201cI...can\u2019t...breathe,\u201d I complained playfully, pushing at his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d He laughed and rolled onto his side. \u201cThat...was amazing,\u201d he said between labored breaths.</p><p>He leaned into me, kissing my nose before propping up on one arm. \u201cI love you. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll fuck it up because I don\u2019t know what the hell I\u2019m doing. Just promise me that you\u2019ll be patient with me. Grade me on a learning curve or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should really go into sales, you know that?\u201d I teased, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, Kitten. Patience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you promise not to do anything that embarrasses me or makes me look stupid.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeal.\u201d He grinned and I leaned in to kiss his dimples, my limbs tangled up with his.</p><p>I\u2019ll admit I was scared. We\u2019d crossed the line and my heart would never be the same, no matter what happened from here on out. But if I wanted him to believe in us, I had to believe in him.</p><p>I drove Jack to the baseball stadium at five the next morning. When we arrived, I looked over at the rumbling bus and Jack\u2019s arriving teammates. I laughed when I noticed Jamie, a girlfriend of one of Jack\u2019s teammates, driving a monster-sized truck. She looked terrified behind the wheel and her expression brought me relief since I assumed my face probably looked the same. Glancing over at me, she shrugged her shoulders, and I waved in response.</p><p>Jack hopped out of his death machine, grabbed his bags, and sauntered over to the driver\u2019s side where I reluctantly sat.</p><p>\u201cTake care of my pride and joy.\u201d He grinned, his dimples making an appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou know it\u2019s just going to sit in the parking lot at my apartment, right?\u201d I shrugged.</p><p>He laughed before grabbing the back of my neck and pulling me toward him. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when I get there.\u201d His mouth covered mine as hoots and hollers filtered into the air. He pulled away, turned around, and flipped off his teammates.</p><p>\u201cAmateurs.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve ever been able to give you shit. They\u2019re excited.\u201d I pressed my lips together and smiled.</p><p>He leaned in, giving me one last kiss before walking away, his body disappearing behind his two large bags.</p><p>EIGHT</p><p>I sat in my Comm Law class as my professor droned on about the legal regulations of mass communication as it applied to freedom of speech and the press. Instead of taking notes, my mind drifted to thoughts of Jack and our night together. I absentmindedly placed my pen near my mouth and started chewing on the cap, my eyes blurring over.</p><p>Maryse, the gorgeous brunette next to me, nudged me with her elbow, breaking my trance. I turned to look at her and she lifted her chin toward the front of the class where our teacher was writing down topics for our next test.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I whispered with a sideways glance.</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re dating Jack Carter, right?\u201d I nodded. \u201cScrew this class, I\u2019d be thinking about him too.\u201d She giggled quietly.</p><p>I stifled a laugh and let out a long, drawn-out breath, knowing I\u2019d been caught. Our professor ended his lecture and Maryse stood up when I did, following behind me as the class dispersed. Once outside, she appeared next to me, her full hair bouncing with each step. \u201cSo how did you get the elusive Jack Carter to fall for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know. I guess you\u2019d have to ask him that.\u201d I smiled and dropped my sunglasses over my eyes.</p><p>\u201cEvery girl at this school has been chasing him for years,\u201d she said, acting as though this was new information to me.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s just it. I didn\u2019t chase him.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cAhhh, so he chased you? That probably would be a first for him.\u201d She applied a shiny gloss to her lips and puckered before pushing the tube back into her pocket. \u201cGuys love the chase. It\u2019s once you\u2019re caught that you have to be careful.\u201d</p><p>I glimpsed at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying a guy like Jack Carter isn\u2019t fit to be tied down. I can see him enjoying a challenge, which is what you were. But you\u2019re not anymore \u2019cause he has you. Where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond, unsure of what to say in my defense. What if she was right? What if it was all a game to him? At first he couldn\u2019t have me, then he got me. Then I wouldn\u2019t give it up, but I just did. There were no more challenges.</p><p>The pathway split and Maryse peeled away to head in the other direction. \u201cI have another class right now. Media Ethics. Snore.\u201d She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll see you Monday. Don\u2019t forget to study!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee you Monday,\u201d I answered with half a smile as my mind raced.</p><p>I wandered toward the student union, noticing the lack of activity that normally bustled around it. It was weird to admit that a sports team had that much of a presence on campus, but they really did. The lack of energy when they were gone was noticeable.</p><p>When I opened the door, the usual obnoxious sound of girlish chatter was absent. I glanced around the almost empty space and laughed to myself as I headed toward Melissa and Dean. If the team wasn\u2019t here, then the fan-girls weren\u2019t either. That revelation was almost as weird as it was disturbing.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t taken two steps before an overly friendly blonde reached out a tanned arm to stop me.</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s Cassie, right? I\u2019m Mollie, and I was just wondering if you and Jack were still dating?\u201d She made sure her voice was loud enough for her three eavesdropping friends to hear.</p><p>I pinched my eyebrows together, my body tensing. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s just that my friend from Texas sent me this photo last night from her cell. That is Jack, right?\u201d she asked, holding her phone out where I could see it and giggling while her friends anxiously waited for my reaction.</p><p>I leaned toward the phone and squinted at the grainy photo on its screen. It was definitely Jack holding open a hotel room door as a skinny, dark-haired girl walked through it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd this one too.\u201d She scrolled to another photo of Jack smiling while closing the door behind his new friend.</p><p>I fought off the heat rising in my body. \u201cIt looks like him.\u201d I sniffed in dismissal and forced myself to hold it together while I walked away with my head held high.</p><p>The sound of giggling echoed in my ears as I forced back the tears that burned in my eyes. I refused to let the mean girls see me crumble.</p><p>I strode toward Dean, my gaze burning holes through him. \u201cWhat was that?\u201d he asked when I got close enough to hear.</p> <p>I dropped into a seat at their table. \u201cThat was a picture of some chick walking into Jack\u2019s hotel room.\u201d My eyes began blurring from the tears that threatened to fall. \u201cAnd then another one of him closing the door behind her. Did I mention the smile plastered all over his face?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Dean shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYes, way.\u201d Unease quickly spread throughout my body, making itself at home. \u201c Fuck. I\u2019m such an idiot.\u201d</p><p>Dean put his hands on top of mine and squeezed. \u201cMaybe they\u2019re old?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d I yanked my hands away.</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of pictures of Jack and other girls out there, Cass. Maybe they\u2019re old?\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>I winced, suddenly feeling vulnerable in my surroundings as the mean girls watched me greedily like coyotes from several tables away.</p><p>\u201cJack wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d Melissa attempted to reassure my splintering ego.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go that far.\u201d I choked out the words, my tone cold.</p><p>Melissa frowned at me with annoyance. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she knows my brother.\u201d Dean glanced at Melissa before looking back at me. \u201cAnd she\u2019s waiting for him to screw up because he keeps telling her he\u2019s going to.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, for the record, I want it noted that I don\u2019t believe it. Not for one second,\u201d Melissa said with confidence.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either.\u201d Dean gave me a soft smile.</p><p>\u201cWell, it was definitely Jack in those pictures. And the shirt he was wearing was packed in his bag. I saw it the other night.\u201d I could no longer hold back the tears as they rolled slowly down my cheeks. Refusing to allow my tears to be fodder for the mean girls\u2019 gossip, I rose from the table and darted into the bathroom.</p><p>Once I was safely behind the locked stall door, I let the teardrops fall. My heart ached inside my battered chest. I felt stupid and embarrassed for letting Jack Carter ever get close to me.</p><p>A knock on the stall door caused my breath to catch. \u201cCass?\u201d Melissa asked in a soft voice. Without a word, I unlocked the latch and she pushed the door open. She took one look at my tear-stained face before grabbing me in her arms.</p><p>Hugging my best friend only made the tears fall harder. \u201cWhy would he do this? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie, I\u2019m not trying to be a bitch, but you\u2019re really jumping to conclusions here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d do the same thing if you were suddenly dating the one guy who\u2019d never dated anyone before.\u201d I winced, my head pounding in time with my heartbeat.</p> <p>\u201cI know it looks bad, but didn\u2019t he call you last night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what? He calls and texts me all the time. Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t hook up with some girl after we get off the phone. Doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t send me a text while some random chick is in his room.\u201d The logic made perfect sense to me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true, Cass, but I just think you should give him a chance to explain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExplain that I\u2019ve been a complete idiot? That I got played by the biggest player on campus? You even warned me about him.\u201d I buried my head in my hands, my chest literally aching with each breath I took.</p><p>\u201cBut I was wrong. I mean, I wasn\u2019t wrong that he was a jerk to all those other girls. But he\u2019s not that way with you. You know that, Cassie. There has to be some sort of explanation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you defending him?\u201d I glared at her through my sobs.</p><p>\u201cBecause I see the way he looks at you. And I hear the way he talks about you.\u201d Melissa\u2019s forehead creased in sympathy.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look like a fool in front of everyone! Those girls with those pictures...\u201d I paused to gasp a sob. \u201cI\u2019m mortified. Do you know how embarrassing that was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose girls got exactly what they wanted. They don\u2019t care about you. They\u2019re so freaking fucking bitter that you\u2019re the one with Jack that they\u2019ll do and say anything to tear you two apart. Can\u2019t you see that?\u201d Melissa tried to reason with me, her voice tinged with disappointment.</p><p>But nothing she said made me feel any better. I couldn\u2019t get the image of Jack\u2019s smiling face as he ushered the girl inside that hotel room out of my head. It was simply that easy to make me question everything and assume the worst.</p><p>\u201cI have to go.\u201d I pushed past Melissa and stormed out the bathroom door.</p><p>My mind didn\u2019t stop racing until I got to our apartment and crashed on top of my bed. I begged my brain to shut off and pleaded for my body to find some peace in sleep. The sound of my cell phone beeping startled me. I glanced at the screen, which read One new text message from Jack. My stomach dropped as I read his name. I pressed the Read button. Heading off to the field. Call you after the game. Miss you like crazy.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>My stomach twisted into pretzel-like knots as my heart yearned for the truth. I curled my body into a ball, clutching a pillow tightly as the pounding in my head resumed. Closing my eyes, I reached for an escape.</p><p>The sound of my ringtone blared loudly from the floor, waking me from a dream-free slumber some time later. I glanced at the clock on my nightstand, its red numbers alerting me that almost four hours had passed.</p><p>My phone continued blaring the music I\u2019d picked out for Jack\u2019s calls.</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna answer that?\u201d Melissa yelled from the other room.</p><p>I pressed the Ignore button, stopping the music from playing. After a minute, my cell phone beeped, alerting me to a new voice mail. I didn\u2019t listen, afraid that if I heard the sound of his voice, my resolve would weaken completely. Another beep followed and One new text message from Jack flashed across the screen.</p><p>I tried to resist reading it, but my heart wanted to know what he had to say. I clicked Read. Everything okay, Kitten? We won today. I pitch tomorrow. Call me as soon as you get this. Miss you.</p><p>I turned off the display, tossed my phone back onto the floor, and headed into the living room where Melissa sat watching TV.</p><p>\u201cDid you really ignore his call?\u201d she asked without looking at me.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t talk to him right now.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face me. \u201cYou need to talk to him right now.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t have that conversation with him over the phone. I need to be able to look him in the eyes when I ask him about those pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not your dad, Cassie.\u201d Melissa\u2019s face softened as she placed her hand on my knee.</p><p>I dropped my gaze. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>I knew my tone sounded defensive, because she asked again. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is your point, Melissa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is, Jack\u2019s not going to promise the school a popular band for grad night and then disappear, leaving you to clean up the mess and answer all the questions. He\u2019s not going to make a bunch of promises to people he can\u2019t keep.\u201d</p><p>I cringed at the memory I\u2019d tried so hard to block out over the past few years. But the truth was, the embarrassment my father caused me was etched deep inside and was never far from my mind. And whether I wanted to admit it or not, I was affected by his lies and inability to follow through on the smallest of promises.</p><p>I didn\u2019t say anything. I continued to glare at Melissa, angry at her for pointing out the flaws I felt I couldn\u2019t change.</p><p>\u201cCass, I just don\u2019t want you to punish Jack for the mistakes your dad made.\u201d Her voice was soft as she leaned in to touch her forehead to mine.</p><p>\u201cHow can you even say that? You know what I saw today. Those pictures have nothing to do with my dad.\u201d I jerked back, my jaw clenched.</p><p>\u201cNo, the pictures don\u2019t. But the fact that you refuse to speak to Jack unless it\u2019s in person, does. I know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she stated, her expression solemn.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you inform me then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to test him. Judge his body language. Watch his eyes, his mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re damn right I do. Please tell me what\u2019s so wrong with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, I guess.\u201d Melissa shrugged her shoulders in defeat. \u201cI just thought that maybe you wouldn\u2019t need to talk to Jack in person to decide if he was lying or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I do. Don\u2019t you see?\u201d I took a long breath. \u201cI don\u2019t trust myself when it comes to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019ll want to believe anything he tells me over the phone. I\u2019ll hear his voice and turn into a stupid girly ball of mush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is about protecting yourself, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Melissa rested her chin against her hand and sighed.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou think someday you\u2019ll be able to trust the way a normal person does?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean blindly?\u201d I laughed harshly before continuing. \u201cProbably not.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Jack\u2019s ringtone blasted from my bedroom again, grinding our conversation to a halt. \u201cPlease go answer that, Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I winced before walking into my room and pressing Ignore once more.</p><p>My phone beeped with another voice mail alert, followed quickly by the sound of an arriving text message. This was going to be a long weekend.</p><p>Kitten, I\u2019m getting worried. Please let me know you\u2019re okay before I lose my fucking mind over here. I love you.</p><p>Part of me thought, Good. Lose your mind. Be worried. You deserve it. The other part of me breathed in with relief that he actually cared. I shook my head, disgusted at my conflicted emotions, and turned my phone off. I couldn\u2019t deal with any more text messages or missed calls tonight. Not to mention the fact that I couldn\u2019t stop wondering if Miss Thin Brunette would be making another appearance inside Jack\u2019s hotel room later. The very thought made my stomach churn.</p><p>I heard Melissa\u2019s cell phone ring, followed by the sound of her voice. \u201cCassie, get out here!\u201d</p><p>I reluctantly walked back into the living room where Melissa held out her phone in my direction. \u201cWho is it?\u201d I whispered, afraid of the answer.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Dean. Get on the phone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said, my tone irritated.</p><p>\u201cCassie, Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on? Jack\u2019s calling me like a lunatic. He\u2019s flipping the fuck completely flipping out. Says you won\u2019t answer any of his phone calls or texts!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what.\u201d I pretended not to care.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta talk to him, Cass. You can\u2019t ignore him like this when he\u2019s on a road trip, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes I can!\u201d I screamed back into the phone. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who had a fucking girl up in his hotel room, not me!

Don\u2019t talk to me about what\u2019s fair!\u201d</p><p>The tears reluctantly escaped my eyes once more as Jack\u2019s betrayal settled into my damaged heart.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so goddammed stubborn! He\u2019s going fucking apeshit and you\u2019re just going to let him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t call him, okay? I can\u2019t talk to him right now.\u201d I pleaded with Dean for some sort of understanding. \u201cJust tell him I\u2019m busy with a project for school or something. He\u2019ll believe that.\u201d</p> <p>Dean breathed heavily into the phone. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll tell him. But, Cassie, he\u2019s not stupid. He\u2019ll figure out something\u2019s wrong and then I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just means that I\u2019ve never heard him sound as crazy as I did tonight. He was literally flipping the fuck out because he couldn\u2019t get a hold of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess he should have thought about that before he invited some whore up to his hotel room,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re completely unreasonable, you know that?\u201d Dean asked, his voice harsh.</p> <p>\u201cHow am I unreasonable?!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019d rather ignore this entire situation instead of put an end to it,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ignoring it! I simply refuse to discuss it over the phone. So what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Unreasonable and selfish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m selfish too?\u201d I shouted with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cSort of. You\u2019re only thinking about yourself and your feelings. You\u2019re not thinking about Jack at all. This isn\u2019t just a game to him. This is his future. This is his career. He can\u2019t fuck mess up. Don\u2019t you care about that at all ?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice was pained.</p> <p>\u201c None of that matters Not if he cheated on me,\u201d I responded, my tone cold.</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t even know what happened. You don\u2019t even know who that girl was. She could be an old friend of his...you have no clue because you won\u2019t ask!\u201d He sighed loudly.</p><p>\u201cNope. I won\u2019t. Not until he gets home. And don\u2019t you dare say a thing to him either, Dean! I don\u2019t want you tipping him off so he has an entire weekend to think up the perfect response.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying a word to him. But, Cassie, can you please at least send him a text message? Just give him something so he can focus on the game? Please do that for him.\u201d</p><p>The phone fell silent between us. Of course I cared about Jack and wanted him to pitch well. No matter how badly I hurt, I didn\u2019t want to distract him from the one thing that truly owned his heart. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll text him as soon as you let me get off the phone.\u201d</p><p>Dean huffed out a small laugh. \u201cTalk to you later then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait! Dean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not picking him up on Sunday.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight pause before Dean sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll come get his car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Bye.\u201d I pressed End and handed Melissa back her phone before walking into my bedroom and powering my cell back on.</p><p>I quickly typed out a text that read: Sorry, Jack, been busy with a photography project. I\u2019ll probably be pretty swamped until you get home. Good luck tomorrow. You\u2019ll be great! xo</p><p>Less than a minute passed before my phone beeped, signaling I had a response. It makes me crazy to be this far away from you and not know what\u2019s going on. I just completely lost my shit on Dean. What have you done to me? LOL Call me if you have a chance. If not, I understand. Good luck with your project. Can\u2019t stop thinking about the other night...</p><p>I tried so hard to be strong when it came to him, but even his text messages challenged me. I knew I\u2019d jumped to conclusions about the pictures, but I refused to look like a fool. And in my opinion, only a fool would carry on like nothing had happened. Simply put, I didn\u2019t want to be that kind of girl. The kind of girl that needed Jack in her life so badly, she\u2019d overlook potential relationship-ruining material.</p><p>But in trying so hard to be unlike all the other girls, I made myself irrational, declaring Jack guilty before viewing the facts of the case. I clung to my principles with both hands so tightly it was the only way I got through the next day and a half Jack-free.</p><p>That, and the fact that I\u2019d turned my phone off.</p><p>NINE</p><p>Panic set in when I realized that Jack would be arriving home soon. I hadn\u2019t communicated with him in any form since the text messages two days ago. I half wondered if I should leave the apartment. But where would I go? I couldn\u2019t hide from him forever. The sooner we had this conversation, the better it would be for everyone involved.</p><p>I paced back and forth in my bedroom, my thoughts all over the place. It was easier to be the tough girl when Jack was in another state and I could simply shut him off with the press of a button on my cell phone.</p><p>Nerves shot through my unsettled stomach as I curled up on my bed and waited. Finally, tires squealed outside and I peered out my window just in time to see Jack come to a screeching halt in one of the parking spots. He appeared to be shouting at poor Dean in the passenger seat before he bolted out of the car and sprinted out of sight.</p><p>Within seconds, his knuckles knocked wildly against the front door. \u201cCassie!\u201d He banged relentlessly as he yelled through the door. \u201cCassie! Please, Cassie, open up. It\u2019s not what you think.\u201d So much for Dean not saying anything.</p><p>My stomach rolled when the door finally creaked open and I heard him ask, \u201cMelissa, where is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten? I\u2019m coming in,\u201d he announced from behind my closed bedroom door. When he walked in, my heart skipped a beat at the sight of him. His hair was wild and wind-whipped from the quick drive over from the stadium and he was still in his dress clothes from the airport, although his tie was loosened and barely hanging on.</p><p>He ran to the side of my bed, dropped to his knees, and reached out for me. I pulled back before he could touch me, my eyes focused on his as he spoke. \u201cKitten, it\u2019s not what you think. That girl wasn\u2019t in my room for me.\u201d</p><p>I refused to move, unwilling to be deceived. \u201cDid you hear me? She wasn\u2019t there for me. I roomed with Brett and he met her our first night. He invited her up to our room, but she wasn\u2019t there for me. I just answered the door.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019d the picture come from then?\u201d I wondered, the question suddenly dawning on me.</p><p>\u201cShe came upstairs with a bunch of other girls, but I wouldn\u2019t let them in. One of them must have taken it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I asked, my voice filled with more hope than I\u2019d anticipated.</p><p>\u201cI swear it.\u201d He reached out again for my hands and I allowed his fingers to intertwine with mine. He brought my hand to his lips and he kissed it all over.</p><p>\u201cSo you weren\u2019t with her?\u201d I asked once more, even though I already believed him.</p><p>\u201cNo. I don\u2019t even like brunettes anymore. I\u2019m into this one particular shade of blonde.\u201d He gave me a tentative, lopsided smile, and ran his fingers through my hair. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you.\u201d</p><p>I practically jumped out of my bed and into his waiting arms. He pressed me tightly against his chest before he tipped my head back and covered my mouth with his. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he said between kisses. His tongue parted my lips as I melted into him, the self-imposed stress from the weekend falling from my shoulders.</p><p>He pulled away before I was ready and asked, \u201cSo, tell me exactly what happened.\u201d</p><p>I collapsed onto my bed, pulling him with me. \u201cSome random chick came up to me on Friday and showed me two pictures of you with this girl going into your hotel room. I pretty much lost it after that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just assumed the girl was with me?\u201d He looked down, picking restlessly at my bedspread, his voice tinged with sadness.</p><p>\u201cYou two were the only ones in the photos, so yeah, pretty much.\u201d I shuddered, recalling the pictures in my mind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair, Kitten,\u201d he remarked, his eyebrows pinched together.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not.\u201d I looked away from him, embarrassed at my ability to write him off so quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou have to remember that I\u2019ve been playing ball here for three years now. I have friends in all the places we travel. And sometimes they come up to my room to hang out. I always share a room with at least one other guy. You can\u2019t assume that I\u2019m doing something wrong all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what was I supposed to think?\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but defend my initial reaction and thoughts. \u201cI saw a girl walking into a room that you were holding the door open for. Then I saw you closing the door behind her, with the world\u2019s biggest smile on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck, Cassie, how about asking me?\u201d His tone changed, anger quickly replacing sadness. \u201cIs that why you never called me? Because you thought I cheated on you the second I left town?\u201d He lowered his voice, the angry tone still present. \u201cWe had sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the first girl you\u2019ve had sex with, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But you are the first girl I\u2019ve ever loved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t have that conversation with you over the phone,\u201d I admitted, guilt careening through my body.</p><p>\u201cSo instead you had no conversation with me at all?\u201d He eased off the bed and walked across the floor. \u201cDo you know how crazy that made me? I\u2019m trying to concentrate on my fucking fucking ball baseball game and all I can think about is why the hell the girl I\u2019m in love with is ignoring me. I knew something was wrong when you never called. I tried to shake it off, but I couldn\u2019t. You can\u2019t do that to me. Don\u2019t you understand? You can\u2019t fucking do that to me when I\u2019m trying to play ball!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack. I didn\u2019t think...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is bullshit, Cassie!\u201d he shouted, his jaw tense. \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything to make you not trust me.\u201d His eyes widened as the realization set in. \u201cBut that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He nodded his head in understanding, then turned his hurt gaze to me. \u201cYou don\u2019t...trust me.\u201d</p><p>I avoided his eyes, the truth in his words resonating deep within me. \u201cLook at me!\u201d His voice rose along with his anger.</p><p>I did as he demanded, grateful for the tears blurring my view of him. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Jack?\u201d My voice cracked with emotion.</p><p>\u201cI want you to give me a fair shot, but apparently that\u2019s too much to ask.\u201d He turned his back to me and threw open my bedroom door. I heard the front door slam shut as I sat stunned in my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d Melissa poked her head through my doorway.</p><p>\u201cI think I just royally fucked things up.\u201d I exhaled and wiped a tear from my eye. \u201cHand me my phone, please?\u201d I practically begged, pointing to its location on the bathroom counter.</p><p>Melissa snagged my phone and tossed it to me. \u201cYou wanna talk about it?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn a minute. Thanks.\u201d I tried to smile but couldn\u2019t. Melissa nodded in understanding and closed my door behind her to give me some privacy.</p><p>I scrolled through my contacts searching for Jack\u2019s name and pressed Send. I listened as it rang twice before going straight to voice mail. He was ignoring me. I swallowed my pride and waited patiently for the beep that acknowledged his voice mail recording, but hung up instead. I had no idea what I wanted to say to him that wouldn\u2019t sound pathetic or stupid.</p><p>How had things twisted into tangled-up knots so easily? I walked into Melissa\u2019s room and found her reading a book on her bed. I cuddled up next to her and worked through the emotions churning inside of me.</p><p>\u201cYou were right about Jack,\u201d I started.</p> <p>She dropped the book to her side and turned to me. \u201cAbout what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said the girl wasn\u2019t there for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was she there for then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack roomed with Brett and apparently Brett met her and invited her up.\u201d I let out a long sigh.</p><p>\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d She leaned her curly brown head against mine.</p> <p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then why\u2019d he leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe got pissed that I didn\u2019t trust him.\u201d I shook my head at the absurdity of the situation. \u201cI feel like a crazy person right now. I mean, one second I\u2019m overwhelmed with relief that the girl wasn\u2019t there for him. I\u2019m looking at Jack, realizing how much I care about him. And in the next, I\u2019m feeling horrible and guilty for not trusting him. Now he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m scared to death that I just screwed it all up.\u201d</p><p>I forced my eyes closed as I inhaled through my nose. \u201cWhat if I lose him?\u201d My face twisted in pain.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Melissa\u2019s voice was stern with certainty.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d I asked, unable to hide the fear in my voice.</p> <p>\u201cBecause Jack\u2019s just as stubborn as you are! He\u2019s not going to quit on you that easily. But he is right, you know. You don\u2019t trust him. And that\u2019s not fair.\u201d She stroked my hair as she spoke.</p><p>I breathed in deeply again. \u201cI know, but it\u2019s hard. I mean, I saw those pictures and was so embarrassed. I felt like such an idiot. Like those girls knew something I didn\u2019t about my own relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, I know how you felt. But you never once questioned that maybe he didn\u2019t do it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d I confessed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be pissed off too.\u201d</p><p>The sound of the front door swinging open stopped our conversation. Footsteps beat against the floor toward my bedroom before stopping. \u201cCassie!\u201d Jack\u2019s voice echoed throughout the apartment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Melissa\u2019s room,\u201d I nervously squeaked out.</p><p>Jack appeared and leaned against the doorway, his dressy attire now replaced with black shorts and a tight-fitting baseball t-shirt. He buried his hands in his pockets before demanding, \u201cGet up. I want to talk to you.\u201d</p> <p>Fear shot through me as I struggled to move from Melissa\u2019s bed. She helped push me to my feet and I eyed her nervously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Go. Apologize,\u201d she whispered before giving my backside a light shove.</p><p>I stumbled over my flimsy flip-flops before regaining my balance, my eyes searching Jack\u2019s for any sign of happiness, but failing. I followed his lead into my bedroom where he slammed the door shut behind me.</p><p>\u201cSit.\u201d He pointed at my bed and I did as he requested.</p><p>He didn\u2019t join me. Instead, he stood in front of me, eyeing me before speaking. \u201cLet me finish before you say anything. Okay?\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t seem to find my voice, so I simply nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want to be really pissed off at you right now. No, forget that, I am really pissed off at you.\u201d He stopped talking, took a deep breath, and ran his tanned fingers through loose strands of his black hair. \u201cListen, I know we\u2019re both fucked up. We both have trust issues and this thing happening between us is scary as hell.\u201d He wagged his finger, his eyes avoiding mine.</p><p>\u201cBut when I told you I loved you, I meant it. I didn\u2019t mean that I\u2019d love you only if it was easy, or only if it was drama-free. I think we both know life isn\u2019t like that.\u201d I watched his face twisting with emotion as my eyes began to fill with tears.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not easy to be with me. Dating me means that you have to deal with some pretty crazy shit that other people don\u2019t and I\u2019m sorry for that. All the things you\u2019re just now being exposed to, I\u2019ve had years to deal with. I\u2019m used to it...the crazy pictures, the girls, the fan pages, the blogs, the reporters, the scouts, all the social media stuff.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders as his eyes met mine. \u201cAnd I know that the past version of me is someone you would never trust. But who I am when I\u2019m with you\u201d he paused, \u201cisn\u2019t who I used to be. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been that guy since the night of our first date, so it\u2019s not fair that you judge me like I\u2019m still him.\u201d</p><p>He settled his body next to mine on the edge of the bed. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, then you have to trust me. And you can\u2019t shut me out or ignore me when things get uncomfortable.\u201d</p><p>It felt like hours of silence passed before I asked, \u201cCan I talk now?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Jack. I know you haven\u2019t done anything to deserve my mistrust, but it\u2019s just that I saw those pictures and I felt so stupid. I\u2019d just told you not to make me look dumb or embarrass me, and I felt like that\u2019s exactly what you did. I went into self-preservation mode where nothing else mattered but me.\u201d I tried to explain my craziness in a way I hoped he\u2019d understand. That basically, he was dating someone with serious trust issues.</p><p>His arm swept around my back and pulled me toward him. I allowed a few teardrops to fall before wiping them away. \u201cYou make me fucking crazy, but I love you.\u201d He pressed his warm lips against my temple.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not breaking up with me?\u201d I asked with a pout.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not that lucky.\u201d</p><p>TEN</p><p>JACK</p><p>\u201cKitten, come on, we\u2019re gonna be late!\u201d I shouted toward Cassie\u2019s bathroom in between paces.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, hold on!\u201d I heard the sound of clanking against the countertop and feet shuffling.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I\u2019m ready,\u201d she announced as she entered the living room.</p><p>My jaw dropped at the sight of her tanned legs in that little white sundress. I scanned every inch of her body, my eyes loving each curve. I shook my head and smiled. She seriously looked like a fucking angel. And I wanted to be her devil.</p><p>\u201cKitten, you\u2019re gonna give Gramps a heart attack looking like that.\u201d</p><p>Melissa\u2019s laughter echoed from her bedroom. \u201cPlease don\u2019t kill Jack\u2019s grandpa, Cass. Not a good first impression.\u201d</p><p>Cassie giggled in response. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d Her bright green eyes focused on mine. \u201cSee you later.\u201d</p><p>I stuffed my cell phone into my pocket before reaching for Cassie\u2019s hand. She locked her fingers in mine as I led her toward the door. \u201cSee you later, Melissa,\u201d I shouted toward her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cBye, you guys. Have fun!\u201d</p><p>I ushered Cassie outside with a light slap to her ass and when she turned to smack me, she stopped and simply smiled instead. God, I loved this girl.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful,\u201d I said, running my fingers through the soft golden waves in her hair.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She smiled and hesitated at the side of my car before I helped her up and inside.</p><p>I glanced over at the girl to my right and noticed her fidgeting with her hair. Shit. She\u2019d actually curled it and I was going to fuck mess it all up on the drive. I should have borrowed Gran\u2019s Honda.</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d I tossed my baseball cap into her lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put it on. It\u2019ll help keep your hair in place.\u201d I shot her a half smile. \u201cIt\u2019s better than no hat, right?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged her shoulders, saying, \u201cI guess we\u2019ll find out,\u201d and placed the hat on top of her head. She laughed as it fell all the way down, covering her eyes. \u201cYou have a huge head!\u201d</p><p>I leaned toward her, grabbing the bill of the hat between my fingers and pulled her close. \u201cNo. You have a small head.\u201d I ducked under the hat and planted my lips firmly against hers as she giggled. God, she smelled good.</p><p>The engine screamed to life as I turned the key in the ignition. \u201cReady for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she answered with a nod and I took off, the wind whipping through my hair.</p><p>\u201cSo, have you ever brought a girl home before?\u201d Her voice cut through the sound of the air and the roar of the engine.</p><p>I glanced at her before laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She shrugged.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d I eyed her before shaking my head. \u201cI\u2019ve never even slept with the same girl twice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo? That doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t brought some random girl home before.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>I placed my right hand on her knee and caressed her bare skin with my fingers. \u201cYou\u2019re the first. And the last,\u201d I informed her, my expression serious.</p><p>She smiled and her whole face lit up. Or maybe it was mine. All I know for certain is that smile lit up even my darkest days.</p><p>We drove for ten minutes before I pulled the car directly in front of my grandparents\u2019 blue and white one-story house. Gran\u2019s yard was meticulous, with manicured bushes lining the front of the house.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so cute,\u201d she said, removing my hat and fussing with the tangled strands of her hair.</p><p>I smirked in her direction. \u201cYour hair looks perfect, Kitten. Come on.\u201d I grabbed the hat she discarded and pulled it on my head, tucking my hair underneath.</p><p>I opened the car door and helped her down, my hands resting on her hips and ass. \u201cI think you\u2019re trying to kill me in that dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it,\u201d she teased, her eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll like you better out of it,\u201d I whispered against her neck.</p><p>\u201cJack! Stop it.\u201d She smacked my arm and I laughed.</p><p>We interlocked our fingers and I led her toward the blue double front doors. One of them shot open and Dean appeared, grinning from ear to ear. \u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d he chastised before pulling Cassie against him in a tight bear hug.</p><p>\u201cI will hurt you. Get off her.\u201d I playfully shoved him away from her.</p><p>Cassie laughed at our horseplay, then lifted her chin, sniffing at the air. \u201cIt smells incredible in here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Gran\u2019s homemade sauce,\u201d Dean said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home.\u201d I beamed, watching as she looked around at all our things.</p><p>\u201cLook at all these old pics of you two. You were so cute,\u201d she said, pointing at an elementary school photo framed on the wall.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re still cute.\u201d I led her across the aging beige carpet toward the entryway to the kitchen. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>We walked through and I immediately spotted Gran leaning over the stove, her graying brown hair pinned tightly back in a bun. Gramps sat at the round dinner table, reading the newspaper. He looked up when he heard our footsteps, his glasses resting on the tip of his nose like always.</p><p>\u201cOh, Ma, they\u2019re here!\u201d Gramps sounded excited. He rose from his chair and walked straight toward Cassie with open arms.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Cassie. It\u2019s so nice to finally meet you.\u201d He squeezed her hard against his chest.</p><p>I laughed as I headed over to Gran. \u201cGran, this is my girl, Cassie.\u201d</p> <p>Gran wiped her hands on her apron as Cassie grinned and pulled herself from Gramps\u2019 hug. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you, Cassie. We\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d Her eyes crinkled in the corners as she grinned, a hint of dimples like mine appearing on her creased cheeks.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so nice to meet you both. Thanks for having me,\u201d Cassie replied with a warm smile. \u201cCan I help?\u201d She directed the question toward Gran.</p><p>\u201cOh heavens no, dear. I\u2019m almost finished. Go sit down and make yourself comfortable. Jack, you get her whatever she needs, you hear me?\u201d Gran\u2019s voice took on the tone she only used with Dean and me.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gran, of course.\u201d I leaned toward her and planted a kiss on her cheek.</p><p>\u201cDo you need anything, Kitten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, thanks.\u201d</p><p>Gramps pulled out the empty chair next to him and patted it. \u201cCome sit down next to me, Cassie. Or do I get to call you Kitten too?\u201d he asked with a wink.</p><p>Dean laughed out loud. \u201cI think we should all start calling her Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I shot Dean a murderous look, not at all amused. \u201cOnly I get to call her Kitten. You\u2019d be wise to remember that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, stop threatening your brother,\u201d Gran remarked while waving the steam away from her face.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gran.\u201d I gave Dean a hard kick under the table.</p> <p>Gramps leaned on his elbow and tilted his head. \u201cSo, Cassie, Jack tells us that you\u2019re a photographer.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at me, grinning before looking back at Gramps. \u201cWell, that\u2019s what I\u2019m studying right now. I\u2019d like to start my own business as soon as I graduate.\u201d</p><p>Gramps slapped his hand against the table. \u201cWell, that\u2019s just great! Isn\u2019t that great, dear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is great. What kind of photography?\u201d Gran asked.</p><p>\u201cIdeally, I\u2019d like to work for a magazine that focuses on travel and human interest stories. I\u2019d get to travel around the country and meet all sorts of incredible people with amazing stories.\u201d Cassie started to explain slowly and loud enough for everyone to hear. It didn\u2019t escape me the way her green eyes lit up when she talked about her craft.</p><p>\u201cOoooh, that sounds exciting.\u201d Gran squeezed her shoulders up to her ears.</p><p>\u201cNow, what would you do for them? What kind of pictures would you take?\u201d Gramps asked as he reached for his glass of water.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d either get assigned with the journalist writing the piece, or I\u2019d go by myself to shoot whatever the focus of the article was about. It could be anything from a new hotel opening and its impact on a struggling city, to a town\u2019s comeback after almost being destroyed in a natural disaster. But the overall theme is positive and uplifting.\u201d</p> <p>She paused before looking at me, her eyes wide. \u201cThere\u2019s an internship that I\u2019m going to apply for this summer. Apparently one of the New York-based magazines has an LA office and my professor mentioned it to me today. He said he\u2019d write me a letter of recommendation, so you never know.\u201d</p><p>I gave her a big smile. \u201cCan\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play, Kitten. They\u2019d be idiots not to hire you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should see her stuff, Gramps. She\u2019s really good,\u201d I added, pride shooting through my body.</p><p>\u201cShe is,\u201d Dean agreed. \u201cBut I have a question. The stuff you take pictures of is so creative. I mean, your angles and what you put in your shots... Gramps, she has this one picture of Jack on the mound. You can\u2019t see his whole body or even his face. It\u2019s the coolest shot! Will you get to take pictures like that for a magazine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFirst of all, thank you. It\u2019s sweet of you to say that about my photos and I appreciate it.\u201d Cassie smiled. \u201cI guess it totally depends on the magazine and their style. But the ones I\u2019d love to work for have very beautifully creative photos and I think they give the photographer a lot of control with their shots.\u201d She shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds perfect for you. Your photography is way too beautiful to be defined by someone else\u2019s standards. If it doesn\u2019t work out, you can always go into sports photography and follow your boyfriend around the country,\u201d I suggested helpfully.</p><p>\u201cSo, I\u2019d just wake up and take pictures of you all day?\u201d</p><p>I let out a slight chuckle. \u201cSounds like a dream job to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord.\u201d Gran sighed. \u201cForgive me, Cassie, I did the best I could with him.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Gran, he\u2019s perfect just the way he is.\u201d Her eyes wandered back to mine as her lips curved in a slight smile.</p><p>\u201cJack, Dean, come help me serve, will you?\u201d Gran asked.</p><p>Dean and I jumped up from the table and returned carrying steaming dishes filled with Italian food. The smell of freshly baked bread mixed with garlic tomatoes filtered into the air and my mouth started to salivate.</p><p>\u201cDig in, please. Cassie first,\u201d Gramps insisted.</p><p>Cassie reached for the bowl of spaghetti and dished out a huge helping before grabbing two piping hot pieces of fresh bread and tossing them onto her plate. Her eyes widened once she added salad, and I gently placed my hand on her upper thigh and squeezed.</p><p>\u201cGet enough, Kitten?\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cI think I got excited in my serving sizes,\u201d she admitted, the hue of embarrassment rising in her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just eat what you can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis all looks incredible, Gran. Thank you so much,\u201d she said sincerely, before digging in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, dear. Thank you for coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, Jack, we need to talk about the draft,\u201d Gramps mentioned between sloppy, sauce-filled bites.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for starters, who all will be here on draft day besides the reporters from that TV channel?\u201d Gramps swirled some spaghetti around his fork.</p><p>Cassie looked at me, clearly interested in the conversation we\u2019d yet to have. I swallowed my food before speaking. \u201cYou and Gran, of course. Dean, you\u2019ll be here, right?\u201d</p><p>Dean nodded and I turned to face Cassie. \u201cAnd Cass, I\u2019d like you here too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait. Here for what? I\u2019m sort of lost right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe major league draft. They think I\u2019ll go within the first couple of rounds so it will be televised on ESPN.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked with surprise.</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d I mimicked her tone and she glared at me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll come though, right?\u201d I reached under the table again and connected with her thigh, moving her dress up slightly with my fingertips.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll...come,\u201d she sputtered before swatting my hand away.</p><p>\u201cGreat. So, Gramps, it\u2019s you and Gran. Dean and Kitten. And of course, my agents, Marc and Ryan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have agents already?\u201d Her face scrunched up as she winced noticeably.</p><p>\u201cNot officially. I can\u2019t sign with them until I get drafted, but we have a verbal agreement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how many do you have? Don\u2019t most people only have one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne\u2019s an agent and the other\u2019s a lawyer. But they work together and it stops me having to hire a lawyer separately,\u201d I explained.</p><p>\u201cOh. We really need to talk more about all this baseball stuff. I feel like I don\u2019t know anything that\u2019s happening.\u201d She bit her bottom lip and I saw the unease on her face; she looked so overwhelmed. I\u2019d do anything to take that feeling away from her. I didn\u2019t just want her by my side through this process, I needed her there.</p><p>\u201cSorry, Kitten, we\u2019ve had other stuff going on. And this is all pretty recent. I was going to tell you about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not mad or anything. I\u2019m really excited for you, but the whole TV thing is a little overwhelming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt only happens if you\u2019re getting drafted really high. They don\u2019t send camera crews to everyone\u2019s house,\u201d Dean said, and I couldn\u2019t read her expression any longer, her face blank.</p><p>\u201cOh. When is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe first Monday in June,\u201d Dean answered before I had the chance.</p><p>\u201cAnd then when do you leave?\u201d Cassie asked softly, her green eyes searching mine for answers I didn\u2019t have yet.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know for sure, but I think right after,\u201d I answered, my chest suddenly feeling like it weighed a thousand pounds.</p><p>\u201cLike that day?\u201d she asked, as her eyes started to get that shiny look.</p><p>\u201cNo. But within a week, I think.\u201d Her face twisted at my words.</p><p>She was upset. Of course she was upset. I hadn\u2019t told her any of this and now it was all being sprung on her without any warning. I could be such an idiot sometimes.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the plan, Jack? What do your agents think is going to happen?\u201d Gran asked from across the table.</p><p>\u201cThey think I\u2019ll go within the first round and that should come with a solid signing bonus. If we like the deal, then we accept it and I\u2019ll have to move to wherever their Single-A farm team is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a signing bonus?\u201d Cassie asked, her forehead creasing.</p><p>\u201cA signing bonus is exactly what it sounds like. It\u2019s money used as an incentive to get the player to sign with the team instead of returning to school for another year. The minor league pay scale is barely enough to live off of each month. That\u2019s why the signing bonus is so important. But not every player gets it.\u201d I tried to clarify without confusing her.</p><p>\u201cSo not everyone gets a signing bonus, but you will because you\u2019ll get drafted in the first round?\u201d she asked, her voice stumbling a bit.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many rounds are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the draft? About forty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, and they think you\u2019ll go in the first?\u201d Her eyes widened as I stifled a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said before clasping her hand over her mouth, her face embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard far worse,\u201d Gramps said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cWhat happens to those guys who don\u2019t get a signing bonus?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you said they can barely live off of the money they make without a bonus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one plays this game for the money, Kitten. We play it because we love it so much that the thought of being without it causes unbearable pain. It\u2019s a game that one day ends for every single person who plays it, but we all want to put off that ending as long as possible.\u201d I took a quick breath. \u201cWhen you only dream of doing one thing for the majority of your life, it\u2019s almost unfathomable to think about doing anything else. You don\u2019t know how. It\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever wanted and you\u2019ll not only fight like hell to get there, you\u2019ll fight like hell to stay.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love how much you love it,\u201d she said, her eyes beaming.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t play it if I didn\u2019t,\u201d I admitted, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cDo Marc and Ryan have any idea what team is going to try to draft you?\u201d Dean asked while ripping apart a piece of bread.</p><p>\u201cIf they do, they haven\u2019t told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you have no idea where you\u2019ll be going?\u201d He chewed thoughtfully while he waited for my answer.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe teams are all over the country, right?\u201d Cassie asked, her expression a mixture of excitement and concern.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you just have to go wherever they tell you to?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf I want to play ball, I do,\u201d I responded with a playful grin, hoping to lighten the darkening mood.</p><p>Gran\u2019s concerned gaze swung between Cassie\u2019s face and mine. \u201cWhat will you two do when he leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, we haven\u2019t really talked about it yet, Gran.\u201d I ran my fingers nervously through my hair. Cassie placed her hand under the table on my thigh and I quickly reached for it, grateful for her touch.</p><p>\u201cLong distance relationships suck,\u201d Dean commented darkly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell do you know about \u2019em?\u201d I snapped at Dean, suddenly overwhelmed with the reality of the situation with Cassie and me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just heard they suck. And they never last.\u201d He clamped his jaw shut, a little too late for my liking.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Dean!\u201d Gran swatted him with her napkin. \u201cLong distance relationships can work just as well as any other kind. Sometimes they\u2019re even better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d Cassie asked, our minds clearly on the same page.</p><p>\u201cFor starters, your relationship becomes less about the physical aspect, obviously,\u201d she said with a laugh, \u201cand more about the things that truly matter in the long run. When you can\u2019t see each other for months at a time, the building blocks of your relationship either flourish or flounder. No relationship can survive without trust, honesty, and communication, no matter how close you are.\u201d</p><p>She stopped for a moment, looking at both Cassie and me before continuing. \u201cLong distance means countless hours talking on the phone. And I mean, really talking. Because it\u2019s all you have when you can\u2019t simply get in your car and drive to the other person\u2019s house. You get to really know each other. The bonds you form during that time apart can be as solid as steel beams.\u201d</p><p>I found myself completely focused on Gran\u2019s words. \u201cShe\u2019s right,\u201d Gramps added with a twinkle in his eyes. \u201cWhen you only have the telephone or letters, it changes things. All the emotions and feelings are still there, but they\u2019re amplified in a way that\u2019s tough to explain. That\u2019s why the communication part is so important.\u201d</p><p>Gran glanced over at him with a dimpled smile. \u201cBecause it\u2019s easy to misinterpret things or jump to the wrong conclusion when the person you love is far away. The only way to fix it is to talk about it. So you end up talking...a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen were you two apart?\u201d I asked, finally realizing they were both speaking from experience.</p><p>\u201cDuring the war. But I wrote him every day,\u201d Gran said matter-of-factly.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I wrote every chance I had.\u201d Gramps grinned. \u201cCalled, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat he did.\u201d They exchanged a loving glance and I squeezed Cassie\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough of that talk for one night. I\u2019m sure the kids don\u2019t want to think about all this stuff right now.\u201d Gran waved a hand in front of her face before rising from the table, followed by Gramps.</p><p>\u201cNo, it was really nice to hear. Thank you.\u201d Cassie smiled, her hand still holding mine.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll get the dishes, Gran. Go lie down,\u201d I suggested with a hearty smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Jack. We\u2019ll just be in the other room,\u201d she said before slowly making her way into the living room.</p><p>\u201cYou two are gonna stay together, right?\u201d Dean asked with a wince.</p><p>I turned to look at Cassie, whose eyes were piercing into mine. \u201cShe\u2019ll probably be sick of me by then.\u201d I couldn\u2019t help but tease Cassie in a weak attempt to hide my fears.</p><p>\u201cMost likely,\u201d she kidded back.</p><p>At least, I hoped she was kidding.</p><p>\u201cYou guys seriously haven\u2019t talked about any of this?\u201d Dean questioned in disbelief, leaning back against his chair.</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d I tried to be cool, ignoring the irritation rising in my body.</p><p>\u201cDude, June isn\u2019t that far away. And you\u2019ll leave right after the draft. You two are hopeless.\u201d</p><p>I rammed my foot into Dean\u2019s shin with force, my temper flaring. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut the fuck hell up, Dean, and worry about your own love life. Or lack thereof.\u201d</p><p>Dean\u2019s chair slid across the kitchen floor with a loud squeak. \u201cOw, Jack! Jesus! I was just saying you two should probably get your shit together and actually start doing that whole communicating thing Gran was talking about. \u2019Cause the last time I checked, you sort of sucked at it.\u201d</p><p>I stood up from my chair, my breath increasing with each second that passed. \u201cYou\u2019re being a real asshole, Dean, you know that?\u201d I seethed, my jaw working as I ground my teeth, trying to control my anger.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s hand gripped the bottom of my shirt, pulling it tightly toward her. \u201cJack! Sit! Down!\u201d</p><p>I looked at her face, all pinched with fear, and fell back into my chair, my breathing ragged. After thinking a moment, I shot to my feet again and grabbed her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. We haven\u2019t even done the dishes and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re leaving. I\u2019ll do the dishes when I get back,\u201d I demanded, leaving her no choice.</p><p>\u201cNight, Dean,\u201d she said grudgingly, two steps behind me.</p><p>\u201cNight, Cass. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>I stormed into the living room before leaning in to plant a kiss on Gran\u2019s soft cheek. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take Cass home. I\u2019ll be back in a bit and will handle the dishes then. Okay? Thanks for dinner, Gran. It was delicious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid something happen, dear? What happened?\u201d Gran\u2019s voice echoed her concern.</p><p>\u201cAsk your other grandson.\u201d I smiled at her unapologetically, before giving Gramps a hug, inhaling the scent of tobacco lingering on his clothes.</p><p>\u201cIt was really nice meeting you both. Thank you so much for dinner. It was fantastic.\u201d Cassie smiled softly before leaning in to hug Gramps and then Gran.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you too, young lady. Good luck with that internship!\u201d Gramps remembered with an enthusiastic smile.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome any time, even after he leaves,\u201d Gran told Cassie, her eyes tired but kind.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll see you both soon.\u201d</p><p>I practically dragged Cassie out of the house by her hand before she ripped it from my grip once we were out the door. \u201cJesus, Jack, enough! Stop pulling me like I\u2019m a fucking dog or something. I don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re so pissed off about!\u201d</p><p>I came to a sudden stop on the walkway as guilt immediately mixed with my anger. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d I asked, my insides battling.</p><p>She cocked her head to one side, assessing me. \u201cNo. But don\u2019t do that again. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>I reached for her hand, but she tucked it behind her back. \u201cI deserve that,\u201d I said with a nod before walking toward my car ahead of her. I opened her door, but didn\u2019t stay to help her up. If she wasn\u2019t going to let me touch her hand, she sure as shit wasn\u2019t going to let me grab her ass.</p><p>Once inside, I pulled open the old ashtray, the sound of jingling change filling the air as I dug around for the proper amount. I glanced at Cassie, knowing that she was pissed causing an aching in my chest I couldn\u2019t stand. \u201cForgive me,\u201d I said, before tossing two quarters into her lap.</p><p>She glanced down, the corners of her mouth turning up in a hesitant smile as she shook her head. \u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d Relief spread through me as soon as I realized that it would be okay. We\u2019d be okay.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes, releasing a long breath. \u201cJust take me home, Jack. That\u2019s what you ripped me from your house to do, so just do it already.\u201d</p><p>My stomach twisted as her tone chased away every ounce of relief I\u2019d just felt. I started the car and we drove in silence the entire way to her apartment, except for the music I chose. As soon as I put the car in park, she hopped out.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Kitten. Wait!\u201d I shouted at her retreating back, but she continued walking. \u201cCassie!\u201d</p><p>I realized she had no intention of stopping, so I followed slowly behind her, my mind racing. When I reached her front door, I noticed that it wasn\u2019t closed all the way and my heart literally let out a thankful beat.</p><p>\u201cCass?\u201d I peered around the door into the empty living room. I noticed the light on in her bedroom, so I headed that direction.</p><p>I walked in and found her looking in the bathroom mirror as she scrubbed the makeup from her face. She turned to me and sighed before looking back at her reflection. I sat on the edge of her bed, suddenly feeling like the biggest asshole on earth. The problem was, I wasn\u2019t sure what the hell she was even so mad about, but I was certain it was my fault.</p><p>I watched as she gathered her long hair into a ponytail, revealing that gorgeous neck she usually hid underneath. I knew I was in trouble with her, but suddenly all I could think about was kissing that neck. I stood up and started to walk toward her, my other head clearly in charge of my actions.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she snapped and I stopped. No fighting back, no response, no arguing. I simply turned my ass right around and sat back on her bed. If I had a tail, it would sure as shit have been tucked between my legs.</p><p>I was one hundred percent not in control of this situation. This girl fucking owned me right now. I sat on that bed waiting for her to give me the time of day. I didn\u2019t necessarily like this feeling, but I suffered through it...for her. I convinced myself that I\u2019d probably suffer through pretty much anything for this girl.</p><p>The water turned off and she walked toward me, avoiding my eyes before sitting down as far away from me as possible. \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d Her angry tone caught me off guard.</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d She let out an irritated laugh. I stared at her as she threw her hands up in the air in exasperation. \u201cYou flipped out at your grandparents\u2019 house. I thought you were going to hit your own brother!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe pissed me off!\u201d I attempted to defend my actions. \u201cI didn\u2019t like the things he was saying about us. I don\u2019t want to hear that shit when it comes to me and you.\u201d</p><p>She released a loud breath, her shoulders slouching. \u201cJack, you can\u2019t get pissed every time someone says something unflattering about us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d I responded seriously, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cOkay, you cannnn,\u201d she dragged out the word before continuing, \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t. Plus, it\u2019s not like Dean was really wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust that we don\u2019t really have the best track record when it comes to trust and communication, is all.

I don\u2019t want to be the last to know what\u2019s going on with you.\u201d She spoke softly and I could see the hurt in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never be the last to know again. I promise.\u201d I caressed her hip with my thumb, the feeling that I\u2019d let her down surging through my body.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll really be gone soon?\u201d she asked, her tone of voice breaking my fucking heart.</p><p>I nodded. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be back in a few months. The season ends in September, so I come home as soon as it\u2019s over.\u201d</p> <p>Her eyes lit up as the worry lines on her forehead subsided. \u201cReally? So it\u2019s not like you move away forever?\u201d</p><p>The heaviness in my chest lifted. \u201cIs that what you thought? That I got drafted and never came back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. I don\u2019t know how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just go for the rest of the baseball season and then I come home. They\u2019ve already been playing games since April,\u201d I told her, wanting to alleviate her fears.</p><p>\u201cAnd then what? I mean, you go back again, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled half-heartedly. \u201cI go back in February.\u201d</p> <p>She started counting the months between when I come back and when I leave again on her fingers as I braced for her response. \u201cThat\u2019s not terrible.\u201d She smiled and dropped her hands.</p><p>\u201cTotally doable, right?\u201d I asked with confidence, but my insides were doing somersaults.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up on you quite yet. I\u2019ll try anything with you once.\u201d She winked at me before seeing the big grin on my face, then began backtracking. \u201cWell...almost anything.\u201d Her cheeks turned rose-colored.</p><p>I tilted her face toward mine, lifting her chin with my fingers. \u201cI love you.\u201d Her eyes focused on my mouth before closing as I pulled her to me. She tasted like the mint of her toothpaste and her lips were soft as I parted them. The touch of her tongue against mine woke up parts of my body I had no real control over. I tangled my fingers in her hair, pulling her even closer to me.</p><p>She let out a low sound and all I could think about was ripping that little white dress off her body. I leaned her against the mattress and positioned myself on top of her. The way her hair spilled out all around drove me crazy. There was something so sexy about seeing it splayed across her pillow as she lay beneath me. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d I reminded her as I leaned down to kiss her again, pushing the lower half of my body against hers.</p><p>I waited for the signal that she was willing to go farther before I attempted anything. Her hips lifted from the bed to meet mine as she pressed herself into me. My hand reached down to her leg before sliding up along her bare skin, bringing her dress with it. I pulled the fabric up to her hip as she wiggled, sensing no rejection to my actions.</p><p>I ran my thumb along the elastic of her thong, sliding underneath it. The feel of her skin made me ravenous. I couldn\u2019t get enough; all my thoughts consumed in what it felt like to be inside her. \u201cI want you,\u201d I admitted, my breath faltering.</p><p>She opened her eyes to mine, her mouth opening slightly as her hands reached for the button on my shorts. Her fingers brushed against me as she fumbled, causing a groan to escape from my lips. My willpower fading, I reached down to help her remove the fabric that remained between us.</p> <p>I flung off my shorts and boxers as she pulled at me, her fingers digging into my exposed skin. I sat up, my breathing erratic as I tossed my shirt onto the floor. Her gorgeous body, half naked with her white dress bunched up toward her breasts, took my breath away, and I peeled the dress from her effortlessly. Then I reached lower and pulled her underwear all the way down to her feet, where she kicked them off.</p><p>The curves of her body called out to me, and I slid my mouth over them, my tongue tasting the salt on her skin. Her breathing was quick and heavy as her fingers slid along the muscles in my back. Every sound that escaped her lips simply made me want her more. \u201cJack.\u201d Her voice was shaky. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>Her words lit a fire inside me that was hard to contain. I wanted to please her...satisfy her...ruin her for all other guys out there. I wanted this moment right here to be the best part of her day.</p><p>Her hands gripped my body as I slid into her. She let out a sigh and I almost lost it right then. I bit down on my bottom lip as I rocked in and out of her, trying to focus on anything other than how amazing she felt.</p><p>Her eyes opened and closed as my thrusting continued. No matter how many girls I\u2019d slept with at Fullton, none had ever come close to feeling like this. Nothing had ever felt like this. Not even baseball. \u201cI\u2019ll never get over how incredible you feel,\u201d I admitted without shame.</p><p>She looked into me. \u201cYou too. Don\u2019t stop, Jack.\u201d She panted the words and I crushed her lips against mine. My hips moved with hers, my shoulders burning from the weight of my body, but refusing to falter. She moaned and shuddered as she sucked in a deep breath, her eyes flying open in wonder as her body trembled in spasms. My pace quickened; I knew wouldn\u2019t be able to hold out much longer.</p><p>Her head thrust back and I kissed along her neck, before finding the sweet taste of her lips. My mouth covered hers, my tongue exploring while I continued working in and out of her. \u201cCass,\u201d I said as my lips pressed against hers. She sighed as her teeth grazed against my ear. I groaned without control and released myself into her.</p><p>I gently pulled out of her before falling onto my back, my breathing loud and uneven. She turned to lay her head on my chest and I wrapped my arm across her bare, damp back.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jack.\u201d Her breath whispered against my skin as I kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cJust don\u2019t forget that when I\u2019m gone for three months this summer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one who\u2019s slept with half the school.\u201d She laughed, softening the barb a little.</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean half the school won\u2019t try to sleep with you the second I\u2019m out of the picture,\u201d I informed her, my tone serious.</p><p>I\u2019ve seen the way other guys look at her. I\u2019m not the first guy at Fullton to notice Cassie. I\u2019m just the one who actually got her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re insane.\u201d She looked over at me, disbelief written all over her face.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope every guy on campus has the same opinion of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure they do. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re known for your sweet disposition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I smiled as contentment welled within me.</p><p>ELEVEN</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>Things with Jack and me were in a good place after all the chaos at Gran and Gramps\u2019 house. We spent every spare moment together, which didn\u2019t seem like much these days. With the baseball draft nearing, Jack focused more than ever on all things baseball. And I had been working on putting together a portfolio for the internship.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Melissa leaned against the wall in our kitchen, clearly wanting to talk. \u201cI was thinking about heading home. Did you want to come with?\u201d</p><p>I thought for about two seconds before answering, \u201cNo way. The guys don\u2019t have games this weekend, just practice.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThen I\u2019m definitely leaving.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, tossing my hair from my shoulder. \u201cAlone time with Jack...whatever will we do?\u201d I placed one finger in front of my puckered lips before tapping.</p><p>\u201cI seriously don\u2019t want to know.\u201d She rolled her eyes and turned to open the fridge.</p><p>\u201cYeah, you do,\u201d I teased, raising my eyebrows.</p><p>Her lips turned up in a half smirk. \u201cSorta. But please don\u2019t share.\u201d She shook her head as if trying to shake way a disturbing image. \u201cWhat did I hear about Jack and the softball team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cSince the guys don\u2019t have a game, they asked Jack to throw out the first pitch tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d Her head cocked to one side.</p><p>\u201cApparently it\u2019s good publicity. I don\u2019t know. Whatever, it\u2019s not like he has a choice. He can\u2019t really say no to another team at the school, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s still sort of weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think so too, but whatever. I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so supportive,\u201d she teased, cupping her hands together.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do try,\u201d I said with a fake Southern accent as I fanned my hand in front of my face.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you when I get back. Want me to check on your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Can you make sure it\u2019s still sitting in my driveway collecting dust?\u201d I giggled at the absurdity of the situation.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need it,\u201d my mother had told me during one of our many arguments. \u201cIt just gives you a way to leave school when you should be studying or doing homework.\u201d I had tried to tell her that maybe I\u2019d need to leave school for a photography project, but then she\u2019d just insist that I take Melissa\u2019s car. No matter how many times I tried to tell her that she made no sense, she refused to budge. So there my car sits. At home. Waiting for me. And the truth is, I\u2019m not sure I ever want to go back for it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t have too much fun with Jack this weekend. Call you later, \u2019K?\u201d Melissa gave me a squeeze before grabbing her things.</p><p>\u201c\u2019K. Drive safe. Tell your parents I said hi and I miss them.\u201d I smiled and waved as she walked out our front door, almost crashing into Jack.</p><p>\u201cHave a good weekend, Jack.\u201d Melissa winked and he turned to me, his eyebrows raised.</p><p>\u201cUh, you too, Melis,\u201d he responded with a half grin before closing the door. \u201cWhat was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s leaving for the weekend.\u201d I tried not to blush but felt the heat rising to my cheeks.</p><p>He dropped onto the couch next to me. \u201cThe whole weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole weekend,\u201d I said, dragging out the words for effect.</p><p>\u201cSweet. Listen, before I get distracted, Matt wants us to come over before the softball game and hang out at his place. I told him I\u2019d check with you first.\u201d Jack rested his head against the pillow on my couch, his hat flopping to one side.</p><p>\u201cFine with me. Who\u2019s gonna be there?\u201d I asked absentmindedly, tossing the hat aside and running my fingers through his soft, dark hair.</p><p>\u201cA few of the guys from the team. Dean and probably Jamie. I don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like her,\u201d I admitted with a smile. \u201cShe\u2019s funny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is funny. And she\u2019s good for Matt,\u201d Jack added, alluding to things I knew nothing about and frankly wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s going to the game, right?\u201d I asked, changing the subject.</p><p>He pushed himself up with one arm until he sat facing me. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you just come with me when I go?\u201d He slid his thumb down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cBecause you have to be there an hour before the game starts. For what, I have no idea, but I\u2019m not going that early.\u201d I pouted, eyeing him with my best puppy dog impression.</p><p>He put his hand behind my neck and pulled me to him, his mouth meeting mine halfway as the overgrown scruff on his face scratched at my bare cheeks. \u201cSeriously, when are you going to shave?\u201d</p> <p>His lips pulled up into a slight smile. \u201cYou know I can\u2019t shave until we lose, Kitten. And we\u2019re not losing, so probably not ever.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes. \u201cYou guys and your superstitions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou love it,\u201d he whispered into my ear before sucking at my lobe softly with his mouth, causing my senses to disappear.</p><p>\u201cYep, sure do,\u201d was my only response as he continued working down my neck.</p><p>He gently pushed me onto my back and leaned on top of me, his dark brown eyes boring into mine. \u201cYou are so beautiful. You know that?\u201d</p> <p>I let out a small breath before pulling his head down and arching toward his lips. His tongue pushed its way into my mouth with intensity. I ran my hands down his back and slipped my fingers into the waistband of his shorts before lifting his shirt up in succession with my own.</p><p>A slight sound escaped my lips at the feeling of his bare skin hot against mine. Chills coursed through me, appearing up and down my legs and arms. His breath was warm on my neck, small kisses being delivered around my ears and cheeks until meeting my mouth once more.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He mumbled my name, his breath ragged.</p><p>Without a word, I slipped out from under him and stretched out my hand. He laced his fingers with mine and I led him away from the living room and into my bedroom, where I closed the door behind us.</p><p>Jack opened Matt\u2019s front door without knocking and led me inside. I watched as five baseball players with hairy faces turned their heads in our direction and smiles instantly appeared on all their faces.</p><p>\u201cCarter! What\u2019s up, buddy! Hey, Cass,\u201d Matt yelled from the round table where they were playing a drinking and card game.</p> <p>\u201cHey, Jack. Hey, Cassie.\u201d Ryan greeted us without looking up from his hand, his forehead creased in concentration.</p><p>Dean picked up his cell phone, checking the time. \u201cFinally! Where have you two been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure I\u2019ll ever get used to you holding some girl\u2019s hand,\u201d Brett added, his blue eyes locked pointedly on our intertwined fingers.</p><p>\u201cGet used to it, BT, she\u2019s not just some girl.\u201d Jack planted a kiss on the side of my face and gently squeezed my fingers.</p><p>\u201cI like that you\u2019ve finally found someone, Jack. And I especially like that she isn\u2019t some stupid skank.\u201d Matt\u2019s girlfriend Jamie walked out from the kitchen with a smirk.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cLove you too, Jame!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have to admit my worry was valid!\u201d She pursed her lips together, her brown ponytail bouncing. \u201cNow get in here and help me,\u201d she called out, after disappearing back behind the wall.</p><p>I looked at Jack and smiled as I untangled my hand from his. He smacked me on the backside when I walked away.</p> <p>\u201cI love that girl,\u201d he said to his teammates before sitting at the table. \u201cDeal me in.\u201d</p><p>I entered the kitchen before giving Jamie a quick squeeze as I glanced back at the group of guys. \u201cTheir facial hair is killing me. They look freaking horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t remind me. I try to pretend it\u2019s all a bad dream,\u201d Jamie said, rubbing her palm against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cAhem, ladies.\u201d Matt pretended to clear his throat. \u201cWe can hear you, ya know!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike we care!\u201d Jamie said with a huff.</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t curse our winning streak!\u201d Cole answered back before slapping his hand over his mouth.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cole, who raised you? The first rule about the winning streak is you don\u2019t talk about the winning streak!\u201d Ryan punched him in the shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou guys are just lucky we keep kissing you,\u201d Jamie said, attempting to steer the attention from poor Cole.</p><p>\u201cI second that,\u201d Jack belted out, his eyes meeting mine briefly before settling back on his cards.</p><p>\u201cPussy,\u201d Brett teased, his eyes focused on the deck of cards in his hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll knock you into the middle of next week if you don\u2019t shut up, BT,\u201d Jack threatened, his jaw rigid.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just jealous \u2019cause no girls want to go anywhere near him,\u201d Cole teased as he removed his baseball hat and tossed it on the floor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep the girls off me. It\u2019s you no one wants,\u201d Brett chipped back.</p><p>The card game continued until Jack checked the clock on the wall and rose from the table. He slammed back a shot of tequila before speaking. \u201cKitten, I gotta go. Get out here and give me some loving.\u201d</p><p>I eyeballed Jamie. \u201cSeriously? Do you hear this guy?\u201d I said with a nod in Jack\u2019s direction.</p><p>Jamie laughed and gave me a hearty shove. \u201cGet out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou come to me,\u201d I insisted, staring him down.</p><p>All eyes were on us, entertained by our stubborn battle.</p><p>\u201cGladly,\u201d Jack responded and walked hastily toward me. He lifted me up in the air and I wrapped my legs around his waist.</p><p>\u201cKeep it in your pants, pal,\u201d I whispered into his ear before nibbling on his neck.</p><p>\u201cYou better stop or I\u2019ll throw you on the floor and have my way with you.\u201d He yanked my hair back, forcing my head away from his before ravaging my mouth.</p><p>\u201cGet a room,\u201d Brett shouted.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll just take yours,\u201d Jack mumbled between kisses.</p><p>\u201cGo or you\u2019ll be late.\u201d I unwrapped my legs and hopped down.</p><p>Jack looked at me one last time before turning to his teammates. \u201cMake sure she doesn\u2019t walk alone to the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter.\u201d I frowned at him, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cDean?\u201d he said sternly.</p><p>\u201cI got her, J. I promise we\u2019ll all go together. She won\u2019t be alone.\u201d Dean smiled at me and then looked reassuringly at his brother.</p><p>\u201cSee you guys at the game.\u201d Jack closed the door and all eyes fell on me.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m not the crazy one!\u201d I yelled, shaking my head.</p><p>\u201cJust so you know, I\u2019ve never seen him act this way about anyone other than Gran,\u201d Dean said, without looking up from his cards.</p><p>I tried not to smile, but failed miserably.</p><p>Forty minutes later, the group of us headed toward the far end of campus. The guys were playful as they walked, bumping into one another and knocking each other\u2019s hats off. I stopped walking to fall slightly behind when Dean turned around, noticing my absence. I waved him ahead, pulling out my camera and removing the lens cap. When he saw my intention, he rejoined the group with a big smile.</p><p>I knelt on the sidewalk, framing the group of guys in the viewfinder, smiling to myself at how happy they all looked. Click. Another shot of Dean\u2019s hand smacking Brett\u2019s hat off. Click. Jamie and Matt holding hands from the back was too much for me to resist. Click.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a nice camera.\u201d A harsh voice startled me and the camera fell from my eye.</p><p>I looked up to see a large, beefy silhouette towering above me, his face shadowed by the setting sun. \u201cGive it to me,\u201d he insisted, before taking a swig of something hidden inside a brown paper bag.</p><p>I stood up instantly, glancing past the man\u2019s shoulder for Dean. I was too shocked to shout. Too nervous to run. You know how you think that if you\u2019re ever in a bad situation, you\u2019ll be all tough, like in the movies? That\u2019s bullshit. You\u2019ll freeze, just like I did. All I could do was silently will Dean to look back at me. I prayed he\u2019d notice I still hadn\u2019t caught up.</p><p>\u201cI said give it to me, bitch!\u201d the man shouted before introducing the back of his hand to the side of my cheek.</p><p>His knuckles hit me with such brute force that my head flew to one side, my hair flying out all around me. I whipped my head back to face him in shock, strands of hair sticking to my eyelashes and lips.</p><p>Did he just hit me?</p><p>\u201cThat guy just hit Cassie! Hey!\u201d I heard Dean shouting and the sound of feet heading in my direction.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t move. My body was still frozen with shock. I couldn\u2019t believe this stranger hit me.</p><p>He struck me again, this time punching me with a closed fist on the other side of my face. As I stumbled with the force of the blow, I looked in the direction of the group, my eyesight crystal clear. Dean sprinted full speed toward me when the man suddenly appeared in front of him. I watched as Dean shoved him, but the man lifted his brown paper bag and slammed it against the top of Dean\u2019s head.</p><p>Thick green glass shattered and spilled onto the sidewalk as Dean\u2019s body crumpled lifelessly to the ground, blood spilling from his head. I wanted to scream, but no sounds came. My mind immediately replayed the scene: Dean\u2019s tall, muscular body losing all coordination as it collapsed into a heap on the concrete, then blood. Lots of it. Brett ran to Dean\u2019s limp body and quickly pulled Dean\u2019s arm around his shoulder, lifting him and dragging him away in the opposite direction.</p><p>I watched the rest of the group as they scattered like animals in a forest fire.</p><p>Hey, wait!</p><p>Where is everyone going?</p><p>I took two steps in their direction before the man suddenly reappeared at my side. \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going, bitch?\u201d</p><p>I instinctively bent over and tried to cover my face with both arms. My eyes focused solely on the black and white design of his shoes as they danced around me. The colors blurred to the left where forceful blows crashed against the side of my face and head.</p><p>Please stop hitting me.</p><p>Blurry movement to the right and the other half of my face exploded in pain.</p><p>Please stop.</p><p>His fist interrupted my internal pleas as it collided with the side of my head once more, almost knocking me off my already shaky feet. I was his personal punching bag. Blow after blow, his blasts showed no signs of stopping, the force of each punch only growing in intensity.</p><p>Dear God, please make it stop.</p><p>I don\u2019t care if I die right now, just please make him stop hitting me.</p><p>Please.</p><p>It hurts so bad.</p><p>And just like that his shoes disappeared from my view. I glanced up to see him running between two sets of houses in the distance, my camera flailing wildly from the strap wrapped tightly around his hand.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d I jerked my head down the street to see Cole waving frantically at me. \u201cCassie! Run!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>I didn\u2019t run.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>My legs were shaking so forcefully I could barely hold myself upright. I stumbled toward Cole, keeping my eyes locked on his face the entire time.</p><p>\u201cJesus, Cassie, are you okay?\u201d His eyes widened at the sight of me and I couldn\u2019t stop myself from spitting, my taste buds revolting at the metallic taste.</p><p>I didn\u2019t speak. Blood-covered saliva covered the area where I continued spitting. I pressed my fingertips against my cheeks, the pain sharp where my teeth had ripped up the inside of my mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My mind couldn\u2019t process what just occurred. I kept thinking, Did that just really happen? Did he just hit me? The words kept repeating over and over again in my mind.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Dean?\u201d I looked around anxiously, visions of his body crumpling to the ground replaying once again in my mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Come on, we have to find Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s everyone else? Where were you?\u201d I asked, my tone almost robotic as a metallic taste filled my mouth. I spit and blood spattered the pavement.</p> <p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know. Everyone scattered. It just happened so fast.\u201d Cole winced as his eyes avoided mine.</p><p>He tossed his arm around my waist to help steady my incessant shaking. We were walking slower than Cole would have liked toward the campus entrance when I saw Jack. He ran full speed in our direction, his hat gripped tightly in his fist.</p><p>\u201cCassie!\u201d Jack\u2019s eyes grew wide when he recognized me. \u201cCassie!\u201d he yelled, as he quickened his pace toward us.</p><p>I stopped moving, tears suddenly filling my eyes. I didn\u2019t recognize it at first, the feeling that overwhelmed me at the sight of him. My entire body released the shock it held as I fell into his strong arms. For the first time since this whole mess began, my lungs filled themselves fully with cool evening air as I took a cleansing breath. I looked into his frantic brown eyes and finally relaxed.</p><p>I was safe now because Jack was here.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the fuck happened, Cole?\u201d Jack shouted, his voice filled with rage.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know, Jack. One minute everyone\u2019s together, and the next some guy\u2019s hitting Cassie and breaking a bottle over Dean\u2019s head and saying he has a gun.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice shook as he summed up the events.</p><p>\u201cHe said he had a gun?\u201d I asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cHe said he was packing. That\u2019s when everyone ran away.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s chest rose and fell rapidly against my body as his jaw tightened. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><p>Jack eased me from him and began pacing, pulling at his hair with each step. He turned to me, his eyes filled with pain. \u201cKitten, where were you when they ran?\u201d My eyes darted between Cole and Jack; I wasn\u2019t sure how to respond. \u201cYou gotta tell me, Kitten, I\u2019m going fucking crazy right now.\u201d</p> <p>I watched as Cole braced, clearly dreading Jack\u2019s reaction. Jack reached for Cole\u2019s shirt, gripping it tightly in his fist. He yanked until Cole stood an inch from his face. \u201cWhere the fuck was Cassie, Cole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Cole winced, unwilling to put up a fight.</p><p>I watched as Jack\u2019s other hand balled into a fist. \u201cJack!\u201d I longed to stop this battle before it began. Jack turned to me, my eyes locking onto his. \u201cHe took my camera.\u201d</p><p>I said the words out loud and allowed my tears to fall. This stranger had violated me. He ripped away a sense of security I never knew I had before suffering the loss of it. He struck my body violently and robbed parts of my innate trust in others. And he took the one material thing that I cared about the most and ripped it from my possession.</p><p>Jack\u2019s anger dropped away for a moment, his eyebrows pinched together in pain. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a new one, Kitten. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI need my camera. Why\u2019d he take it? Why\u2019d he hit me so hard? And why so many times?\u201d I fell to the curb, sobbing uncontrollably.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we should call the cops? The campus police or something?\u201d Cole suggested with a nervous shrug.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where Dean and Brett are now,\u201d Jack snapped.</p> <p>My eyes opened at the mention of his name. \u201cWhere is Dean? Is he okay? I saw him fall. He looked unconscious.\u201d</p><p>Jack leaned next to me, his hand rubbing the length of my back. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? His head was bleeding like crazy! And he couldn\u2019t even stand!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHead wounds do that, Kitten. They bleed something fierce, but it had almost stopped by the time I saw him,\u201d Jack told me, his voice calm.</p><p>\u201cSo he\u2019s really okay?\u201d I released a breath.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really okay.\u201d His voice reassured me and he kissed the top of my head.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack.\u201d Cole took a step toward us before Jack cut him off with an angry slash of his hand.</p><p>\u201cStay the fuck away from me right now, Cole, or I\u2019ll end up doing something I might regret.\u201d</p><p>I looked into Cole\u2019s worried eyes and flashed him a hollow look.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Cassie.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice echoed softly.</p><p>\u201cShut. Up. Cole.\u201d Jack\u2019s tone was deadly, and I turned away.</p><p>Jack\u2019s arms settled underneath my legs and around my waist as he lifted me into the air. \u201cLet\u2019s go home,\u201d he whispered before kissing the side of my forehead.</p><p>I wrapped my arms around his neck and nuzzled into his chest, the sound of his heart beating against my ears giving me reassurance. He carried me in his arms the entire way to my apartment, never once stopping to catch his breath and never slowing his pace.</p><p>Once inside, he placed me gently on my bed and kneeled beside it. \u201cWe need to get you cleaned up, Kitten. Your beautiful face is a mess.\u201d He lightly brushed my hair back with his fingertips.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t given any thought to how messed up my face might be. My jaw ached and my head throbbed, but other than that, nothing else really hurt. \u201cI\u2019m gonna get you some ice. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d He brought my hand to his lips and kissed it.</p><p>I heard his cell phone ring and his voice rose in anger at whoever was on the other end of that call. He reappeared at my side. \u201cThe police are coming here, Kitten. They need your statement right now so they can go look for this guy. And they need to take pictures of your injuries, so we can\u2019t clean you up just yet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019d rather get it over with anyway.\u201d I smiled gamely and then winced. \u201cOuch. Shit, that hurts,\u201d I admitted before placing my palm against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I left you alone tonight. I should have been with you.\u201d His face twisted with anguish.</p><p>My heart ached for his self-inflicted guilt. \u201cJack, I should be able to walk through a neighborhood without getting beat up and robbed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if I hadn\u2019t gone early. If I\u2019d been there...\u201d His head rested on my lap and he clasped his arms around my back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t there,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I could never live with the guilt if you got hurt because of me.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced at my admission. \u201cKitten, I\u2019d break my fucking pitching arm if it meant keeping you safe.\u201d</p><p>My heart jumped inside my chest. \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t say things you don\u2019t mean.\u201d I gave him a pained wink, reminding him about my list.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d he said confidently before a knock on the front door interrupted our exchange. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. Sit tight.\u201d He kissed my forehead and I watched him walk out of my room.</p><p>My phone beeped, alerting me to a text message. Melissa. Oh my God, are you okay? Dean just called me. I\u2019m coming back.</p><p>Don\u2019t come back. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll call you after I talk to the police, I responded, knowing she\u2019d be sick with worry.</p><p>The police? What the hell? Call me as soon as you can. I\u2019m freaking out!!!!!!!!</p><p>Her text made me laugh. I think it was all the exclamation points. Or the fact that I could hear her voice whenever I read her words. Either way, I typed out another response. Call you soon. Don\u2019t freak. Jack\u2019s here.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kitten?\u201d Jack peered into my room, his hand gripping the edge of the door. \u201cThe police are here.\u201d</p><p>I tossed my cell phone on the bed before pushing my body off. Two uniformed police officers were waiting for me when I walked into the living room. One held a notepad while the other gripped a camera that caught my gaze and reminded me of what I\u2019d lost.</p><p>That asshole stole my camera.</p><p>I no longer own a camera.</p><p>I\u2019m camera-less.</p><p>Tears started to roll down my cheeks as I blinked in vain to stop them. Jack rushed to my side and gathered me close, wiping them away tenderly with his thumb. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he stole my camera.\u201d I closed my eyes tightly as the drops continued to fall, feeling like a hole was opening in the pit of my stomach.</p><p>\u201cWe really need to get your statement, miss,\u201d one of the officers prompted.</p><p>I sniffed once and looked up, swiping at the moisture under my eyes. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour brother already told us what happened, but we\u2019d like you to corroborate his story. He also said that more happened once he left the scene and we\u2019ll need you to give us those details as well. Okay?\u201d the officer asked, while reading from his notepad.</p><p>I looked at Jack with confusion before looking back at the officer. \u201cMy brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Um, Dean Carter? He said he was Cassie Andrews\u2019s brother,\u201d the officer noted.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s he doing? Is he okay?\u201d My concern for Dean instigated a rush of questions.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need stitches but has a nasty cut on his head, not to mention a raging headache. It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to have him seen by a doctor,\u201d the other officer chimed in.</p><p>I looked at Jack and he waved his hand to calm me down. They read Dean\u2019s statement out loud and I agreed with his account, noticing as Jack clenched his jaw. I reached down for his hand and squeezed it tightly in mine. I filled in the blanks from when Brett carried Dean away until I walked to Cole, watching again as Jack cringed and the veins in his neck bulged. Seeing him in pain caused an ache to form inside my chest. But I\u2019ll admit I liked the fact that he was so pissed off about the whole thing. I\u2019d never felt more safe or protected in my life.</p><p>The officers asked me simple questions that I had already answered and nothing stumped me until the last one. \u201cCan you give us any idea of what the perp looks like? Would you be able to identify him in a lineup?\u201d</p><p>My gaze flashed to Jack, and I shifted uneasily in my seat. \u201cI could identify his shoes. And maybe his fist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll I saw were his black and white shoes. And his knuckles. He was standing with the sun behind him and I never saw his face.\u201d My body shook and Jack released my hand as he stood up and started to pace.</p><p>\u201cAre we almost done?\u201d Jack asked defensively.</p><p>\u201cAlmost.\u201d The officer\u2019s voice was a little terse before it softened when he turned to me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cassie, but we have to take some pictures of your injuries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d I sighed and then stood up to move in front of the white living room wall. The officer took pictures of my face at varying angles, while I kept my eyes locked on Jack\u2019s, refusing to let go of the comfort he brought me.</p><p>When the police officers left, Jack walked me into the bathroom where I caught a glimpse of my reflection for the first time that evening.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so weird.\u201d I leaned toward the mirror, touching the green and purple bruise on my brow before moving to the similar one forming on my forehead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even hurt where the bruises are,\u201d I noted, mesmerized by the unfamiliar face staring back at me.</p><p>Jack\u2019s forehead creased. \u201cWhere do you hurt?\u201d he asked, the pain in his eyes evident.</p><p>\u201cMy cheeks and jaw.\u201d I touched them gingerly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go get you some ice and ibuprofen. They\u2019ll help with the pain and swelling.\u201d He grabbed my hand, turning me toward him. \u201cIf I ever find this guy, I\u2019m going to fucking kill him for putting his hands on you.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, my heart breaking. \u201cI just want my camera back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said before looking away.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack?\u201d I stopped him. \u201cWhy did Dean say he was my brother?\u201d I asked, suddenly remembering what the officer had said.</p><p>Jack shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I can only guess that he thought he was doing you a favor. Or protecting you somehow. Why?\u201d</p> <p>I smiled and quickly winced with the pain. \u201cI just liked it, was all.\u201d</p><p>His dimples flashed in his cheeks as his lips turned upward. \u201cOh yeah? And why\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI liked the way it sounded.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t know it was possible, but I watched as his dimples deepened as his smile grew. \u201cSo did I, Kitten. So did I.\u201d He walked out and my heart stammered with his confession.</p><p>Jack\u2019s cell phone rang and it reminded me that I still needed to call Melissa. I walked toward my bed and reached for my cell as Jack leaned in, his hand covering his phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if Dean stays here tonight, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. I was just gonna tell you to call him. I\u2019m gonna call Melissa real quick,\u201d I told him, relieved that Dean was coming over.</p> <p>He removed his hand from covering the phone before bringing it up to his ear. \u201cShe says it\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t think so. Hold on, I\u2019ll double-check.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me again. \u201cWe don\u2019t need anything, right?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cNope, just get him over here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe says no. She won\u2019t care. Make sure Gran knows we\u2019re both staying here before you leave. Okay, see you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t care about what?\u201d I asked as soon as he hung up.</p><p>\u201cIf he stays here all weekend,\u201d Jack said before straightening his stance.</p><p>\u201cOh. Not at all. I sort of want him here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, really? Trading me in already?\u201d He winked at me and I laughed.</p> <p>\u201cOuch. Don\u2019t make me laugh, it hurts.\u201d I grabbed my cheeks with both hands. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I want to be around him \u2019cause he was there. He knows how I feel because he experienced it too. Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes sense to me, Kitten,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><p>\u201cI really need to call Melissa before she shows back up here.\u201d I started to press buttons on my phone and Jack turned away, closing my bedroom door as he left.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Cassie! What happened? What is going on? And what took you so long to call me back? I\u2019m freaking out here!\u201d Melissa yelled into the phone.</p><p>\u201cSorry, it\u2019s been a crazy night.\u201d I held the phone away from my face, taking care to not press it against my cheek like I normally would.</p><p>\u201cIs Dean okay? Is Jack there? What happened?\u201d Her questions shot out rapid-fire.</p><p>\u201cWe were walking to the softball game to see Jack and we got jumped. Some guy stole my camera, beat me up, broke a forty-ounce bottle over Dean\u2019s head\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Cass, he stole your camera?\u201d I could hear the sorrow in Melissa\u2019s question as she interrupted me, and her compassion for my loss affected me more than I expected.</p><p>I struggled to even out my breathing as I swallowed hard. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I know you\u2019re more upset about that than anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know me well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay? I mean, where did he hit you? Did Jack freak?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack\u2019s pretty...\u201d I paused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Jack is. Pissed? Sad? Angry? He\u2019s all over the place. Oh, but hey, I think Dean\u2019s gonna stay here this weekend. Do you mind if he sleeps in your bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Just tell him no funny business in there. I don\u2019t want to come back to sheets I have to crack in half or anything.\u201d Melissa laughed at her own joke.</p><p>\u201cYou are so gross.\u201d I chuckled, trying not to scrunch my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she responded proudly. Her tone changed as she asked, \u201cHow\u2019s Dean? Is he going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently he\u2019s going to be fine. He must have a pretty hard head,\u201d I joked.</p><p>Melissa was quiet for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re both alright.\u201d</p><p>Before I could respond, there was a knock on my door and it opened slowly. \u201cKitten, Dean\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Melis, Dean just got here and I really wanna go see him. Can I call you later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, you go. Tell the boys I said hi and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re staying with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will. Love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove you more,\u201d she said before hanging up, and I tossed the device onto to my mattress.</p><p>I emerged from my bedroom and locked eyes with Dean as Jack stood beside him. My eyes instantly watered up at the sight of him. \u201cDean! Are you okay?\u201d I said, my voice frantic. I ran to him, locking my arms around his back and squeezing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. How are you? Are you okay?\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cYou have no idea how scary it was to see you hurt like that.\u201d I tried to shake the images from my mind that I was certain were seared there forever.</p><p>\u201cYou have no idea how horrible it was to see some guy hitting you,\u201d he replied, his voice rising in anger.</p><p>\u201cCan we not talk about that right now?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice sounded angry and I was grateful for the subject change.</p><p>I let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m just happy you\u2019re okay. Does your head hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike a bitch,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cBefore I forget, Melis said you could stay in her room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well I was going to stay in there even if she said I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s okay if I take a shower, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. There\u2019s a shower in Meli\u2019s room. She has extra towels under the sink.\u201d As I spoke, Jack reached for my hand and pulled me toward the couch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be out here when you\u2019re done,\u201d Jack said, before sitting down and pulling me onto his lap. \u201cI\u2019m going crazy inside right now, Kitten. I feel like I\u2019m losing my fucking goddamned mind. I\u2019m not going to practice this weekend. I won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d He leaned his head against my chest and I ran my fingers through his hair.</p><p>\u201cJack, I love that you care so much about what happened to me, but you can\u2019t be by my side twenty-four hours a day. And you absolutely cannot skip practice this close to the draft. Are you out of your mind?\u201d</p><p>He glanced up at me, the pain evident in his narrowed eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to tell you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen you go to practice, Dean will stay here with me. I won\u2019t be alone, okay?\u201d I prayed my suggestion would ease his worry.</p><p>He let out a long, exasperated breath. \u201cOkay. He\u2019s the only one I trust anyway...\u201d His voice trailed off. \u201cWe\u2019ll take shifts.\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes, but he didn\u2019t notice. \u201cYou have to get past this, Jack. You can\u2019t take it upon yourself to be my personal bodyguard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll drive me insane,\u201d I snapped, my voice harsher than I intended. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll break up with you.\u201d</p><p>Jack\u2019s head snapped around as he glared at me with shock and surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want a babysitter. I don\u2019t want a bodyguard. I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, Jack, but I don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019m in a fucking cage.\u201d</p><p>He slid my body from his lap and turned to face me, his forehead creased. \u201cCass, just give me some time to deal with this, okay? It just happened and I feel like I\u2019m losing my goddamn mind.\u201d He cringed as he continued. \u201cDo you know what it feels like to want to beat the shit out of four of your teammates? Four guys I\u2019m supposed to respect and trust. Four guys I trusted completely before tonight.\u201d</p><p>I watched as his face twisted with his pain, my heart aching. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you not to be mad at them, Jack. I don\u2019t know why they ran and left me there. I\u2019m sort of conflicted about all that. It did happen really fast, though, I can tell you that. It\u2019s like one minute the guy was with me, then with Dean, then back at me.\u201d I closed my eyes, my head shaking.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it. You might be conflicted in regards to them, but I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>Dean walked into the room, a towel wrapped around his waist. \u201cRemind me that it\u2019s really going to fucking hurt next time I try to wash my hair.\u201d He smirked. Dean\u2019s ability to bounce back so quickly after what happened amazed me and gave me hope.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really tired. I\u2019m gonna go to bed, okay? Love you both,\u201d I said before pushing myself from the couch.</p><p>\u201cSo much for our weekend alone, huh?\u201d Jack offered me a slight smile.</p><p>I looked at Dean before responding. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. This is better anyway.\u201d</p><p>TWELVE</p><p>JACK</p><p>The fact that some stranger had beaten up Kitten and stolen her camera drove me out of my fucking mind. It had been three weeks and her bruises had faded, but my anger hadn\u2019t. I never told her, but I cruised up and down that street every day, sometimes before and after baseball practice, looking for the asshole that had touched her. He was lucky I hadn\u2019t found him yet.</p><p>I also looked everywhere for her camera. I searched online, went to local pawnshops, but it didn\u2019t show up. I wanted justice for her...vengeance, really. But more importantly, I wanted to be the one to deliver it. And every day that I was denied that, my anger toward my cowardly teammates grew. I hadn\u2019t talked to any of the ones who were there that night, my temper flaring out of control whenever one of them was near.</p><p>I walked into the locker room and changed into my practice uniform in silence. \u201cCarter!\u201d Coach Davies shouted from his office. I glanced up and our eyes met. \u201cGet in here,\u201d he demanded before turning his back to me. Coach was a good baseball player, but he was an even better man. He was the reason I chose Fullton State over the other schools. I wanted to play ball for someone I respected, and I respected Coach Davies.</p><p>I slammed my locker door shut and hustled into Coach\u2019s office. \u201cShut the door.\u201d He motioned before leaning back in his swivel chair. \u201cCome sit.\u201d</p><p>I sat in the old wooden chair, my mind racing before he spoke. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on between you and your teammates. I heard something about your girlfriend getting beat up and I\u2019m really sorry about that, but your team is your family and you need to work it out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo disrespect, Coach, but my family wouldn\u2019t let my girlfriend get the shit beat out of her while they ran away and hid.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Coach frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jack, what did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour of your guys left her there alone. Brett took care of Dean, but everyone else bailed on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho does that?\u201d His voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you who. My teammates. My so-called family. My brothers. I can\u2019t even look at them, let alone pretend like I respect them.\u201d I threw my hands up in the air, my voice disgusted. \u201cCoach, it takes all of my willpower every single day to not beat the shit out of them. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d I looked down.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know the details, Jack. I\u2019ll take care of it on my end, but you have to promise me you\u2019ll work it out on yours. I can\u2019t have my team falling apart at the end of the season. And you need to keep your focus.\u201d He leaned toward me, his concern genuine.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m focused. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I attempted to reassure him, but I could see he wasn\u2019t buying it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t quit on me, Carter. Don\u2019t quit on this team. Don\u2019t quit on yourself.\u201d His frown deepened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in my nature, Coach. I don\u2019t quit.\u201d And I meant it.</p><p>\u201cAlright, get on out there then. Tell Coach Smith I want to talk to the boys before practice starts.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d I answered before scooting the chair back.</p><p>The entire team sat in the dugout waiting for Coach. Since this wasn\u2019t our standard protocol, the guys were nervously trying to figure out what was up. I remained on one end of the long bench, while Brett, Cole, Matt, and Ryan sat on the other.</p><p>\u201cAlright, gentlemen, listen up.\u201d Coach appeared on the field and was immediately greeted with silence. \u201cI know there was an incident that happened off school property with a few of our players. I didn\u2019t realize how bad the situation was. I didn\u2019t know what happened. But I know now.\u201d His stern gaze landed briefly on each player sitting on the bench as he continued. \u201cAnd let me tell you, I\u2019m not just molding you gentlemen into great baseball players here...I\u2019m trying to mold you into great men. And great men don\u2019t run away from a fight. Great men don\u2019t leave a girl alone to fend for herself.\u201d</p><p>He looked at Coach Smith before letting out a long huff of air. \u201cThere will come a time in your life when you lose something that matters to you. You\u2019ll fight for it and you won\u2019t win. But what really matters isn\u2019t the war you\u2019re waging, it\u2019s that you don\u2019t lose the person you are in the midst of the battle. You boys lost yourselves that night.</p><p>\u201cAnd I know that some of you are real pissed off about what happened. Some of you are angry, hurt, embarrassed, shocked, and whatever other girly emotion your mommies tell you to get in touch with,\u201d he mimicked with a slight snarl. \u201cI want you to take those feelings and use them on the field. Put it all out there and then leave it there. Don\u2019t take those emotions home with you at night where they can eat you up inside and rot your soul. This time we have together goes by in a blink of an eye. It\u2019s a special thing. Don\u2019t let anyone take it from you.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Coach turned around and walked out of the dugout and down the field toward the locker room entrance. The silence was deafening as no one moved a muscle or made a sound. I hated being mad at my teammates, but the events of that night twisted me up so fiercely inside, it was hard to ignore. Forgiving them for what happened to Kitten felt almost impossible, even though they asked for it on a daily basis. I didn\u2019t know how to move past the anger. The truth was, I wasn\u2019t sure how to forgive them.</p> <p>\u201cYou heard the Coach. Work it out, gentlemen. Let\u2019s finish off our season as not only teammates, but friends. Pitchers and catchers in the bullpen. Everyone else on the field.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCoach Smith?\u201d I said loud enough that it stopped the rest of the team from leaving.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I have a minute with Brett, Cole, Matt, and Ryan?\u201d I asked, meeting the gaze of each of them as I said their names.</p><p>\u201cFive minutes, then get your asses on the field.\u201d He turned. \u201cEveryone else out. Now!\u201d he shouted and the dugout cleared.</p><p>The guys sat there, unease written all across their faces. I could tell they weren\u2019t sure what I was about to do or say. And I\u2019ll admit I liked that they didn\u2019t know what I was capable of. Matt had called me a loose cannon once before and I happily wore the nickname with honor, even though he insisted it wasn\u2019t a compliment.</p><p>\u201cCoach is right. We can\u2019t end the season like this.\u201d I shook my head. \u201cI can\u2019t leave here hating you guys. This anger I have, it eats me up inside,\u201d I admitted. \u201cI just need to know what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Jack. Personally, I panicked,\u201d Matt confessed, his eyebrows drawing together. \u201cAll I thought about was getting Jamie out of there. I didn\u2019t even think about Cassie. I know it\u2019s fucked up, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p> <p>I tried to fight the resentment that welled inside my gut. I clenched my fists before unclenching them. \u201cI appreciate your honesty, Matt.\u201d My teeth ground together as I forced my tone to stay even.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry too, man. He said he had a gun and I took off. All I could think about was how I couldn\u2019t outrun a bullet. I left Cassie there and watched from a safe distance as she got the crap beat out of her,\u201d Ryan said as he looked at the ground.</p><p>My heart raced with his words as heat began rising in my cheeks. Ryan noticed the anger spreading across my face and quickly continued. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one who has to live with that, Jack. I have to live with the fact that when the shit hit the fan, I went running. I let a girl get beat up and I did nothing about it. You might know how it feels to be you, but you have no idea how it feels to be me right now. I let you down. I let Cassie down. I let myself down. And I think about it every single day.\u201d</p><p>My breathing steadied as his words sank in. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say. Just know that I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Ryan added.</p><p>I nodded before looking at Cole and Brett. \u201cWhen Dean fell, you should have seen it. He was just lying there on the ground and my gut instinct was to get him out of there. Cassie was still standing and I figured that one of the other guys would get her. But Dean wasn\u2019t even moving.\u201d Brett shuddered with the memory.</p><p>\u201cThank you for taking care of him. I appreciate it.\u201d I half smiled at Brett. \u201cCan I ask you guys a favor?\u201d It wasn\u2019t really a question and they all answered yes in unison.</p><p>\u201cIf you see the guy who did it, you call me immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve looked for him every day,\u201d Cole admitted. \u201cI drive around looking for him \u2019cause I saw his face. I\u2019d recognize him for sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really like to find him.\u201d My eyes narrowed as I imagined beating this animal to a bloody pulp.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can go after practice? See what we can find?\u201d Matt offered with a shrug.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d Brett raised his hand.</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d Ryan noted with a grin.</p><p>\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d I was relieved at their willingness to help, and felt some of the anger trickle away.</p><p>Coach Smith poked his head into the dugout. \u201cIf you ladies are done with the warm and fuzzies, I\u2019d like you to get your asses on the field with your team.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComing, Coach.\u201d I spoke for the group and we filed out.</p><p>We all knew we\u2019d probably never find the guy, but this was their way of trying to right a wrong. And I needed that from them to help work past my anger and disappointment.</p><p>We walked the streets after practice looking for him, until my phone rang one evening during the middle of our nightly ritual. \u201cHold up, guys, it\u2019s Dean,\u201d I yelled toward my scattered teammates.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey got him.\u201d Dean\u2019s voice sounded solid and relieved.</p><p>\u201cThe guy?\u201d My chest immediately tightened.</p><p>\u201cThey caught him trying to pawn Cassie\u2019s camera. He\u2019s in jail. I have to head down there to identify him.\u201d</p><p>My head spun as anger, relief, and fury all coursed through me at once. \u201cCan I get her camera for her? Do you want me to come with you? I should probably come with you.\u201d My voice changed as my emotions settled on anger and making the coward pay for ever putting his hands on my girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll find out about the camera when I get there, but I think it\u2019s evidence now, so she still can\u2019t have it back.\u201d Dean sounded sympathetic before his tone turned stern. \u201cI\u2019m in the police parking lot now, so I\u2019ll just head in and identify him. You should go tell Cassie they got him.\u201d</p><p>I made eye contact with each one of my teammates, who now surrounded me, and attempted to rein in my temper. I ended the call before addressing the group. \u201cThey got him. He tried to pawn Cassie\u2019s camera and they arrested him. Dean\u2019s at the police station now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll head down there. I got a good look at the guy too, so I can help,\u201d Brett added quickly, and took off running before waiting for a response.</p><p>\u201cYou alright?\u201d Matt placed his arm on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIn all honesty, I kind of wanted to be the one to find him.\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI wanted to introduce his face to the pavement,\u201d I added, and they all howled with laughter.</p><p>\u201cI bet you did,\u201d Cole said with a wince.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s probably good you didn\u2019t, Jack. Knowing you, you would have killed the guy. You can\u2019t play professional baseball from jail,\u201d Ryan offered, his tone grave.</p><p>\u201cI could start a jail baseball league. I\u2019m very resourceful,\u201d I suggested.</p><p>Matt ignored my sick humor. \u201cIt\u2019s good they got him. This is a good thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Plus, Cass would never forgive me if I went to jail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr broke your hand,\u201d Cole chipped in.</p><p>I frowned at Cole and snapped, \u201cWho invited you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying!\u201d he defended.</p><p>\u201cNah, you\u2019re right. She\u2019d be pissed if I broke my hand.\u201d I sighed heavily, feeling the intensity of my anger dissipating. \u201cI\u2019d better go tell her the news. Thanks for coming out with me, guys.\u201d</p><p>I shook hands with each of them as the damage between us slowly healed. We walked toward our cars as a group before dispersing. I\u2019m sure it looked like a scene out of Swingers, that old movie where people drove around the corner because no one walked anywhere.</p><p>I found Cassie sitting on her bed, so engrossed in whatever she was reading that she hadn\u2019t noticed me standing in her doorway. It was moments like these where I could stare at her for hours. I watched as her eyes scanned the words on the page, her forehead creasing and her eyes narrowing with her emotions. I cleared my throat and she looked up.</p><p>\u201cJack! How long have you been standing there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot long.\u201d I smiled and moved next to her bed.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming over. Is everything okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just talked to Dean and they found the guy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her eyes widened as she carefully marked her page, closed her book, and set it down beside her. \u201cThey caught him?\u201d</p><p>I sat facing her. \u201cHe tried to sell your camera to a pawnshop. They have regulations to check if things are stolen goods or not. The shop called the police and they arrested him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God. Well, that\u2019s good. Do they have my camera? Can I get it back?\u201d Her eyes lit up with hope.</p><p>I reached out my hand and felt her relax with my touch. \u201cSorry, Kitten. The police have it as evidence. It has to stay there until the sentencing is done.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow long does that take?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can take months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonths?\u201d she repeated, her voice filled with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d And I was. Seeing her disappointed, hurt, and sad practically killed me. I repositioned myself next to her before resting my arm on her leg.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d Cassie tried to smile, but it looked pretty halfhearted.</p> <p>\u201cDean positively identified him. So did Brett. He\u2019ll most likely be charged with assault and battery and grand theft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she breathed out, interrupting my download from Dean. \u201cIs there going to be a trial? Am I going to have to testify?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was getting to that.\u201d I leaned over, planting a kiss on her cheek. \u201cHe pleaded \u2018no contest,\u2019 so there won\u2019t be a trial.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cWhat does \u2018no contest\u2019 mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s basically saying he did it, without saying he did it. He waives his right to a trial because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll get off if it goes to a jury. But the other thing about pleading no contest is he can\u2019t be sued for any damages he caused and his sentence will most likely be less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess? How is that fair?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a pussy. He took the easiest and best way out for him.\u201d</p><p>I watched as the confusion cleared from her eyes before she leaned her head against my shoulder. \u201cSo, no trial. You\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d I answered.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you pissed off? Or angry?\u201d</p><p>Her head lifted and she turned to eye me. \u201cI can\u2019t change what\u2019s already done. I just want my camera back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I just want to kill him,\u201d I said seriously and she chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s be happy they caught him. I didn\u2019t think they ever would.\u201d Cassie\u2019s voice sounded more relaxed, and I sighed in relief.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I am happy they caught him. Now I know where to go to kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, stop it.\u201d She playfully swatted at my hand.</p><p>I winked at her and she rolled her eyes. \u201cI won\u2019t ever let anyone touch you like that again, Kitten. It won\u2019t happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. But we have to move forward, okay? Put it behind us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine,\u201d I begrudgingly agreed as she nuzzled into me and I realized that he didn\u2019t matter anymore. I had everything that truly mattered right here in my arms.</p><p>THIRTEEN</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>My eyes opened slowly and I rubbed at them, resisting the urge to close them and go right back to sleep. Today was the big day for Jack. I heard my cell phone beep its soft reminder tone and I reached for it. A text message.</p><p>Morning, Kitten. Are you up? Can\u2019t wait to see you.</p><p>I noted the time. Six forty-three a.m. That was over an hour ago. I typed out a response letting him know I was awake and pressed Send. My phone immediately rang. \u201cHi,\u201d I answered wearily.</p><p>\u201cWhen can I come get you?\u201d Jack\u2019s voice sounded chipper.</p><p>\u201cGood morning to you too,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming over in half an hour. Be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! I\u2019m still in bed and I need to eat and shower and get ready.\u201d It was still early and I couldn\u2019t help the little whine that crept out in my voice.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say we had to leave in half an hour, just that I was coming over. Plus,\u201d he paused, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d</p><p>My pulse skittered. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA present. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d He laughed before hanging up.</p><p>I jumped out of bed and threw open my door in search of Melissa. \u201cThank God you\u2019re already awake!\u201d I shrieked at the sight of her eating cereal on the couch.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sleep in. You know this.\u201d She looked up from her cereal bowl and smiled.</p><p>\u201cUm, Jack will be here in half an hour. And he said he\u2019s bringing me a present.\u201d I cocked my head to one side and raised my eyebrows as I plopped down across from her. Melissa\u2019s lips parted as her smile spread all the way across her face.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, you know what it is! Tell me!\u201d I shouted at my best friend.</p><p>\u201cNo way. I\u2019m not ruining that surprise.\u201d She shoveled another spoonful of cereal into her still grinning mouth.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not...\u201d I paused. \u201cHe\u2019s not...\u201d</p><p>Her face crinkled as she read my mind. \u201cNot what? Proposing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not, right? I mean, we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this is fun.\u201d Melissa was enjoying teasing me way too much, and I resisted the urge to reach across the table and strangle the truth out of her.</p><p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d I grumbled. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like I think he\u2019s going to, but it did pop into my head. Probably because he\u2019s leaving soon, and I\u2019m a girl and...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a ring,\u201d she confessed begrudgingly. \u201cBut what if it was? Oooh, what would you say if Jack asked you to marry him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI seriously hate you. This isn\u2019t funny. I hate surprises.\u201d I stood up, rubbing my suddenly anxious stomach.</p><p>\u201cYou will love this. I promise. Trust me. Trust Jack,\u201d she said confidently. \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing. He has your best interests at heart. And that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that.\u201d</p><p>I released a deep breath. \u201cOkay. Thank you. I\u2019m gonna jump in the shower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fall,\u201d she shouted, mimicking her father\u2019s usual tired joke.</p><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d I yelled from my room.</p><p>After my shower, I wrapped a towel around me and opened my bathroom door, spotting Jack lying with his eyes closed on my bed. If he really was sleeping, I didn\u2019t want to wake him, so I quietly tiptoed past him toward my dresser. I shrieked when he jumped from the bed and grabbed me, forcing my towel to fall to the floor.</p><p>\u201cJack! You scared the crap out of me!\u201d I shouted as I reached for the wet clump of terrycloth.</p><p>Jack reached it first and snatched it away. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m giving this back. I like what I see too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d I whined, trying to cover my girly parts with my hands while he stared.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He extended his hand and when I grasped it, he pulled my dampened body on top of his. \u201cI love you. You know that?\u201d he asked, running his fingers through my wet and tangled hair.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. I looked deep into his eyes and smiled. His fingers ran down my spine, forcing chills to course through my already chilled body. He arched his head up, meeting my mouth with his before pulling my head down. My lower lip felt the graze of his tongue as it entered my mouth slowly, methodically. His tongue darted against mine before leaving and then returning in a sensual exchange. Every touch awoke parts of me until soon, my entire body was screaming out for him.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I breathed his name against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm,\u201d he responded as his tongue continued to titillate my senses.</p><p>\u201cDo we have time?\u201d I reached for the button of his shorts, hoping he\u2019d take the hint.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmm.\u201d He grabbed me firmly with one well-toned arm and propped us both up on the bed with the other.</p><p>When we were sitting up completely, he reached for the back of his shirt and pulled it over his head in one swift movement. I stared at the muscles in his chest and shoulders, fascinated by the way they flexed with any movement he made. I fumbled with the button on his shorts, trying desperately to get it open, but failing due to our position.</p><p>\u201cJust one sec,\u201d he said softly before sliding my body from his. I sat next to him as he kicked off his shorts and boxer briefs. \u201cYou can come back now.\u201d He smirked before lying on his back.</p><p>I leaned down to kiss his dimples before climbing back over. I positioned my body on top of his, my legs straddling his hips as I lifted my lower half and placed him inside of me. I allowed my body to lower gently, taking all of him in one motion. \u201cOh God,\u201d I moaned, feeling him reach places in me I\u2019d never felt before. I looked up at my ceiling as I continued to lift and rock my body over and over, feeling him deeper inside each time.</p><p>Jack groaned with pleasure as his hands clutched my hips, moving with my body. Up and down. Up and down. His grip tightened as his excitement grew, willing me to speed up my motion, but I refused. I wanted to make it last. I rose and fell, sounds escaping my lips more often than not.</p><p>I looked down at him and noticed his eyes fixated on my face. Or more specifically, they were focused on my mouth. I moaned once more, my lips parting and moving with each labored breath I took as he squeezed his eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you always feel so amazing?\u201d he asked, his hips thrusting upward against mine each time I fell.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d I breathed heavily as I bent over him, my body still rising and falling as I swept my tongue across his lips. This new angle caused him to reach different places inside of me and I unwittingly moaned once more, almost unable to take it.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Jack.\u201d I breathed his name, my hips pumping faster. His hands moved me forcefully at a swift pace as he let out a throaty growl. I threw my mouth against his, longing for the feel of his lips and tongue against mine. I ravaged his mouth, unable to get enough, my tongue desperate for a dance with his. And when the hot taste of his tongue finally met with mine, I sighed audibly as I felt the beginning of that rush of tingling that I\u2019d worked for.</p><p>As impossible as it seemed, I felt him grow larger inside of me as our movements hastened to their final pace. His eyes snapped shut and his face pinched together as he exploded inside of me with forceful thrusts. I shook with the joy it brought, my insides twitching and pulsing. Breathing rapidly, he opened his eyes and leaned shakily up to kiss me. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking sexy as hell. You know that?\u201d</p><p>I collapsed onto his sweaty chest, my thighs burning. I breathed heavily against him before removing our still attached parts from each other. I scurried into the bathroom and when I came back out, Jack was propped up on the bed with both elbows.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever getting dressed?\u201d I teased and he smiled.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He hooked his finger at me and I ambled toward him, slipping into a pair of underwear before sitting down in front of him.</p><p>He reached behind him and lifted a white box tied with a red bow. It was smaller than a shoebox, but bigger than a jewelry box. I had no clue what could possibly be inside.</p><p>\u201cOpen it,\u201d he insisted as nerves exploded throughout my system. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I pulled at the bow, watching as it released its grip on the box wrapped in white paper beneath it.

But...\u201d I shook my head reluctantly. \u201cI know how much this camera costs, Jack, and it\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> <p>His smile wavered as he asked, \u201cDo you remember the night your camera got stolen?\u201d His jaw tensed as I nodded. \u201cDo you remember what I said to you?\u201d I shrugged. \u201cI said I\u2019d get you a new one. I promised. Besides, it could be months before the police release yours from evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Jack...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut nothing. Kitten, I\u2019m getting drafted today. By the end of the afternoon, I\u2019m going to have more money than I\u2019ve ever had in my life. I wanted to do something nice for you. And I made you a promise.\u201d His voice pleaded, desperate for my acceptance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pay you back,\u201d I offered, feeling the self-imposed weight subside.</p><p>\u201cConsider it an investment in your future.\u201d He reached for my face before tilting my chin toward him. \u201cI believe in you. You have a gift. You are so talented. Now you can show the world.\u201d</p> <p>Little tingles pricked the backs of my eyes with his words. \u201cSaying thank you doesn\u2019t seem like enough, but thank you, Jack. I can\u2019t believe you did this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d do anything for you,\u201d he said before pressing his lips against my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI got the internship,\u201d I told him softly.</p><p>His eyes lit up. \u201cYou did? I knew you\u2019d get it! What\u2019d they say? I mean, when they said you got it, what were their reasons?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey said I had real raw talent that impressed them. \u2018A beautiful eye and a unique perspective,\u2019\u201d I quoted, my eyes burning with unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cThey have no idea how right they are. Congrats, babe!\u201d He lifted me off the bed and swung me around the room in his arms.</p> <p>\u201cI was going to have to turn them down because I didn\u2019t have a camera anymore,\u201d I admitted as one tear escaped. \u201cBut now I can accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can just call me your hero if you want,\u201d he taunted, placing my feet back on the ground.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so irritating.\u201d I sniffed back the tears and pretended to snarl at him and he laughed heartily.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just playing. I\u2019m proud of you. You deserve it.\u201d He kissed the side of my head. \u201cHey, bring it with you today. Gramps said he wants to see it in action.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love him,\u201d I said with a laugh, imagining Gramps limping around with a giant-sized professional camera.</p><p>\u201cAnd I love you. Now hurry up, \u2019cause we need to get to the house before the cameras do.\u201d He pushed me and smacked my behind.</p><p>I tumbled forward before gaining my balance. I turned toward my handsome boyfriend and said, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, you know? I\u2019m excited for you today.\u201d</p><p>His eyes brightened. \u201cThanks, Kitten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d I asked, realizing he never expressed any fear when it came to this subject.</p><p>\u201cNot really. I\u2019d be nervous if I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not I was getting drafted, you know what I mean? If I had to sit there and wait to find out if they were going to crush my dreams or let me hold on to them a little bit longer. Those are the guys who have it rough. Not me.\u201d His eyes held mine in a serious gaze.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re one of the lucky ones?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not worried about anything? The money, where you\u2019ll be playing, or what team you\u2019ll get on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be getting paid to play baseball. Paid...to play...a sport I love. I don\u2019t care about the team, how much they pay me, or where I have to go to play it. I just want to do this for as long as they let me,\u201d he answered, flashing the dimples on his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cWell, I think they\u2019re the lucky ones,\u201d I explained, \u201cwhatever team drafts you. They\u2019re lucky to have you.\u201d</p><p>He avoided my gaze as his cheeks flushed with color. \u201cThanks, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I slipped into some white dress shorts paired with an off-the-shoulder tan sweater. I brushed my hair, letting the golden strands fall down around my shoulders. When I stepped back from the mirror, Jack whistled. \u201cKitten, the whole world is going to be in love with you after this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? I\u2019m in shorts and a sweater,\u201d I argued, looking down at my attire.</p><p>\u201cYou clearly don\u2019t see the way yourself the way guys do. If I was watching ESPN today, I wouldn\u2019t care at all about Jack Carter. I\u2019d want to know everything about Jack Carter\u2019s girlfriend.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks warm. \u201cShut up. You\u2019re totally embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should stay here. It\u2019s one thing to have half the school in love with you, but I don\u2019t think I can handle half the viewing population wanting my girl.\u201d He sniffed, running his hand through his black hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled one long breath before shaking his head with his exhale. \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to put a huge rock on your finger before I leave so everyone knows you\u2019re unavailable.\u201d</p><p>My pulse quickened. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy about you,\u201d he said, waggling his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cNo, I think you\u2019re just crazy.\u201d I laughed as I willed my heart to calm down.</p><p>Jack led me through the screen door, his fingers intertwined tightly with mine. \u201cGran? Gramps? We\u2019re here!\u201d he shouted into the house.</p><p>I looked around as Gran walked from the entryway in the kitchen wearing a light blue floral dress, a short string of pearls resting at her throat. Gramps followed behind her, dressed in carefully pressed brown dress slacks and a tan button-down shirt.</p><p>\u201cYou two look so nice!\u201d I squealed.</p><p>\u201cSo do you, dear. Come here and give me a hug.\u201d Gramps shuffled toward me with a smile.</p><p>I hugged him and he whispered in my ear, \u201cDid you like your present?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did! It\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t wait to show it to you later,\u201d I said with a large smile.</p><p>Gramps clasped his hands together. \u201cOh good! I want to learn all about it.\u201d</p><p>Gran reached for me and I leaned down toward her to give her a squeeze. \u201cYou look lovely, dear. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here,\u201d she said happily.</p><p>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m happy to be here.\u201d My heart squeezed with love as I watched Gran meander back into the kitchen, humming happily.</p><p>\u201cHave you heard anything about that internship yet?\u201d Gramps asked, his wrinkled face looking hopeful.</p><p>\u201cI got it!\u201d I shouted, then winced a little at how overexcited my voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, dear. Oh, that\u2019s just great news.\u201d Gramps beamed at me with a wide smile.</p><p>\u201cYou got the internship, sis?\u201d Dean\u2019s voice cut through the noise in the room as he appeared, rubbing his tired eyes.</p><p>\u201cI just found out. I wasn\u2019t going to take it, but now I can.\u201d I shot a thankful glance toward Jack before finding myself wrapped in Dean\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations. That\u2019s awesome.\u201d Dean caught me up in a tight bear hug, then released me with a proud smile.</p><p>A quick rap at the door reminded us all why we were gathered there in the first place. Jack pulled the curtain back and peered toward the porch. \u201cIt\u2019s just Marc and Ryan.\u201d</p><p>He opened the front door for his two well-dressed agents, who sauntered in with their hands filled with paperwork, a bottle of champagne, and a box of baseballs. \u201cHow you feeling, champ?\u201d the taller of the two asked Jack.</p><p>\u201cGood, thanks,\u201d Jack responded confidently, reaching out his hand to help carry the load.</p><p>\u201cHey, Dean. How you doing?\u201d Dean smiled at the men as they playfully boxed in the living room, almost dropping their things.</p><p>I resisted the urge to pull my brand new camera out of my bag and shoot the interaction. The taller man stopped as he noticed me and walked in my direction, his arm outstretched. \u201cYou must be Cassie,\u201d he said before shaking my hand.</p><p>I smiled and nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Marc and this is my partner in crime, Ryan.\u201d He gestured toward the other gentleman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you,\u201d I responded politely.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you too. Jack, you held back on how good-looking your girl is.\u201d Ryan winked at Jack with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cSettle down. I haven\u2019t signed any agreements with you two yet.\u201d Jack smirked before wrapping his arm around my waist and pressing me against him.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun!\u201d I wiggled my shoulders with excitement, then leaned into Jack\u2019s hard chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, you like this, do you?\u201d He dropped his arm and started to tickle my side.</p><p>I screamed and ran away, pretending to hide behind Dean for protection. \u201cSave me, Dean,\u201d I shouted, grabbing his arms and cowering as he moved his body to block me from Jack\u2019s playful attack.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Gran\u2019s voice echoed into the living room before she popped her head in. \u201cOh dear, stop it! Come sit at the table...that esspen will be here any minute now!\u201d</p><p>I laughed at Gran\u2019s pronunciation of ESPN. She said it like it was a word, instead of separate letters. No matter how many times everyone told her it was E, S, P, N, she still insisted on pronouncing it ESS-pen.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay, Gran?\u201d Jack dropped a kiss on the top of her head before enveloping her frail frame in his strong arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a little anxious is all,\u201d she admitted, her voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be great, isn\u2019t it, fellas?\u201d Jack narrowed his eyes toward his soon-to-be agents.</p><p>\u201cOf course it is,\u201d Ryan reassured.</p><p>\u201cThis whole thing is nerve-wracking,\u201d Gran declared. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you nervous?\u201d she asked her grandson, and I watched the smile take over his face.</p><p>\u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing more I can do. I\u2019ve worked my ass off and I\u2019ve left it all out on that field every day for years.\u201d He shrugged one shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s out of my hands at this point.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks scrunched as she beamed with pride. \u201cHow\u2019d you get so smart?\u201d She cupped his face with both hands and planted a kiss on each cheek.</p><p>\u201cI learned it from you. Now come sit with us and relax.\u201d He led her by the hand toward the kitchen table when the chime of the doorbell stopped them. \u201cYou sit, Gran. I\u2019ll let them in,\u201d Jack told her sweetly.</p><p>The chatter of voices filtered from the open front door and into the kitchen where we all sat waiting. Jack walked in followed by two cameramen, a reporter, and a producer. They discussed how things would work\u2014that we would basically be filmed waiting for the phone to ring and for Jack to get his offer. They would film the reaction when the call came, and then interview Jack and possibly us after. And they kept reminding us not to look at the cameras and to act natural. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed and all eyes turned to me. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s not natural to have huge cameras following your every move and filming your private expressions. I\u2019m a lot more comfortable behind the lens than I am in front of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s a little weird. Just do your best to pretend that the cameras aren\u2019t here,\u201d the director told me.</p><p>We sat around the kitchen table making small talk while the cameras filmed mere feet from us. Waiting for a phone call to come was nerve-wracking enough, but being filmed while you were waiting was a completely different experience entirely.</p><p>I jumped when the phone clanged to life, the sound startling me and waking up my dormant emotions. Fear suddenly ripped through my body, followed quickly by nerves, and then elation. My stomach twisted as Jack walked toward the old yellow rotary phone.</p> <p>\u201cHello?\u201d His eyes scanned each of our faces, but never the camera. \u201cSpeaking.\u201d A huge grin spread across his face making the dimples I loved even deeper. \u201cThank you so much. Yes, sir. I\u2019ll be in touch. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He slammed down the phone before turning toward us. \u201cArizona!\u201d he shouted and everyone cheered, including me. I wasn\u2019t sure why we were cheering, but I screamed and clapped along. \u201cI\u2019m a Diamondback!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBonus amount?\u201d Marc asked, leaning his elbows against the table.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d Jack said before walking over to his Gran and kissing her cheek. Then he squeezed Gramps and Dean before leaning down to kiss my mouth and I instantly forgot we were surrounded by cameras and strangers.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations, babe. I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d I looked into his soft brown eyes and noticed the peace there.</p> <p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered into my ear before pressing his lips against my neck.</p><p>\u201cCarter, come on. Do we have to call these guys back and negotiate or what?\u201d Ryan interjected in a vain attempt to get Jack\u2019s attention.</p><p>\u201cThey said five,\u201d Jack answered with a smile, refusing to look away from my face.</p><p>\u201cYeah? Did they say five?\u201d Ryan\u2019s eyes lifted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, alright! How do you feel? Should we push?\u201d Marc asked as he scribbled notes furiously onto his pad.</p> <p>He turned. \u201cI think five is more than fair. I\u2019m happy with it,\u201d Jack acknowledged.</p><p>\u201cI know it sounds like a lot of money right now, Jack, but you\u2019ll lose half in taxes, we take our cut, and you won\u2019t be making much for the next few years in the minor leagues. We could probably get them to budge some,\u201d Marc suggested, still writing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy with it. I just want to play ball.\u201d Jack\u2019s tone was firm.</p><p>\u201cAlright then. We\u2019ll accept the deal as is. Congrats!\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled his chair next to me and tossed his arm low across my back. \u201cFive million isn\u2019t a bad signing bonus, right? Am I being na\u00efve?\u201d</p><p>I almost choked. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is? Five million dollars?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d He laughed, his eyebrows pulling in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I didn\u2019t think that. Holy shit, Jack, that\u2019s incredible.\u201d I was so stunned I had to remember to close my mouth since my jaw kept dropping open.</p> <p>\u201cI should sign, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I mean, have your lawyer look over the contracts, but of course you should sign! Why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I grabbed his face and pulled him to me before planting a loud kiss on his lips. \u201cYou\u2019re awesome. My baby\u2019s a Diamondback!\u201d</p><p>The reporter tossed Jack a Diamondback jersey and hat and asked him to put them on while they interviewed him for a piece to air later that day. I watched as he tossed the jersey over his black shirt, buttoning the top button before placing the cap firmly on his head and tucking the stray hair underneath.</p><p>\u201cHow do I look?\u201d he asked, modeling the crimson red jersey with D*Backs written on it.</p><p>\u201cLike a ball player,\u201d I responded with a smile.</p><p>\u201cLike a million bucks.\u201d Gramps punched the air.</p><p>Dean grinned. \u201cMore like five.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I get my camera? Are we allowed to take pictures?\u201d I asked, longing to use my new camera for this special moment.</p><p>The producer turned to me. \u201cAs soon as we stop rolling. Otherwise the shutter sound of your camera will filter into the sound bytes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I responded with a huge smile, turning my camera on and exploring its new features so I\u2019d be ready when it was time.</p><p>When the television crew cleared out, I grabbed Jack and his family and posed them in the backyard, under a giant oak tree. I took a few group family shots and then individual ones.</p><p>\u201cLet me take one of you and Jack, dear. Do you trust me to use your camera?\u201d Gramps asked with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOf course! Be careful, it\u2019s a lot heavier than it looks,\u201d I noted, handing him my weighty equipment.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is heavy.\u201d He carefully placed the camera strap around his neck.</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you have to look through it like a regular, old-fashioned camera.\u201d I paused, realizing that Gramps had probably never used anything but an old-fashioned camera.</p><p>I placed his index finger on top of a round, smooth knob. \u201cThen you press this button halfway down so that Jack and I come into focus. Once we\u2019re focused, you press it all the way down and you\u2019ll hear it click. And that\u2019s it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do that.\u201d Gramps gave me a confident nod and I scurried over to Jack\u2019s side.</p><p>I glanced sideways, taking in his new hat and jersey before wrapping my arm around his middle. He pulled me tight. \u201cThis is exciting, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstatement of the year.\u201d I shivered with excitement and grinned up at him.</p><p>We stood still for what felt like an eternity while Gramps maneuvered us and played with the camera. \u201cOh, Gramps, can we get one more with Dean?\u201d I looked at Dean and waved him over. \u201cI don\u2019t have any pictures of the three of us. I really want one. Or twelve,\u201d I said with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cThis is fun! I see why you like doing this, Cassie. You can\u2019t screw up because you can\u2019t run out of film.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool, huh?\u201d I asked, removing the camera from around his neck.</p><p>\u201cPretty cool indeed,\u201d he answered with a wink.</p><p>FOURTEEN</p><p>Jack left for Single-A ball a few days following the draft. Dean drove up north with him in his deathmobile, and then spent a few days there with him. It had been twenty-seven days since I last saw him, not that I was counting or anything.</p><p>He told me before he left that the minor leagues consisted of Single-A, Double-A, Triple-A, and then The Bigs, which was another word for the Big Leagues, the Majors, The Show. Although signed by the Diamondbacks, Jack would have to work his way up through a succession of teams that funneled players to the Diamondbacks, starting with Single-A.</p><p>The Diamondbacks\u2019 Single-A team was in a small town in Northern California and even though Jack didn\u2019t have to leave the state, he still had to leave where we lived in Southern California. The truth was that when it came to matters of the heart, distance was distance, no matter the number of miles. I was confused at first why he wasn\u2019t going to Arizona, but after Jack explained to me how it all worked, it made sense that he would be going to Northern California instead.</p><p>It was hard having him gone. I\u2019d become so used to Jack\u2019s physical presence that his absence was unavoidably felt and missed on a daily basis. I was thankful for e-mail, Facebook, and our cell phones, but nothing replaced his actually being here. It was weird too, being the one left behind. Jack moved, his life now filled with new experiences, friends, teammates, and adventures. But I was still here, doing the same things I did before he left, seeing the same people, living pretty much the same life.</p><p>Yeah. It was definitely weird being the one left to live in the memories of what used to be. Fortunately for me, I kept myself busy with my new summer internship. I\u2019d finally convinced my parents to let me bring my car to school for the summer, since I needed to drive to and from work five days a week. They agreed, but only with the understanding that once the fall semester started, my car had to return to its dust-collecting spot in the driveway.</p><p>Seriously? Who were these people claiming to be my parents? They felt like such strangers with whom I had absolutely nothing in common, least of all common sense.</p><p>My personal ringtone for Jack blared as I sat outside with my co-worker, Lesslie, watching the surfers during our lunch break. I fumbled through my purse looking for my phone, a smile plastered across my face. \u201cBabe!\u201d I shouted as soon as I answered.</p><p>\u201cKitten,\u201d his voice purred in response. \u201cI miss you so much. How\u2019s the internship?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s so freaking cool. I love it. I\u2019m learning so much.\u201d Seagulls cawed in the background as I pressed the phone closer to my ear so I could hear Jack better.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me all about it when you get up here.\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was upbeat, his excitement confusing me.</p><p>\u201cWhen I get...what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanna fly you up for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I shot Lesslie a glance.</p><p>\u201cYes, really. I\u2019m pitching on Saturday night and I want you to meet the guys. And I fucking miss you like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCheck with your boss to see if you can take Friday off. E-mail me and let me know what he says, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll ask as soon as I get back from lunch,\u201d I responded, suddenly not hungry anymore.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you oughta remind him that your boyfriend has a bit of a temper, so he probably shouldn\u2019t tell you no,\u201d he teased with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ll definitely make sure to threaten him. That stuff usually works on normal, sane people.\u201d I rolled my eyes, safe in the knowledge that he couldn\u2019t see me.</p><p>He laughed and I pictured his face in my mind. \u201cSeriously though, if he says no, I\u2019ll fly you out after work on Friday night or first thing Saturday morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay! Oh my gosh, I\u2019m so excited! Thanks, babe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too. Talk later, love you.\u201d I could hear Jack\u2019s smile in his voice as he said good-bye. I smiled back and dropped my hand holding the phone, before tilting my head toward Lesslie.</p><p>\u201cWas that your superstar boyfriend?\u201d she asked with a grin, her straight brown hair blowing in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh,\u201d I responded, my mind a million miles away as I thought about what to pack for the weekend.</p><p>\u201cSo what are you asking about after lunch?\u201d She elbowed my arm.</p><p>\u201cIf I can take Friday off or not. He wants to fly me up there for the weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Tom\u2019s not going to care. Offer to work a half day, and he\u2019ll tell you to take the whole thing off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Don\u2019t even stress about it,\u201d she said and I exhaled with relief. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of your boyfriend to fly you up. Most guys probably wouldn\u2019t want their girlfriends around, let alone pay to bring them there.\u201d</p><p>I stiffened. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t mean anything by it. It\u2019s just that I know that scene. And there are a lot of girls waiting in the wings to get in on that action,\u201d she said with a crooked smile.</p><p>\u201cThe groupies.\u201d I nodded my understanding.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She nodded back, frowning her disapproval.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve already dealt with my fair share of them at school. They\u2019re pretty brutal.\u201d I winced at the memory.</p> <p>\u201cAnd those girls are nothing compared to the ones who chase after the professional ball players. Consider the girls in college amateurs and strap your big girl pants on, \u2019cause you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201d She gave my shoulder a friendly squeeze.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d I asked, my thoughts drifting.</p><p>\u201cI used to photograph a minor league team in town. I saw a lot of things I wish I could un-see.\u201d She laughed with a shudder. \u201cI\u2019m just saying be careful. I\u2019m sure your boyfriend\u2019s a stand-up guy and all, it\u2019s just those girls definitely aren\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you definitely haven\u2019t met my boyfriend or you wouldn\u2019t describe him as a stand-up guy,\u201d I joked with a snicker, doing my best to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cWell, you have the right attitude. I\u2019m sure you two will be fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not really worried about it,\u201d I lied.</p><p>\u201cWe should head back in.\u201d She stood before reaching out her hand to help me up.</p><p>I headed down the escalator in the airport and saw Jack standing there holding a sign that read: Anyone seen my Kitten?</p><p>I laughed so loud when I read it, I scared the poor guy in front of me. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I whispered to the irritated stranger before quickly covering my mouth with my hand. I stepped off the moving stairs and ran into Jack\u2019s waiting arms.</p><p>I knew that I missed him, but being in his arms reminded me just how much. He tilted my chin and leaned down to kiss me. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he said with another kiss, his lips brushing against my ear.</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d I wrapped my arms around his body and squeezed, the sound of suitcases rolling past us.</p> <p>\u201cDo you like my sign?\u201d</p><p>My body let out a loud, quick ha that could wake up an entire building. \u201cIt\u2019s adorable. And hilarious,\u201d I answered, trying not to laugh but failing miserably.</p><p>He reached down, grabbing my carry-on bag with one arm and swinging it behind his shoulder. \u201cDo you have a suitcase?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust this.\u201d I smiled, pointing at the bag he carried.</p><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re my dream girl.\u201d He tossed his free arm around my shoulders and led me out of the airport.</p><p>I shivered when the cool morning air hit my body as we exited. \u201cHoly shit, it\u2019s cold up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. The weather\u2019s a little different than back home.\u201d He lifted an eyebrow as he led me across the street toward the first row of cars.</p><p>I scanned the area looking for the familiar white death trap when he clicked the unlock button on an unfamiliar black Acura. I stopped walking and tilted my head back. \u201cWhose car?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy roommate, Tyler\u2019s. He let me borrow it since I\u2019d knew you\u2019d freeze in mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d I said, moving into the chilly leather seat.</p><p>Jack slid his muscular frame into the car and turned to look at me. His face twisted into a sexy smile, his dimples appearing. \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>I felt my cheeks warm with his words. \u201cMe too. Thank you so much for flying me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGotta see my girl!\u201d he said with enthusiasm before the engine purred to life.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me about your new roommates and your place and stuff,\u201d I asked, even though he\u2019d told me a lot of those things before.</p><p>\u201cWell, you know we have a house that we rented. We each have our own room. The guys are Tyler, Nick, and Spencer. Tyler\u2019s girlfriend Amanda\u2019s in town too. You\u2019ll like her, she\u2019s cool. And you girls can go to the games together and stuff, so that worked out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat worked out?\u201d I asked, wanting clarification.</p><p>He glanced at me before looking back at the road. \u201cWell, I was sort of going crazy before I knew that Amanda would be here. I didn\u2019t want you going to the field by yourself. I\u2019m not sure if you know this or not, but I really fucking hate leaving you alone. Especially after what happened.\u201d His tone tightened with irritation.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I sympathized as I flashed back to the night of the beating.</p><p>\u201cI know I have issues. But I can\u2019t let something happen to you again.\u201d He exhaled through his nose. \u201cSo I was happy when Tyler told me that Amanda would be in town. Now you don\u2019t have to be alone.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and rested my hand on his thigh. \u201cSounds good.\u201d</p><p>Jack pulled the car into the driveway of a gorgeous two-story house. \u201cJack, this house looks brand new!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you it\u2019s only a few years old. The guy who owns it has like twelve properties or something. Wait \u2019til you see the backyard.\u201d His eyebrows lifted as he smirked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the backyard.\u201d I hinted at the many cell phone pictures he\u2019d sent me.</p><p>\u201cWell, wait \u2019til you see it in person.\u201d</p><p>I walked on the cobblestone pathway to the oversized front door and headed inside, where music blared in an empty room. \u201cJesus. Sorry, Kitten, I\u2019ll turn it down.\u201d Jack ran to the stereo and flipped the switch off.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d A rowdy voice yelled from a distance and I peered around the wall into the perfectly manicured backyard. Green trees, bushes, and plants surrounded the back side of the pool, making it appear lush and tropical. Earth-colored stones and matching boulders accented the area, bringing out the blue of the water.</p><p>One of Jack\u2019s roommates sat floating on a neon pink raft as another tumbled down the built-in slide. \u201cWow, you were right. It\u2019s much better in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you can\u2019t even see the hot tub from there,\u201d he whispered before running up the stairs. \u201cCome on, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>I followed Jack up before colliding with a girl I assumed was Tyler\u2019s girlfriend Amanda, knocking her twisted hair loose. I watched as the light brown strands fell from the once messy bun, into just...a mess. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! Are you okay?\u201d I asked as I helped her up.</p><p>\u201cYeah. You must be Cassie? I\u2019m Amanda,\u201d she said, grabbing and twisting her hair back into place.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d I smiled, my tone cordial.</p><p>\u201cYou too. Okay, I really have to go before I pee my pants.\u201d She laughed, ran into the bathroom, and slammed the door shut.</p><p>The thought of going to my first professional baseball game alone didn\u2019t really appeal to me, so I was thankful Amanda was in town. We arrived at the field, parked, and headed toward the Will Call ticket booth. I gripped my camera tightly as we walked to our seats next to the visitors\u2019 dugout.</p><p>The stadium was much larger than the one at Fullton State, but the crowd was similar. There were a lot of families with kids and a ton of girls. When our team was announced, the crowd went wild. And when they broadcasted Tyler\u2019s name, groups of girls screamed and some stood up, showing their jerseys with his number on the back.</p><p>It was nothing I hadn\u2019t seen or heard before. I glanced at Amanda, noting the discomfort on her face as she fidgeted in her seat.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked, nudging her arm.</p><p>Her hazel eyes glanced around the stadium before returning to mine. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fan-girls here.\u201d I nodded. \u201cI\u2019m not really used to this,\u201d she admitted as she crossed her legs.</p><p>\u201cWhich part?\u201d I asked, finding it hard to imagine that this scene was completely new to her.</p><p>\u201cThe girls, mostly. The crazy screaming like that for Tyler. The jerseys with his number. I hate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? It wasn\u2019t like that for him in college?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNot even close. Was it like that for Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah.\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cWow. You\u2019re much braver than I am.\u201d She swallowed.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just talking to Tyler about this last night. I think it takes a certain kind of person to date a professional athlete. I don\u2019t think just any girl could do it.\u201d She paused, glancing toward the field. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m cut out for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d I reassured her as I put my arm around her shoulder. \u201cYou can do it. You love Tyler, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, but it\u2019s not about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes it is. It\u2019s about exactly that.\u201d I smiled at Amanda and she gave me an obviously forced smile in return. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want these other girls. He wants you. You have to remember that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, pressing her shoulder into mine. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>The game wasn\u2019t nearly as entertaining when Jack wasn\u2019t pitching, but it did give me time to photograph other players and things. I took a lot of pictures of Jack\u2019s roommates, knowing full well how much the guys tend to enjoy photos of themselves playing. I even snuck in a couple of Amanda on my way back from the bathroom. Her fingers were intertwined and twisted in a weird way as she pressed them against her lips, staring intently toward the field. I framed her fingers and her mouth in one shot, the focus of her eyes in another, and then her whole body language in a third. She looked so uncomfortable and unhappy.</p><p>When the game ended, Amanda and I walked down a ramp that led us underground toward the locker room. The walls were cement and kept the air chilled in the breezeway where we stood, waiting for our boyfriends to emerge. I glanced at the others waiting\u2014some younger girls like myself and other folks a bit older that I assumed were parents\u2014and resisted the urge to walk over and introduce myself. I wasn\u2019t sure why, but instead of being friendly, I stood with my arms crossed over my body. The steel gray door flung open with a bang as Jack walked out grinning.</p><p>I smiled at the sight of him, his chocolate-brown eyes holding my gaze. He kissed my cheek and grabbed my hand. \u201cTyler\u2019s almost done. We\u2019ll see you at home, \u2019K?\u201d he informed Amanda, leading me away from her.</p><p>We walked hand in hand down a long cement corridor before Jack pushed against the metal release bar of the outer door. Once outside, we found ourselves surrounded by squealing girls. They stared at Jack, then at me, then back to Jack. A few asked for his autograph, while others asked for something else entirely. This is exactly what Lesslie from work had warned me about.</p><p>\u201cHey, Jack, call me,\u201d a blonde-haired floozy said, shoving a piece of paper into Jack\u2019s free hand.</p><p>I snarled, offended at this girl\u2019s incredible behavior. \u201cReally?\u201d I said to her bitterly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right here,\u201d I bit back, my jaw clenching.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t always be standing right there.\u201d She smirked and Jack gripped my hand, knowing I was about to lose it.</p><p>\u201cYou disrespectful little\u2014\u201d I started to shout, trying to wrench my hand free as Jack\u2019s grip tightened and interrupted me. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCassie, don\u2019t.\u201d Jack shook his head and swallowed hard before turning toward the blonde. \u201cYou dropped this,\u201d he said, crumbling her number up into a little ball before flicking it past her.</p><p>I choked back a laugh as he pulled me toward his car. There were scraps of paper scattered on the front seat and envelopes under his windshield wipers. \u201cWhat is all this?\u201d I asked, reaching for the papers.</p><p>\u201cPhone numbers, mostly. Some pictures too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d My eyes widened as I leaned into the seat.</p> <p>He scooped up the loose papers, grabbed the envelopes from under the wipers, and placed them all in a stack on his lap. He turned the key and the engine roared its familiar sound. We drove a few feet before he hopped out and tossed the stack of papers into a blue garbage bin.</p><p>\u201cDoes this happen every night?\u201d The surprise in my voice still lingered.</p><p>\u201cPretty much.\u201d He leaned his head toward my face before reaching across the seat and pulling my mouth to his.</p><p>We drove the short distance from the stadium to his house and Jack hopped out before opening my door for me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to socialize tonight, okay? I just want to go straight upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack, jeez.\u201d I smacked his arm.</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean because of that. I just want to spend time alone with you. I hate not seeing you every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too,\u201d I admitted, partially relieved.</p><p>The noise of the housemates filtered through the front door and they erupted in cheers as we walked through. \u201cHey, guys. Sorry, we\u2019re going to hit the sack,\u201d Jack informed them with a wink.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t go to bed yet! Come on, Jack,\u201d Nick shouted before he chugged a beer.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see you ladies tomorrow.\u201d Jack laughed and slung an arm over my shoulders.</p><p>\u201cGoodnight, you guys,\u201d I said with a shrug before heading up the carpeted stairs.</p> <p>We shared the same space in the bathroom as we got ready for bed. I washed my face, brushed my teeth, and quickly changed into a tank top and boxer shorts as Jack stripped down before hopping into the shower.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go get in bed, okay?\u201d I called out into the steam-filled air.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be a minute,\u201d he responded, his wet face peering from around the white shower curtain. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at him before leaning toward him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA kiss.\u201d He puckered his lips together, beads of water falling from them as I leaned in, pressing my mouth to his.</p><p>\u201cUgh, you\u2019re all wet.\u201d I pulled away, wiping the water from my lips.</p><p>\u201cSee you in a minute.\u201d He disappeared behind the curtain.</p><p>I shut the door to Jack\u2019s room and hopped into bed, noticing the framed picture of the two of us from the day he got drafted sitting on his nightstand. I reached for it, running my fingers across the glass as he walked in.</p> <p>\u201cI love this picture.\u201d I smiled up at him before placing the picture frame back on his nightstand.</p><p>\u201cMe too. It\u2019s one of my favorites,\u201d he admitted, his voice sincere.</p><p>\u201cI had an interesting talk with Amanda tonight,\u201d I noted as he slid his well-defined body into bed next to me.</p><p>\u201cYeah? What about?\u201d He threw his arm around me and pulled my head against his chest.</p><p>\u201cShe just said she thinks it takes a certain kind of girl to date you guys. And she wasn\u2019t sure if she could handle it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Well that would suck for Tyler, but she\u2019s not wrong.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in his abs tightened as he twisted down to look at me. I pushed my body up and sat, angled toward him. \u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt takes a certain kind of girl to date any athlete,\u201d he started to say. \u201cMost girls can\u2019t handle the stress of it. It\u2019s hard to deal with other girls throwing themselves at your man constantly. But you\u2019re already used to that.\u201d He winked and I smacked his shoulder, rolling my eyes.</p><p>\u201cKitten.\u201d He pointed at me, his voice rumbling before he continued. \u201cAnd a lot of girls can\u2019t handle the amount of travel we have to do. We\u2019re gone a lot and even when we\u2019re home, we\u2019re not really home. Baseball is our job so it\u2019s our number one priority. It has to be or we\u2019ll get cut from the team for someone younger, faster, or better than we are. The amount of dedication it takes is more than most girls can handle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never even thought about it like that before,\u201d I admitted, my eyes drifting past his face, landing on the earthy tone of his wall.</p><p>\u201cBecause you can handle it,\u201d he stated with confidence.</p><p>I tilted my head. \u201cYou\u2019re that sure, huh?\u201d</p><p>Jack frowned. \u201cAren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Tonight was sort of crazy with all the phone numbers and the girls waiting outside for you and stuff...\u201d My voice trailed off as he reached for my chin, tilting my face up.</p><p>\u201cI know it\u2019s not easy, but please remember that I\u2019ve been dealing with this craziness for a long time now. It\u2019s not new to me like it is with some of the other guys. They have fucking stars in their eyes when they walk out those stadium doors at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d</p><p>He huffed out a breath, as if surprised at my question. \u201cHonestly? All I\u2019m thinking about when I walk out those doors at night is how long it\u2019s gonna take me to get home so I can call my girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-uh.\u201d I shook my head and tried to hide a smile.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d He bent forward to kiss the side of my head before leaning back into his pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even tempted? At all? Some of those girls are really pretty.\u201d I hated like hell to admit that, knowing that Jack could hear the disbelief in my voice.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I be tempted by any of those girls when I have you?\u201d He grinned before his expression fell flat. \u201cWhat I should be worried about is someone stealing you away while I\u2019m out of the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh please, like anyone will even come near me. They know better, Jack. You trained every male on campus well.\u201d</p><p>He let out a loud hoot before smacking his palm against the bed. \u201cThat\u2019s fucking awesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re so pleased with yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know how shitty it would be if I had to worry about that kind of stuff? I want to go out of my mind right now just thinking about it.\u201d</p><p>I placed my hand on his thigh. \u201cThen don\u2019t. There\u2019s no point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re good, right? Me and you?\u201d His voice faltered slightly and I noticed the clouds forming in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d I longed to reassure whatever unpleasant thoughts were creeping into his mind.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re happy?\u201d His eyes tensed.</p><p>\u201cExtremely.\u201d I smiled at him.</p><p>He exhaled. \u201cYou\u2019re my game changer, you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGame changer?\u201d I shook my head, unsure of his meaning.</p><p>\u201cThe one girl who changes everything. The one you\u2019d give it all up for.\u201d He brushed his thumb down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to give anything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. But here\u2019s the thing about baseball, Kitten. There\u2019s an expiration date for every single one of us who plays and we all know it. Eventually my baseball career will come to an end, and I can live with that. But I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>I blinked back the tears forming in my eyes as I leaned into his chest, his warm arms wrapping around me. \u201cThe only time I feel safe is when I\u2019m with you,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cBecause you know I\u2019ll kill anyone who hurts you. Because I\u2019m a superhero,\u201d he said seriously, his fingers twisting locks of my hair.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re something, alright.\u201d I laughed into his bare chest, my eyes closing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m your something...\u201d His voice trailed off into a whisper as I drifted off.</p><p>I woke up the next morning to the sound of Jack\u2019s alarm beeping relentlessly. I shook Jack\u2019s shoulder and he grumbled before flipping over.</p><p>\u201cJack, get up. Turn it off,\u201d I whined.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes before slamming his palm down on top of the clock radio. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get up. I need sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get to pitch today,\u201d I reminded him, my voice groggy.</p><p>\u201cI get to sleep today.\u201d He laughed before grabbing me in his arms and squeezing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d I choked out sarcastically. \u201cI\u2019m dying. I can\u2019t breathe. Hello? Earth to Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClearly you\u2019re not dying if you\u2019re still flapping your gums.\u201d I wanted to smack him, his grin was so wicked.</p><p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>The rest of our weekend together consisted of two more baseball games, floating around the pool, and the constant reminder of how much we enjoyed being together. Jack\u2019s pitching was amazing during his outing on Saturday, which prompted rumors to spread that he\u2019d get moved up to Double-A soon. Which was fast, even by baseball standards.</p><p>When he dropped me off at the airport on Sunday evening, I cried. It was like saying good-bye to him for the first time all over again. Seeing him made it harder to be away, which was sort of fucked up, if you asked me.</p><p>\u201cI hate saying good-bye to you. It sucks.\u201d I buried my face against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too.\u201d He kissed the top of my head as his fingers caressed my back.</p><p>I pushed myself away from the protection of his arms. \u201cI\u2019ll call you as soon as I land, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better,\u201d he teased before cupping my face in his hands. \u201cI love you.\u201d His mouth pressed against mine as his tongue swept across my lips.</p><p>\u201cI love you too,\u201d I said, pulling away from him.</p><p>I shut the car door before walking through the sliding glass doors of the airport entrance. I headed toward the security checkpoint, thankful that it wasn\u2019t crowded. Once my bag and my body were cleared, I found my gate and plopped into an empty chair, the weekend\u2019s activities catching up to me. I yawned as my cell phone rang with Jack\u2019s song.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up, babe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassie,\u201d he shouted, the wind whipping through the air, forcing the reception to crackle. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSort of. Are you okay?\u201d I grabbed my bag and looked for a more private setting.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with Coach. They\u2019re pulling me up to Double-A. I leave for Alabama in two days!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, babe, that\u2019s amazing! Congratulations. I\u2019ve always wanted to see Alabama,\u201d I added, so happy for my guy.</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, I can\u2019t wait to fly you out.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI\u2019ve gotta call Dean and Gran. I just wanted to tell you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so glad you did. Congratulations again, babe. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kitten. Love you. Call me when you land.\u201d He hung up and I couldn\u2019t stop my face from grinning.</p><p>FIFTEEN </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>JACK</p><p>The state of Alabama welcomed me with open arms. That was the good news. The bad news was that the air there was so thick with humidity I thought I might choke. I\u2019d never experienced heat that felt almost solid in form, hitting you in the face when you stepped outside. But the people were friendly and the city boasted that small-town feel I thought only existed in movies.</p><p>All the shifting in the Diamondbacks organization caused a group of guys on my team to lose a roommate. This worked out perfectly for me, considering I was looking for some. I moved in right away, taking not only the other guy\u2019s room in the house, but his spot on the roster too.</p><p>I braced for resentment from the other players that would never come. Instead, I found myself playing with a group of extremely supportive guys. The competition was fierce, but this was still a team sport, no matter how you sliced it.</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d I said as Cassie picked up her phone.</p><p>\u201cHi, yourself,\u201d she said back, her voice making me smile. \u201cHow are you? How\u2019s the team?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good. The team is insane.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s just really fucking good.\u201d I sighed with contentment.</p> <p>\u201cLike better than your other team, or how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust in every way possible. It\u2019s a whole different level of ball.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou expected that though, right?\u201d Her voice suggested if I hadn\u2019t, I should have.</p><p>\u201cI guess I didn\u2019t really think about it. They\u2019re definitely better hitters and my pitches don\u2019t intimidate them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo pitch around their bats and make your pitches scary,\u201d she suggested with a giggle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying, Kitten.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJack, you\u2019re an incredible pitcher. You\u2019ll figure it out. This is all part of the process and in the end you\u2019ll be a better player for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019d you get so smart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably the second you left town.\u201d I could practically feel her eye-roll over the phone line.</p><p>\u201cBrat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gotta go, Jack. I\u2019m sorry but I get to sit in on a call with the New York offices! Yay!\u201d she screamed into the phone.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, babe. You go. I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d I chuckled, her excitement making me smile.</p><p>\u201cWait, Jack?\u201d she shouted and I fumbled.</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood luck tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks. Love you,\u201d I said before hanging up.</p><p>I took a deep breath as I kicked at the dirt mound beneath my cleats. The fans were all on their feet cheering, but I could barely hear anything above the sound of my own heart pumping adrenaline through my veins.</p><p>\u201cYou got this, Carter,\u201d I heard my shortstop shout. I glanced at him briefly, our eyes meeting in a hopeful exchange. The cheers grew louder when I stepped onto the mound. My catcher flashed signs between his legs and I nodded in agreement, then gripped the ball in my left hand, the baseball\u2019s string seams pressing against my fingertips. With another focused breath, I lifted my right leg into the air before delivering a piping hot fastball right down the middle.</p><p>The batter swung and I held my breath, hoping he wouldn\u2019t send that pitch into no man\u2019s land. The sound of the ball crashing against the catcher\u2019s glove echoed into the evening air, as the umpire screamed, \u201cStrike three! You\u2019re out!\u201d</p><p>The crowd erupted into cheers and rushed the field before my teammates lifted me on top of their shoulders. Cameras flashed from all around, the quick bursts of light blinding me briefly. Hands reached out from every angle, pulling and tugging at any exposed body part. Everyone wanted a piece of me.</p><p>I had just pitched my first perfect game in Double-A ball. The feeling you get when that happens is hard to describe. It\u2019s like an unbelievable high. I accomplished something that happens so rarely in the game of baseball. Not a single person from the other team got on base. I didn\u2019t walk one batter. No one was hit by a pitch. Just me and my boys on our field for nine straight innings. Tonight, we\u2019d be celebrating. And all I could think about was her.</p><p>I peeled myself away from the gaggle of fans and journalists and headed inside the locker room. \u201cI\u2019ll sign more after I shower,\u201d I shouted toward the group of people wanting my autograph.</p><p>I opened my locker, grabbed my cell phone, and dialed.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe!\u201d she answered, her tone excited and bubbly.</p><p>\u201cDid you hear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI watched the game online. Congratulations!\u201d She squealed as I pulled my cell phone from my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you, baby!\u201d</p><p>I leaned my head against the wall and closed my eyes, visualizing her gorgeous face. \u201cGod, I miss you,\u201d I breathed out with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cMe too. I wish I was there.\u201d Her quiet, wistful tone tugged at my heart.</p><p>\u201cI wish you were too. More than anything I wish you were celebrating this night with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Kitten. I should probably go. I\u2019ll call you later, okay?\u201d My teammates filed out of the showers, eyeing me and pointing at their wrists.</p><p>\u201cHave fun tonight. I love you,\u201d she said and I grinned.</p><p>\u201cI love you too. Night,\u201d I replied before shutting my phone off.</p><p>The local bar seemed packed to capacity by the time we sauntered in. I walked through the front door with two of my teammates and the entire bar broke out into hoots and shouting. Before I knew it, drinks and shots were being handed to me from all directions. I downed the first three shots without hesitation and held on tightly to a bottle of beer. I looked around to thank whoever sent them over, but the dim lighting made it virtually impossible to distinguish individual people in the thick crowd.</p><p>\u201cGreat game tonight, Jack,\u201d a petite brunette remarked as she grabbed my arm.</p><p>I looked at the hand touching me before removing it and placing it at her side. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>Her hand wrapped around my waist. \u201cThe name\u2019s Chrystle.\u201d</p><p>I removed her hand again more forcefully. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigured you\u2019d want to know,\u201d she said, inching her body closer to mine.</p><p>\u201cAnd why\u2019s that?\u201d I asked, laying on the bored tone I usually used to discourage groupies.</p><p>She got on her tippy toes and leaned closer. \u201c\u2019Cause you\u2019ll be screaming it later,\u201d she whispered in my ear with a smile.</p><p>\u201cNot a chance.\u201d I frowned and turned my back to her before wading through the crowd toward a table in the back.</p><p>I reached my excited teammates and quickly sat down. \u201cI\u2019m starving! Please tell me there\u2019s food here.\u201d My stomach growled on cue and I looked around, noticing the insane amount of tequila shots covering the tabletop.</p><p>\u201cHell yes, there\u2019s food! It\u2019s just not here yet. So drink up, man. That was a hell of a game tonight, Carter!\u201d My first baseman, Logan, slid a shot in my direction to celebrate.</p><p>The rest of the table erupted in similar congratulations and compliments, followed by high fives and knuckle-bumps, as we all grabbed a shot and drank a toast. I looked up from the table and noticed Chrystle eyeing me from the other end of the bar. She winked at me before taking a swig of her beer.</p><p>I elbowed Logan, who\u2019d played on this team the past two seasons. \u201cHey, man. Who\u2019s that chick at the end of the bar?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich chick?\u201d he asked with a chortle.</p><p>\u201cThe little brunette staring at us over there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Chrystle? She\u2019s basically a groupie on a mission. I\u2019d steer clear of her if I were you,\u201d he warned before downing another shot of the amber liquid.</p><p>\u201cTrust me. I\u2019m trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere. Drink these.\u201d He slid two shots over and I downed them one after the other, wincing after I swallowed. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely on her radar.\u201d He pointed at Chrystle engrossed in conversation with our head coach as both sets of eyes stared in our direction.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be on any chick\u2019s radar,\u201d I answered, my temper starting to rise.</p><p>\u201cWell, good luck with that. She\u2019s relentless, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve noticed.\u201d I glanced quickly toward her before looking away. The last thing I wanted this groupie to think was that I was the least bit interested in her.</p><p>Logan handed me two more shots and I drank them effortlessly the tequila no longer a shock to my system. \u201cI really need something to eat,\u201d I mentioned to no one in particular before noticing the basket of bread across the table.</p><p>\u201cCan I eat this?\u201d I asked, reaching for it.</p><p>My teammate, Vince, looked up from his cell phone. \u201cHuh? Oh yeah, Carter, here.\u201d He shoved the basket toward me. \u201cEat up, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I nodded before ripping apart the bread and shoving a huge piece in my mouth.</p><p>It was too late and I knew it. My attempt to put something in my stomach was feeble at best. It was too little, too late...the bread no match for the alcohol that already assaulted my system. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019d drank this much.</p><p>I elbowed Logan. \u201cWhere\u2019s the pisser?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, man?\u201d He turned to me, his eyes already showing signs of how wasted he was getting.</p><p>\u201cThe bathroom? Where?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cIn the far corner behind the jukebox.\u201d He pointed, his finger unsteady.</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I pushed away from the table and stumbled. Shit, I was already drunk. My eyes squinted toward the corner of the bar and my legs headed in that direction.</p><p>Not even ten steps in and Chrystle stood at my side. \u201cWhere you going, Jack? Can I come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I tried to sound as disinterested as I could muster.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that.\u201d She bit her bottom lip seductively and I suddenly noticed her tight-fitting top. She caught me staring. \u201cYou like what you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing I haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d She pressed her chest against my stomach and wrapped her arms around my lower back.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck off me,\u201d I shouted before shoving her away from me.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, Jack? I just want to make you feel good. Help you celebrate the big game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a girlfriend. Why don\u2019t you go celebrate with one of my single teammates. Or have you fucked them all already?\u201d My lips formed a snarl as I walked away, leaving her behind.</p><p>A few minutes later, I exited the bathroom, my face wet with the water I\u2019d splashed on it to help me feel less drunk. It didn\u2019t work. And Chrystle still stood there waiting for me.</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d she said with a grin before blocking my path with her petite frame.</p><p>\u201cWho gives a shit? Get out of my way.\u201d I stared blearily at her perfectly made-up face.</p><p>\u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d I shook my head, suddenly feeling woozy.</p><p>\u201cAt least let me buy you a drink?\u201d she offered and I narrowed my eyes, unsure of her intentions. \u201cCome on, Jack, it\u2019s just a drink.\u201d</p><p>I glanced toward Logan for backup, only to see him crashed face-down on the table. I laughed. \u201cFine. One drink.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When we reached the bar, I watched Chrystle lean across it, trying to catch the bartender\u2019s attention. The hem of her shirt rode up her back, revealing the tribal tattoo above her ass. I shook my head at the obvious clich\u00e9. Of course a chick like this would have a tramp stamp.</p><p>\u201cHey, Chase!\u201d she shouted at the surly bartender\u2019s back. He turned around, meeting her eyes with acknowledgement. \u201cTwo shots of whiskey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo no no,\u201d I yelled and Chase turned to eyeball me. \u201cNo more shots,\u201d I said, my vision hazy.</p><p>\u201cFine. Two Jack and Cokes,\u201d she shouted before turning to me. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d She nudged me with her elbow.</p> <p>\u201cBetter. I think,\u201d I offered up wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. Now tell me about this girlfriend of yours.\u201d She batted her thick-coated eyelashes sweetly.</p><p>\u201cI like to keep my private life, private,\u201d I slurred, feeling suddenly protective of my relationship with Cassie.</p><p>Chrystle looked around the crowded room before whispering, \u201cWell, she isn\u2019t here, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it look like she\u2019s here?\u201d I threw one hand in the air, glancing to my side.</p> <p>\u201cWhat she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her, and I\u2019m not going to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks for the drink.\u201d I grabbed the tall glass that had just appeared on the bar in front of me, before hightailing it away from her.</p><p>\u201cJack, wait! I was just kidding!\u201d she shouted, but I refused to stop. That girl was trouble and I was fucking hammered enough.</p><p>I heard her footsteps racing after me as I beelined straight for Logan. \u201cJack, wait!\u201d She grabbed my shirt with her free hand.</p><p>\u201cStop grabbing me. What the hell do you want?\u201d I spun to face her, my head feeling like it weighed a hundred pounds as the room spun around me.</p><p>\u201cI just want to hang out with you,\u201d she said, her voice innocent.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. You\u2019re not very good at accepting the word no,\u201d I spat, noticing the blue of her eyes.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>This isn\u2019t good.</p><p>I\u2019m drunk.</p><p>And she\u2019s hot.</p><p>\u201cYou can teach me,\u201d she teased, a playful smile spreading across her face.</p><p>\u201cChrystle. Leave me the fuck alone. I\u2019m gonna stop being nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is you being nice?\u201d She winked before slapping my ass and heading onto the dance floor.</p> <p>I hurried to the booth and scooted in. \u201cKeep that bitch away from me.\u201d Logan lifted his head in a daze as I elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI already told you to stay away from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s hard when she follows me everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stop going places. Sit still. Drink this,\u201d he said, before pushing another tequila-filled shot glass toward me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to get me drunk to take advantage of me,\u201d I joked.</p><p>\u201cShut up, dickhead. Drink.\u201d</p><p>I downed the shot quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to carry me out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit. You\u2019re going to have to carry me,\u201d Logan stuttered.</p><p>\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll let us sleep here.\u201d I laughed and pulled out my cell phone.</p><p>\u201cNo! No cell phones tonight, man. You just pitched a no-hitter! We\u2019re getting fucked up!\u201d Logan shouted before sliding my cell phone down the length of the table.</p><p>\u201cDick! Hey, Chance, gimme my phone, will you?\u201d I shouted toward my teammates on the other end.</p><p>Chance looked down, his eyes widened, and he pushed it forcefully. I watched as it practically flew and landed in my lap with a thud.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d Logan yelled, his eyelids half closed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just gonna text Cass, then I\u2019ll shut it off,\u201d I promised my drunk friend. I typed out the text as quickly as I could, which wasn\u2019t very quick considering how drunk I was.</p><p>I miss yo9 os fukkeng mucb. Wish u wede hefd.</p><p>I stared at the text message before pressing Send. I knew I\u2019d spelled words wrong, but I was too drunk to care about fixing it.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I felt this fucked up. My vision blurred, my head spun, my legs shook as I walked, and my defenses were definitely down on the floor somewhere with my good judgment. I spotted Chrystle on the dance floor and suddenly couldn\u2019t tear my eyes away from her tiny little body as she shook it. She watched me watching her and I knew I was in trouble.</p><p>Look away, you idiot.</p><p>Hot prickles shot through my body, but I ignored their warning, watching Chrystle grind her tight little body against another girl\u2019s. Her hips dipped and moved in perfect rhythm and I suddenly couldn\u2019t stop thinking about fucking her. If she moved like that on the dance floor...</p><p>The song changed and she ditched her dance partner and headed toward me. \u201cI knew you liked what you saw earlier. You were just playing hard to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t like it earlier, but I like it now.\u201d I slurred my words.</p><p>\u2019Cause I\u2019m fucking loaded and I can\u2019t think straight.</p><p>\u201cIs that right? Earlier you had a girlfriend.\u201d She toyed with me, pressing her sweaty body against mine as I instantly became aroused.</p><p>Cassie.</p><p>\u201cEarlier you didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t,\u201d she sassed before grinding her hips into me.</p><p>\u201cYou better stop doing that or it\u2019s gonna get you in trouble.\u201d</p><p>I want to give her some trouble.</p><p>Some good, hard trouble.</p><p>\u201cMaybe I wanna get into trouble?\u201d She turned her body around and pressed her ass against me before bending over to pick something up off the floor. \u201cI dropped this. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Me.</p><p>I grabbed her wrist and pulled her to me. When our bodies were pressed up against each other, she reached down and placed her hand on my zipper. \u201cTake me home, Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know this doesn\u2019t mean anything, right? It\u2019s just sex.\u201d Drunken truth spilled from my lips.</p><p>\u201cYou sure know how to romance a girl,\u201d she pouted as her bottom lip jutted out.</p><p>\u201cFucking isn\u2019t romantic. And that\u2019s all we\u2019re gonna do.\u201d I grabbed her hand and attempted to pull her toward the exit. \u201cYou can drive, right?\u201d I asked as I struggled to stay upright.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sober as a judge.\u201d She dangled her keys in the air.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means, but let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>She giggled as I followed behind her.</p><p>I rolled over, my head throbbing and my eyes refusing to open willingly. I thrashed my arm across the bed before hitting someone and I jumped.</p><p>\u201cStop, Jack. Let me sleep,\u201d a girl\u2019s voice spoke.</p><p>No, no, no, no, no, no.</p><p>This wasn\u2019t happening. I was going to turn and look at the other half of my bed and it was going to be empty. This was all going to be a bad dream. I squeezed my eyes before turning and opening them.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.</p><p>A head full of brown hair lay splayed across my pillow, a naked female body accompanying it. My stomach dropped to the carpet as I moved to sit on the edge of my bed. I threw my pounding head into my hands before looking down. I tugged and pulled at the recesses of my mind where the memories of last night were hiding. There\u2019s no way I did this. Maybe she came home with one of my roommates and needed a place to crash? I love Cassie. I love Cassie so goddammed much I\u2019d never do this to her.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>The memories started pouring in swiftly and unabashedly. I remembered. Now I wished I could forget.</p><p>I grabbed my cell phone and stood up before realizing I was naked. A pair of boxers and a sweatshirt later, I sat on the balcony in the early morning dew, dialing Cassie\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey, babe,\u201d she breathed tiredly into the phone.</p><p>I didn\u2019t know what to say so I stayed silent, knowing that these would be the last few moments that everything between us would be okay.</p><p>Hang up, you idiot.</p><p>Hang up the phone.</p><p>She\u2019ll never know what happened if you don\u2019t tell her.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d she asked. \u201cHello? Jack?\u201d She sounded so concerned. \u201cI can hear you breathing, dummy.\u201d She yawned into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d I muttered.</p><p>Too late to hang up now.</p><p>\u201cI wish you could see me roll my eyes,\u201d she responded with a chuckle.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good for you.\u201d My voice came out slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I still am, yeah.\u201d I tugged at my hair.</p><p>\u201cDid you drive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d I heard the smile in her voice. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>I can\u2019t do it.</p><p>I can\u2019t lose her.</p><p>Not over this.</p><p>Everyone makes mistakes.</p><p>\u201cYeah, Kitten. Sorry for calling so early. I just wanted you to know how much I love you.\u201d</p><p>I am such a pussy.</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d Her voice was perfect. She was perfect. I couldn\u2019t lose her.</p><p>My stomach balled into knots. \u201cGo back to bed. I love you. I\u2019ll call you later,\u201d I said, swallowing the baseball-sized lump in my throat.</p><p>She giggled. \u201cNight, Jack. Congratulations again on your perfect game. I\u2019m really proud of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, babe. Bye.\u201d I pressed End, squeezed my eyes shut, and buried my head in my hands, wishing I could bury the guilt instead.</p><p>How could I undo this? Cass couldn\u2019t ever know this happened. I\u2019d do anything to make sure of that. I vowed to never drink excessively again. I\u2019d never put myself in that kind of a position where I could willingly be so stupid. Anger quickly filtered through my pain as I remembered the girl sleeping in my bed. I stormed into my room before slamming the door shut with a loud bang.</p><p>\u201cGet the fuck up and get out,\u201d I shouted. She was on her stomach, sprawled spread-eagle over three-quarters of the bed. Still naked. Shit.</p><p>Chrystle moved slightly, her eyes opening to look at me. \u201cWhat? Why are you so angry?\u201d She whined and it made her even more annoying.</p><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d I reached across the bed, grabbing her by the forearm and pulling.</p><p>\u201cOw, Jack, jeez! I\u2019ll get up. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d She sat up, not bothering to pull up the sheet to cover her nakedness, and her eyes narrowed as she glared at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re my problem. Get out of my bedroom. Get out of my apartment. Get out of my life,\u201d I demanded, my attitude void of any respect or kindness.</p><p>\u201cYou sure weren\u2019t saying that last night,\u201d she commented coyly and my temper flared.</p><p>\u201cGet out or I will throw you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like foreplay.\u201d She bit her bottom lip suggestively and my stomach churned.</p><p>\u201cFor a twisted slut, maybe.\u201d I scowled darkly and flung venom-filled words designed to hurt her.</p><p>\u201cOh, so now I\u2019m a slut?\u201d She swung her legs over the side of the bed and began to wriggle back into her clothes from last night.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you were always a slut,\u201d I responded coolly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you sure as hell weren\u2019t complaining last night. And I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t complain again soon.\u201d Her confidence oozed through an arrogant smile. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSorry to disappoint you, but I don\u2019t fuck the same girl twice. Not really my style.\u201d In desperation, I went for my worst asshole tone of voice.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she said smugly before heading out my door and closing it behind her.</p><p>I tore the sheets from my bed and threw them in the corner, half tempted to light the damn things on fire. I opened the window as far as it would go, trying to air out the sick smell of sex from my room. Images of my idiocy replayed in my mind and I wished I could reach through my head and rip them from my skull.</p><p>I walked down the hall to turn the shower on, my reflection in the mirror forcing me to stop short. I turned to face myself, my bloodshot brown eyes staring back at me. I balled my hand into a fist and lunged toward the mirror, stopping just short of striking it.</p> <p>You idiot! You pitched a perfect game last night. A perfect game in baseball. And then you almost took your perfect relationship and flushed it down the toilet. This is your future, you asshole. Don\u2019t ever be that careless with your future again.</p><p>SIXTEEN</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>The last few weeks of summer flew by as the fall semester approached. The magazine extended my internship and I convinced my mom to let me keep the car, promising that I wouldn\u2019t use it to do anything crazy other than drive back and forth to the magazine offices. She was reluctant at first, but when I screamed that she was ruining my life, she relented. I\u2019d have to use that tactic more often.</p><p>Jack would be home shortly, depending on if his team made playoffs or not. I\u2019d fallen into a comfortable routine of working and reading while he\u2019d been away, surpassing my self-imposed goal of getting through twenty books in the summer. The Opportunist was my twenty-fifth and I was completely engrossed in the story, wishing the main character\u2019s mental anguish on no one...except maybe the sorority girls who enjoyed making my life hell.</p> <p>I walked through the door of our apartment and shouted Melissa\u2019s name. No response. I tossed my purse and car keys onto the counter before opening up the refrigerator door and grabbing a bottle of water. My cell phone rang, blaring Jack\u2019s song, and I sprinted to reach for it.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d I answered with a smile in my voice.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kitten.\u201d The flat tone of his voice caused unease to spread in my empty stomach.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d I asked, unprepared for what came next.</p><p>\u201cI fucked up, Cassie.\u201d He swallowed hard.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Are you okay?\u201d My stomach twisted as the ominous sound of his words settled in.</p> <p>\u201cI have to tell you something.\u201d His voice was so unnatural, it hardly sounded like Jack.</p><p>My body slid down onto the cold kitchen floor as I fought against the bile threatening to rise up into my throat. \u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d was all I managed to get out.</p><p>\u201cOh God. Okay.\u201d He took a quick breath. \u201cRemember the night a few weeks ago...\u201d he paused, \u201cthe night I pitched my perfect game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I responded, my lips barely moving.</p><p>\u201cRemember when I called really early and woke you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d My chest tightened and my stomach heaved.</p><p>\u201cI kept saying no, Cassie. I swear. I told her no at least a hundred times,\u201d he rambled, not really making any sense. \u201cI was mean as hell to her, but she didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, Jack?\u201d I couldn\u2019t stop the shaking in my voice.</p> <p>\u201cShe was just so fucking god damned persistent. She wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer and I was really fucked up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d My tone was harsh, the tears already welling in my eyes.</p><p>\u201cI called you that morning because I made a mistake and I wanted to tell you. I wanted to be honest with you, but then I heard your voice and I couldn\u2019t do it. I knew I\u2019d lose you and I wouldn\u2019t lose you for some girl who meant nothing.\u201d His voice trailed off into a whisper.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cI told you I\u2019d fuck screw up, Kitten. I ruin things,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to do that. Tell me what you did!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI slept with someone. I\u2019m so sorry. It didn\u2019t mean anything. I made a mistake. I just wanted it all to go away. I wanted her to go away.\u201d</p><p>My world spun around me at breakneck speed as my heart literally felt like it was shattering inside my chest.</p><p>\u201cCassie? Say something,\u201d he begged.</p><p>\u201cHow could you? Why?\u201d I shrieked through my sobs.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore?\u201d I froze. My head whirled, unsure of his meaning.</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d He breathed hard and I remained silent for a full minute before he finally continued. \u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He said it so low, my ears barely registered the sounds. But my shattered heart not only heard the words, it digested them, processed them, and promptly left the spot in my chest where it used to reside and fell to the ground at my feet and turned to dust.</p><p>\u201cAre you there, Kitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever call me that again,\u201d I whispered through my pain.</p><p>He breathed loudly into the phone. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to tell you what to do.\u201d Bitterness and resentment swept over me and carried over into my voice. As much as Jack hadn\u2019t sounded like himself earlier, I knew I didn\u2019t sound like myself now either.</p><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019d fuck up, but I never meant for this to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201c You don\u2019t get to do that. No. You don\u2019t get to blame this on anything other than your own inability to keep your dick in your pants. You got drunk. You brought another girl home with you and you slept with her. I deserve better than that.\u201d I ranted at him loudly, my voice catching.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right. You do,\u201d he agreed without argument.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well it was supposed to be you, Jack, because you are better than that.\u201d I was frozen in place, vibrating in shock as my future crashed around me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>It took everything in me to put my pride, feelings, and emotions aside and not hang up the phone. I didn\u2019t want to care that he was scared. I didn\u2019t want to care about anything other than my own breaking heart.</p><p>But I couldn\u2019t ignore his pain.</p><p>\u201cWhat is she going to do?\u201d I asked first, before the obvious tore through my mind like a tornado. \u201cHow did you get her pregnant?\u201d He huffed out a quick breath. \u201cI know how you got her pregnant, but, tell me you didn\u2019t, Jack. Tell me you didn\u2019t sleep with her without protection.\u201d</p><p>If I thought my heart couldn\u2019t break any more, I was wrong. Because that realization sent earthquake-sized cracks shooting through me with such ferocity, I thought I might pass out.</p><p>\u201cI was really drunk that night, Cassie. And I don\u2019t keep condoms anymore,\u201d he said weakly in his own defense.</p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. I couldn\u2019t. The pain of this was too much. Everything hurt so bad...even breathing. It was all a reminder that I was still alive and this nightmare was really happening.</p><p>\u201cShe wants to keep it, Cass. She wants to have the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d I asked sharply.</p><p>I heard him inhale before blowing the air out long and slow. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I could picture him in my mind. He was probably shaking his head, his brow furrowed. \u201cI mean, I just want to play baseball. I\u2019m not ready to be a dad. Especially not with this chick. But then again, I don\u2019t want to be the kind of dad that my father was. You know, absent. I\u2019m all mixed up inside and I don\u2019t know what the right thing is.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I couldn\u2019t listen to him talk about having a baby with another girl while I was so fiercely in love with him. \u201cJack, I can\u2019t be the one you talk to about this. I have to go.\u201d</p><p>I didn\u2019t wait for his response.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>I knew that if I waited for him to answer me, he\u2019d change my mind. I\u2019d stay on the phone with him for as long as he needed me to. And I couldn\u2019t be that for him. Not right now. Not with this.</p><p>I turned my phone off and stared blankly ahead, my thoughts all-consuming. I pictured him saying things to this girl that he said to me. Kissing her the way he kissed me. Touching her the way he touched me. The thoughts made my stomach churn as tears ran unchecked down my face.</p><p>My throat burned and I sprinted to the bathroom, losing today\u2019s lunch in the white bowl. I leaned against the bathtub, wiping beads of cold sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand. Made-up images crept into my subconscious, threatening to make me sick again unless I forced them away. I curled up into a ball on the shaggy bath mat and cried.</p><p>I never realized until the moment it disappeared how much I truly trusted Jack. It took seconds to annihilate the foundation we\u2019d worked so hard to build. In its place were piles of powder, jagged bits of concrete, and shards of my broken heart.</p><p>The front door slammed and I heard Melissa shout my name. When I didn\u2019t respond, she wandered through the apartment looking for me. Her brown curls fell against the wall as she peered around the bathroom door. Her eyes widened once she caught sight of me.</p><p>\u201cCass? Are you okay?\u201d The sound of her voice prompted more tears to fall. \u201cOh my God, what is it? What happened?\u201d</p><p>I tried to focus, but Melissa turned into a big blur of brown through my watering eyes. \u201cJack cheated on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? When? I\u2019ll fucking kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night he threw his perfect game. He said he got really drunk and this girl was really persistent and he gave in.\u201d I could barely say the words out loud. \u201cWhy would he give in?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Cause he\u2019s an asshole. And he\u2019s stupid. He\u2019s a stupid asshole.\u201d Melissa\u2019s eyes welled up.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s pregnant?\u201d she asked before releasing one of those surprised and horrifying gasps that just slip out uncontrollably. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish.\u201d I grabbed my stomach as it cramped once more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cassie. I can\u2019t believe this is happening.\u201d Melissa kneeled down and wrapped her arms around me, her warmth penetrating my chilled body. \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually. Just not right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Dean know?\u201d She leaned her head against mine.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, get up.\u201d Melissa stood and linked her arms with mine.</p><p>I shuddered. \u201cI\u2019m afraid to move too far away from the toilet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll grab you a trash can. You need to lie down.\u201d She carried the brunt of my weight on her tiny frame, practically falling with me once we reached my bed.</p><p>I crawled on top of my dark blue comforter and plopped my head on the pillow, Jack\u2019s voice replaying in my mind. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t sleep?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep, we\u2019ll figure it out. I bet you\u2019re more exhausted than you realize. You\u2019ve had a traumatic day,\u201d she said, her fingers brushing against my hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s been a little rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and sleep. I\u2019ll be in the living room if you need me.\u201d She leaned down to give me a half hug before leaving my room.</p><p>I crawled under the comforter and snuggled into my bed, wrapping my covers into a safe, warm cocoon around myself as I begged my body to shut down. Implored my mind to turn itself off. I knew I\u2019d only be able to find non-vomit-inducing peace in sleep.</p><p>Later, I opened my eyes to the sound of the alarm buzzing. I hit the snooze button before the reality of my situation crashed down all around me. That split second before I remembered was so peaceful, then it was gone. There would be no more peace for me today.</p> <p>I looked at my cell phone, half tempted to turn it on and throw it against the wall. I ignored it as I shoved out of bed to get dressed.</p><p>\u201cCass, you up?\u201d Melissa hollered from the other room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up.\u201d My voice was so hoarse from crying, I had to try twice to get the words out.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you just woke up.\u201d Melissa walked into my room, her concern for me apparent in her expression.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d I cleared my throat, longing for some warm tea with honey to ease the burning there.</p> <p>\u201cHave you heard from him at all?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI haven\u2019t turned my phone on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to. And you don\u2019t have to go to class either, you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sit here and cry all day,\u201d I whispered through my pain. \u201cI need a distraction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She gave me a quick squeeze before leaving me alone.</p><p>The next few days were a blur as I found it difficult to concentrate on anything other than my failed relationship. Classes were a great distraction...in theory. But the reality was that everything reminded me of Jack, and no matter how many lectures I heard on Visual Reporting or Comm Law, nothing held my attention with greater force than my own destructive mind.</p> <p>My phone stayed off until my mom called Melissa\u2019s cell phone, frantic that I was either kidnapped or dead since my phone kept going straight to voice mail. When I finally did turn it on, seven new voice mail notifications appeared. All seven were from my mom, each one increasing in overdramatized panic.</p><p>The blue text message envelope lingered at the top of my screen, begging for me to press it. Eight new text messages from Jack. Eight.</p><p>I am so sorry, Cass. Please tell me you know how sorry I am.</p><p>How did I screw us up this badly?</p><p>I love you. I love you so fucking much.</p><p>I feel like someone ripped out my heart and smashed it with bricks. It hurts. I hurt. And I\u2019d gladly take your hurt too if it meant that you\u2019d be okay. I\u2019d do anything for you.</p><p>Cassie, please respond to me. Tell me to fuck off. Anything! Your silence is more hurtful than your anger.</p><p>I deserve this. I deserve anything you want to do to me. I sure as hell don\u2019t deserve you.</p> <p>I\u2019m losing my fucking mind. I\u2019ve already lost my heart so I guess in a way that makes sense. I\u2019m so fucking lost without you.</p><p>I love you. I\u2019ll never stop loving you. And I\u2019m so sorry for everything. I\u2019ll never stop telling you how sorry I am.</p><p>But eventually he did stop.</p><p>It had been over two weeks since his last attempt to contact me. And as hard as it was to not respond to his texts, it was even harder to stop getting them. I wanted him to want me. I needed him to still need me. Because I was still so desperately in love with him, my heart ached with each beat it pumped.</p><p>Of course, Melissa knew. \u201cJesus, Cassie, you look like hell. When\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve eaten something other than toast? Or brushed your hair?\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d My voice was hollow, void of emotion.</p><p>\u201cYou need to eat, okay?\u201d Melissa cocked her head to the side, her expression soft.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich is exactly why you need to eat something,\u201d she responded, which made no sense to me at all.</p><p>Jack\u2019s name suddenly appeared on my cell phone. My body started to shake as my gaze swung around to meet Melissa\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cJack?\u201d she asked, her tone surprised. I nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t answer. Unless you want to. No, you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Melissa fought with herself as I pressed Decline, sending his call to voice mail.</p><p>He\u2019d stopped leaving voice mail messages around the same time he stopped texting. So I jerked my head back in surprise when the One new voice mail notification appeared on my screen.</p><p>I hesitated before pressing Send, tears already filling in my eyes.</p><p>His voice mail was short and to the point. \u201cI know you hate me and never want to talk to me again, but I really need to tell you something.\u201d He exhaled before whispering, \u201cKitten, please. I wouldn\u2019t call if it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d Then he hung up.</p><p>I still loved him no matter how hard I tried to pretend like I didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d Melissa asked.</p><p>\u201cHe asked me to call him. Said he had something he needs to tell me. As if I can take any more of Jack\u2019s news.\u201d I shook my head, the tears no longer hesitating to fall.</p><p>\u201cWell, shit. I wonder if Dean knows. Want to call him for the heads-up first?\u201d she suggested.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s actually brilliant, but I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll just call him and I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I gave her a half smile before heading into my bedroom and closing the door behind me.</p><p>I scrolled through the missed calls list on my phone and pressed on his name before touching the Send button.</p><p>\u201cYou called,\u201d he said as he answered.</p><p>\u201cYou said it was important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but I wanted you to hear this from me.\u201d Jack\u2019s voice was so flat it sounded robotic.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t take much more of this. My heart was so fractured already. \u201cWhat is it now, Jack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Chrystle to marry me.\u201d He choked on the words and I almost swallowed my tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou what? You\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d I instinctively looked at the calendar on my wall to make sure it wasn\u2019t April first.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>I let out the biggest, loudest, most sarcastic ha! I could manage. \u201cThe right thing to do? How is marrying someone you don\u2019t even know the right thing to do?\u201d My head spun as a dizzy feeling overwhelmed me.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be like my parents.\u201d His voice faltered. \u201cI have to be there for my kid.\u201d</p><p>My voice softened when I heard his pain. \u201cJack, you\u2019ll never be like your parents. But you don\u2019t have to marry some stranger to prove that.\u201d My lungs felt like they stopped functioning, and I forced myself to suck in a breath.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do,\u201d he repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou already said that.\u201d I started wondering who he was trying to convince. \u201cJack, no kid should grow up with two parents who don\u2019t love each other, let alone even know each other. This isn\u2019t right!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cass. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m such a fuck-up.\u201d He sniffed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a fuck-up, Jack. But please, don\u2019t do this.\u201d I begged for him to see reason. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a kid with someone, but it\u2019s another thing to marry them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already asked her,\u201d he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Jack, no,\u201d I said as the tears spilled. Breaking up was hard enough to deal with, but marrying someone else was truly putting the final nail in the coffin of us. \u201cHave you talked to Marc and Ryan?\u201d I asked through my desperation, assuming his agents would have the ability to talk logic into his clearly illogical mind.</p><p>\u201cI have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d I practically shouted. \u201cWhat did they say? I\u2019m sure they told you not to do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey pretty much said exactly that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJack. If everyone is telling you the same thing,\u201d my breath hitched, \u201cwe can\u2019t all be wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I refuse to continue the fucked-up cycle my parents started. We\u2019re getting married in two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks?\u201d I could barely say the words aloud.</p><p>\u201cChrystle doesn\u2019t want to be showing in the wedding pictures.\u201d</p><p>I hated her. Right when he made that statement, I felt pure hatred toward this strange girl. How was some random chick getting to marry the one guy I\u2019d loved in my entire life?</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t...call me that,\u201d I said, my breath shaking.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d His voice wavered. \u201cI never meant for this to happen. I never imagined marrying someone who wasn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>Resentment replaced the sadness coursing throughout my body. \u201cHow is that supposed to make me feel? Huh? You can\u2019t say that to me! It\u2019s not fair, Jack. I can barely get through the day without breaking down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Cassie, but you\u2019re not the only one hurting here. You\u2019re not the only one who has to try to make it through each day. I lost us too, ya know?\u201d</p><p>I felt the breath I was holding escape with a whoosh as I struggled for air. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never get over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t do this. Jack, please don\u2019t marry her,\u201d I pleaded, my voice breaking.</p><p>\u201cI have to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to!\u201d I screamed into the phone and he didn\u2019t respond.</p><p>Melissa barged into my room after hearing my raised voice, her face contorted in confusion and sympathy. I waved her over, not wanting her to leave, so she positioned herself next to me on the bed with her back leaning up against the wall.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d I asked him, squeezing my eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you until the day I stop breathing,\u201d he answered, his voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t how our story was supposed to go, Jack. We weren\u2019t supposed to end like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? Our story wasn\u2019t supposed to end at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess we\u2019re really over.\u201d I tried to accept the finality of it all.</p><p>\u201cIf I had the power to take it all back, I would. I\u2019d give anything to undo this.\u201d</p><p>I broke down. I bawled uncontrollably into the phone, my misfortune spilling out in teardrop form.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t cry, Kitten.\u201d His voice shook.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that any more. You don\u2019t get to call me that any more.\u201d I could barely speak for sobbing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. I should probably go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood...bye, Jack,\u201d I moaned before pressing End, not waiting to hear another word. I dropped my head into my hands, my tears soaking the comforter.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that? What\u2019s happening, Cassie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s getting married.\u201d I could barely choke the words out.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing what?\u201d she shouted, her face angry. \u201cWhy?!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe says it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m calling Dean.\u201d Melissa shot up from my bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No! Why?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause someone has to talk some sense into that idiot and it can\u2019t be you!\u201d She stomped out of my room.</p><p>My world went black and the next thing I knew, Dean was sitting at the foot of my bed, clearly uncomfortable with the way I carried on. Even with my face buried in my pillow, my muffled wails were loud enough to wake the dead. He tried to comfort me by patting my calves, and I turned my head to look at him before swatting his hands away.</p><p>\u201cSay something, Dean,\u201d Melissa insisted, jabbing at his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d he asked through clenched teeth.</p> <p>\u201cMake her feel better. Tell her you talked to Jack. Something!\u201d Her voice sounded so frantic.</p><p>I jerked my head up at the mention of his name. \u201cYou talked to Jack?\u201d I choked out, my chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He frowned.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s completely irrational. I can\u2019t talk any sense into him at all,\u201d he admitted, his voice frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about his agents? I mean, what good are they if let him go through with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey tried, trust me. I guess I should be thankful they got him to agree to a pre-nup,\u201d he said and lifted one shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThey did? That\u2019s good.\u201d I sniffed.</p><p>\u201cThey tried to get him to wait. They told him to get confirmation that the baby was his, but you know Jack,\u201d he said with a huff.</p><p>I nodded with understanding before allowing my head to fall back into my pillow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sis. I tried to tell him this was wrong. I tried to talk him out of it, but he won\u2019t listen. He\u2019s so stubborn and he\u2019s convinced himself that what he\u2019s doing is right.\u201d He tugged at his brown hair, his eyes closing.</p> <p>\u201cGran even tried to talk to him,\u201d he whispered, his eyes still tight.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What\u2019d she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told him that it doesn\u2019t take becoming someone\u2019s husband to become a good dad. She told him that one has nothing to do with the other. That being a dad was a choice. That anyone could father a child, but a real man chooses to be a dad. She told him that being a husband was something that should be reserved for the person you truly want to call your wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGran\u2019s good.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a slight smile, awed at Gran\u2019s wisdom.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say to that?\u201d Melissa chimed in.</p><p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to her, either.\u201d Dean\u2019s head shook and my smile faded. \u201cHe told her that his child wouldn\u2019t grow up in a broken home. That sometimes you have to be unselfish and compromise even if it\u2019s not what you want because it\u2019s not about you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no getting through to him. How are they doing?\u201d I asked, referring to Gran and Gramps.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both really sad. They\u2019re worried for him. And they\u2019re worried about you.\u201d The skin around his eyes pulled tight with his stress.</p> <p>I nodded, no words necessary.</p><p>\u201cHe loves you, Cassie. He doesn\u2019t give a shit about this girl, he\u2019s just so fucked messed up from our parents that he can\u2019t see reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel like you wouldn\u2019t do this though, and you both grew up in the same house.\u201d Melissa folded her arms across her stomach.</p><p>\u201cYeah, but he was older so he remembers things that I don\u2019t. He was the one who had to hold it together while our mom fell apart. He remembers the day our dad didn\u2019t come home. Honestly, he really lost it when Mom left. He was never the same after that and he\u2019s been fighting his demons ever since.\u201d</p><p>Dean shrugged, picking at the fabric of his shorts. \u201cI never thought he\u2019d let anyone in. We would fight like crazy about it until I realized there was no changing him. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that he didn\u2019t want someone to love him\u2014he just didn\u2019t want to risk loving them back.\u201d</p><p>He paused, exhaling through his nose. \u201cThen you showed up and everything changed. You changed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe changed me too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d Melissa added, her arms dropping to her side. \u201cShe never let anyone in either. I knew the night she saw Jack that something was different.\u201d Her blue eyes pierced into mine. \u201cI could literally see it. Watching the two of you interact, it was like watching fireworks light up the night sky. You two burn brighter when you\u2019re together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven fireworks burn out,\u201d I said, my voice solemn.</p><p>SEVENTEEN</p><p>The next few days were hell as the local newspapers and websites focused on the \u201cUpcoming Nuptials of Our Very Own Jack Carter!\u201d and \u201cHometown Hero Marrying Southern Sweetie!\u201d I couldn\u2019t escape the news. No matter what I did or where I went, his one night of screwing up was always right there, screaming in my face.</p><p>I stopped checking e-mails the day an anonymous person sent me a link that led to a picture of myself underneath a caption that read, \u201cThe girl Jack left behind. Why he\u2019s marrying someone else.\u201d</p><p>And I closed my Facebook account the moment after I logged in to see over a hundred and fifty messages from my so-called \u201cfriends,\u201d asking me if everything they were reading online was true or not.</p><p>If I didn\u2019t rely on my cell phone to communicate with my job and my parents, I would have shut it off as well. The texts alone were a nightmare. Each time one beeped, my heart jumped. Part of me wanted the messages to be from Jack, wanting to know how much he hurt, how sorry he was, and how he wished it had never happened. But the other part of me could barely stomach it. His words were like knives in a heart already overflowing with stab wounds.</p><p>My phone rang and I looked down to see Dani\u2013Trunk Mag flashing on the screen. I hadn\u2019t been to the offices at Trunk since the semester began. I pressed the Answer button, resting the phone against my ear. \u201cHey, Dani. What\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Cass.\u201d Her voice sounded cordial. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about you and Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d This had become my standard response. I simply accepted people\u2019s condolences for my now-dead-and-buried relationship and tried to move on.</p><p>\u201cUm, I really hate you ask you this, but BC is insisting the school wants to do a follow-up feature on Jack since the draft. He says everyone and their mother has their panties in a wad and can\u2019t read enough about him.\u201d</p><p>BC was the editor of the magazine. Half the time I thought he was an idiot, but his ideas usually won us awards, so I stopped questioning his ridiculous demands months ago.</p><p>\u201cHe freaked out when he looked at our collection of Jack photos.\u201d She snickered.</p><p>We had a collection of Jack photos.</p><p>Who has a collection of photos of one person?</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have anything recent and he told me to ask you if you had anything from the summer when he was playing. I\u2019m sorry, Cass, I tried to argue with him, but he was adamant that you\u2019d be professional about this.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed the lump in my throat. Going through photos of Jack wasn\u2019t something I was sure I could handle at this point. But BC was right. I needed to be professional.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this. I can tell him you didn\u2019t have any.\u201d Dani\u2019s sympathy and regret sounded sincere, and I found myself feeling bad for the position she was in.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sure I have something you can use. How many do you need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust e-mail me a few of your best shots. I trust your judgment.\u201d I could hear the relief in her tone.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Deadline?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTomorrow by noon. I know it\u2019s tight but BC wants it to go out in the Welcome Back edition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d I sucked in a lungful of air.</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cassie. You\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d</p><p>I ended the call, reaching for my backpack and stuffing my textbooks inside. I slipped my sunglasses over my eyes, tossed a hat on my head, and headed out the door toward campus.</p><p>I strolled along the sidewalk before cutting to the left, entering the well-manicured campus. I marveled at how green the lawn was even though I couldn\u2019t remember the last time it rained. I passed two girls in hand-painted sorority shirts and I swear I felt a few brain cells spontaneously combust in my head.</p><p>A larger crowd appeared up ahead and my chest tightened as I neared. The stares were less subtle now and the whispers sounded less like whispers and more like shouts. I hated the fact that everyone on campus felt the need to talk about me like I was some freak in a circus sideshow.</p><p>My phone vibrated in my pocket and I reached in and pulled it out. Text from Melissa. My fucking savior. I walked with my head down, my attention focused on my cell phone instead of the gossiping people I passed.</p><p>In the SU with Dean. It\u2019s not crazy crowded.</p><p>With my heart in my throat, I turned in the direction of the student union and punched in a response.</p><p>On my way.</p><p>If I continued to hide, it would only make things worse. I\u2019d be giving them more things to talk about, instead of less. I had to show them I wasn\u2019t falling apart. That I could survive without Jack in my life. Whether or not I believed it wasn\u2019t the point\u2014I needed everyone else to.</p><p>I threw open the glass door before stepping into the familiar smells and sounds. I pretended not to notice as the girls watched my every move, their faces painted with fake sympathy.</p><p>I spotted Dean and rushed over, my pace not even slowing as someone called my name. By the time I reached the table, I was practically hyperventilating.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re okay. It\u2019s okay.\u201d Melissa reached across the table, touching my hand with hers.</p><p>My eyes pooled as I squeezed them shut to force the tears to recede. Dean slid next to me, tossing his arm around my shoulder and pulling me against him as I struggled to even my breathing.</p><p>\u201cI guess if Jack dumped me, I\u2019d date his brother too.\u201d A curvy blonde motioned toward us with a snide smile.</p><p>\u201cShut up, you stupid tramp,\u201d Melissa shouted, her face reddening. \u201cAll of you just shut the hell up and leave her alone!\u201d</p><p>I was silently thankful for her outburst. Thankful she had the guts to say what I wanted to, but was too terrified of actually doing. My actions were so scrutinized that any flare-up would most likely end up on YouTube. It was hard enough simply getting through the day without adding fuel to the wildfire that showed no sign of stopping its ravenous burn.</p><p>Cole and Brett grabbed their trays and headed toward our table. When random girls tried to follow, the guys shoved them away and announced loud enough for everyone to hear that they weren\u2019t welcome.</p><p>Cole sat down on the other side of me, his eyes still holding the pain I recognized from the day of the beating. \u201cWe\u2019re all really sorry about you and Jack, Cassie. And if there\u2019s anything we can do, just let us know. You\u2019re still our family.\u201d</p><p>Brett dropped his tray on the table with a crash. \u201cGirls are such bitches!\u201d he shouted before plopping his muscular body across from me, causing the whole table to vibrate.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Melissa smacked his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cPresent company excluded of course,\u201d he continued with a wink in her direction. \u201cGood to see you, Cass.\u201d He smiled, shoving a monster-sized sub sandwich into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I laughed and my body welcomed the emotion, embracing it like an old friend it hadn\u2019t seen in years.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the smile I love.\u201d Dean nudged my arm with a grin.</p><p>\u201cAre you still working at that magazine?\u201d Cole asked, flicking an unopened bag of chips across the table.</p><p>\u201cYeah. They extended my internship another semester.\u201d I smiled, feeling the excitement course through my veins as I talked about my passion.</p> <p>\u201cAnd they\u2019re sending you on an assignment!\u201d Melissa squealed.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re what? You didn\u2019t tell me that.\u201d Dean cocked his head to the side as his face pinched a little.</p><p>\u201cShe just found out, Dean, don\u2019t get all pouty about it.\u201d Melissa pretended to whine and he threw a grape at her.</p><p>I nudged Dean with my arm. \u201cI think it\u2019s a test. They said they want to see what kind of emotions I can evoke in readers with my pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of what?\u201d Brett\u2019s mouth twisted in confusion.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re such...an idiot.\u201d Cole teased, shaking his head.</p><p>\u201cThey said they wanted to see how I viewed the world.\u201d I shrugged my shoulders. \u201cSo they\u2019re giving me a chance to show them.\u201d</p><p>Cole leaned over the table toward me. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool. Do you think they\u2019ll hire you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess if they like what they see, but I still have a lot to learn. The photographers they have on staff are mind-blowingly talented. I only hope I\u2019ll be that good someday. Plus, their main offices are in New York. The only people they have in LA are the head of sales, a research and development exec, some freelancers, and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you move to New York?\u201d Brett looked stunned, lettuce and meat falling out of his open mouth.</p><p>My eyes met Melissa\u2019s as curiosity crept across her face. \u201cWhy not? You only live once, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it snows there, that\u2019s why not!\u201d Melissa shouted and jutted out her bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cNew York seems pretty cool.\u201d Brett shrugged before finishing off a sports drink and tossing it toward the plastic can a few feet away. When it hit the edge and fell to the ground, everyone at the table broke into laughter and shouting about how much Brett sucked.</p><p>I almost felt normal.</p><p>And then the moment passed.</p><p>Jack was engaged to marry someone else. He had sex with a strange girl without using protection. Something he had never done before us.</p><p>Us.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d Melissa waved both arms like she was signaling a rescue chopper.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did I miss?\u201d I asked and the table roared with amusement once more.</p> <p>I glanced at my phone, noted the time, and started to gather my things. \u201cI have to go. I have class in ten minutes and it\u2019s on the other side of campus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you.\u201d Dean stood as I did, his actions causing the table to fall silent as we left.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to walk me to class, Dean. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I wanted to talk to you,\u201d he said, each step perfectly timed with mine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I glanced sideways at him as he tugged at his brown hair the same way Jack used to do.</p><p>\u201cI just wanted you to know that I\u2019m going to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>My legs started to tremble as his words surged through me with ferocity. I stopped walking and silently begged myself not to lose it. \u201cOf course you are. You\u2019re his brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I feel like I\u2019m betraying you somehow. Standing up there with Jack, it\u2019s like saying that I agree with what he\u2019s doing. And I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t agree with it for one second, but he\u2019s my brother and I love him.\u201d He lowered his head as he kicked at the ground with his foot.</p><p>I threw my arms around him, squeezing hard until he returned the friendly gesture. \u201cI love you for caring about me, but of course you should be there for Jack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish I could talk him out of it.\u201d He tugged at the corners of his eyes, a yawn escaping.</p><p>\u201cAre Gran and Gramps going?\u201d The question alone forced my knees to resume trembling.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not. Gran can\u2019t fly for that long and Gramps refuses to go without her.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t think they have the heart to watch him go through with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Jack know they aren\u2019t coming?\u201d I suddenly found myself caring for Jack\u2019s well-being.</p><p>\u201cHe knows. I think he\u2019s relieved, actually. He feels like he let them down, you know? He\u2019s dealing with a lot of guilt right now.\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard as my throat burned with repressed emotion. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be late to class. I have to go. Thanks for telling me.\u201d I turned on my heel and walked away as fast as my quivering legs would move me.</p><p>I paced in the living room, my body a bundle of nervous energy as I waited for Melissa to get home from night class. The door flung open as a gust of wind practically blew Melissa inside. She pushed her small body against the door, shutting it with a loud slam before turning to face me, her hair tangled across her face.</p><p>\u201cI hate the wind.\u201d She jutted out her bottom lip and blew a huff of air against the pieces covering her mouth.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cMe too.\u201d I plunked down on the couch and picked nervously at the edge of a cushion. \u201cI need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo talk.\u201d She flipped the kitchen light on, searching the cupboards for her bag of butter-flavored pretzels.</p><p>\u201cI want to go out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo out where?\u201d She turned and squinted at me in confusion.</p><p>\u201cAlabama. I need to see him, Melissa. Or maybe he needs to see me? I don\u2019t know, but what if I can stop the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you want to stop the wedding?\u201d Her head cocked to one side as she crunched on a pretzel.</p><p>\u201cBecause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause why, Cassie? This guy cheated on you. And he lied.\u201d Leave it to Melissa to press the issue, forcing me to examine my heart.</p><p>\u201cI know. And I always believed that cheating was an unforgiveable act. That once you broke down that foundation of trust, it could never be rebuilt. But I was wrong. I don\u2019t want him to marry someone else, Melissa. I don\u2019t know that I can get past what he\u2019s done, but I\u2019m willing to try.\u201d</p><p>She stared at me like she\u2019d known this all along and was simply waiting for me to figure it out.</p><p>\u201cSo why are we still talking about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have the money for a ticket.\u201d I sighed, plucking at the frayed edges of the throw pillow. \u201cAnd I was wondering if I could borrow some? I\u2019ll pay you back, I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you pay me back? You don\u2019t even have a real job.\u201d Even though she was telling the truth, I still wanted to smack her.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I\u2019d pay you back next week, but I will pay you back.\u201d Irritated at her reluctance, I squeezed the pillow to my stomach, trying to push back at my emotions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just messing with you. Let\u2019s go book you some flights!\u201d She tossed the bag of pretzels into the air before heading into the bedroom. I laughed as they spilled out onto the floor.</p><p>\u201cAnd a rental car. And a hotel,\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ve got it covered. Get in here!\u201d</p><p>The lights at the baseball stadium flicked off as the last of the fans pulled out of the gravel lot. The opposing team piled onto their bus and the engine roared to life with a loud puff of smoke. I stood next to my rented Ford Mustang and watched as the home team players sporadically filed out of the locker room. My legs were shaking like crazy, my nerves completely frayed.</p><p>I noticed Jack immediately. He was freshly showered, his black hair still dripping wet. A smile crept across my face and I knew without a doubt that if my eyes could sparkle like stars, they would have. Seeing him almost brought me to my knees.</p><p>I watched as his eyes scanned the parking lot for his car, before they stopped on me. He looked away and then quickly jerked back, his hair spraying water from the force of the turn.</p><p>\u201cKitten?\u201d He dropped his bag, running.</p><p>\u201cI hate when you call me that,\u201d I half shouted with a smile.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>I leaned my back into the car as he kissed the side of my face and then stood far too close. I felt my stomach drop to my knees. And my knees drop to my feet. And my feet...well, they could barely stand. He wrapped his arms around me and I nuzzled into his neck, breathing him in. I stopped my fingers from running through his wet hair. I stopped my hands from gripping the back of his neck and pulling him to me. I stopped my mouth from attacking his.</p><p>God, I missed him. What was left of my broken heart belonged to him. Every jagged shard had his name written all over it in permanent black ink.</p><p>He gently pulled back from our embrace before asking me again, \u201cWhat are you doing here, Cass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d I hadn\u2019t thought about what I was going to say, which was really stupid. I\u2019d just been so consumed in the process of getting to Alabama so I could see him, I hadn\u2019t really thought through what I was going to say once I got there. \u201cI just wanted to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could have called.\u201d His teasing tone was so familiar, bringing memories crashing back that made my throat start to burn.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to see you in person.\u201d</p><p>He suddenly shifted his weight and his eyes widened. \u201cAre you okay? Everything is okay with you, right?\u201d</p><p>I smiled at his protectiveness. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>I watched as he regained his composure with a shaky breath. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if something ever happened to you, Kitten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike if I was marrying a complete stranger tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>His body stiffened. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d I watched his shoulders and head drop as the realization hit.</p><p>\u201cJack. It\u2019s a mistake. You shouldn\u2019t do this. Please don\u2019t do it...don\u2019t marry this girl.\u201d My left hand balled into a fist and rested between my breasts. \u201cI\u2019m begging you. I am literally begging you to not do this.\u201d</p><p>I started crying. The ugly, uncontrollable kind of crying. His eyes glistened and I watched him blink back his own tears.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too late. Her whole family\u2019s in town.\u201d His face pinched with pained emotion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not too late. Tomorrow at whatever time you\u2019re supposed to marry her is too late. Tonight isn\u2019t. Please.\u201d I reached for his shirt and gripped, balling it tightly in my fist. \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you flew all this way.\u201d His eyes looked away from mine.</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it? You won\u2019t even consider not going through with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already made my decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d I asked, my heart beating as if the next pulse depended on his answer.</p><p>His body suddenly pressed against mine as he cupped my face with both hands. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>I struggled to breathe. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d I choked out the words. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His dark eyes narrowed. \u201cShe\u2019s not you.\u201d</p><p>His breath was a mixture of warmth and cinnamon from his long-gone breath mint. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d I asked, my tears spilling over his fingertips.</p><p>His hands fell from my face as he breathed in and out through his nose, his temper rising. \u201cFuck, Cassie. What do you want to hear? How much I hate myself for getting drunk that night and losing the only girl in my life I\u2019ve ever trusted and truly loved? How I called Dean fifty times a day for weeks begging him to tell me how I could get you back? Do you want to hear how fucking weak and pathetic I think I am for not being able to tell her no that night, when I knew what was at stake?\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows pinched together and his jaw tensed as his emotions spilled out into the night air. \u201cDo you want to hear how I tried to talk her out of keeping this baby so that it wouldn\u2019t fuck everything up? How I begged her not to keep it, told her I\u2019d pay for everything, I\u2019d drive her there and give her money after it was all over, just to please not do this to me. And then how much of an asshole I felt after that too? Who tells someone that?\u201d</p> <p>I watched as he paced back and forth before falling to his knees, his hands covering his tortured face. His hands fell as he glanced up at me, tears reflecting in his eyes. \u201cI am so fucking in love with you I can\u2019t see straight. I don\u2019t love her. I\u2019ll never love her. But I fucked up and now I have to pay for it. I\u2019ll never forgive myself for hurting you,\u201d he said. \u201cOr losing you.\u201d</p><p>I fell to the ground next to him, my teardrops staining the dry concrete below. I reached for his arms as he wrapped them tightly around my waist and pulled me in. There was no space between us, our bodies sharing the same air. Our foreheads touched and I closed my eyes. \u201cKnowing you\u2019re marrying someone who isn\u2019t me,\u201d I squeezed my eyes tighter to fight back the pain, \u201cis literally killing me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t hate me?\u201d he asked tentatively.</p><p>I opened my eyes to him, my pulse racing at his nearness. \u201cI flew to Alabama to tell you not to get married, dummy. I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t hate you.\u201d I forced a small laugh.</p><p>\u201cHow about one last kiss then?\u201d He grinned, his dimples illuminated by the moonlight.</p> <p>\u201cMy heart\u2019s already shattered beyond repair, what more damage could it do?\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed as his lips pressed against mine. My broken heart sputtered to life as those pesky butterflies in my stomach flapped the dust off their wings. My mouth opened slightly and my tongue was immediately greeted by his. His lips softly opened and closed as our tongues danced with one another as if thrilled to have reconnected. Everything in the background faded away and nothing existed except that kiss. Nothing but the feel of his lips, the taste of his tongue, the smell of his sweet, cinnamon-scented breath. His lips closed gingerly as he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to recover from this...from you,\u201d I admitted, embarrassed.</p><p>\u201cHow do you think I feel? Do you have any idea how hard of an act you are to follow, Cassie Andrews? I will never be the same.\u201d</p><p>He stood up before reaching out a hand to pull me to my feet. I took a shaky breath, suddenly distracted by the sound of tires screeching and the flash of headlights bouncing in our direction.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Jack looked at me apologetically and then back toward the oncoming car.</p> <p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d I asked, and then suddenly I knew. \u201cIt\u2019s her, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>I swallowed hard as the car came to a sudden stop and the driver\u2019s side door flew open. Without turning off the ignition or closing the door, a petite, pixie-like brunette sprinted toward Jack. \u201cWhen you didn\u2019t come home, I got worried. All the other players are home already.\u201d She flung her arms around Jack\u2019s shoulders and squeezed, the massive diamond on her finger flashing. I looked away as my stomach lurched.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked as her eyes looked past Jack and fell onto mine, her eyes widening as realization set in. I eyed her tiny five-foot-one-inch frame and wished I could tackle it to the ground.</p><p>She pulled back from Jack\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s she doing here?\u201d Jealousy was written all over her pinched little face.</p><p>Jack glanced at me before turning to face his future bride. \u201cShe came to see me. She wanted to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s trying to stop the wedding, isn\u2019t she? She doesn\u2019t want us to be together, Jack! She\u2019s trying to take you away from me and the baby!\u201d She clutched her stomach before throwing her head into Jack\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cShe just wanted to talk, Chrystle. Calm down.\u201d Jack glanced at me as he awkwardly tried to console her.</p><p>She pulled her head from against his body and glared at me. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about showing up at the church tomorrow. You will not ruin this day for me! He\u2019s not yours anymore!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChrystle. Stop it.\u201d Jack scolded her like a child as I looked around the empty parking lot to make sure her threats were really meant for me.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d I said with a defensive snarl.</p><p>She placed a hand on her hip, her thigh jutting out to one side. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know who you are?\u201d she asked before jerking Jack\u2019s hand possessively into hers.</p><p>Anger swept over me, effectively blocking all the other emotions swirling around inside me. \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck if you know who I am or not. Just be thankful you\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Her jaw dropped slightly. \u201cOr what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr else I\u2019d be beating your tiny little ass right now for being a disrespectful slut who sleeps with other people\u2019s boyfriends. You\u2019re the worst kind of girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what kind of girl is that?\u201d She tried to sound tough and I had to hold back a smirk.</p><p>\u201cThe kind other girls can\u2019t trust. You\u2019re a backstabber, a liar, and a manipulative skank. You have no respect for boundaries or other people\u2019s relationships.\u201d Damn, it felt good to finally say those words to her face!</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t even know me! Jack, say something!\u201d</p><p>Before he could speak, I lit into her once again. \u201cYou didn\u2019t care that Jack had a girlfriend back home, did you? And no matter how many times he told you about me, you told him I wasn\u2019t there and what I didn\u2019t know wouldn\u2019t hurt me. You manipulated him that night into sleeping with you.\u201d</p><p>She eyeballed me, unsure of how to respond, so I continued. \u201cSo you tell me...what kind of girl does that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Jack said sympathetically.</p><p>I cringed inwardly at the sound of him using my real name. No one called me that. Ever. To hear it spill from his mouth, in his voice, it sounded all wrong.</p><p>\u201cNone of it matters now, does it? I\u2019m pregnant and we\u2019re getting married, so you\u2019ll just have to find someone else.\u201d She looked at Jack for approval, but he refused to tear his eyes from mine. \u201cHave a nice life, Cassie. I know we will.\u201d She smirked at me and then tugged at Jack\u2019s arm.</p><p>Jack whispered, \u201cGood-bye, Kitten,\u201d loud enough for me to hear before she dragged him away. I stared down at the concrete, willing the pain to subside, when I heard footsteps bounding back in my direction. I glanced up to see Chrystle standing a few feet away, a smug look on her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the kind of girl who gets what she wants, and what I wanted was a professional baseball player for a husband. And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m getting. Maybe you\u2019ll be a little more resourceful in your next relationship.\u201d She patted her flat stomach again before running toward her car.</p><p>My jaw unclenched as it fell open.</p><p>I drove the short distance to my hotel, tears blurring my vision the entire way. It\u2019s amazing I didn\u2019t have a freaking wreck. When I pulled into the hotel parking lot, I turned off the engine and dialed Melissa\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cTell me everything,\u201d she screamed into the phone.</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t stop the wedding,\u201d I admitted, my voice cracking.</p><p>\u201cOh God, what happened? Did you see him? Did he see you? Did you talk to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw him. We talked. I told him not to marry her. He said he loved me, and then he left with her. He said he couldn\u2019t call off the wedding, that this was something he had to do.\u201d I choked back a sob as I stared out the windshield into the night, seeing nothing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Cassie. I honestly thought that if he saw you, it would change things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m really fucking proud of you. The old Cassie would have never done this. She would have never put aside being wronged to try to win him back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the old Cassie never had Jack Carter to lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo regrets,\u201d I repeated.</p><p>EIGHTEEN</p><p>JACK</p><p>It killed me to leave Cassie standing alone in that empty parking lot. I watched her as I drove away, tears streaming down her beautiful face. It took every ounce of my self-control to keep my foot on the gas pedal, when all I wanted to do was turn around and be with her.</p><p>Seeing her tonight almost broke me. I\u2019d do anything for her, be anything she wants me to be. Because she deserves nothing less than everything.</p><p>But I always find a way to fuck things up. And Cassie Andrews was no exception. I had the best damn girl in the world, and I threw it all away. Just like that jerk Jared said I would, the night of my first date with Cassie.</p><p>I pulled my car into the garage next to Chrystle\u2019s and hopped out to look for Dean. \u201cHey, little brother! Where are you?\u201d I shouted from the entryway.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Dean yawned as he walked out of the guest bedroom, his dark hair sticking up in every direction.</p><p>\u201cCan I talk to you out back?\u201d I glanced at Chrystle, who pretended to yawn.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be long, will you, Jack?\u201d she asked, her voice nauseatingly light and airy.</p><p>\u201cGo to bed without me, Chrystle. I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d I forced a smile, dreading each moment I had to spend with her.</p><p>Dean and I walked out into the warm Alabama air and sat in two lawn chairs side by side.</p><p>\u201cYou nervous for tomorrow?\u201d Dean asked with a slight grin.</p><p>I turned to look at him. \u201cA little.\u201d Then I cut to the chase. \u201cDid you know Cassie\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>I watched Dean\u2019s eyes widen. \u201cExcuse me? What do you mean, she\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was waiting for me in the parking lot after my game tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Dean looked at me with worry.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? I was certain you knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no idea, Jack. I swear. I would have given you a heads-up or something if I knew.\u201d His eyes widened. \u201cWhich is why, of course, they didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa and Cassie. They were acting weird all week, but they didn\u2019t say why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she ever talk about me,\u201d I asked, putting my brother on the spot.</p><p>\u201cNot when I\u2019m around,\u201d he answered and I nodded with understanding. \u201cSo what did she say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>I shrugged my shoulders and leaned toward him. \u201cShe asked me not to get married tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe flew all the way out here to ask you that? She could\u2019ve just called.\u201d I watched as Dean eyed the second-story window where my bedroom was. His eyes searched for something before landing back on mine.</p><p>I laughed. \u201cI told her the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sucks.\u201d Dean shook his head. \u201cI know this is killing her.\u201d</p> <p>I felt my face tighten with his words. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s killing both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you doing it? I mean, don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t marry Chrystle.\u201d I knew it was hard for Dean to be supportive of my marriage to Chrystle, but sometimes his irritation with me bubbled over, like now.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I get why you\u2019re doing it. I just wish you wouldn\u2019t. I know you still love Cassie.\u201d</p><p>My eyes narrowed and I clenched my jaw. \u201cOf course I fucking love Cassie. But I cheated on her and got someone else pregnant. I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life loving the one person I can\u2019t have. That\u2019s my punishment for hurting her.\u201d</p> <p>Dean squinted as he shook his head. \u201cWhat kind of fucked-up logic is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only kind of logic I can live with. My pain is my punishment. I brought it on myself. I deserve to hurt since I hurt her. And I don\u2019t deserve to have her after what I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seriously whacked. You know that, right? You could be with Cassie right now if you wanted to!\u201d Dean whisper-shouted to me harshly.</p><p>I breathed in and out through my nose, refocusing my thoughts. \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Dean stood up, shoving the chair out from under him before leaning close to my face. \u201cYou\u2019re still hurting her. Every day you aren\u2019t with her, you\u2019re hurting her. And following through with this stupid wedding is probably going to fucking ruin her!\u201d</p><p>He went back into the house and slammed the sliding glass door shut with a thwack. I replayed the conversation in my mind, convincing myself that he was wrong about one thing. Eventually Cassie would heal and get over me. She\u2019d find someone new to love...someone who deserved her.</p> <p>But me? I\u2019d never find another girl like her. And I\u2019d never love anyone the way I love her. My pain would last a lifetime and hers would one day become a distant memory.</p><p>The church was a combination of newly updated renovations mixed with the original structure built in the early eighteen hundreds. I had no idea that the tall building I drove past on the way to the ball field was an actual church until Chrystle forced me inside one day.</p><p>It honestly looked like an oversized mausoleum from the outside. But once you walked through those massive doors, it was a different story. Maybe it was the impressive stained glass windows that guided you down the aisle. Or the white and black swirled marble staircase. Whatever it was, I found myself understanding why people found comfort here.</p><p>The pews filled up quickly with my teammates and Chrystle\u2019s family and friends. I stood at one side of the altar with Dean next to me, and Chrystle\u2019s best friend, Vanessa, waited at the other. The large white doors opened as organ music filtered from the enormous pipes.</p><p>Chrystle appeared in a skintight white dress, the fabric hugging every inch of her body as her smiling father walked her down the aisle. What a fucking sham. He had to know this wasn\u2019t real. If I had a daughter, I\u2019d never let her marry some schmuck who didn\u2019t even love her.</p><p>I wanted to throw up. Beads of sweat began to accumulate behind my neck as my heart started pounding. Dean leaned over and whispered, \u201cWe can still leave,\u201d and I actually considered it. My stomach flipped as I struggled to hold back the sickness that threatened.</p><p>What was I doing? This should be Cassie walking down the aisle toward me. I shouldn\u2019t be marrying this girl. I don\u2019t love her. Hell, I can barely stand her. The mere idea of spending every day with her made me want to vanish into thin air.</p><p>I imagined having the power of invisibility and how freaked out everyone would be if I suddenly disappeared. Poof, gone. The crying and screaming that would overwhelm the church. Some would insist that demons took me. Or that maybe I was the demon. I forced back a laugh as I glanced toward Vanessa who eyed me, her expression wicked.</p> <p>I glimpsed back at Chrystle just as she placed her free hand on her stomach and rubbed it with a smile, as if reading my mind. I swallowed my broken laugh and remembered why I was standing there in the first place. I had an obligation to my unborn child. A duty as a father.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t wouldn\u2019t leave my baby. I would follow through with this because it was the right thing to do. My kid deserved a family that was whole, not broken, not incomplete, not separated. He deserved to grow up in a house with a mom and a dad who loved him. I refused to be the reason why he switched houses depending on the day of the week and I was unwilling to only see him on those days. Kids should grow up with their family and I wouldn\u2019t abandon mine.</p><p>I forced a smile as she neared, a part of me suffocating with each step. She looked pretty, but all I saw when I looked at her was the reason I\u2019d lost the one thing I ever loved. I glanced at Dean, his face pained behind the happiness he faked, as Chrystle sidled up next to me. The preacher read vows and we repeated them to each other, my heart slowing with each word until I was certain it would stop beating altogether and I\u2019d drop dead.</p><p>Couldn\u2019t everyone in the room tell I wasn\u2019t in love with the girl standing next to me?</p><p>I felt hollow. Empty. Devoid of all emotion as I said, \u201cI do,\u201d when I really wanted to shout, \u201cHell no, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>The words, \u201cYou may now kiss your bride,\u201d echoed in my mind as Chrystle\u2019s grin widened. I leaned in to give her a peck, refusing to close my eyes, but she grabbed the back of my neck with both hands and refused to let me go. I pulled against her tight grip as my temper flared.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d I whispered through a tight smile.</p><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Jack Carter,\u201d the preacher shouted with enthusiasm, and I pulled at my tie, willing its chokehold to loosen.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Dean leaned in with a whisper.</p><p>\u201cI gave up being okay the day I lost Cassie,\u201d I admitted, Chrystle\u2019s hand gripping mine as she pulled me from the altar.</p><p>NINETEEN</p><p>After the wedding Chrystle wanted to buy a house, insisting that our child needed a neighborhood and a backyard in order to be truly happy. We fought for weeks over it, until I finally got it through her thick skull that we weren\u2019t going to live in Alabama forever.</p><p>\u201cI can get moved up or traded at any time, Chrystle! Then we\u2019ll have to move right away. It doesn\u2019t make any sense to buy a house here when we\u2019re most likely not staying,\u201d I shouted, trying but failing to hold back my temper.</p><p>\u201cBut I want to live here in the off-season. Don\u2019t you?\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cHadn\u2019t planned on it.\u201d I longed to feel any emotion for the tears she shed, but couldn\u2019t find it in me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even trying.\u201d</p><p>I released an exasperated sigh. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis marriage. Us. You\u2019re not even trying, Jack. I deserve for you to try.\u201d She stomped her foot on the floor. \u201cI\u2019m carrying your child. We both deserve for you to try.\u201d</p><p>There was the emotion I so desperately needed. Guilt. Welcome home, old friend. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ll try harder,\u201d I promised, and she cried again.</p><p>\u201cSorry. Being pregnant makes me really emotional.\u201d She wiped at her face with the back of her hand and I reluctantly pulled her into my arms.</p><p>I walked through the front door carrying my baseball gear before I shouted, \u201cChrystle? I\u2019m back!\u201d</p><p>I refused to say that I was home because Cassie was my home. But I\u2019d lost that, and her, forever, so I\u2019d never truly be home again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up here,\u201d she shouted from upstairs, her voice sounding odd.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I yelled before craning my neck to hear her response. \u201cChrystle?\u201d I yelled again, dropping my bags with a thud.</p><p>I could make out the soft sounds of crying as I rushed up the stairs to our bedroom. Chrystle was curled into a ball surrounded by pillows and used-up tissues. While no feelings existed for the woman I was married to, my feelings for what grew inside of her were immeasurable.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? What happened? Is the baby okay?\u201d I asked, overwhelmed with worry.</p><p>\u201cOh, Jack.\u201d She broke down into tears. \u201cI lost the baby this morning.\u201d</p><p>My stomach dropped and on its way down it grabbed a hold of my heart. \u201cWhat? What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe doctor said it\u2019s common. I woke up and started bleeding really bad. I was so scared.\u201d She threw herself into my arms and sobbed against my chest.</p><p>Devastation ripped through me. Somewhere along the way I\u2019d grown used to the idea of being a father. I\u2019d made plans and looked forward to a future that no longer existed.</p><p>There was no more baby. I brushed under my eye and stared at Chrystle\u2019s stomach, resting my hand there.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I lost our baby. I\u2019m so sorry. All I wanted was our baby. Our child.\u201d She looked up at me through her tears.</p><p>\u201cI know. Me too,\u201d I admitted as a tear escaped my eye. \u201cCan I get you anything? Do you want some water or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay. Where are you going?\u201d She clung to my shirt as I climbed to my feet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just going downstairs to grab a drink. I\u2019ll be right back, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and I flew from the room, my emotions taking over. I hopped over the last two stairs before rushing into the tiny bathroom and slamming the door shut. I fell to the floor, my head falling between my legs as I grieved for the child I\u2019d lost.</p><p>My chest heaved with pain before a sliver of hope crept in.</p><p>You can leave Chrystle now.</p><p>Get a divorce and go fix things with Cassie.</p><p>Spend your life making it up to her.</p><p>Relief washed over me, quickly followed by guilt, my new best friend. How could I feel relief at a time like that? This isn\u2019t the time to find happiness. What the fuck was wrong with me?</p><p>I steadied my heartbeat before pushing my body up from the floor. I poured a glass of water, grabbed some headache medicine, and slowly crept back up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s make another baby, Jack.\u201d</p><p>Her request caught me off guard. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I told her staunchly, the very idea made me want to punch something. I hated the relief I felt, but the truth was, I\u2019d just dodged a bullet. I wasn\u2019t about to load the gun again.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Now that we\u2019re not having a baby, you\u2019re going to leave me? I can see the headlines now...\u2018Jack Carter Leaves Heartbroken Wife After She Loses Baby.\u2019\u201d</p><p>I winced. \u201cCalm down, Chrystle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay you won\u2019t leave. I can\u2019t handle you leaving on top of what I already lost.\u201d She sobbed, her face flushed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d I conceded.</p><p>I woke up the next morning, my head throbbing as if I\u2019d drank too much the night before. But it was the ache of loss that ripped through my skull. I glanced at Chrystle, her arm possessively clasping mine. She whined as I removed it from her grip and flipped over, but continued sleeping as I crawled out of bed.</p><p>I brushed my teeth, splashed water on my face, and started to head downstairs. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Her needy voice stopped me in my tracks.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just heading to the gym. Go back to sleep.\u201d I took two steps toward her before changing direction and running down the stairs.</p> <p>I sat in my car, turned the ignition, and powered on my wireless headset. As I drove away, I dialed Dean\u2019s number.</p><p>\u201cHey, bro, it\u2019s early.\u201d Dean\u2019s voice was raspy. Apparently I\u2019d woken him up again.</p><p>\u201cShit. I always forget the time difference. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo big deal. What\u2019s up?\u201d He yawned into the receiver.</p><p>\u201cChrystle lost the baby yesterday,\u201d I said as my emotions whooshed out from me.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, really? I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I heard him shifting around in his bed. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo what now?\u201d he asked, the same way he always did when we were kids.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, you\u2019ll get a divorce, right? You\u2019re not going to stay with her now that there\u2019s no baby?\u201d He practically shouted in the phone, causing me to pull mine away from my ear a little.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t leave her right now, Dean. She\u2019s devastated. She can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo what? She\u2019s a bitch. I\u2019ll fly out today and help you pack.\u201d His voice was serious.</p><p>\u201cEven I\u2019m not that heartless,\u201d I commented with a snicker.</p><p>\u201cDoes Cassie know?\u201d I heard his question and my mind drifted as the trees in the neighborhood rushed past my window.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot right now,\u201d I admitted.</p><p>\u201cWhy not? What is going on with you? Leave Chrystle and come make things right with Cassie!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d He sucked in a gulp of air. \u201cYou\u2019re not in love with Chrystle, are you?\u201d</p><p>My hands gripped the steering wheel, my knuckles turning white with the force. \u201cAre you fucking crazy? I don\u2019t even know how to love anyone other than Cassie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust making sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna go. I just wanted to tell you. Can you tell Gran and Gramps, please, and tell Gran I\u2019ll call her soon. Don\u2019t tell Cassie. She shouldn\u2019t hear it from you,\u201d I demanded.</p><p>\u201cFine. But you better tell her soon.\u201d</p><p>I arrived at the clubhouse gym to find three of my teammates already working out. Coach sat in his office, the phone in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. I smiled when he placed down his coffee and reached for a donut, shoving part of it in his mouth while he tilted the phone back behind his shoulder. His eyes darted out the window and met mine before his head nodded in time with his moving mouth. He put the phone down, stood up, and wagged his finger. \u201cCarter.\u201d</p><p>Anxiety shot through me as I walked into Coach\u2019s office, my stomach dropping.</p><p>\u201cI just got off the phone with the head of the organization. You got the call, kid. They\u2019re moving you up for the playoffs. Pack your stuff, grab that wife of yours, and get ready to leave tonight. You start playing with the team tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>My feet wouldn\u2019t move and my ass felt like it was super-glued to the chair I was sitting in. \u201cWhat?\u201d I asked like an idiot and he laughed.</p><p>\u201cGet outta here, Carter. Your flight leaves at ten tonight. We\u2019ll messenger the tickets to your house. Congratulations, kid, you\u2019re a hell of a pitcher.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you, Coach. Thank you so much.\u201d I stood, my hand shaking as I reached for his.</p><p>I throttled the gas, a million thoughts racing through my head, the most prominent one being how badly I wanted to share this moment with Cass. After everything we\u2019d been through, she was still the first person who came to mind when I had news to share. It made me fucking sick to think I wouldn\u2019t be moving her to Arizona with me. When I dreamed of the future, this had always been part of it. Getting to The Show was the foremost thing on my mind. But Cass at my side went hand in hand with that vision.</p><p>When I got home, I searched through the house. \u201cChrys? Chrystle?\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cIn here.\u201d Her voice drifted in from the kitchen.</p><p>I walked into the kitchen and caught her eye. \u201cStart packing. We leave for Arizona tonight.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d Her voice radiated with excitement as she threw her tiny arms around me.</p><p>Since she was no longer carrying my child, I didn\u2019t move to hug her back.</p><p>I\u2019m an asshole.</p><p>\u201cA messenger will drop off the tickets and a car will pick us up at eight thirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do with all our stuff? Just leave it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come back here when the season ends and pack everything up. But for now, just bring the necessities. I\u2019m not sure how long we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is so exciting! I\u2019m married to a big leaguer.\u201d Her voice rang out in song as she reached for her cell. \u201cI\u2019m going to call my mama.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright. I\u2019m gonna hop in the shower,\u201d I said as she hummed to herself.</p><p>I ran upstairs and turned the shower on, closing the bathroom door behind me as I wished for a moment of solitude. Wished for a moment that Cass was here. Wished I hadn\u2019t fucked things up. Realizing I\u2019d left my cell phone in my gym bag downstairs, I opened the door to ask Chrystle to get it for me. \u201cChrys?\u201d I scanned the bedroom, but she wasn\u2019t there.</p><p>I wrapped a towel around my waist and headed downstairs when I overheard Chrystle say, \u201cOh please, Tressa, I\u2019ve got him wrapped around my finger. I\u2019ll have him so guilt-ridden by the time the night is through, he\u2019ll never leave.\u201d</p><p>I paused on the stairs, listening with intent as she continued. \u201cI know, right? No, he\u2019s in the shower. Tressa! He doesn\u2019t suspect a thing. And plus, I\u2019ll make him sleep with me until I actually do get pregnant...for real this time.\u201d</p><p>My jaw worked as I saw red and my ears started to burn. \u201cHe has no idea I made the whole thing up. How could he? What does a guy know about being pregnant? Nothing.\u201d</p><p>She laughed and my temper flared. I stormed down the rest of the stairs and into the kitchen, my eyes burning a hole right through her. \u201cHang up the phone,\u201d I demanded as her face twisted with surprise. \u201cHang up the goddammed phone. NOW!\u201d I lunged for the device in her hand, but she pulled it away.</p><p>\u201cTressa, I have to go. I\u2019ll call you later. \u2019Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t, Chrystle. Tell me you didn\u2019t fucking lie to me about being pregnant.\u201d I vibrated with emotion, my hands balling in and out of fists, and she moved away from me.</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Instead, she stared at me with her stupid face, and I wished for a brief second that it was socially acceptable to punch a chick. \u201cWho else knows?\u201d She didn\u2019t move. \u201cWHO...ELSE...KNOWS?\u201d I shouted through my rage.</p><p>\u201cJ...j...ust Tressa and Vanessa,\u201d she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not lying, Jack. I swear. They\u2019re the only ones I told.\u201d Her voice shook with her admission.</p><p>I glared at her, my adrenaline pumping like wildfire through my already heated veins. \u201cWhy would you do that to me? You ruined my fucking life! You made me lose the only person I\u2019ve ever loved for a lie?!! Why, Chrystle? TELL ME WHY?\u201d I screamed from the other side of the granite island in the kitchen, pounding my fist against the top.</p><p>\u201cBecause!\u201d she shouted back.</p><p>\u201cBecause why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I just wanted a major league baseball player for a husband! Okay? I wanted to marry a professional athlete. I wanted a rich and famous husband,\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t matter that you ruined my life, as long as you got what you wanted?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, save it. I didn\u2019t ruin your life, Jack. It\u2019s not like I killed your career or anything.\u201d She rolled her eyes with a huff, any guilt she felt dissipating.</p><p>\u201cGet your stuff and get the fuck out. I don\u2019t care where you go, but you can\u2019t stay here.\u201d I pointed toward the front door.</p><p>\u201cBut you leave for Arizona tonight. At least let me stay while you\u2019re gone.\u201d Her whiny voice sent irritation through me like the sound of nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>\u201cNo. If you step foot in this house while I\u2019m away, I\u2019ll have you arrested for breaking and entering, right after I file the restraining order against you and annul this sham of a marriage for false pretenses and lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever, Jack. Good luck getting Cassie back after all this. No one will ever really love you. Your own mom didn\u2019t even stick around.\u201d She hurled the insult and I took it like a ninety-mile-an-hour fastball to the gut.</p><p>\u201cI changed my mind. Get out of my house now. I\u2019ll set your things on fire and mail you the ashes.\u201d I grabbed her by the arm, forcefully removing her from the premises before engaging the dead bolt on the door behind her.</p><p>\u201cJaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!\u201d she screamed as she pounded her fists against the door. For a bitty thing, she could sure make a lot of noise.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead to me,\u201d I shouted through the door before turning around and heading upstairs to pack.</p><p>TWENTY</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>We need to talk.</p><p>I stared at the text message from Jack for nearly twenty minutes before putting the phone down on my dresser and walking out of my room.</p><p>\u201cMelis?\u201d I asked, poking my head through her doorway.</p><p>She was sprawled out across her bed reading. \u201cYeeessssss?\u201d she responded, dropping her electronic reader to her side.</p><p>\u201cJack just sent me a text.\u201d</p><p>She adjusted her body to an upright position before crossing her legs Indian style. \u201cSay what? What\u2019d he say? Did you text him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt just said we need to talk. What do we need to talk about? And why now? Do you think he knows I\u2019m leaving?\u201d My eyes darted around the room, pausing at the various photos of us on the walls.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible. I\u2019m sure Dean told him. But why would he need to talk to you about that?\u201d she asked, patting the spot next to her for me to sit down.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you gonna text him back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yeah, you should. You should be like, \u2018What do we need to talk about? I\u2019m all talked out from spilling the entire contents of my heart to you the night before your wedding. I think we\u2019re done talking,\u2019\u201d she finished with a sassy head gyration and my jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that!\u201d I leaned back into her mountain of fluffy pillows.</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m just kidding. Just be super casual and ask him what\u2019s up. Give me your phone, I\u2019ll do it for you.\u201d She reached for me and I fell backward onto the other side of the bed, typing quickly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What\u2019s up?</p><p>\u201cThere.

I\u2019d forgotten to change it. I shot her a horrified look before she whispered, \u201cAnswer it! Just answer it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you whispering?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know! Answer it!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d I answered, scooting my body from her mattress.</p><p>\u201cHey, Kitten.\u201d His familiar voice sent chills racing up and down my spine.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I didn\u2019t protest at the nickname. I was too busy being caught up in the sound of his voice. I never realized how much I\u2019d missed it until it was beaming into my eardrums, the comfortable familiarity forcing nervous energy to ping throughout my insides.</p><p>\u201cI have to tell you some stuff,\u201d he started to say and my legs immediately gave out, the words a reminder of the heartache I\u2019d experienced not that long ago.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you possibly have to tell me now, Jack?\u201d I snapped at him, hoping to mask the pain I still carried, as Melissa gave me a thumbs-up of support.</p><p>\u201cChrystle lost the baby.\u201d His voice relayed the unfathomable information and I fell to the floor, my back sliding against the wall in Melissa\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d My breath hitched and a lone tear rolled down my cheek.</p><p>\u201cI mean, she didn\u2019t lose the baby. Well, that\u2019s what she told me, but she was really never pregnant. She lied.\u201d He paused to take a breath, then let out a sigh. \u201cAbout everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God, Jack, I\u2019m so sorry. That\u2019s...insane. How\u2019d you find out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI overheard her on the phone telling her best friend how stupid and gullible I was. And that she\u2019d try to get pregnant for real.\u201d His voice lowered.</p> <p>\u201cThat little bitch.\u201d The words escaped my lips as my mind drifted back to the night in the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cCass, I left her. I\u2019m annulling the marriage and I got called up tonight. I leave for Arizona in an hour.\u201d His tone changed and I recognized the joy in his voice.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I smiled, my eyes meeting Melissa\u2019s. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible! Congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. But, Cassie?\u201d He paused. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I should have listened to you. I never should have married her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know she was lying, Jack. And you were just trying to do the right thing...no matter how misguided. Your heart was in the right place. I was just devastated that it wasn\u2019t with me.\u201d</p><p>His breath whooshed over the phone line. \u201cMy heart has always been with you. Since the day you first rolled your gorgeous green eyes at me. You\u2019ve always had my heart. I\u2019m the one whose been lost without it.\u201d</p><p>His words were everything I wanted to hear and didn\u2019t. We\u2019d come so far from where we once were. So much damage had been done and while I still loved him, I was scared to give my heart to him again...at least not easily. \u201cI\u2019ve had to learn how to live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd how\u2019s that working out for you?\u201d he asked with a slight laugh.</p> <p>\u201cNot that great,\u201d I reluctantly admitted.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it didn\u2019t really work out for me either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure seemed to.\u201d I wondered if his words meant what I thought they did.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped loving you. I know I hurt you...shit.\u201d He stopped as a loudspeaker echoed in the background. \u201cI have to go. I really want to finish this conversation, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d I answered, knowing that eventually I\u2019d need to tell him I was leaving.</p><p>Left tickets for you and Melissa at Will Call. Please come. I really want to see you.</p><p>\u201cAre you still staring at that text?\u201d Melissa teased.</p><p>I rushed to look away from the screen and into Melissa\u2019s eyes. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d I smiled.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m having d\u00e9ja vu,\u201d she announced with a sigh.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d I rolled my eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m begging you to come to Jack\u2019s baseball game and you won\u2019t. Cassie, it\u2019s his major league debut! At Dodger Stadium! You have to come to that!\u201d She pleaded with me, her eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cNo, Melissa, I can\u2019t go to that.\u201d I answered quieter than I intended.</p><p>\u201cPostpone your flight! How will you forgive yourself if you miss this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I go to that game and see him, it will change everything. I\u2019ll want to wait after the game for him, and then we\u2019ll go to dinner, and then I\u2019ll spend the night...and it will never end!\u201d I shouted.</p><p>\u201cOur cycle will start back up and before you know it, I\u2019ll have not only missed my flight to New York, but I\u2019ll be turning down a a killer job so I can follow him to Arizona! And then eventually I\u2019ll hate I\u2019ll eventually hate him because I gave up the one opportunity I was given to follow my dreams, to follow his dreams, which have nothing to do with mine . I\u2019ll leave him and it will be ugly and messy and then I\u2019ll become turn into some old crazy lady with twenty dogs who talks about the days she used to be a good photographer and dated a professional baseball player!!!!!!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, over-think things much?\u201d Melissa\u2019s laugh echoed throughout the apartment.</p><p>I started laughing too and when I couldn\u2019t stop, I started crying. \u201cGoing to watch Jack play just reminds me of everything we used to have, the couple we used to be. I can\u2019t watch him and pretend like I don\u2019t want to be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pretend, Cassie. Be. With. Him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t, Melissa. I have to be with me,\u201d I said, mimicking her tone. \u201cThis job is an incredible opportunity and I need to do something for myself. If I go to that game tonight, I won\u2019t want to ever leave him again. And I have to be able to leave him. For me.\u201d</p><p>Her eyebrows pinched together as she nodded. \u201cThat actually makes a lot of sense. Which sorta pisses me off because I really want you to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Trust me, I want to be there. I really do. I just know I can\u2019t handle it. That boy could talk me out of buying an umbrella during a hailstorm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. He\u2019s gonna freak out, though. You know this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t always get what you want,\u201d I said matter-of-factly.</p><p>\u201cAt least Dean will be there so I won\u2019t have to sit alone.\u201d</p><p>TWENTY-ONE</p><p>JACK</p><p>I made the public relations girl at the field show me exactly where the seats were that I\u2019d left for Cassie. When she pointed them out, I shook my head. \u201cThose aren\u2019t gonna work. They\u2019re fine for my family, but I need two seats right here.\u201d</p><p>I pointed to the row of seats directly in line with the dugout. \u201cI don\u2019t care if I have to buy them, I\u2019ll buy them. Just get me two seats right here.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to be able to see Cassie. I needed to see her.</p><p>\u201cI can do that for you. I\u2019ll just check and make sure the seats are available. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d She flipped her hair with a smile before walking away.</p><p>I looked around at the stadium I\u2019d been to so many times as a kid, my pride swelling. I hopped over the short wall and onto the field, turning around to view the seats I\u2019d chosen. I walked to the mound, glancing at the seat choice, before settling into the dugout. The seats were perfect.</p><p>\u201cJack? Jack?\u201d The PR girl\u2019s voice reverberated.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d I said, climbing out of the dugout and onto the field.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in luck. The seats are available. What name should I put them under?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease put them under Cassie Andrews and Melissa Williams. Thanks for the help, I appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo problem. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d She batted her lashes before spinning on her heel and walking off.</p><p>Ever since my coach in high school reinforced the message of \u201cKeep your head in the game and your eyes outta the stands if you want to get drafted,\u201d I\u2019ve never looked. But tonight, I couldn\u2019t help myself. I glanced at the empty seats to my left at least a hundred times, waiting for her to be there.</p><p>Focus, Carter. You\u2019re being ridiculous.</p><p>I breathed deeply, looking up at the bright lights of the major league stadium before releasing the breath slowly. I glanced to the left again.</p><p>Feet! Black tall girly-shoes!</p><p>Noticing the pair of heels, I hustled to the side of the dugout nearest the seats. I glanced to my left, spotted Melissa, and smiled as she turned toward me and waved. I gave her a quick wave back before pointing to the seat next to her with a shrug. She shook her head and my smile dropped, along with my heart. I tried to mouth, \u201cShe\u2019s not coming?\u201d Apparently she couldn\u2019t read my lips.</p><p>\u201cCarter! Get over here,\u201d the manager yelled and I jerked my head behind me. \u201cGo get warmed up.\u201d</p><p>I grabbed a pen and a program, and scribbled out Where is she? before walking up to our teenaged bat boy. \u201cHey, Cody, do me a favor. See that girl over there with the curly brown hair and the giant pink purse?\u201d</p><p>Cody craned his neck. \u201cThe one in the Diamondbacks shirt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Can you give her this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, Jack.\u201d His face lit up and I only imagined what he thought I was trying to do.</p><p>\u201cMake sure you wait for her response and then hold on to it for me, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, Cody,\u201d I said, before grabbing my glove and running toward the outfield.</p><p>I failed to realize that I\u2019d be spending the majority of the game in the bullpen, which couldn\u2019t be further away from the seats I\u2019d reserved if I tried.</p><p>I sprinted into the dugout, looking around for Cody like a madman. \u201cCody?\u201d I yelled.</p><p>\u201cHere, Jack.\u201d He held out the folded program.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t come. She said it\u2019s too hard. Jack, she\u2019s leaving tonight for New York! She\u2019s moving there!!</p><p>I ran to the far end of the dugout, my face frantic as I caught sight of Dean sitting in the seat I\u2019d bought for Cassie. I whisper-shouted his name and he turned, his eyes wide at the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cWhat time\u2019s her flight?\u201d I shouted, not caring who heard.</p><p>Dean turned his head toward Melissa before turning back to mine. \u201cShe\u2019s leaving the apartment at ten thirty.\u201d</p><p>I glanced around frantically looking for a fucking clock, knowing full well there wasn\u2019t one in the visitor dugout. I leaned over the cold railing and craned my neck toward the scoreboard. The numbers 9:03 splashed across the black board in yellow lights. I released a breath. I still had time.</p><p>The sound of my tires squealing into the parking lot caused Cassie to turn in my direction. A cab driver tossed the last of her suitcases into the trunk before slamming it shut.</p><p>I hopped out of my car and rushed toward her. \u201cCassie!\u201d I shouted, not stopping as my hat flew off.</p><p>\u201cJack, what are you doing here? Don\u2019t you have a game?\u201d Her eyes widened. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s done and I drove straight here.\u201d I reached her and grabbed her shoulders with both hands, as if my touch alone would stop her. \u201cSo it\u2019s true? You\u2019re really leaving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible opportunity, Jack,\u201d she responded, her voice cold.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not even finished with school yet.\u201d I could hear a little whine in my own voice, but hell, I was desperate.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t either when you left to pursue your dreams. If it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019ll come back and finish. But I don\u2019t have to get my bachelor\u2019s degree to do what I want to do.\u201d Cassie looked so resolute, her arms crossed over her chest.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, Kitten. Don\u2019t move across the country,\u201d I pleaded, this scene all too familiar in my head. \u201cI know things are different and maybe I fucked them up so badly that they\u2019re beyond repair. But I want to try. I need to try. I can\u2019t let you walk out of my life without knowing that I did everything in my power to keep you in it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying, Jack?\u201d Her eyes welled up as she blinked back tears.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that I love you. Nothing in my life is right if you\u2019re not with me. You\u2019re a part of me. And I can\u2019t let that part go. I want to be with you. I know I messed up, and I know you don\u2019t trust me, but I\u2019ll prove to you that you can. I promise I\u2019ll spend the rest of my life making it up to you if you\u2019ll let me.\u201d</p> <p>I held my breath as I waited for her to respond.</p><p>Her brows drew together as she looked away from me. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here , Jack . I already accepted the job. And I want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen say we\u2019ll work it out. Say we\u2019re back together while we figure things out,\u201d I begged, willing to say anything to not lose her again.</p><p>\u201cLong distance doesn\u2019t really work for us,\u201d she admitted, and I cringed.</p><p>\u201cIt will be different this time. I\u2019ve learned my lesson. I know what\u2019s at stake. I know how much I have to lose. I promise you I\u2019ll never fuck up again.\u201d I reached for her hands, squeezing them as I pleaded. \u201cI know my promises mean nothing to you right now, but I\u2019ll make them mean something again. I\u2019ll give the words meaning.\u201d</p><p>I caressed her hands with mine, not wanting to let go.</p> <p>\u201cProve it,\u201d she said with a shrug, before sliding She slid into the cab and , locked the door and rolled down the window. \u201cProve it.\u201d locking the door.</p><p>My heart thumped as it battered against my chest. The cab sped away and Cassie\u2019s image in the rear window faded from view.</p><p>TWENTY-TWO</p><p>CASSIE</p><p>I\u2019d spent the last four months falling in love with New York City. I hadn\u2019t heard from Jack at all since the night I left, which not only surprised me, but broke my heart all over again. No matter how many times Dean tried to assure me that Jack was still in love with me and to give him time, his silence proved otherwise to my doubtful heart.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d hoped for, exactly. I guess a part of me wanted some sort of grand gesture. I wanted to walk outside one morning and find him waiting there for me, like he\u2019d done that one time when I got out of class. And when I told him to \u201cprove it\u201d the night I left, I honestly thought he would. I just wanted something from Jack. Anything but silence. And when nothing came, I tried my best to move on.</p><p>I shuffled out of the jam-packed subway car and moved along with the crowd up the stairs and into the chilled air outdoors. I was still awestruck daily by the sights and the sounds of New York and constantly forced myself to keep walking, when I was dying to drop to my knee to shoot the scenes around me.</p><p>The building I worked in was thirty stories tall with rectangular windows spaced three feet apart in all directions. I opened the oversized gold door before shaking off the chill.</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Craig.\u201d I squeezed the shoulder of our salt-and-pepper-haired security guard.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Miss Andrews,\u201d he said with a nod, before pressing the elevator button for me and holding the door open once it arrived.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d I smiled, repeating the same routine we acted out each morning.</p><p>I hopped in, pressing the button for the twenty-seventh floor before I heard, \u201cWait! Hold the doors!\u201d</p><p>I threw my arm between the closing doors, forcing them to stop abruptly and stutter back apart. Joey, an adorable brown-haired, blue-eyed copy editor from Boston, hopped inside, his arms full of papers.</p><p>\u201cThanks! Oh...morning, Cassie.\u201d He glanced over his shoulder at me, and I looked away, embarrassed. He\u2019d asked me out a few times since I moved here, but the truth was, I wasn\u2019t ready to date. After everything I\u2019d been through with Jack, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d ever be ready again.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Joey. Can I help?\u201d I asked, reaching for the papers that threatened to fall.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Half his mouth twisted upward into a smirk. \u201cSo, what you\u2019d do last night?\u201d he asked with his cute Boston accent.</p><p>\u201cUh, I worked until a little after eight. Then I grabbed some amazing Italian food on the way home from this tiny caf\u00e9, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere do you live again?\u201d He asks me this every time we talk. I haven\u2019t figured out why, but he does.</p><p>\u201cLower East Side, not far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat street?\u201d</p><p>\u201cClinton,\u201d I responded as the elevator announced our arrival.</p><p>The doors opened and the sounds of rushed voices filled the air. The floor was packed with wall-to-wall cubicles spilling over with the previous day\u2019s work. Privacy was not something one could find in this office. I secretly loved the chaos and the constant rushing around.</p><p>\u201cSo, do you like it?\u201d he asked, watching my eyes. \u201cLiving in the lower east?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I do. Most of my neighbors are young and super artsy so it\u2019s kind of inspiring and annoying all at the same time.\u201d I laughed as I followed him to his cubicle.</p><p>\u201cWe should grab dinner sometime.\u201d I started to turn him down as he held up a hand in the air to stop me. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be a date. Just friends sharing a meal together. I don\u2019t think you get out of your Clinton Street apartment enough.\u201d</p><p>He smiled and I shook my head. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink it over. Just friends, no pressure.\u201d He leaned in close and I could smell his cologne as he grabbed the papers from my arms. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Joey,\u201d I answered, feeling a little flustered as I rushed across the hardwood floor.</p><p>\u201cThink it over!\u201d he shouted, although no one else seemed to notice in all the chaos.</p><p>I quickened my pace, my cheeks burning as I scurried past the wall-mounted antique mirror. I slid into my cubicle, pushing the button on my computer as the screen flickered to life. I scrolled past the spam that always seem to get through the e-mail filters and landed on Melissa\u2019s name. She\u2019d gotten into the habit of sending e-mails to my work address so that I would have something to read from her first thing in the morning. And in return, I had to write back, no matter what, so that she\u2019d have something from me when she woke up.</p><p>Hooker,</p><p>Do you think your IT guy reads my e-mails? Because if I was an IT guy, I would totally read my e-mails. Maybe he would if he knew how hot I was. I should probably attach a picture. LOL</p><p>So, tell me more about this Joey kid. Is he hot? Where\u2019s he from? What\u2019s his deal? Are you gonna go out with him, or what? What is it with you and making guys beg? You\u2019re really sort of a bitch, Cassie Andrews. JK, LOL, smiley face (say it super fast like this.) JKLOLSMILEYFACE</p><p>Ooooh, I think Dean has a crush on this really cute freshman, so make sure you give him shit the next time you talk to him, K? K. I\u2019m not going to ask about \u201chim\u201d this time, so don\u2019t freak out. But hey, if he does call or text or anything, I\u2019d better be the first person to hear about it! Just sayin\u2019! :)</p><p>I\u2019d better go. I know this was like the most boring e-mail ever, but what can I say? Life is sorta boring without you. I miss you.</p><p>Melis &lt;3</p><p>I hit the Reply button and watched as her message scrolled to the bottom half of the page.</p><p>Dork,</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure our IT guy (Hi Shawn!!!!!) is far too busy to sift through my e-mails and read them. But if you want to attach some super-hot photo of yourself, I\u2019m pretty sure he wouldn\u2019t be opposed. LOL</p><p>You\u2019re crazy, just so you know. Joey is really cute, with an accent that kills me every time he talks. He\u2019s from Boston and is \u201cwicked\u201d smart, as he would say. LOL He seems like he totally has his shit together, which is kind of intimidating, to be honest. He asked me out today, just as friends. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to lead him on...</p><p>Tell me about this girl Dean likes. Is she nice? She\u2019s not in a sorority, is she? Make sure she isn\u2019t a bitch, Meli. Dean\u2019s too nice.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure \u201che\u2019s\u201d done with me. Although to be honest, I have no idea why. If I ever hear from him again, which I highly doubt, you\u2019ll be my first call.</p><p>I love you and miss you so much. Move in with me after you graduate. Just kidding. Not really. When are you coming to visit?</p><p>xoxox C.</p><p>Even talking about Jack in an e-mail forced my stomach to spin. I tortured myself constantly, thinking up scenarios as to why he stopped liking me. I\u2019d pushed him too far this last time. I\u2019m never happy. His words never mean enough. I\u2019m always asking him to jump through hoops for me.</p><p>Ugh. I hated this feeling of self-blame and discontent.</p><p>The next two months flew by in a blur. The snow finally melted and spring filled the air with its warmer temperatures, its colors, and its smells as flowers bloomed and trees budded. The dull, colorless winter that was so often gray and dreary quickly gave way to full green trees, white flowers, and bright blue skies. In a word, New York in the spring is amazing.</p><p>\u201cHey, girl,\u201d I answered after seeing Melissa\u2019s name flash across my screen.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s New York today?\u201d she asked happily on the other end.</p><p>\u201cSo beautiful! Seriously, when are you coming to visit me?\u201d I was so dying to show her the sights of the city.</p><p>\u201cSoon, I think! Maybe over break, is the weather nice then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Probably not, to be honest. I think that\u2019s when everyone goes to Florida.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, what? They go to Florida willingly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMelissa!\u201d I giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s a quick flight and the weather is way better! It\u2019s no different than everyone in So Cal heading to Hawaii.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, yes it is. It\u2019s H a w a i i and really, who goes to Florida on purpose?\u201d Her voice sounded so exasperated, it made me smile. \u201cSo, have you heard from Jack?\u201d</p><p>I should have known that was why she called. The Diamondbacks were coming into town, and she and Dean wouldn\u2019t stop blowing up my phone.</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she said, her voice laced with disappointment.</p><p>\u201cReally. We have to stop talking about him, Melis. I mean, when will we stop talking about him?\u201d I hated that we had to go over this again; it really didn\u2019t help. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.

The sadness still got to me sometimes.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me, how\u2019s Joey from Bahhston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good.\u201d I laughed at her attempt at his accent.</p> <p>\u201cStill making him beg?\u201d</p><p>My lack of an answer was all the answer she needed. \u201cCassie, you can\u2019t stay closed off forever.

That\u2019s how we know we\u2019ve lived a life worth fighting for. Love is a battlefield! Thank you, Pat Benatar.\u201d She belted out an off-key rendition of the chorus that made me giggle before continuing. \u201cOur scars don\u2019t point us in the direction we\u2019re headed, Cass, they simply remind us of where we\u2019ve been.\u201d</p><p>I remained silent, taking in the very truth of her words. \u201cCass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s time to let him go,\u201d she suggested, her voice tinged with pain.</p><p>My breath whooshed in and out of the phone before she spoke again. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that sometimes letting go is the only way to find out who you\u2019re meant to hold on to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I like that. Did you make it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I read it online somewhere before.\u201d She laughed. \u201cBut let\u2019s pretend it came from this gorgeous head of mine.\u201d</p><p>I rested my camera on top of my messy desk and watched as Joey waltzed into the building, his business attire looking more than good on him. He flashed a smile in my direction before walking into the kitchen. I followed him, pretending I needed to fill my already half-filled coffee mug.</p> <p>\u201cAre you ever going to go out with me?\u201d he asked, his confidence reminding me of Jack.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to stop asking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until you agree.\u201d He stirred his coffee before taking a sip.</p><p>\u201cFine. This is me...agreeing,\u201d I responded, an eerie, all-too-familiar feeling creeping over me.</p><p>\u201cIt only took me six months. I think that\u2019s a new record.\u201d He leaned in and planted a peck on my cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave at six. No overtime for you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight?\u201d I repeated, horrified.</p><p>\u201cTonight. No backing out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it work.\u201d I pressed my lips together to stop them from smiling.</p> <p>\u201cSo where are you taking me?\u201d I leaned my head back in the passenger seat of Joey\u2019s car and watched as the city whizzed by us in a blur.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise.\u201d Joey glanced over at me and smiled.</p><p>I really hated surprises. But this guy didn\u2019t know that. He didn\u2019t know anything about me.</p><p>He turned onto Grand Central Parkway and I almost started hyperventilating. \u201cWhere are we going? Are we going to the game?\u201d I choked out, noticing the stadium on the horizon.</p><p>\u201cI overheard you one day talking about baseball and how you went to college with one of the guys on the Diamondbacks. So I got us tickets. Maybe you can see your friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God. Joey, that\u2019s really sweet and thoughtful and romantic, but I...can\u2019t go to this game with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you can. Don\u2019t be silly. We don\u2019t have to stay for the whole thing. Have you even seen a game yet? Or been to either stadium?\u201d</p><p>I shook my head, unable to come up with a reasonable explanation to stop this train wreck from happening.</p><p>\u201cIt will be fun. New Yorkers are pretty cool fans. I mean, as long as they aren\u2019t playing the Sox. But you have to experience it.\u201d Joey sounded so excited as he tried to sell me on it while he parked the car.</p><p>I\u2019ve already experienced pretty cool fans. Back in college. You have no idea, buddy.</p><p>\u201cPromise me that if I want to leave, we will. No questions asked. Okay?\u201d</p><p>He stared at me as if I\u2019d asked something completely foreign of him. \u201cJoey, you have to promise me or I\u2019m not stepping one foot out of this car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine, I promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromise what?\u201d I tested.</p><p>\u201cI promise that if you want to leave, we will. Even though you won\u2019t want to leave at all because these seats are choice. You can probably high-five your friend if you want to.\u201d</p><p>My legs shook as Joey took my hand, leading me toward the blue and orange gate. Security checked my bag before ushering me through in a slightly less friendly way than I was used to. New Yorkers are a little more brash.</p><p>We walked down the stairs toward the field. I could tell by Joey\u2019s pace that we weren\u2019t stopping anytime soon. My stomach knotted up while my heart struggled to remain consistently beating. I refused to look around for Jack, terrified at how my body would react.</p><p>When he stopped at the very front row, he turned around and threw out his arms. \u201cWell? What do you think? Pretty great, right?\u201d he asked, clearly proud of his seat-purchasing ability.</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. They\u2019re really close to the field,\u201d I said between laboring breaths, my gaze desperately pinned to his face.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d He put his hand on my shoulder and I winced.</p><p>\u201cI need to get a drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get it for you,\u201d he offered, his face creased with worry.</p><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s okay. I need to use the restroom too. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d I tried to force a smile, but my lips felt broken as I rushed back up the stairs and out of view.</p><p>I sprinted to the closest bathroom, locking the stall door behind me as my upper body crumpled. With my head between my knees, I began rocking back and forth.</p><p>Stop it. You\u2019re acting like an idiot. Jack won\u2019t see you. He never looks up in the stands. He doesn\u2019t even like you anymore, so stop freaking out. It\u2019s time you moved on with your life and got over Jack Carter once and for all. You have got to stop thinking about him because he is clearly not thinking about you.</p><p>I nodded as my own thoughts struck a chord within me. I could do this. I could be strong. I could watch Jack play baseball and not want to die from it.</p><p>I think.</p><p>A few more calming breaths and I unlocked the latch, walking out to face my reflection in the mirror. I wiped at the smears of mascara under my eyes and washed my hands under the running cold water.</p><p>I stopped at a concession stand to buy a bottle of water before heading back down to our dugout level seats. Joey smiled as he caught sight of me, his bright white teeth a welcome sign to anyone.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d He stood up and took my elbow in concern before sitting down again as I plopped into my seat.</p><p>\u201cMuch better, thanks,\u201d I answered, taking a drink of water.</p><p>\u201cSo which one\u2019s your friend from school? Can you tell?\u201d</p><p>If seeing Jack didn\u2019t kill me tonight, this guy\u2019s questions were sure going to. I couldn\u2019t really get mad at Joey, he didn\u2019t know any better. It\u2019s not like I\u2019d told him Jack was my ex-boyfriend whom I\u2019d given my entire heart to and he\u2019d given it back to me in pieces. Want a sliver?</p><p>I squinted my eyes and pretended to look around the field for Jack. \u201cI can\u2019t tell, sorry. They all look alike in their uniforms.\u201d I bit my bottom lip.</p><p>\u201cDo you know if he starts? Or what position he plays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea, honestly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what did he play in college?\u201d He kept pushing questions at me and I wanted to scream.</p><p>\u201cHe was a pitcher,\u201d I replied, forcing back the burning in my chest with another gulp of water.</p><p>\u201cAhhhh, I see.\u201d Joey nodded. \u201cThen he might not even play tonight. I\u2019m sorry if he doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay. I wasn\u2019t planning on watching him anyway. You forced me here, remember?\u201d I attempted to smile and he tossed an arm around my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t even told me your friend\u2019s name. What is it?\u201d</p><p>Jesus. This guy was relentless.</p><p>\u201cJack Carter.\u201d I almost stumbled on his name. I hadn\u2019t said it out loud to anyone in almost six months, not counting Dean or Melissa.</p><p>\u201cYou know Jack Carter?\u201d His jaw dropped before he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s an incredible player! And he\u2019s starting tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? He\u2019s starting?\u201d I braced myself.</p><p>\u201cYeah! Pretty cool, huh?\u201d He leaned his head back before tossing some peanuts in his mouth.</p><p>By the time the game started, my body was filled with so much anxiety that I kept shifting in my seat. I grinned as Jack walked onto the field, pleased to see that he still sported the number twenty-three on the back of his jersey.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your boy, right?\u201d Joey said, pointing at Jack as he made his way to the mound for pre-game warm-ups.</p><p>Was.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d My eyes followed the lines of Jack\u2019s new uniform, noting the muscle he\u2019d gained in his legs and chest. He took my breath away.</p><p>Jack stood on the mound, every motion and move he made careening through me with familiarity. The fluid movements of his body\u2014the way it bent, curved, kicked, and then released the ball\u2014destroyed me emotionally.</p><p>Tears started to burn my eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t be here. I have to go.\u201d I bolted from my seat, shooting up the cement stairs.</p><p>\u201cCassie! Cassie, wait!\u201d Horrified at the volume at which Joey shouted my name, I stopped dead in my tracks and turned slowly to face him. Then I made the mistake of glancing at the field.</p><p>Jack\u2019s eyes were focused on me, the look on his face unlike any expression I\u2019d ever seen on him before. My hand flew to my mouth as Joey reached me, placing his arm protectively around me. I noticed Jack\u2019s jaw working as he dropped his head and refocused his attention toward the batter\u2019s box.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Cassie?\u201d Joey asked, his arm still circled around my waist.</p><p>\u201cJack and I used to date.\u201d I pursed my lips together and squeezed my eyes shut.</p><p>\u201cWas it serious?\u201d His voice sounded confused but curious.</p><p>\u201cIt was.\u201d I took a quick breath and opened my eyes, and looked squarely into his. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t end well. I\u2019m sorry, Joey, I should have told you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not obligated to tell me anything you\u2019re not comfortable with. You basically told me earlier that you didn\u2019t want to come, but I didn\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d I tilted my head to one side and he rubbed my neck.</p><p>\u201cLook, Cassie, I like you. I\u2019d still like to take you out. But I promise, no more baseball games.\u201d He threw up his hands in a surrender pose.</p><p>I snickered. \u201cThat sounds nice. But right now I really want to go home. Would you mind dropping me off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not. Come on.\u201d Joey reached for my hand, interlocking his fingers with mine as he guided me away from the stadium and Jack. I climbed the stairs behind him grimly, the look I\u2019d seen on Jack\u2019s face running circles in my already fragile mind.</p><p>TWENTY-THREE</p><p>After Joey dropped me off, I ran upstairs and slammed my apartment door, tossing my body like a rag doll onto the gently-used couch I\u2019d purchased as soon as I arrived in New York. I cried into the velvet-like cushion, my tears soaking in as I reached for my cell phone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYo,\u201d Melissa answered, rowdy cheers screaming in the background.</p><p>\u201cMelis?\u201d I choked out.</p><p>\u201cCass? What\u2019s wrong? Shit, I can\u2019t hear anything. Hold on a sec, \u2019K?\u201d She didn\u2019t really ask. \u201cExcuse me. I said excuse me, move please. Ugh. Cass? Cassie, can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>The noise faded into the background with each word she said. \u201cOh my God, Melissa. I saw Jack tonight. He saw me. It was horrible.\u201d The words tumbled from my lips.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean? Slow down and tell me everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI finally agreed to go out with Joey from work. He\u2019s super nice, by the way, but anyway. I guess he overheard me talking to someone about how I was good friends with a baseball player in college and how that player was on the Diamondbacks. Well, Joey thought it would be sweet to surprise me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, he didn\u2019t. This guy needs a Cassie 101 lesson,\u201d she interrupted.</p><p>\u201cAnyway, so he won\u2019t tell me where we\u2019re going and then we pull up at the baseball stadium because they\u2019re playing Jack\u2019s team and Jack was warming up and I lost it, Melissa. I fucking lost it.\u201d I covered my eyes with one hand.</p><p>\u201cGo on.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I practically ran from my seat and Joey screamed my name. I mean, he shouted it so loud I think the people in space heard!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d Melissa sounded horrified.</p><p>\u201cI turned around and Jack was just staring at me with this look on his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. My. God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that look on his face before. I think he hates me.\u201d I sobbed into the phone, wishing she was next to me.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t hate you. Stop saying that,\u201d she chastised, her voice irritated.</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t see his face or his eyes. What do I do? Should I text him? Should I do nothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so tired of doing nothing when it comes to him. For the last six months, I\u2019ve just accepted that he hasn\u2019t tried to talk to me. But the whole time I\u2019m sitting here going insane trying to figure out why. I know I could end all my suffering by picking up the phone and talking to him. But do I do that? No, because that\u2019s what a normal, sane person would do. And clearly, I\u2019m neither.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should text him. Or call. But you\u2019re right. You should say something. This has got to stop between you two. Either work it out, or give each other closure and move the hell on.\u201d</p><p>The word closure caused my insides to twist again. \u201cI don\u2019t want closure. I don\u2019t want to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you don\u2019t,\u201d she agreed calmly, \u201cbut this thing between the two of you...whatever it is...I know it\u2019s not good for you. I don\u2019t give a fuck if it\u2019s good for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, well, I think I\u2019ll call him while he\u2019s still playing and leave him a voice mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWimp.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know, but that way the ball\u2019s in his court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me know what happens. Love you.\u201d She made a kissy sound into the phone before hanging up, and I dialed Jack\u2019s number.</p><p>Straight to voice mail. \u201cHey, Jack, it\u2019s me...Cassie. I just wanted to apologize for the craziness at the game tonight. It\u2019s sort of a long story, but I...\u201d I paused, my chest deflating. \u201cI just miss you.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t call back.</p><p>Two weeks passed since the game which Melissa and I now referred to as \u201cthe incident\u201d whenever it was discussed.</p><p>My doorman\u2019s kind and raspy voice blared through the speaker box in my apartment. \u201cMiss Andrews, there\u2019s a package down here for you. Do you want me to bring it up, or would you like to come get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you bring it up, Fred? I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201d I released the button before quickly pressing it again. \u201cUnless you\u2019re busy, then I can come down. Whatever is more convenient for you, Fred. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, Miss Andrews. I\u2019ll be up soon.\u201d</p><p>I plopped back onto my couch and continued to watch TV until the doorbell rang. I opened it to see Fred, dressed in his dark gray work suit and black bow tie. He was all smiles as he warned, \u201cCareful, Miss Andrews, it\u2019s really heavy.\u201d He heaved the package into my arms.</p><p>\u201cHoly crap, Fred, what the heck is this? Someone sending me weights? I\u2019m sorry you had to carry this all the way up. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a problem, Miss Andrews. It\u2019s my job,\u201d he said with a warm smile that made me want to wrap my arms around him and squeeze.</p><p>I closed the door as he left, lugging the incredibly heavy package back onto the couch with me. I tore through the brown paper wrapping to reveal an old shoebox with a note on top.</p><p>I can\u2019t live without your Touch. You\u2019ll see that I\u2019ve provided enough money to pay for at least twenty years or so.</p><p>I lifted the lid to reveal the entire contents of the box filled with quarters. My heart raced as my mind tried to figure out if this meant what I thought it did. I glanced toward the corner of my living room where the original mason jar filled with Cassie\u2019s Quarters sat on a shelf. Confused, I reached for my cell to call Melissa when my doorbell rang again.</p><p>I tossed my cell on top of the quarters and shoved off the couch to answer the door. I cocked my head when I noticed Fred standing there, holding another box in his arms. \u201cFred?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry I didn\u2019t call. I just figured I\u2019d bring this one up too.\u201d He held the package out and I grabbed it, relieved that it didn\u2019t weigh three hundred pounds like the first one.</p><p>Confusion sprinted marathons through my head. \u201cWas this with the original package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, miss, it arrived separately.\u201d Fred gave me a big smile.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks again,\u201d I said before closing the door and returning to my seat on the couch.</p><p>I tore through the same brown paper wrapping to reveal another box with a note on top.</p><p>Your Passion is inspiring. I can\u2019t live without the way you use it to see the world.</p><p>I opened the lid to reveal four individually framed photos that I had taken for the magazine\u2019s website over the last few months. One of them was from when I\u2019d first gotten here. He\u2019d chosen some of my favorites of the scenes I\u2019d shot of the city, the people I\u2019d captured, and the way a building caught the light of the sunset. He\u2019d been following my work the whole time.</p><p>The bell ringing caused me to jump from my current revelation. I peered from around the door to see Fred standing there yet again, another package in tow. \u201cFred, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not really sure, Miss Andrews. They just keep arriving.\u201d He shrugged.</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t be. It\u2019s kind of fun!\u201d He laughed.</p><p>\u201cWho keeps bringing them?\u201d I asked, wondering if Jack was here before I realized that his team played in Houston this week.</p><p>\u201cSome young kid,\u201d he offered.</p><p>\u201cWeird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeird indeed.\u201d He nodded before turning away.</p><p>I took two steps toward the table closest to the door and sat, peeling the wrapping back.</p><p>Your Mind is filled with tests and goals and reasons why you should always say no. But I can\u2019t live without you and here are reasons why you should say yes.</p><p>I removed a framed eight-by-ten photo of my rules typed in a girlish font that I wondered who helped him pick out.</p><p>Cassie\u2019s Rules for a Happy Life:</p><p>#1 \u2013 Don\u2019t Lie</p><p>#2 \u2013 Don\u2019t Cheat</p><p>#3 \u2013 Don\u2019t Make Promises You Can\u2019t Keep</p><p>#4 \u2013 Don\u2019t Say Things You Don\u2019t Mean</p><p>Attached underneath rule number four was a handwritten note taped to the glass.</p><p>I know I\u2019ve broken your rules and I don\u2019t deserve a second chance, but I promise you that I\u2019ll never break them again. I think it was Ghandi who said, \u201cForgiveness is the attribute of the strong.\u201d I hope you have the strength to forgive me.</p><p>#1 \u2013 I lied because I was terrified of losing you. I know that\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s the only reason I have for being untruthful. I\u2019ll never lie to you again.</p><p>#2 \u2013 This one kills me more than I can put into words. I have no excuse for my behavior that night but I can only tell you that I\u2019ll never even look at another girl again if that\u2019s what it takes. I\u2019ll never drink another drop. Just tell me what I have to do to get you to forgive me. I\u2019m not asking you to forget, just forgive.</p><p>#3 \u2013 I promise to spend the rest of my life making you happy if you\u2019ll let me.</p><p>#4 \u2013 I told you once that you were my game changer. I meant it then and it still holds true now. There\u2019s no getting over you.</p><p>Tears dropped from my eyes as my heart caught in my throat. All my emotions jumbled together as I tried to sort them out but failed.</p><p>Another quick ring of the bell and I didn\u2019t even attempt to wipe my eyes before I answered it. \u201cHi, Fred,\u201d I said, the tears still rolling down.</p><p>\u201cGood tears or bad tears?\u201d His tired eyes widened at the sight of me.</p><p>\u201cGood tears.\u201d I snickered.</p><p>\u201cWhew!\u201d he exclaimed as he playfully wiped the non-existent sweat from his brow. \u201cHere\u2019s the latest.\u201d He handed me a large manila envelope.</p><p>\u201cThanks again.\u201d I reached for it before closing the door, already undoing the small fastener on the back.</p><p>Eye-rolling is bad for you, Kitten, and here are the reasons why.</p><p>I laughed out loud as I turned through the pages filled with ridiculous pictures of people and pets rolling their eyes. He attached a few completely made-up articles about \u201cThe Unknown Dangers of Eye-Rolling!\u201d</p><p>I rolled my eyes as the doorbell rang for the last time. \u201cFred. I feel like I should just leave my door open for the rest of the night,\u201d I teased.</p><p>\u201cThis is the last one, Miss Andrews,\u201d he said, handing me the last brown paper-wrapped box.</p><p>I breathed in deeply before giving Fred a quick hug. \u201cThank you for not getting irritated by all of this, Fred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been fun. Have a good night.\u201d He closed the door for me as I settled into the couch next to the box of quarters.</p><p>I unwrapped the box more slowly, knowing that it would be the last. There was an envelope taped to the top of the box that said Read Me First. With my emotions in overdrive, I ripped open the envelope, reaching for the paper inside.</p><p>Kitten,</p><p>Letting go of someone who owns your heart is hard. Sometimes holding on to that person is even harder. I know I\u2019m not the easiest person to love, but you are.</p><p>It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t live without you; it\u2019s that I don\u2019t want to. There\u2019s a difference. We all make choices in life and I choose you.</p><p>My heart belongs to you. And I\u2019m not asking for it back, even if you don\u2019t want it anymore. I\u2019m just asking for the chance to have yours again. I promise I\u2019ll be more careful with it this time.</p><p>Love Always,</p><p>Jack</p><p>I opened the box, the tears blurring my vision almost completely as I looked inside. The box was empty, except for a lone envelope that sat taped to the bottom with the words Read Me Last written in black Sharpie marker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>My finger tore through the thick sealed paper before pulling out the small note folded over once.</p><p>Kitten,</p><p>Open your front door.</p><p>My head spun around and my mouth opened as I eyed my front door, unsure of what would be behind it. I hopped off the couch, turned the knob, and pulled it open.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God.\u201d</p><p>Jack stood outside my door carrying a dozen red roses. It was only once he lowered his arms that I could see the uniform he was wearing. The word Mets was written across an all-white jersey with dark blue and orange lettering. It reminded me of his old uniform from college and my mind instantly flashed back to seeing him on the mound. \u201cWhy are you wearing a Mets jersey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI got traded.\u201d The sound of his voice melted through my every pore like butter, instantly sending me back in time.</p><p>\u201cThey traded you?\u201d I managed to ask through my surprise.</p><p>\u201cWell, technically,\u201d he said, his trademark dimples flashing, \u201cI asked.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou asked what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked to be traded to the Mets.\u201d He looked down at his feet.</p><p>I rapped my knuckles against the manager\u2019s glass door. He looked up from his computer. \u201cCome in.\u201d He motioned with his hand before glaring at me. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Carter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, um, I know this is really unorthodox but I was wondering if I could get traded, sir,\u201d I asked him nervously. My agents were going to kill me when they heard what I was attempting to do.</p><p>\u201cWhy the hell do you want to go and do that?\u201d he snapped as the irritation spread across his face.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I love this sport and I want to play. But there\u2019s a girl I love too. And the only way I can have both is if I move.\u201d</p> <p>I sound like a total pussy.</p><p>He is going to ream me for this.</p><p>He dug out a pencil from the mess on his desk and twirled it around in his fingers while he thought a moment, before he used it to point at me. \u201cSo you\u2019re telling me that you want me to put you up for the eligible trade options because you need to be closer to some girl?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not just some girl, sir. And I know it sounds bad, but I need this. If it\u2019s possible, I need this. And if it\u2019s not, just tell me. I won\u2019t ask you again. But I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I didn\u2019t at least ask.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSon, you realize that you can live with this girl during the off-season, right? That\u2019s three, sometimes four months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not enough time,\u201d I responded respectfully.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s this special girl live?\u201d He tapped the pencil against his desk in an irritated rat-a-tat.</p><p>\u201cNew York.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell! We\u2019re in New York a couple times a season. And Florida and Boston aren\u2019t far!\u201d He stopped and glared at me. \u201cAnd you\u2019re telling me you\u2019d like me to trade you to New York? You know after your contract expires, they won\u2019t have the budget to pay you like we have?\u201d He threw the pencil down on his desk before he stood up to face me with his hands on his hips.</p><p>\u201cWith all due respect, sir, it\u2019s not about the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you live here now?\u201d My eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cJust got in. Can I come in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Yes.\u201d I stumbled as I moved aside, and gestured for him to come in.</p><p>\u201cThese are for you.\u201d He pushed the roses toward me.</p><p>\u201cThank you. They\u2019re beautiful,\u201d I replied, sniffing at them before moving to put them on the counter in the kitchen.</p><p>He looked around my apartment, taking in the details, then focused on the pile of things he had sent.</p><p>\u201cI see you got my gifts.\u201d He motioned toward the couch.</p><p>\u201cMm-hmmm,\u201d I mumbled, still in shock that he was actually here.</p><p>\u201cCassie.\u201d He moved his body close to mine and ran his fingers through my hair, tucking pieces behind my ear. I scanned the scruff on his face, the black of his hair, the chocolate color of his eyes, before reaching out to touch him.</p><p>\u201cDo you still love me?\u201d he asked, his eyes unsure.</p><p>\u201cI never stopped,\u201d I admitted breathlessly.</p><p>\u201cMe either.\u201d He grabbed the back of my neck and pulled his mouth to mine. His tongue caressed mine with slow, deliberate movements, and if I could have turned to liquid and dissolved into his arms, I would have.</p><p>He pulled away, his hand still caressing my neck. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for lying to you that morning. I\u2019m sorry for cheating on you that night. I\u2019m sorry for not being the person you knew I could be.\u201d He leaned in, his mouth sucking lightly on my bottom lip before kissing me again. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know if you can ever forgive me, but I\u2019d never forgive myself if I didn\u2019t at least ask you to try.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry it took me so long to get here. She was fighting the annulment and it took months to get it processed and finalized. I refused to come fight for you while I was still carrying that baggage. But it took a lot longer than I had expected. I should have called you. And I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated me,\u201d I whispered. Unable to look at him, I dropped my gaze to his chest.</p><p>He reached for my chin before tilting my head up, forcing me to meet his eyes. \u201cI could never hate you. I thought I was going to have to come before the annulment was complete when I\u2019d heard about you and the guy from your work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you know who he was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDean. I kept tabs on you, Kitten. Not in a creepy way, I swear. Just in a making-sure-I-wasn\u2019t-going-to-lose-you-all-over-again way. See, you\u2019ve always been able to see past the front I put up. I never thought I\u2019d be able to find someone who would know the real me and still want to stick around. And then I saw you at that frat party and my life was never the same.\u201d</p><p>A tear ran slowly down my cheek as he continued. \u201cI know I don\u2019t deserve you, but I need you.\u201d He finished talking and wiped the tear from my cheek with his thumb, his touch reminding me how much I\u2019ve missed it.</p><p>\u201cI need you too. I hate feeling vulnerable and I want to pretend like I don\u2019t, but it would be a lie,\u201d I said with a half smile.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t pretend. Tell me you\u2019ll try to forgive me so we can move on from our past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have,\u201d I admitted, and felt the weight of trying to be strong for so long drop away from me. I felt lighter and freer than I had in a very long time.</p><p>Jack leaned his forehead against mine. \u201cI\u2019ll earn your trust again. I promise.\u201d</p><p>I leaned into him, burying my head into his shoulders as I wrapped my arms around him. I smiled into his neck, and snuggled closer as I closed my eyes with happiness. Then I lifted my mouth to his ear and breathed two little words.</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p><p>One Year Later</p><p>Jack walked into our apartment while I cooked dinner. He\u2019d just gotten back from an away game, and his stuff was scattered in every direction, making the living room look like a bomb had gone off. \u201cYou\u2019re such a slob. At least throw your crap in the bedroom where it belongs,\u201d I teased from behind the stove.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll throw you in the bedroom where you belong,\u201d he sassed, his dimples appearing on his tanned cheeks.</p><p>He\u2019d moved in that night when he first arrived in New York last year, refusing to leave me ever again and I didn\u2019t object, even though his presence made my already cramped apartment even smaller. With two incomes, we were soon able to afford to move into a nicer apartment in Sutton Place, not far from Central Park on the east side of the city. My commute to work became longer, but it was worth it to live in this gorgeous place with him. Our view consisted of the Upper East Side and we spent our evenings on the balcony as often as we could.</p><p>Jack took it as a sign when they offered us a two-bedroom apartment on the twenty-third floor. \u201cIt\u2019s my number, babe. We\u2019ve gotta take it!\u201d And after we toured the place, admiring its granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, and marble bathrooms, I couldn\u2019t agree more. The fact that it had a fitness center and a pool was just an added perk. I also felt safe living here, what with the twenty-four-hour doorman and the front lobby concierge.</p><p>Jack traveled frequently with the team and I was often away on assignment for work, so the security of our apartment while we were out of town or if I was home alone gave us both much-needed peace of mind. Not to mention the fact that Jack was a Mets player now, which made him a local celebrity in New York. Fans had tried to sneak into our place on more than one occasion. We found it necessary to give our doormen extra bonuses last Christmas for their efforts.</p><p>We loved living in Manhattan, the hustle and craziness unlike anything we\u2019d ever known in Southern California. The people were also completely different. For us, it was a welcome change of pace that suited us for now.</p><p>As I stirred the pasta, the sparkle of the diamond shining from my left hand caught my eye. I glanced down at it with a smile. The three-carat round diamond mounted on a diamond-encrusted band practically took up my entire finger, but I didn\u2019t mind. It was the most beautiful ring I\u2019d ever seen and more than I\u2019d ever dreamed of.</p><p>We hadn\u2019t set a date yet, what with Jack\u2019s limited time off between the season ending and spring training, plus my assignments that seemed to pop up without warning. I didn\u2019t mind, though. For now, it was simply enough just to be together and know where our future was headed. Especially after living through the time when I thought our relationship was dead and buried, with no chance for resuscitation. If we could get through that, we were certain we could get through anything.</p><p>\u201cI picked up my mess. Happy?\u201d Jack walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist, then dropped a kiss on my neck.</p><p>\u201cYes. Thank you.\u201d I turned, his lips moving to mine with a passionate fire we\u2019d yet to put out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired of waiting to make you Mrs. Carter.\u201d He grabbed my left hand and kissed the top of my ring finger. \u201cMarry me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d I laughed, pulling my hand from his lips.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d His brown eyes narrowed with his smile.</p><p>\u201cIf I can wait for a real wedding with all of our friends and family, then you can too.\u201d I kissed his nose before turning back to the bubbling water.</p><p>\u201cFine. But I\u2019m just going to tell everyone you\u2019re my wife, whether it\u2019s official or not.\u201d He pressed his body against my back.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so weird.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the weird one. What kind of girl can just wait patiently to get married?\u201d he whispered into my ear, nibbling on my lobe before chills raced through me and I shoved him away.</p><p>\u201cThe kind of girl who doesn\u2019t need to a piece of paper to tell her how to feel. The kind who knows that being married won\u2019t change anything between us.\u201d I turned again, wrapping my arms around his neck and pulling him close. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of girl who wants to share our special day with everyone who\u2019s important to us. They deserve it. It\u2019s not like we\u2019ve made it on easy on them.\u201d</p><p>He exhaled through his nose. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Plus, Gran and Gramps would kill us if we eloped.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about!\u201d I chuckled.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s set a date though, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d I conceded, pouring the boiling water and pasta into a strainer in the sink, the steam rising around my face.</p><p>\u201cTonight.\u201d His voice echoed as he walked toward the calendar on the wall.</p> <p>\u201cSo pick a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re not on assignment?\u201d He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cJack.\u201d I grabbed a jar, pouring the contents into a bowl and stirring before I continued. \u201cPick a date and I\u2019ll tell the office on Monday.\u201d His expression softened with my words.</p><p>He flipped the calendar to November before muttering to himself, \u201cNovember has Thanksgiving, and then December is Christmas. No one wants to have to go to a wedding during the holidays. I think we should wait until after New Year\u2019s. What do you think about a January wedding?\u201d</p><p>He glanced over, his hand still holding the calendar. \u201cJanuary sounds cold.\u201d I shivered over-dramatically to make my point.</p> <p>\u201cNot if we get married back home,\u201d he suggested, as if it was the most obvious plan in the world.</p><p>\u201cYay!\u201d I squealed, delighted at the thought. \u201cJanuary sounds totally doable then! I love January.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlright, woman, you become a Carter on January twelfth.\u201d His dimples deepened as his smile widened.</p><p>I glanced down at my ring, its brilliance losing focus as my eyes blurred with an unexpected tear. \u201cCassie Carter. I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitten Carter. I like the sound of that better,\u201d he said, as I placed two plates on our table.</p><p>\u201cJanuary twelfth,\u201d I repeated, watching as his eyes relaxed with the permanence of our decision. I smiled as I scooped out a heaping serving of pasta and placed it on Jack\u2019s plate.</p> <p>Jack twirled the pasta against his spoon before looking up and smiling at me. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to knock you up and have a whole team of little baseball players running around this place!\u201d He reached under the table and rested his hand on my thigh, then slid it upwards teasingly.</p><p>\u201cSlow down, Mr. Carter!\u201d I swatted his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cAw, come on, Kitten. Let\u2019s start now.\u201d He badgered me good-naturedly, sensing my discomfort.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a discussion for another time. Like after we\u2019re married,\u201d I insisted as warmth coursed through my cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAlright. On January thirteenth, we\u2019ll start making babies.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
