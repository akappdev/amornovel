My heels clicked across the dark marble of the massive lobby with a tempo that echoed my racing heart. With damp palms, I slid my ID across the security desk. My nervousness only increased after I accepted my visitors badge and headed to the elevator.</p><p>Have you ever wanted something so bad, you couldn\u2019t imagine not having it?</p><p>There were two things in my life I\u2019d felt that way about: the man I\u2019d stupidly fallen in love with and the administrative assistant position I was about to interview for.</p> <p>The man had turned out to be really bad for me; the job could change my life in an amazing way. I couldn\u2019t even think about walking away from the interview without nailing it. I just had this feeling, deep inside me, that working as Lei Yeung\u2019s assistant was what I needed to spread my wings and fly.</p><p>Still, despite my inner pep talk, my breath caught when I stepped out onto the tenth floor and saw the smoked-glass entrance to Savor, Inc. The company\u2019s name was emblazoned in a metallic feminine font across the double doors, challenging me to dream big and relish every moment.</p><p>Waiting to enter, I studied the number of well-dressed young women sitting around the reception area. Unlike me, they weren\u2019t wearing last season\u2019s styles secondhand. I doubted any of them had held three jobs to help pay for college, either. I was at a disadvantage in nearly every way, but I\u2019d known that and I wasn\u2019t intimidated...much.</p><p>I was buzzed through the security doors and took in the caf\u00e9-au-lait walls covered with photos of celebrity chefs and trendy restaurants. There was a faint aroma of sugar cookies in the air, a comforting scent from my childhood. Even that didn\u2019t relax me.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I checked in with the receptionist, a pretty African-American girl with an easy smile, then I stepped away to find a bare place against the wall to stand. Was my scheduled appointment time\u2014for which I was nearly half an hour early\u2014a joke? I soon realized that everyone was set for a brisk five-minute audience, and they were marched in and out precisely on time.</p> <p>My skin flushed with a light mist of nervous perspiration.</p><p>When my name was called, I pushed away from the wall so quickly that I wobbled on my heels, my clumsiness mirroring my shaky confidence. I followed a young, attractive guy down the hall to a corner office with an open, unmanned reception area and another set of double doors that led into Lei Yeung\u2019s seat of power.</p><p>He showed me in with a smile. \u201cGood luck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>As I passed through those doors, I was struck first by the cool modern vibe of the decor, then by the woman who sat behind a walnut desk that dwarfed her. She might\u2019ve been lost in the vast space, with its stunning views of the Manhattan skyline, if not for the striking crimson of her reading glasses, which perfectly matched the stain on her full lips.</p><p>I took a moment to really get a good look at her, admiring how the strip of silver hair at her right temple had been artfully arranged into her elaborate updo. She was slender, with a graceful neck and long arms. And when she looked up from my application to consider me, I felt exposed and vulnerable.</p> <p>She slid her glasses off and sat back. \u201cHave a seat, Gianna.\u201d</p><p>I moved across the cream-colored carpet and took one of the two chrome-and-leather chairs in front of her desk.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said, belatedly hearing a trace of my Brooklyn accent, which I\u2019d practiced hard to suppress. She didn\u2019t seem to pick up on it.</p><p>\u201cTell me about yourself.\u201d</p><p>I cleared my throat. \u201cWell, this spring I graduated magna cum laude from the University of Nevada at Las Vegas\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just read that on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\u201d She softened her words with a slight smile. \u201cTell me something I don\u2019t already know about you. Why the restaurant industry? Sixty percent of new establishments fail within the first five years. I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ours. My family has run a restaurant in Little Italy for three generations,\u201d I said proudly.</p><p>\u201cSo why not work there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have you.\u201d I swallowed. That was way too personal. Lei Yeung didn\u2019t seem rattled by the gaffe, but I was. \u201cI mean, we don\u2019t have your magic,\u201d I added quickly.</p><p>\u201cWe...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d I paused to collect myself. \u201cI have three brothers. They can\u2019t all take over Rossi\u2019s when our dad retires and they don\u2019t want to. The oldest will and the other two...well, they want their own Rossi\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your contribution is a degree in restaurant management and a lot of heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to learn how to help them realize their dreams. I want to help other people achieve theirs, too.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and reached for her glasses. \u201cThank you, Gianna. I appreciate you coming in today.\u201d</p><p>Just like that, I was dismissed. And I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get the job. I hadn\u2019t said whatever she\u2019d needed to hear to make me the clear-cut winner.</p><p>I stood, my mind racing with ways I could turn the interview around. \u201cI really want this job, Ms. Yeung. I work hard. I\u2019m never sick. I\u2019m proactive and forward-thinking. It won\u2019t take me long to anticipate what you need before you need it. I\u2019ll make you glad you hired me.\u201d</p><p>Lei looked at me. \u201cI believe you. You juggled multiple jobs while maintaining your honors GPA. You\u2019re smart, determined and not afraid to hustle. I\u2019m sure you\u2019d be great. I just don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the right boss for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d My stomach twisted as my dream job slipped away. Disappointment pierced through me.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d she said gently. \u201cTrust me. There are a hundred restaurateurs in New York who can give you what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p><p>I lifted my chin. I used to be proud of my looks, my family, my roots. I hated that I was constantly second-guessing all of that now.</p><p>Impulsively, I decided to reveal why I wanted to work with her so badly. \u201cMs. Yeung, please listen. You and I have a lot in common. Ian Pembry underestimated you, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes blazed with sudden fire at the unexpected mention of her former partner who\u2019d betrayed her. She didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>I had nothing to lose at this point. \u201cThere was a man in my life who underestimated me once. You proved people wrong. I just want to do the same.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head to the side. \u201cI hope you do.\u201d</p><p>Realizing I\u2019d come to the end of the road, I thanked her for her time and left with as much dignity as I could manage.</p><p>As far as Mondays went, that was one of the worst of my life.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M TELLING YOU, she\u2019s an idiot,\u201d Angelo said for the second time. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t get that job today.\u201d</p><p>I was the baby of the family, with three big brothers. He was the youngest. His righteous anger on my behalf made me smile despite myself.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Nico said. The oldest of the Rossi boys\u2014and biggest prankster\u2014bumped Angelo out of the way to set my meal in front of me with a flourish.</p><p>I\u2019d chosen to sit at the bar, since Rossi\u2019s was packed as usual, the dinner crowd boisterous and familiar. We had a lot of regulars and often a celebrity or two, incognito, who came here to eat in peace. The comfortable mix was a solid sign of Rossi\u2019s great reputation for warm service and excellent food.</p><p>Angelo bumped Nico back with a scowl. \u201cI\u2019m always right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d Vincent scoffed through the kitchen window, sliding two steaming plates onto the service shelf and ripping the corresponding tickets off their clips. \u201cOnly when you\u2019re repeating what I said.\u201d</p><p>The ribbing coaxed a reluctant laugh out of me. I felt a hand at my waist the moment before I smelled my mother\u2019s favorite Elizabeth Arden perfume.</p><p>Her lips pressed against my cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you smile. Everything happens\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2014for a reason,\u201d I finished. \u201cI know. It still sucks.\u201d</p><p>I was the only one in my family who\u2019d gone to college. It\u2019d been a group effort; even my brothers had pitched in. I couldn\u2019t help feeling like I\u2019d let them all down. Sure there were hundreds of restaurateurs in New York, but Lei Yeung didn\u2019t just turn unknown chefs into name brands, she was a force of nature.</p><p>She spoke frequently about women in business and had been featured on a number of midmorning talk shows. She had immigrant parents and had worked her way through school, making a success of herself even after being betrayed by her mentor and partner. Working for her would have been a powerful statement for me.</p><p>At least, that\u2019s what I\u2019d told myself.</p><p>\u201cEat your fettuccine before it gets cold,\u201d my mother said, gliding away to greet new patrons coming in.</p><p>I forked up a bite of pasta dripping with creamy Alfredo sauce as I watched her. A lot of customers did. Mona Rossi was closer to sixty than fifty, but you\u2019d never know it from looking at her. She was beautiful and flamboyantly sexy. Her violet-red hair was teased just high enough to give it volume and frame a face that was classical in its symmetry, with full lips and dark sloe eyes. She was statuesque, with generous curves and a taste for gold jewelry.</p><p>Men and women alike loved her. My mom was comfortable in her skin, confident and seemingly carefree. Very few people realized how much trouble my brothers had given her growing up. She had them well trained now.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I absorbed the comfort around me\u2014the beloved sounds of people laughing, the mouthwatering smell of carefully prepared food, the clatter of silverware meeting china and glasses clinking in happy toasts. I wanted more out of my life, which sometimes made me forget how much I already had.</p><p>Nico came back, eyeing me. \u201cRed or white?\u201d he asked, setting his hand over mine and giving a soft squeeze.</p><p>He was a customer favorite at the bar, especially with the women. He was darkly handsome, with unruly hair and a wicked smile. A consummate flirt, he had his own fan club, ladies who hung out at the bar for both his great drinks and sexy banter.</p><p>\u201cHow about champagne?\u201d Lei Yeung slid onto the bar stool next to me, recently vacated by a young couple whose reserved table had opened up.</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>She smiled at me, looking much younger than she had during our interview, dressed casually in jeans and a pink silk shell. Her hair was down and her face scrubbed free of makeup. \u201cLots of rave reviews about this place online.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBest Italian food ever,\u201d I said, feeling my heartbeat quicken with renewed excitement.</p><p>\u201cA lot of them say a great place got even greater over the past couple of years. Am I right in assuming that\u2019s due to you putting into practice things you\u2019ve learned?\u201d</p><p>Nico set two flutes in front of us, then filled them halfway with bubbling champagne. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said, butting in.</p><p>Lei caught the stem of her glass and stroked it with her fingers. Her gaze caught mine. Nico, who was good at knowing when to disappear, moved down the bar.</p><p>\u201cTo get back to what you said...\u201d she began. I started to cringe, then straightened up. Lei Yeung hadn\u2019t made a special trip just to berate me. \u201cIan underestimated me, but he didn\u2019t take advantage of me. Blaming him would give him too much credit. I left the door open and he walked through it.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. The exact circumstances of their split were private, but I\u2019d inferred a lot from the reports in industry magazines and filled in the rest from gossip columns and blogs. Together they\u2019d had a culinary empire comprised of a stable of celebrity chefs, several restaurant chains, a line of cookbooks and affordable cookware that sold in the millions. Then Pembry had announced the launch of a new chain of eateries bankrolled by A-list actors and actresses\u2014but Lei hadn\u2019t been part of that.</p><p>\u201cHe taught me a lot,\u201d she went on. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve come to realize he got as much out of that as I did.\u201d She paused, thoughtful. \u201cI\u2019m getting too used to myself and the way I\u2019ve always done things. I need fresh eyes. I want to feed off someone else\u2019s hunger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Her mouth curved. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that until you pointed it out. I knew I was looking for something, but I couldn\u2019t say what it was.\u201d</p><p>I was totally thrilled but kept my tone professional. I swiveled toward her. \u201cI\u2019m in, if you want me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget about normal hours,\u201d she warned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a nine-to-five gig. I\u2019ll need you on weekends, and I might call in the middle of the night.... I work all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t complain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d Angelo came up behind us. All the Rossi sons had figured out who I was talking to and, as usual, none of them were shy. \u201cI need to see her every once in a while.\u201d</p><p>I elbowed him. We shared a sprawling, half-finished loft apartment in Brooklyn\u2014all three of my brothers, me and Angelo\u2019s wife, Denise. Most of the time we bitched about seeing one another too often.</p><p>Lei thrust out her hand and introduced herself to Nico and Angelo, then to my mom, who had wandered back over to see what the fuss was about. My dad and Vincent gave shout-outs through the service window. A menu was set in front of Lei, along with a basket of fresh bread and olive oil imported from a small farm in Tuscany.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the panna cotta?\u201d Lei asked me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never have better,\u201d I replied. \u201cHave you already had dinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Lesson number one\u2014life\u2019s too short. Don\u2019t put off the good stuff.\u201d</p><p>I bit on my lower lip to hold back a grin. \u201cDoes that mean I got the job?\u201d</p><p>She held up her flute with a brisk nod. \u201cCheers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter 2</p><p>One year later...</p><p>\u201cGOD, THE RUSH,\u201d Lei said, her feet tapping beneath the dining table. \u201cIt never gets old.\u201d</p><p>I grinned, having caught the bug from her over the months we\u2019d been working together. We\u2019d experienced a lot of highs, but today\u2014a cloudless late-September afternoon\u2014was special. After months of finessing and wooing, we were going to close a deal that would snag two of Ian Pembry\u2019s brightest stars. Payback for what he\u2019d done to Lei long ago and a major coup for us.</p> <p>Lei had dressed for the occasion and so had I. Her Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg wrap dress was vintage and her signature red. Paired with black boots, she looked fierce and sexy. I debuted a dark gold shell snagged from Donna Karan\u2019s fall collection and the cigarette pants the designer had paired with them. The ensemble was chic and reflected a new me, a Gianna who\u2019d evolved a lot over the previous year.</p><p>Impatient to finalize everything, I looked toward the entrance of the hotel bar and felt a surge of adrenaline when the Williams twins appeared as if on cue. Brother and sister made a striking pair, with auburn hair and jade-green eyes. They were a great team in the kitchen, having made a name for themselves with down-home Southern cooking updated with gourmet ingredients. The package they presented sold deluxe books and cute little tins of seasonings, but the truth wasn\u2019t so pretty. Behind the scenes, they hated each other.</p><p>And that had been Pembry\u2019s fatal mistake with his dynamic duo. He told them to suck it up and make it work, because they were making millions off their sibling success story. Lei had offered them what they really wanted\u2014the chance to split up and shine on their own, while still capitalizing on their supposedly playful rivalry. Her plan was to build a chain of restaurants with dueling kitchens in the world-famous Mondego casinos and resorts.</p><p>\u201cChad. Stacy,\u201d Lei greeted, rising to her feet along with me. \u201cYou\u2019re both looking fabulous.\u201d</p><p>Chad came over and pressed a kiss to my cheek before he even said hello to Lei. He\u2019d been flirting with me for a while and it had become part of our negotiations with him.</p> <p>I\u2019ll admit I\u2019d been tempted to do more than flirt on occasion, but thoughts of his sister retaliating held me back. Chad wasn\u2019t a saint by any means, nursing a fierce ambitious streak. But Stacy was a real piece of work and she hated me more than her brother. Despite all my friendly overtures, she\u2019d taken an instant dislike to me and that had seriously hindered the whole process.</p><p>Personally, I suspected she was sleeping with Ian Pembry\u2014or had been once\u2014and was carrying a torch for him. I thought that was why she didn\u2019t like Lei, either, but maybe she was just one of those females who hated other women.</p><p>\u201cI hope your rooms are comfortable,\u201d I said, knowing damn well they were. The Four Seasons didn\u2019t have its five-star reputation for nothing.</p><p>Stacy shrugged, her glossy hair sliding over her shoulder. She had an angelic face, pale with a smattering of freckles that were adorable. It was disconcerting how someone so sweet and innocent-looking, with a syrupy Southern accent, could be such a raging bitch. \u201cThey\u2019re all right.\u201d</p><p>Chad rolled his eyes and held out my chair for me. \u201cThey\u2019re great. I slept like a rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d his sister griped, sliding gracefully into her chair. \u201cIan kept calling. He knows something\u2019s up.\u201d</p> <p>She slid a side glance at Lei, as if gauging the impact of her words.</p><p>\u201cOf course he does,\u201d Lei agreed easily. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart man. Which is why I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t do more to keep you both happy. He knows better.\u201d</p><p>Stacy pouted. Chad winked at me. Usually I didn\u2019t find winking cute, but it worked for him. Part of his good-ole-boy charm that was tempered by how sexy he was. There was something about him that hinted he might spank you with a spatula as expertly as he cooked with one.</p><p>\u201cIan did a lot for us,\u201d Stacy contended. \u201cI feel disloyal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t. You haven\u2019t signed anything yet,\u201d I said, having learned reverse psychology worked best with her oppositional nature. \u201cIf you feel that your identity as the Williams twins has more potential than being Stacy Williams, you should absolutely go with your gut. It\u2019s got you this far, after all.\u201d</p><p>Out of the corner of my eye, I watched Lei\u2019s lips twitch with a repressed smile. It gave me a thrill that she was pleased, since she\u2019d taught me pretty much everything I knew about herding egos where we wanted them to go.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be an ass, Stace,\u201d Chad muttered. \u201cYou know this casino deal is a prime opportunity for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but it may not be the only opportunity,\u201d she argued. \u201cIan says we need to give him a chance to deliver.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou told him?\u201d her brother snapped, scowling. \u201cFor fuck\u2019s sake, the decision isn\u2019t just yours to make! This is my goddamn career, too!\u201d</p><p>I shot a worried glance at Lei, but she just gave a nearly imperceptible shake of her head. I couldn\u2019t believe how cool and unruffled she looked, considering this deal would be the one to finally even the score between her and her mentor-turned-nemesis.</p><p>The Hollywood eateries Ian had pulled out from under her went bust when the celebrity investors got over the novelty of it and went looking for other tax shelters that didn\u2019t involve personal appearances. And two of his heavy-hitter chefs had gone back to their home countries, leaving a lot riding on the young shoulders of the Williams twins.</p><p>\u201cThe Mondego deal is exclusive to Savor, of course,\u201d Lei said. \u201cWhat\u2019s Ian offering you?\u201d</p><p>What the hell had gone wrong? I glanced between the two siblings, and then at my boss. I had the contracts in my lucky satchel under the table. We were in the home stretch and suddenly our prime bet was backing away.</p><p>Later on, I\u2019d recognize the ripple of awareness that shimmered across my skin for what it was. At the time, I thought it was foreboding, my instincts warning me that the deal had tanked long before we\u2019d sat down at the table.</p><p>Then, I saw him.</p><p>Everything in me stilled, as if the predator couldn\u2019t see me if I didn\u2019t move. He came into the bar with a sultry stride that made my hands curl into fists beneath the tablecloth. That walk of his was easy and smooth, confident. And yet it somehow signaled to the female brain that he was packing heat between those long, strong legs and knew how to use it.</p><p>God, did he.</p><p>Dressed in a gray V-neck sweater and dress slacks of a darker hue, he looked like a successful man with the day off, but I knew better. Jackson Rutledge never took a day off. He worked hard, played hard, fucked hard.</p><p>I reached for my water glass with a shaking hand, praying he wouldn\u2019t recognize me as the girl who\u2019d once fallen hopelessly in love with him. I didn\u2019t look the same. I wasn\u2019t the same.</p><p>Jax was different, too. Leaner. Harder. His face made more stunning by the new sharpness in the angles of his jawline and cheekbones. I took a deep, quivering breath at the sight of him, reacting to his presence as if I\u2019d been physically struck.</p><p>I didn\u2019t even realize Ian Pembry was walking beside him until they stopped at our table.</p><p>\u201cWHAT ARE THE chances Jackson Rutledge is related to Senator Rutledge?\u201d Lei asked with silky evenness as we slid into the backseat of her town car. \u201cOr any of the Rutledges for that matter?\u201d</p><p>Her driver pulled away from the curb and I fumbled with my tablet just to have an excuse to keep my gaze averted. I was afraid to reveal too much, that her perceptive eyes would see how shaken I was.</p><p>\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d I said, my eyes on my tablet screen and the gorgeous face I\u2019d thought\u2014hoped\u2014I would never see again. \u201cJackson and the senator are brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is Ian doing with a Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d been asking myself the same thing as the deal I\u2019d worked so hard on fell apart in front of me\u2014we\u2019d come with contracts and pen in hand and left empty-handed. Unfortunately, I\u2019d lost track of the conversation the moment Jax had allowed Stacy to press an exuberant kiss to his cheek. The roaring of blood in my ears had drowned out everything.</p><p>Lei\u2019s crimson-tipped fingers tapped a silent staccato on the padded door handle. Manhattan spread out all around us, the streets crawling with cars and the sidewalks with people. Steam billowed sinuously from the subways buried below, while shadows claimed us from above, the sun kept at bay by towering skyscrapers that choked out the light.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I answered, slightly intimidated by the energy she radiated, that of a tigress on the hunt. Did Jackson have any idea what he\u2019d stirred by getting in Lei\u2019s way?</p><p>\u201cJackson\u2019s the only one of the Rutledge males not serving in political office somewhere in the country,\u201d I continued. \u201cHe manages Rutledge Capital, a venture capital firm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he married? Any children?\u201d</p><p>I hated that I knew the answer to that question without looking it up. \u201cNeither. He plays the field. A lot. Prefers pedigreed blondes in public, but won\u2019t turn down a roll in the hay with something...flashier in a pinch.\u201d</p><p>I couldn\u2019t help remembering how Jax\u2019s cousin-in-law, Allison Kelsey, had once described me. You\u2019re flashy, Gianna. Guys like to fuck flash. Makes \u2019em feel like they\u2019re banging a porn star. But that\u2019s what turns them off, too. Enjoy him while it lasts.</p><p>Allison\u2019s melodious voice and cruel words echoed in my mind, reminding me why I straightened my naturally wavy dark hair and had stopped maintaining the French-manicured acrylic nails that had made me feel sexy. I couldn\u2019t do anything about the genetics that gave me an overly generous ass and big boobs, but I\u2019d toned the rest of myself down, striving to be classy instead of flashy.</p><p>Lei looked at me sharply. \u201cYou got that from a five-minute search?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I sighed. \u201cI got that from five weeks in his bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Her dark eyes took on an avid gleam. \u201cSo he\u2019s the one. Well, this just got interesting.\u201d</p><p>DURING THE REMAINDER of the ride back to the office, I braced for Lei to tell me the conflict of interest was a problem. I scrambled to find a way to downplay it.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t serious,\u201d I told her as we rode the elevator up. At least not for him... \u201cMore like an extended one-night stand. I don\u2019t think he even recognized me just now.\u201d</p><p>And hell if that hadn\u2019t stung. He hadn\u2019t even looked at me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a woman a man forgets, Gianna.\u201d She looked thoughtful. \u201cI think we can work around this, but are you up for it? If this is going to get personal for you, we need to talk about that now. I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable. I also don\u2019t want to put my business at risk.\u201d</p><p>My first instinct was to lie. I wished Jax had meant as little to me as I had to him. But I respected Lei and my job too much to be untruthful. \u201cI\u2019m not indifferent to him.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI can see that. Glad you\u2019re honest about it. Let\u2019s keep you on this for now. You\u2019ll throw Rutledge off balance and we\u2019ll need that. And you\u2019re my in with Chad Williams. He likes doing business with you.\u201d</p><p>I breathed a sigh of relief. She was wrong about Jax, but I wasn\u2019t going to blow my shot by pointing that out. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>We exited onto our floor and were buzzed through the glass doors. The receptionist, LaConnie, raised her brows at me, obviously picking up on our agitated vibe. We should have returned triumphant, not frustrated.</p><p>\u201cAny idea why Rutledge would have a sudden interest in the restaurant industry?\u201d Lei asked, returning to her earlier question as we headed to her office.</p><p>\u201cIf I had to make a guess, I\u2019d say one of the Rutledges owed Pembry a favor.\u201d That was the way the Rutledge family operated. They worked together like a tightly knit team, and even though Jax wasn\u2019t a politician, he still played the game.</p><p>Lei went directly to her desk and took a seat. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to figure out what chip he\u2019s cashing in.\u201d</p><p>I caught the undercurrent of annoyance in her voice and understood it. Ian Pembry had been undermining Lei in countless ways for years, but Lei had bided her time\u2014it had been a study in patience that she admitted had made her a better businesswoman. She was determined to prove she\u2019d learned his last lesson in betrayal well and I was determined to help her.</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d I knew a little of what she felt. It still made me angry that I\u2019d jumped into bed with Jax. I\u2019d known who he was, knew his reputation, yet I\u2019d thought I was sophisticated enough to take him on.</p><p>Worse, I\u2019d deluded myself into thinking he cared. He lived in D.C.; I was in Vegas. For five weeks he\u2019d flown out to see me every weekend and the occasional weekday. I\u2019d told myself a guy as beautiful and sexy as Jax wouldn\u2019t go through all that trouble and expense just to get laid.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t considered how rich he was. Rich enough to find it entertaining to jet cross-country for a piece of tail and cautious enough to find it convenient that his inappropriate mistress was far away from both the public eye and his family.</p><p>My desk phone started ringing, and I hurried out of Lei\u2019s office to answer it. My station was set up just outside her doors, making me the last barrier visitors faced before they had an audience with her.</p><p>\u201cGianna.\u201d LaConnie\u2019s voice came clipped and quick through the receiver. \u201cJackson Rutledge is in the lobby, asking to see Lei.\u201d</p><p>I hated the way my heart gave a little kick over hearing his name. \u201cHe\u2019s here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I said,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cHave him sent up. I\u2019ll be around in a minute to show him to the conference room.\u201d I placed the receiver carefully back into its cradle and then walked back into Lei\u2019s office. \u201cRutledge is about to arrive at reception.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her brows rose. \u201cIs Ian with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLaConnie didn\u2019t say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d She glanced at the diamond-encrusted watch on her wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s nearly five o\u2019clock. You can stay for the meeting with Rutledge or head out, your choice.\u201d</p><p>I knew I should probably stay. I was already feeling like I\u2019d lost ground by freaking out at the Four Seasons. I\u2019d been too shell-shocked by Jax\u2019s unexpected appearance to grasp how the situation with the Williams twins had changed. Sadly, I wasn\u2019t in any better shape now.</p> <p>\u201cInstead of sticking around, maybe I should use this time to reach out to Chad,\u201d I suggested. \u201cGet a feel for where he\u2019s at with this. I know we wanted to take the Williams twins together, but even if we get just one, it\u2019ll hurt Pembry in a significant way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood plan.\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll do Rutledge some good to get better acquainted with me, don\u2019t you think? If Ian\u2019s led him to believe I\u2019m an easy mark, it would be smart to prove otherwise now.\u201d</p><p>I almost smiled at the thought of Jax and Lei butting heads. He was far too used to females falling all over him, for both his devastating good looks and his family name, which was as close to royalty as America got.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do some digging after I talk to Chad\u2014\u201d I backed out of the room \u201c\u2014and see if I can find the connection between Pembry and the Rutledges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She steepled her fingers together and rested her chin on the tips, studying me. \u201cForgive me for asking, Gianna\u2014but did you love Jackson?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought we loved each other.\u201d</p><p>Lei sighed. \u201cI wish that was one lesson women didn\u2019t have to learn the hard way.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>I GRABBED MY purse out of my desk drawer before I headed up to reception, clutching it like a talisman that would hurry me away from Jax before he realized who I was. The walk up to the front seemed to take a very long time.</p><p>It was a tough pill to swallow, realizing he still affected me so strongly. He\u2019d only been part of my life for a short time. I\u2019d had two other lovers since him and thought I had moved on.</p><p>He was studying a display of our bestseller cookbooks when I rounded the corner and my breath caught. His tall, powerful frame was now shown off to full advantage in an expertly tailored suit, a sign of respect for Lei I couldn\u2019t help but appreciate. I\u2019d never seen him dressed so formally in person. We\u2019d met at a bar, of all places. I\u2019d gone out with some classmates, and he was attending a bachelor party.</p> <p>I should\u2019ve known it wouldn\u2019t turn out well.</p><p>But God, he was magnificent. His dark hair was close-cropped on the sides and back, slightly longer on the top. His eyes were a brown so dark they were nearly black. Thickly lashed, they were relentless in their intensity. Had I really thought they were soft and warm? I\u2019d been blinded by that lush, sensual mouth and wicked dimple. There was nothing soft about Jackson Rutledge. He was a hard and jaded man, cut from a ruthless cloth.</p><p>He raked me from head to toe with a slow, intense look that made my fingers flex as I approached him.</p><p>It was well-known that he was a connoisseur of women. I told myself I could be anyone and get that look from him, but I knew better. My body remembered him. Remembered his touch, his scent, the way his skin felt against mine...</p><p>From the way he was looking at me, the same recollections were heating his blood, too.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Rutledge,\u201d I greeted him formally, because he still hadn\u2019t acknowledged that he knew who I was. I spoke each word carefully, in a controlled voice not quite my own. I usually didn\u2019t have to think about sounding too Brooklyn anymore, but he made me forget myself.</p><p>He made me want to forget everything.</p><p>\u201cMs. Yeung will be out in just a moment,\u201d I continued, deliberately stopping a few feet away from him. \u201cI\u2019ll show you to the conference room. Can I get you some water? Coffee? Tea?\u201d</p> <p>His chest expanded with a deep breath. \u201cNothing, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis way, then.\u201d I passed him, managing a strained smile for LaConnie as I walked by her. I could smell him, that subtle hint of bergamot and spice. I could feel his gaze on my back, my ass, my legs. It made me hyperconscious of my walk, which made me feel awkward.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word, and I was afraid to, my throat too dry to make speech comfortable. I felt a terrible yearning\u2014the almost desperate need to touch him the way I\u2019d once had a right to. It was hard to believe I\u2019d had him in my bed. Had him inside me. How had I ever had the courage to take on such a man?</p><p>I was relieved when we reached the conference room, the door handle feeling blessedly cool as I pushed it down.</p><p>His breath gusted softly over my ear. \u201cHow long are you going to pretend you don\u2019t know me, Gia?\u201d</p><p>My eyes slid closed as he purred the name only he had ever used.</p><p>Pushing the door open, I stepped inside, holding on to the handle so there was no mistaking that I wouldn\u2019t be staying.</p><p>He walked right up to me, standing face-to-face. He was a little more than a head taller\u2014even though I wore heels. His hands were in his pockets, his head bowed over me. He was in my personal space. Too intimate. Far too familiar.</p><p>\u201cPlease step back,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>He moved, but not in the way I wanted. His right hand slid out of his pocket, and then down my arm, from elbow to wrist. I felt his touch through the silk of my navy blouse and was grateful that the long sleeves hid the goose bumps.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve changed so much,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Enough that you didn\u2019t recognize me earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus. You think I didn\u2019t know it was you?\u201d He turned away, but that didn\u2019t lessen his impact. The back view was just as splendid as the front. \u201cYou could never hide from me, Gia. I\u2019d recognize you blindfolded.\u201d</p><p>Shock and confusion held my tongue for a moment. We\u2019d gone from distant and impersonal to searingly intimate in a heartbeat. \u201cWhat are you doing here, Jax?\u201d</p><p>He walked to the windows and looked out at New York. In the near distance, Central Park was a splash of green already touched with autumn-red and orange, a vibrant burst of color in a concrete jungle. \u201cI\u2019m going to offer Lei Yeung whatever it takes to make her go play in someone else\u2019s sandbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work. This is personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBusiness should never be personal.\u201d</p><p>I stepped back toward the threshold, eager to escape. The conference room was spacious and airy, with floor-to-ceiling windows on one side and clear glass on the other. The walls at either end were a soothing pale blue, with an expensively stocked bar to the right and a huge display screen to the left. Still, Jax dominated his surroundings, making me feel caged.</p><p>\u201cNothing\u2019s personal, right?\u201d I said, remembering how he\u2019d just failed to show up one day. And every day after that.</p><p>\u201cThings were between us,\u201d he said, his deep voice husky. \u201cOnce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they weren\u2019t.\u201d Not for you...</p><p>He turned abruptly, causing me to take another cautious step back even though we stood a room apart. \u201cThere are no hard feelings, then. Good. There\u2019s no reason not to pick up where we left off. My meeting with Yeung won\u2019t take long. When I\u2019m done we can head to my hotel and get reacquainted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>His mouth curved, revealing that delicious dimple. Oh, how that changed him, concealing how dangerous he was with a touch of boyish charm. I hated that playful little indentation as much as I adored it.</p><p>\u201cThere you are,\u201d he said, with an unmistakable note of triumph. \u201cYou almost had me fooled into thinking the Gia I knew was gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t toy with me, Jax. It\u2019s beneath you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you beneath me.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d known he would say that, if I opened the door, but I\u2019d had to hear it. I had to hear him spell it out. He was direct when it came to sex, sensual and natural as an animal. I loved it, because I\u2019d been that way with him, too.</p><p>Greedy. Insatiable. Nothing else had ever made me feel as good.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m seeing someone,\u201d I lied.</p><p>Visually, he didn\u2019t bat an eye, but somehow, I got the impression that struck a nerve. \u201cThat Williams guy?\u201d he asked too casually.</p><p>\u201cHello, Mr. Rutledge,\u201d Lei said, sweeping in on her killer Jimmy Choo slingbacks. \u201cI\u2019m going to assume this is a pleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt can be.\u201d He turned his attention to her so completely, I felt dismissed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to it,\u201d I said, walking out. Lei\u2019s gaze caught mine and I understood the silent message. We\u2019d be talking soon.</p><p>I didn\u2019t look at Jax again, but I still got the same message from him.</p><p>I CALLED CHAD WILLIAMS as soon as I passed through the turnstiles in the lobby. \u201cHey,\u201d I said when I heard his smooth Southern drawl. \u201cIt\u2019s Gianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have dinner plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014I can break them.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, feeling a little guilty about preempting whoever was going to be ditched, but it felt good to have a little ego-stroking. My confidence had taken a beating from seeing Jax again.</p><p>I couldn\u2019t forget how he\u2019d been with me long ago. Frisky, teasing, affectionate. If I closed my eyes, I could still feel him come up behind me, sliding my hair out of the way to press his beautiful mouth against my throat. I could still hear the way he\u2019d groan my name when he was inside me, as if the pleasure were too great to stand.</p><p>\u201cGianna? You still there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry.\u201d I started pulling out the pins that restrained my straightened hair into a sleek chignon. \u201cI know a charming Italian place. Cozy. Casual. Excellent food.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got yourself a date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call the car service. I can pick you up in about fifteen minutes. Will that work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d</p><p>TRUE TO HIS WORD, Chad was standing on the sidewalk when the car pulled up. He wore loose-fitting black jeans, boots and a dark green Henley that went great with his eyes. As far as dates went, he was prime.</p><p>He started toward the cab, then jumped back with a curse as a bike messenger sped by.</p><p>\u201cChrist almighty,\u201d he muttered as he settled into the seat beside me. He looked me over as we merged back into rush-hour traffic. \u201cI like your hair down. It suits you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d It\u2019d taken me a while to get used to wearing it up. It was so thick and heavy, the weight of it gave me headaches...like the one I had at that moment.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d I began, \u201cI have to confess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHope it\u2019s sinful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh, no. I\u2019m taking you to my parents\u2019 place.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose. \u201cYou\u2019re taking me to meet your folks?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. They own a restaurant. We won\u2019t have trouble getting a table without a reservation\u2014usually impossible on a Thursday night\u2014and they won\u2019t rush us off, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou planning on keeping me around awhile?\u201d he teased.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to. I think we could work really well together.\u201d</p><p>Chad nodded, sobering. \u201cStacy knows what you\u2019re offering is exactly what we need, but...she\u2019s sleeping with Ian and it\u2019s screwing everything up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI figured.\u201d Ian Pembry was a suave and distinguished fifty-year-old man with silvery gray hair and striking blue eyes. He wasn\u2019t handsome in the usual sense, but he had charisma and a bank balance that made a lot of women overlook his flaws. Stacy had her work cut out for her; since Lei, he\u2019d never stayed with any lover long. \u201cWhat\u2019s he offering you to stay with him?\u201d</p><p>And where does Jax fit in? Had seeing me knocked him for a loop at all?</p><p>\u201cIan says he can put something together like you\u2019ve presented and he can do it better, because Lei doesn\u2019t have what it takes. That\u2019s why she\u2019s poaching his talent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know that\u2019s crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, yeah.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be working for her if she was second-rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the Mondego resort chain is five-star all the way,\u201d I reminded him. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t work with someone second-rate, either. This is the opportunity of a lifetime, Chad. Don\u2019t let Stacy take it away from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it.\u201d His head fell back against the seat rest. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can make it separately. That\u2019s why the idea of the dueling kitchens was going to work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will work. But you can do it on your own, too.\u201d</p><p>He looked at me, his gaze searching. \u201cGive it to me straight, Gianna. You\u2019ll say anything to close this deal, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>I thought about Jax and what he\u2019d said about business not being personal. For me it was always personal. I cared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons,\u201d I admitted, Jax now being one of them. I\u2019d worked too hard to have him stroll in, toss his money around and ruin everything. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t screw you over. It doesn\u2019t get Lei or me anywhere if you\u2019re not successful. I promise you, I won\u2019t disappear as soon as the ink is dry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019ll know how to track you down through your folks,\u201d he said, relaxing.</p><p>\u201cOver thirty years in the same location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess that\u2019s as good a guarantee as anyone can get.\u201d</p><p>MY FAMILY PULLED out all the stops when we got to Rossi\u2019s, deducing who Chad was from my previous descriptions. We were seated at a corner table and everyone came by to introduce themselves, giving Chad a heaping dose of Rossi hospitality.</p><p>I had Chad take the bench seat facing the rest of the restaurant, while I took the single chair across from him. I wanted him to feel the energy, to see the faces of customers enjoying a great meal. I wanted him to remember why he wanted what Savor was offering him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Over a toast, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. This place is great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m never going to lie to you.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and I enjoyed the sound. It was a bit wild, a lot free. Very much like the man himself. I was attracted to him on a comfortable level. Nothing like the explosion of body and mind I\u2019d felt from the very first second I\u2019d laid eyes on Jax, but then no one elicited that reaction but Jackson Rutledge.</p><p>\u201cSmart bringing me here,\u201d he said, running his fingertip around the lip of his wineglass. I suspected he\u2019d prefer beer, but he didn\u2019t ask for it. \u201cMaking me see you\u2019ve got the business in your blood, too. It\u2019s not just a job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy family just opened our second Rossi\u2019s in Upper Saddle River.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNew Jersey. Posh as hell. My brother Nico is spearheading it. Just passed the three-month mark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why not hook your family up with the Mondego?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what they want. They want this\u2014\u201d I gestured around the restaurant with a sweep of my hand. \u201cCommunity. Franchising was never their dream.\u201d</p> <p>He studied me. \u201cYou make it sound like your dreams are different.\u201d</p><p>I sat back. \u201cI suppose they are. I want to help them get what they want, but I want something different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d Although I thought I had. Once upon a time... \u201cI figure I\u2019ll know it when I see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I could help you pass the time while you\u2019re waiting,\u201d he suggested boldly.</p><p>I smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s an idea, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p>Maybe he was what I needed. It\u2019d been too long since my last boyfriend. I\u2019d been working hard, leaving little time for socializing. I didn\u2019t fool myself into thinking I would magically have immunity to Jax if I got laid, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt. It would certainly take the edge off life in the interim, and Jax wouldn\u2019t be staying in New York long. His life and work was split between D.C. and northern Virginia, and soon enough, another Rutledge would need him for something. He was the family fixer.</p><p>I leaned forward, opening myself to the possibilities.</p><p>Chad\u2019s mouth curved in a very male smile, the slightly triumphant one of a man who knew he was going to score. He reached for my hand, his gaze drifting over my shoulder in a lazy way. Then he stilled, his brows lowering in a scowl. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>I knew who he was looking at before I turned around.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR CHARGE swept over my skin. I decided not to turn and give Jax the satisfaction of seeing my face, which probably showed my surprise, frustration and irritation.</p><p>He had cast-iron balls to come into Rossi\u2019s after the way he\u2019d broken my heart. My family would remember him\u2014remember that last night we\u2019d all spent together. We\u2019d been in New York on a quick weekend trip to introduce him to the family I talked so much about. We\u2019d stayed long after the restaurant closed, eating and drinking and laughing with my brothers and my parents. They\u2019d fallen in love with him just as I had. That was the night I\u2019d come to believe we were in it for the long haul.</p><p>I hadn\u2019t seen him again until he\u2019d walked into the bar at the Four Seasons.</p> <p>Chad looked at me. \u201cYou invited Stacy, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Confused, I finally looked over my shoulder. Seeing Jackson helping Stacy out of her jean jacket made my teeth grind. Chad hadn\u2019t known where we were going, but Jax had guessed.</p><p>And sure enough, he made a beeline toward us with Stacy. My mom got in their way, her smile wide as ever but proverbial feathers ruffled in full mother-hen mode.</p><p>I looked at Chad. \u201cWe could sneak out the back.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but his eyes were hard.</p><p>Angelo came over. \u201cIs he meeting you?\u201d he asked, jerking his head toward Jax.</p><p>\u201cNo...\u201d I looked at Chad. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to sit with us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He sat back, glaring. \u201cTalk about keeping the wrong company. Stace can go ahead with Ian\u2019s deal, if she wants. I\u2019m sticking with you and the Mondego.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d Angelo looked at me. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re seated somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>I took a gulp of my wine as my brother walked away.</p><p>Chad studied me for a moment. \u201cHe has your back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the Rossi way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStace and I used to be like that. Before Ian showed up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d I tried to ignore the sensation of Jax\u2019s gaze. I could feel him looking our way. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cHell if I know. It all went to her head. I don\u2019t even know if she thinks about the food anymore. She\u2019s too busy trying to be rich and famous.\u201d</p><p>My mom came by with more wine, setting her hand on my shoulder as she refilled our glasses. I felt the gentle press of her beautifully manicured nails and heard the silent question: Are you okay?</p><p>I set my hand over hers and squeezed, answering. I wasn\u2019t okay, but what I could say? I wouldn\u2019t give Jax the satisfaction of refusing him service and neither would my family. He\u2019d get excellent food, our best server and complimentary wine of his choice.</p><p>They\u2019d pull out all the stops. Kill him with kindness. Show him that we weren\u2019t petty and small. But oh, what it would cost us. All of us. My safe place felt invaded, his potent energy permeating the space and my senses. Every nerve tingled with awareness.</p><p>Lori, one of the waitstaff, came over to take our order. Chad and I decided to split the pasta for two. All through the appetizer and salad courses, I was expecting Jax to come over. I was terribly aware of him, unable to give Chad the attention I\u2019d been able to before. He was subdued, too, his gaze staying firmly on his food or on my face, both of us studiously avoiding looking at other patrons.</p><p>In my mind, I was certain Jax was having a wonderful time just to spite me. Why was he taking Stacy out when she was Ian\u2019s latest fling? Or was she freely available to both of them? After all, she\u2019d showed no hesitation and a lot of pleasure in kissing Jax\u2019s cheek when he first showed up.</p><p>Just before the main course was served, Chad excused himself to go to the bathroom, and I checked my smartphone. I\u2019d missed a call from Lei. When Chad came back with a beer in hand, I smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>I headed toward the bathrooms, but ducked into the back office instead, closing out the noise when I shut the door behind me. I speed-dialed Lei and set the phone to my ear.</p><p>\u201cGianna,\u201d she answered. \u201cI have to applaud you for your choice in men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I pick \u2019em or what?\u201d I walked over to the far wall where a family portrait hung. I\u2019d been around twelve years old in the picture with braces on my teeth and wild hair. Nico, Vincent and Angelo had been varying degrees of gangly. My dad was immortalized in his prime, as was my mother, who\u2019d aged little since. \u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs expected. You guessed right, by the way. Jackson said he\u2019s stepped in as a favor for someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had a chance to dig for more details, I\u2019m sorry\u2014I\u2019ve been with Chad since I left\u2014but it\u2019s probably a Rutledge. When Jackson\u2019s not gambling with millions, he\u2019s cleaning up after family members \u00e0 la Olivia Pope.\u201d And dating beautiful women... \u201cAs for Chad, he\u2019s on board, but I think we\u2019d be wise to get a new contract drawn up ASAP before something happens to change his mind. Jax isn\u2019t going home gracefully. He crashed the dinner hour at Rossi\u2019s, bringing Stacy along for the show.\u201d</p><p>Lei laughed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I like him.\u201d</p><p>My mouth quirked ruefully. \u201cHappens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIan called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? How\u2019d that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe asked if I\u2019d see him tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Maybe that\u2019s why Jax has Stacy. Babysitting duty.\u201d Irritatingly, that filled me with relief.</p><p>\u201cCould be. I said no in any case. I feel like our men are circling the wagons, which means we need to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. Honestly, I haven\u2019t had this much fun in years.\u201d</p><p>Our men. I snorted and turned in time to see the door opening...and Jax appearing. \u201cI have to go, Lei, but I\u2019m here if you need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll hit it again fresh in the morning. Good night, Gianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, too.\u201d I set my phone aside.</p><p>We sized each other up for a long minute. He was wearing the gray sweater and slacks from earlier in the day, the casualness more familiar\u2014and beloved. A lock of his dark hair fell over his brow, softening the severity of his beauty. He had his back against the door, his hands in his pockets, his legs crossed at the ankles. But only an idiot would fail to sense the predatory alertness in him. His hooded gaze was watchful and knowing, seeing way too much.</p><p>\u201cI miss the curls in your hair,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>I backed up to my father\u2019s desk, resting my butt against it. I crossed my arms. \u201cThat\u2019s a seriously delayed response.\u201d A couple years too late...</p><p>\u201cYou were closing in on the kill when I got here. Are you thinking about fucking Chad Williams because you want to, or because you want him to sign on the dotted line?\u201d</p><p>Some other woman might have held her tongue because the question didn\u2019t deserve an answer. I didn\u2019t say anything because I was too hurt. I\u2019d never seen Jax deliberately mean or cruel\u2014he\u2019d just disappeared from my life.</p><p>\u201cGia...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you prefer?\u201d</p><p>My foot tapped restlessly. \u201cI\u2019d rather not see or hear from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would think that\u2019d be obvious.\u201d</p><p>His wonderfully sensitive mouth tightened. \u201cNot to me. We know each other. We get along well. Very, very well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fucking you again!\u201d I snapped, feeling the walls close in on us. He\u2019d always had that effect on me. When he was with me, I didn\u2019t register anything else.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop asking me that!\u201d</p><p>Jax straightened, and the office got even smaller. My breathing quickened, my gaze darting to the door at his back.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a valid question.\u201d He engaged the lock without taking his eyes off me. \u201cTell me why you\u2019re so angry.\u201d</p><p>A surge of panic got the better of me. \u201cYou fell off the face of the earth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid I?\u201d He took a step toward me. \u201cAre you saying you didn\u2019t know how to find me?\u201d</p><p>I frowned, confused. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt had to end, and it did.\u201d He came closer. \u201cQuietly. No messy scenes. No ugly memories. We\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeat and tidy.\u201d I sucked in a sharp breath, more wounded than I could say. I lashed out in self-defense. \u201cSo why rehash and screw it up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we be friends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Jax stepped into my space. \u201cCan\u2019t we do business together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d I unfolded my arms, feeling the need to take the defensive. \u201cYou made this personal from the get-go.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, flashing that damned dimple. \u201cYou\u2019re sexy as hell when you\u2019re mad at me. I should\u2019ve pissed you off more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack off, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. It didn\u2019t take.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, it did. Go back to your world and forget me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy world.\u201d The smile faded along with the light in his eyes. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d stopped his advance, so I skirted him quickly, aware that I had been gone too long and Chad was waiting.</p><p>Jax caught my arm, his hand flexing around it. He spoke in my ear. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck him.\u201d</p><p>I shivered. We stood shoulder-to-shoulder, facing in opposite directions, which mirrored our entire relationship. I smelled him, felt his warmth, was reminded of other occasions when he\u2019d whispered in my ear.</p><p>Jax knew how to seduce and he never shirked the effort. Even when I\u2019d been a sure thing, he\u2019d get me hot long before he took me to bed. Giving me long, searing looks, touching me often, murmuring naughty promises that made me blush.</p><p>\u201cAre you celibate, Jax?\u201d I retorted.</p><p>\u201cI will be, if you are.\u201d</p><p>A harsh laugh burst out of me. \u201cYeah, right.\u201d</p><p>He held my gaze. \u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not interested in playing games.\u201d</p><p>The doorknob rattled, making me jump. \u201cGianna? Are you in there?\u201d</p><p>Vincent. \u201cYes,\u201d I called out. \u201cHang on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fuck him,\u201d Jax repeated, his eyes dark and hard. \u201cI mean it, Gia.\u201d</p><p>I shook free and fumbled the lock open, pulling the door wide.</p><p>My brother paused with the office key in his hand, then glared over my shoulder at Jax. \u201cYou got a death wish, Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>Rolling my eyes, I pushed Vincent back. \u201cLeave it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSniff around somewhere else,\u201d Vincent went on, blocking the doorway as soon as I moved out of the way.</p><p>I briefly considered intervening, then decided against it. They were big boys. They could figure it out by themselves.</p><p>When I got back to the dining room, I found a large to-go bag sitting on the table in front of Chad, who stood when he saw me.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think about taking this back to the hotel and eating in peace?\u201d he asked.</p><p>I looked around the dining room, easily spotting Stacy\u2019s bright hair gleaming in the muted glow of the wrought-iron chandeliers. She was staring daggers at Chad and me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got a better idea,\u201d I said, grabbing my belongings. \u201cI know someplace we can go where no one will find us.\u201d</p><p>I TOOK HIM to my sister-in-law Denise\u2019s beauty salon in Brooklyn. She closed up shop, found some paper plates and we feasted on lukewarm-but-still-delicious rag\u00f9 bolognese in the stylists\u2019 lounge in back, away from the smells of dye and hair spray. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got a New York accent,\u201d Chad noted after we\u2019d been swapping crazy customer stories for a while. \u201cI never noticed before.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cYeah. As heard on TV in ten thousand cop shows.\u201d</p><p>Chad laughed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because she\u2019s on her own turf,\u201d Denise explained.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t add anything. No biggie that he\u2019d noticed. The accent always came out when I was hanging with family or friends, when my defenses were relaxed and I felt more like the me I used to be.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cute,\u201d he teased, exaggerating his own. \u201cY\u2019all know I\u2019ve got one, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gotten good at hiding it,\u201d Denise said, her platinum hair with hot pink tips arranged into artful braids. She had piercings in her nose and brow, and a sleeve of tattoos on her left arm. She was also five months pregnant and just beginning to show. I was so excited about that. I was dying to be an aunt.</p><p>My smartphone started ringing in my purse, and I reached over to the counter to dig it out. Maybe Lei needed me after all. She hadn\u2019t been kidding about the hours when she\u2019d hired me. I\u2019d had 2:00 a.m. calls and weekend calls, but I loved them all because those happened when she was really pumped about something.</p><p>Looking at the screen, I didn\u2019t recognize the New York number and was about to let it go to voice mail when I decided to indulge Chad with my accent a little more.</p> <p>\u201cGianna Rossi\u2019s office,\u201d I answered naturally. \u201cHow can I help you?\u201d</p><p>Silence greeted me, then... \u201cGia.\u201d</p><p>I held my breath, rocked by the way Jax said my name. The way he used to when we were lovers and he\u2019d call just to hear my voice.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he said gruffly.</p><p>Fortified by the sight of my stricken face in the unforgiving mirror, I replied with chilly calm. \u201cHow did you get this number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me a break,\u201d he snapped. \u201cTalk like you used to. The real you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who called me.\u201d</p><p>He bit out something under his breath. \u201cHave lunch with me tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I slid out of the chair and walked toward the front of the beauty shop.</p><p>\u201cYes, Gia. We need to talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen listen.\u201d</p><p>I rubbed the tip of my stiletto over a crack in a floor tile. Denise had just started turning a profit and there were improvements she wanted to make to the shop. Still, the location was newly hip again and she\u2019d been smart to go with gorgeous vintage pinups on the walls and great retro d\u00e9cor that distracted the eye from minor flaws.</p><p>God, I was a mess over Jax. My scattered brain was bouncing random thoughts all over the place.</p> <p>I focused on the man driving me crazy. \u201cIf I have lunch with you, will you go away and leave me alone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t promise that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I won\u2019t go,\u201d I countered. \u201cYou\u2019ve got no right to invade my life like this. None of this is your business. You shouldn\u2019t be butting in\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it. I didn\u2019t know you were in love with me, Gia.\u201d</p><p>My eyes closed against the pain of hearing those words from his lips. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, you didn\u2019t know me at all.\u201d</p><p>I hung up.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>\u201cI FOUND SOMETHING tying Pembry with the Rutledges,\u201d I told Lei first thing Friday morning, following her into her office as she arrived for the day. \u201cAn article in FSR magazine.\u201d</p><p>She glanced aside at me. \u201cHow long have you been here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHalf an hour, maybe.\u201d But I\u2019d been up late doing my homework, unable to sleep. I needed to know why Jax was meddling in my life and how to get him back out of it again.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want an apology from him or an explanation. I didn\u2019t want to be friends. I didn\u2019t want any reason to hope, because it\u2019d become painfully obvious to me that I was still in love with him. And now, he was becoming aware of it, too.</p><p>I\u2019d learned my lesson the first time, and he\u2019d confirmed it\u2014our relationship had to end at some point. No do-overs.</p><p>I slid the article from Full-Service Restaurant across her desk. \u201cA tiny mention of Pembry supporting and contributing to Rutledge campaigns in a bigger piece on restaurateurs and politics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Her astute gaze lifted to meet mine. \u201cI lived with Ian for five years. He never once voted in any election. And he\u2019s too much of a tight-ass to spend the kind of money it takes to get the Rutledges\u2019 personal attention.\u201d</p><p>Lei leaned back, twisting her chair side to side. \u201cThat said,\u201d she went on, \u201cI can\u2019t see a venture capitalist taking an interest in Ian\u2019s business over mine without some personal motivation. It doesn\u2019t make fiscal sense.\u201d</p><p>Lifting my hands, I admitted, \u201cI don\u2019t get it, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Jackson tell you what sparked his interest in Ian if you asked him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d I took a seat in front of her desk. \u201cBut he\u2019s not the deciding factor here. Stacy prefers Ian. Chad prefers us. We\u2019ve got a grip on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you curious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot enough to go out of my way to talk to him. He\u2019s starting to realize I took our fling more seriously than I should have and that\u2019s...awkward.\u201d</p><p>Lei\u2019s gaze was warm with sympathy. \u201cI guess the best solution is to get this wrapped up. I\u2019m talking with the team at Mondego today about moving forward with just Chad. They\u2019re not as excited\u2014no surprise there\u2014but I think I have an appealing alternative.\u201d</p><p>I leaned forward, and she smiled at my eagerness.</p><p>\u201cThese two.\u201d She swiveled her monitor around to face me, revealing two very different women. One darkly exotic, the other a fresh-faced blonde. \u201cI\u2019ve been keeping my eye on them for a few months now. Isabelle, the brunette, specializes in regional Italian, while Inez, the blonde, has a flair for regional French.\u201d</p><p>A soft laugh bubbled up. \u201cDueling kitchens international.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore work to get the menu right, but when you can\u2019t deliver two, up the ante to three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAwesome.\u201d</p><p>Lei rubbed her hands together. \u201cWith any luck, we\u2019ll still be cracking open bottles of bubbly.\u201d</p><p>I heard my desk phone ringing through the open door and stood.</p><p>She pushed her phone over to me. \u201cYou can get that here.\u201d</p><p>Picking up the receiver, I hit the button for my line and answered.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rossi, Ian Pembry. Good morning.\u201d</p><p>I raised my brows and mouthed Ian to Lei. Her mouth curved.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Pembry. I was just thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was waiting for you to call, then I got impatient.\u201d The warm amusement in his voice hit me the way I suspected it hit most women. There was no doubt about it; he had a great bedroom voice.</p><p>\u201cWould you be available for lunch sometime?\u201d I asked, shooting a look at Lei to make sure she\u2019d be okay with it. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m flattered you\u2019d choose me over Jackson,\u201d he said, putting my back up. \u201cBut I was hoping for dinner instead. I have an engagement tonight and I need a date.\u201d</p><p>Reaching over, I hit the speaker button. \u201cWhat about Stacy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s wonderful, of course, but I\u2019d prefer to take you. You\u2019ll want to come along, Lei,\u201d he posited, addressing her directly, \u201cand look out for your girl, which is fine. The more the merrier. It\u2019s a formal event. Be at the Midtown heliport by six.\u201d</p><p>Lei grinned, clearly enjoying the exchange although she didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re assuming I don\u2019t have plans on a Friday night,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be offended, Miss Rossi.\u201d He sounded amused. \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment on your dedication. Lei wouldn\u2019t have hired you if you didn\u2019t put the job first. See you tonight.\u201d</p><p>The line clicked off, and I set the receiver back in the cradle. \u201cWell...what do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to go shopping.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I RETURNED to my desk, I found a package waiting.</p><p>I ripped into the brown paper wrapping and discovered a foiled box of chocolates inside. The surge of desire that pierced me at the sight of that particular brand\u2014Neuhaus\u2014and the memories it evoked quickened my breathing. My skin heated.</p><p>I\u2019d had the Belgian truffles only once before, when I\u2019d sucked them off the tips of Jax\u2019s fingers. He\u2019d melted them with the heat of his touch...then painted words over my body that he\u2019d licked off with wicked lashes of his tongue.</p><p>Sexy Gia. Sweet. And my favorite\u2014mine.</p><p>My thighs clenched, and I crossed my ankles, my core tightening in greedy demand. My body didn\u2019t care that he\u2019d dumped me without a word. It wanted Jax. Desperately.</p><p>The note attached was simple and unsigned.</p><p>I\u2019d know you blindfolded.</p><p>I COULDN\u2019T TELL you where Lei took us to buy gowns. It was a small, unmarked storefront that had a permanent Closed sign on the door. Appointments only. The moment Lei\u2019s town car pulled up out front, we were ushered inside a showroom of quiet luxury and served champagne with ripe strawberries. There were no price tags in evidence anywhere.</p><p>The next hour passed in a blur of silks and taffetas. I was dazzled.</p><p>There had been times working with Lei that I had been exposed to a world far beyond anything I knew. I always struggled to hide my wide-eyed awe on such occasions, striving to take my cues from Lei, who seemed so natural and at ease. I had to remind myself that her background wasn\u2019t so different from mine. She\u2019d acquired polish over the years and so could I.</p><p>I was eyeing a black gown with lace cap sleeves when Lei set her hand on my shoulder.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too old for you,\u201d she said.</p><p>I glanced at her. \u201cI think it looks understated and elegant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt does, for a woman my age. You\u2019re twenty-five. Enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to be careful,\u201d I explained. My boss was slender as a reed, graceful and lithe. I was too curvy. \u201cMy boobs are too big. And so is my butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sexy,\u201d she asserted bluntly. \u201cYou play it down at work, which I understand and appreciate, but don\u2019t waste it. It\u2019s a terrible myth that a successful woman can\u2019t be sexy without it ruining her credibility. Don\u2019t buy into it.\u201d</p><p>I caught my lower lip between my teeth. Looking around the showroom, I was intimidated by the reek of wealth it exuded. I was out of my league. The walls were draped in billowing ivory silk, for Christ\u2019s sake, instead of wallpaper. And the finger sandwiches they had just brought out were sitting on a platter I was positive was pure, heavy silver. \u201cCan you help me? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll make the wrong choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for, Gianna.\u201d She gestured at one of the three women helping us. \u201cLet\u2019s see what you\u2019ve got for young, beautiful and voluptuous.\u201d</p><p>THE WHISTLES I got when I stepped out of my bedroom a few hours later both excited me and made me nervous. Denise had come home early to do my hair, bringing Pam, one of her stylists, with her to do my makeup. Angelo was sprawled across the couch watching stuff he\u2019d recorded on the DVR, passing the time until his eight o\u2019clock shift at Rossi\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d my brother said, sliding up into a sitting position. \u201cWho are you and what have you done with my sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Denise and I retorted in unison.</p><p>\u201cShe looks like a movie star,\u201d Pam said, returning from the kitchen, where she\u2019d been cleaning her cosmetic brushes. \u201cOne of the real goddesses, I\u2019d say. A Raquel Welch or Sophia Loren.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d Denise frowned.</p><p>But I got it. I\u2019d always thought of my mom the same way.</p><p>The gown we\u2019d chosen in the end was still black, but much sexier. A jeweled brooch held the one shoulder strap together, with inky satin ruched across the bust, cinched at the waist with a thin diamond belt, then slit down the right leg from midthigh to hem. It occurred to me that it was a good thing Vincent was already at Rossi\u2019s. He might\u2019ve freaked a little at how much of my legs were showing. Nico, who was living in Jersey now, would\u2019ve loved it.</p><p>Denise plopped down on the sofa with two beers in hand, passing one over to her husband and setting the other on the coffee table for Pam. She\u2019d been sticking religiously to water and fruit juice since she had found out about the baby.</p><p>Gold hoops glittered from between the crimped mass of her hair. \u201cIs Chad going, too?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs Jax?\u201d Angelo added tightly.</p><p>I shrugged, but my pulse leaped. I had tried not to think about Jax when I\u2019d been getting ready, but I couldn\u2019t help hoping he could see me dolled up. I looked hot.</p><p>\u201cYou know better,\u201d he warned.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d I agreed, \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>My smartphone rang, and I knew Lei\u2019s driver had arrived. \u201cGotta run!\u201d</p><p>I hurried across the refinished hardwood of our joint loft to grab my heels, clutch and wrap from the bench by the door, waving at Pam before I exited through the open sliding front door. I skipped the temperamental old freight elevator and took the three flights of stairs to reach the street. Lei\u2019s driver was used to the delay.</p><p>Nico, Vincent and Angelo had bought the loft with the expectation of fixing it up and selling it for a profit. I\u2019d moved in after college and eventually bought Nico\u2019s share when he moved to New Jersey. Then Vincent and I had split the cost of Angelo\u2019s share when he\u2019d moved out with Denise, giving the two of us 50 percent stake each. We\u2019d been considering selling out when Denise found out she was pregnant, and she and Angelo moved back in to save money.</p><p>I liked coming home to a full house and missed Nico. I wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d have done with myself living alone. I think having someone around all the time had helped me focus on work and date less than I normally would have. I\u2019d been comfortable with that, but maybe I had just been hiding from the fact I was nursing a broken heart. Maybe I should\u2019ve faced that sooner. Certainly it was time to face it now. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Breathless from the rush, I slid into the open backseat of the town car and we headed to Lei\u2019s. Her part of New York was a lot different from mine. She lived in Manhattan, a bridge distance away that could\u2019ve been another world. We crossed the East River with the sun still hanging in the sky, the light\u2019s reflection on the water broken by an industrious towboat.</p><p>It amazed me that I\u2019d once believed Jax could fit in here. I had come to associate him so completely with D.C. that I could no longer imagine him anywhere else.</p><p>Except my bed. I had no trouble imagining him there....</p><p>I WAS CONSIDERING how best to finagle information out of Ian Pembry when the car pulled to a stop in front of Lei\u2019s apartment building.</p> <p>I\u2019d seen her dress earlier, but it had a whole new impact with the hair and makeup to match. Emerald-green and Grecian in design, it glided over her willowy body as she exited her apartment building with a smile for her doorman. The rich hue of her gown showed off her flawless pale skin and emphasized the red of her lips, while a beautiful jeweled clip accented the silver strands at her right temple.</p><p>She settled on the seat beside me and I immediately caught her tension.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d I asked.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>We were quiet as we took the short ride to the heliport, both of us lost in our own thoughts. Turning a corner, my gaze caught on a dog park and the boisterous furry bodies running wild and free inside it. Their playful exuberance and undisguised pleasure made me smile, despite the somber turn my reflections had taken all day.</p> <p>I hated to admit it, but I was hurt that Ian knew about Jax inviting me to lunch. When Jax had called, I\u2019d thought the request had come from the heart. I had believed it was personal, that he truly wanted to connect with me, even if it was only to apologize. I guess I\u2019d always expected too much from Jax. When it came to him, my instincts were seriously faulty.</p><p>By the time we were strapped into a helicopter and lifting into the air, my attention had turned outward to Lei. She stared out the window as the ground dropped farther away, laying the city out for us in a spectacular blanket of setting-sun-drenched concrete and sparkling glass. I followed suit, absorbing the panorama. The entire day had been reflective of my experience working with Lei. My family had a microscopic view of the world and they liked it. I\u2019d always wanted something bigger, a view with a much wider lens.</p><p>\u201cDo you know where we\u2019re going?\u201d I asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIan\u2019s making a point with this outing. I expect we\u2019ll be wowed.\u201d</p><p>AROUND EIGHT O\u2019CLOCK I found myself exiting a limousine in front of a sprawling mansion in D.C. I\u2019d been growing more anxious by the mile, starting when we boarded a private jet at the airport and increasing exponentially when the flight attendant advised us of our destination.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s outdone himself,\u201d Lei muttered as Pembry descended the sprawling home\u2019s wide front steps to greet us.</p> <p>The restaurateur looked impressively dapper in a classic tuxedo, his silvery-gray hair slicked back. He greeted me first by kissing the back of my hand, then turned his blue eyes onto Lei.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re toying with one of my people,\u201d she said coldly, watching impassively as he lifted her hand to his mouth. \u201cYou never used to be cruel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to have a heart,\u201d he drawled, \u201cand then someone broke it.\u201d</p><p>My gaze darted between the two, trying to read the vibrating tension between them. I got the sense I was being played and that everyone understood the rules but me.</p><p>Fine. If I kept my mouth shut and my ears open, I could catch up.</p><p>Ian turned and offered me his arm. \u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>He led me up the front steps with Lei trailing behind. A glance back at her proved she did so regally, her head held high on that long neck I envied. Light spilled out of the open double doors and limousines discharged their passengers in steady waves behind us. It was an amazing party and I hadn\u2019t even crossed the threshold.</p><p>\u201cI trust the flights were pleasant,\u201d he said.</p> <p>I glanced at him and found him watching me too carefully. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been to D.C. before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d He smiled, and I could see a hint of his charm. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll consider spending the weekend. I have a town house in Georgetown. You\u2019re welcome to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s kind of you.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, he unlinked our arms and set his hand at the small of my back, urging me through the doors before him. \u201cI hope you\u2019ll say more than a few words at a time as the evening progresses, Miss Rossi. I\u2019d like to get to know you, especially since both Jackson and Lei have taken such an interest in you.\u201d</p><p>My steps slowed when I saw what looked to be a receiving line. \u201cWhat is this event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA private fund-raiser,\u201d he murmured near my ear.</p><p>I suddenly understood what Lei had meant by cruelty. \u201cFor a Rutledge?\u201d</p><p>Amusement colored his voice. \u201cWho else?\u201d</p><p>Passing through the receiving line went quickly, with brisk handshakes from the men and slightly warmer handclasps by the women. All of them were perfectly groomed, without a hair out of place, and all had big practiced smiles with blindingly white teeth.</p><p>I was glad to get through and accept a glass of champagne from the tray of a smiling waiter. I was even happier to see Chad, who looked as uncomfortable as I felt. His face brightened when he saw us, familiar faces in an unfamiliar crowd, and he headed our way.</p><p>\u201cI took the liberty of pairing Chad with you, Lei,\u201d Ian said, his gaze sliding over her.</p><p>I searched the room for Jax. I didn\u2019t see him, but then there were so many people milling around the ballroom we\u2019d been shown to. A ballroom, for God\u2019s sake, in someone\u2019s house.</p><p>Who lived like this?</p><p>I swallowed a large gulp of the cool wine in my glass. Jax lived like this. The sleek businessman I\u2019d seen at Savor fit in here, but not the lover I\u2019d known.</p><p>You only thought you knew him....</p><p>Chad came up to me, sliding one finger beneath the collar of his dress shirt. \u201cCan you believe this? I just met the governor of Louisiana. And he knew who I am!\u201d</p><p>Ian\u2019s smile was smug. But I still didn\u2019t get it.</p><p>\u201cHow do politics and the food-service industry mix?\u201d I asked him.</p><p>\u201cStrange bedfellows, I admit.\u201d He took my empty glass and swapped it for a fresh one as a waiter walked by. \u201cBut everyone eats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone votes,\u201d Lei said, catching her own glass.</p><p>\u201cYou were always much more conscientious about that than I,\u201d Ian agreed. \u201cWhat about you, Gianna? I can call you Gianna, can\u2019t I? Do you exercise your right to vote?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t politics one of those topics it\u2019s wiser not to discuss?\u201d I eyed a passing tray of hors d\u2019oeuvres and realized my nerves were too shot to even consider food.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we dance instead?\u201d he suggested.</p><p>Figuring it might be a rare chance to speak to him alone, I agreed. Chad took my glass of champagne and downed it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll warn you that I\u2019m not a great dancer,\u201d I told Ian as he led me over to the area reserved for dancing. I\u2019d taken a few classes to build my confidence, but I never had a chance to dance formally outside of the studio and little time to practice anything beyond the basic steps. I had definitely never danced to a live orchestra before.</p><p>\u201cJust follow my lead,\u201d he murmured, pulling me close.</p><p>We blended into the few couples on the floor.</p><p>I was so focused on not stepping on his feet that I didn\u2019t say anything for the first minute or so.</p><p>\u201cTell me how you know Jackson,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d And that was the truth, in every way that mattered.</p><p>Ian\u2019s brows rose, his blue eyes searching my face. \u201cYesterday wasn\u2019t the first time you\u2019d met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I\u2019m sure you knew that before you brought him into the mix, I\u2019m more interested in how you two know each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know his father, Parker Rutledge. He introduced us.\u201d He looked past me. \u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d</p><p>My spine stiffened. I turned my head, my steps faltering as I watched a man who looked eerily like Jax dancing with a very pretty younger woman.</p><p>The urge to leave the event was insanely strong. I had no business at a political fund-raiser, no place in a world that had nothing at all to do with my own. I couldn\u2019t figure out how a pair of twin chefs had led me to this point in time and didn\u2019t really care to puzzle it out at the moment anyway. A sinking feeling that the night would go from bad to worse was getting stronger.</p><p>\u201cWhat was the reason you brought us here, Ian?\u201d</p><p>He countered with a question of his own. \u201cHow ambitious are you, Gianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m loyal to Lei.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI was, too. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t find her to be as faithful in return. You know as well as I do that it\u2019s not in Chad\u2019s or Stacy\u2019s interest to break up. They need each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can make it on their own. They\u2019re both talented in their own right.\u201d My feelings of irritation grew. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we have discussed this in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fighting for my livelihood. You have to expect that I\u2019ll pull out all the stops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLei\u2019s in your league. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou feel out of place here,\u201d he said softly, soothingly. \u201cI know these people. I would love to help you make connections and find your way.\u201d</p><p>I stared up at him. \u201cWhy are you offering me that? Because of Jackson? If you think I want to insinuate myself into his life, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong about me.\u201d</p><p>The song ended and I pulled back, ready to find Lei and see if she wanted to leave, too.</p><p>Pembry wisely got the hint and guided me off the dance floor. I was almost home free when a tall figure stepped into my path. I looked up and caught my breath, thinking for a split second that Jax had shown up after all.</p><p>Then I realized it was his dad.</p><p>\u201cIan,\u201d Parker said, thrusting out his hand in greeting. His voice carried power in it, just as his posture did. The Rutledge patriarch controlled a family with serious political clout. His reach and influence were staggering if you thought about it, which I couldn\u2019t help doing when he turned those dark eyes to me. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve met your lovely companion before.\u201d</p><p>I was startled to hear his slight accent, one I couldn\u2019t place.</p><p>Ian did the honors. \u201cParker, this is Gianna Rossi. Gianna, Parker Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cMiss Rossi, a pleasure. This is my wife, Regina.\u201d</p><p>I looked at the blonde beside him, the one he\u2019d been dancing with, and thought she couldn\u2019t be much older than me. She certainly wasn\u2019t old enough to be Jax\u2019s mother. Even a great plastic surgeon couldn\u2019t preserve someone that well. \u201cHello, Mrs. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>Her smile didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cRegina, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDance with me, Regina,\u201d Ian said, holding a hand out to her with a flourish.</p><p>She looked at Parker, who gave a nod. She looked back at Ian. \u201cI want you to tell me about that new chef you brought with you tonight. What type of food does he cook?\u201d</p><p>\u201cModern Southern.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d They moved off. \u201cI\u2019m having a dinner party in a few weeks. Do you think...?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d never know it from looking at her,\u201d Parker said, setting his hand at my waist before I could decline. \u201cBut she loves to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a hard time understanding people who don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Parker swept me into the dance with a flourish and I held on, forcing myself to breathe.</p><p>\u201cRegina also loves a great party,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut then she\u2019s young and beautiful. Like you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour interest is hospitality, isn\u2019t it? I believe that\u2019s what Ian told me. You must enjoy a great party, too. What do you think of this one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d I scrambled for an answer. \u201cI\u2019m still taking it in.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and the sound wasn\u2019t anything like Jax\u2019s warm chuckles. Parker had a booming laugh, one that drew attention. It was oddly infectious. I felt my mouth curve reluctantly.</p><p>\u201cGianna,\u201d he said, again with that hint of a regional accent. \u201cAn unusual name, isn\u2019t it? Jackson knew a Gianna in Las Vegas a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>As I\u2019d expected, the evening was quickly moving from uncomfortable to disastrous. I had assumed I\u2019d been a secret. Instead, it seemed Jax had been telling everyone about me. That didn\u2019t give me the warm fuzzies.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a family name,\u201d I answered tightly, feeling terribly awkward.</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a pleasant surprise, seeing him again.\u201d</p><p>I studied him. Would Jax look like his father when he reached the same age? I hoped not. I hoped he\u2019d have more laugh lines around the eyes and less tension around his beautiful mouth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more surprised that Ian felt the need to involve him in our business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI involved Jackson,\u201d he murmured, looking over my head with narrowed eyes. \u201cIan did me a wonderful favor when he introduced me to Regina, so I help him whenever I can.\u201d He looked at me again. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of you, though. I\u2019ll assume Ian was.\u201d</p><p>Unease slid down my spine. I felt like a clown fish swimming with sharks, in way over my head.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>God. The sound of Jax\u2019s voice reverberated through me.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m cutting in.\u201d</p><p>Parker stopped and I turned my head, my heart pounding when I came face-to-face with Jax.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d show,\u201d Parker said to his son.</p><p>Jax glanced at me, then back at his father. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a choice.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>For a second, I considered slipping away while the two men were occupied with staring hard at each other. Then Jax\u2019s arm slipped around my waist from behind, pulling me into him and away from his father.</p><p>Parker glanced at me. \u201cI\u2019ll bow out and see you at dinner, Gianna. Enjoy yourself.\u201d</p><p>Jax rounded me, cutting off my view of his dad\u2019s retreating back. \u201cYou look amazing,\u201d he said softly, pulling me closer.</p><p>My shoulders ached with tension. \u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d</p> <p>He took the first step and I followed.</p><p>\u201cBreathe, Gia,\u201d he admonished. \u201cI\u2019ve got you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes two of us.\u201d He caressed my back with a soothing brush of his hand. \u201cI hate these things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you fit right in.\u201d</p> <p>His eyes were shadowed with an emotion I couldn\u2019t name. \u201cI was born into it. I don\u2019t live in it.\u201d</p><p>The heat of his body began to soak into mine. Every breath I took was filled with his scent; every movement he made sent echoes of memories sliding through me.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he coaxed. \u201cRelax into me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re in my world now, Gia. My rules.\u201d</p><p>I shook my head. \u201cI was tricked into coming here.\u201d</p> <p>He pulled me closer, his lips at my temple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just had to get that out, didn\u2019t you? I don\u2019t see why. Clearly I wasn\u2019t the dirty little secret I thought I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot dirty.\u201d His voice lowered. \u201cExcept when you wanted me that way. A little rough, a lot hard. Jesus. You used to turn me inside out.\u201d</p><p>I stepped on his foot on purpose.</p><p>His low laugh rippled through me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been drinking,\u201d I accused, smelling the faint trace of liquor on his breath.</p><p>\u201cDriven to it.\u201d He pulled back, his jaw set. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be so damn hard to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it easier. Help me and Lei get out of here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot yet.\u201d His soft mouth brushed over my brow. \u201cI spent a night with your family. You owe me a night with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen do I get to disappear, never to be seen again?\u201d</p><p>I really wanted to. Cinderella at the ball had turned into the unsuitable girl once more.</p><p>His chest brushed against my breasts as he urged me closer. \u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d</p><p>JAX KEPT ME dancing through two more songs, bluntly refusing to relinquish me to Ian or two other gentlemen who attempted to cut in. I got the message as loudly as I\u2019m sure everyone else did: I arrived with Ian, but I was now with Jax.</p><p>At that point, I decided to play my Cinderella role to the hilt. I kicked the voice in my head that had been depressing me for the past two days into a corner and flexed my toes in my proverbial glass slippers.</p><p>\u201cI want champagne,\u201d I announced abruptly.</p><p>Jax eyed me. \u201cIs that right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d</p><p>His eyes took on a wicked gleam I recognized. \u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing my hand, he led me off the dance floor and through the crowd. It surged around him, trying to pin us in, but he was adept at brusque acknowledgments and quick rejoinders. I caught sight of a familiar face, beautiful Allison Kelsey\u2014the woman whose fianc\u00e9\u2019s bachelor party had brought Jax and I together\u2014then the view changed to a brightly lit hallway. From there, Jax led me through a swinging door into a massive industrial-sized kitchen buzzing with activity.</p><p>I looked around, noting the multiple cooking stations and the black-and-white service uniforms I\u2019d only ever seen in movies. Jax snagged a bottle of champagne out of the hands of a waiter, slipped his ring finger around the stem of a flute in a practiced movement, then pulled me out a side door into another hallway.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d I asked, still wary of being alone with him. I wanted him. I\u2019d never stopped.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p><p>The sounds of the party grew louder, and I ignored the pang of disappointment I felt at the possibility of rejoining it. Seriously, I had to make up my mind.</p><p>Jax led me through open French doors onto a terrace overlooking a magical garden. At least it looked that way to me, with its torch-lit gravel pathways and handsome old trees sparkling with white lights.</p><p>\u201cWhose house is this?\u201d I queried.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a Rutledge estate.\u201d</p><p>The way he said it conveyed more ownership than the words themselves. \u201cRight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretend we crashed this party,\u201d he said, leading me down cobblestone steps to a crescent-shaped marble bench.</p><p>I sat, watching as he poured champagne for me and passed me the glass. \u201cSeems like we\u2019ve been pretending all along, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Jax swigged straight out of the bottle and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, careless and a bit defiant. \u201cMaybe. I still know you better than you think I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I know you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo get to know me,\u201d he challenged. \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d</p><p>I sipped my champagne. \u201cSpinning my wheels and dead ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you just enjoy the ride?\u201d</p><p>Oh, I\u2019d love it. A surge of heated yearning pierced me.</p><p>He set the bottle on the bench beside me. \u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you.\u201d</p><p>My breath caught. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry and stop me.\u201d</p><p>I surged to my feet. \u201cJackson\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up, Gia.\u201d He cupped my face in both hands and took my mouth.</p><p>For a moment I didn\u2019t move, frozen by the feel of his lips on mine, so soft yet firm. Achingly familiar. Tender. His tongue licked along the seam. I opened up to him with a low moan and he slid inside.</p><p>I dropped my flute. Distantly, I heard it shatter, but didn\u2019t care. My arms were draped across his broad shoulders; my fingers were in his silky hair. I was drinking him in, tasting champagne and Jax, lifting onto my toes to deepen the connection.</p><p>As always, he gave me what I demanded of him.</p><p>Holding me still, he ate at my mouth, stroking with the velvet lash of his tongue, nibbling with lips and teeth, sliding his lips back and forth across mine. Savoring me. Turning a simple kiss into an erotic melding that had me trembling with pleasure.</p><p>God, I\u2019d missed him. Missed the way he made me feel.</p><p>He growled, the rough sound vibrating against me. His hands slid downward, rubbing along my back, holding me in place as he rolled his hips and brushed the thick length of his erection against my cleft. Desire shot through me, flushing my skin. He smelled delicious, the subtle fragrance of his soap mixing with the virile scent that was his alone. I wanted to wallow in him the way I used to, pressing my naked body to his until even air couldn\u2019t come between us.</p><p>\u201cGia,\u201d he murmured gruffly, his lips sliding along my cheek. \u201cChrist, I want you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, my hands fisting in the thick strands of his hair. I was on fire for him, my skin feeling too tight and sensitive. \u201cYou had me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI made the right decision walking away.\u201d His breath gusted over my temple. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>A tiny voice of caution was screaming. \u201cYou\u2019ll hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll worship you.\u201d One of his hands captured my nape. The other gripped my hip, urging me into the slide of his hardness against my clit. \u201cYou remember how it was. Hours with my hands and mouth on you, my cock inside you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long?\u201d My core was clenching, tightening in demand for an orgasm.</p><p>\u201cWeeks.\u201d He groaned. \u201cMonths. Jesus, I\u2019m so hard it hurts.\u201d</p><p>I struggled out of his hold. \u201cI need more than sex.\u201d</p><p>He let me go, but his gaze was fierce and hot. \u201cI\u2019ll give you everything I\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a few weeks?\u201d I trembled from the effort of staying away from him when he was all I craved. \u201cA few months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d Jax scrubbed his hands over his face. \u201cDamn it. Take what I can give you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has to be. Christ... Don\u2019t ask me to turn you into one of them!\u201d</p><p>I jerked back, startled by his vehemence. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>He turned his back to the house and picked up the bottle of champagne, drinking deeply.</p><p>Confused, I studied him and saw only mulish determination. I looked past him into the ballroom, seeing the glittering couples inside. Lei appeared at that moment, walking onto the terrace with Chad on her arm.</p><p>In that moment I understood how badly I wanted to unravel the mystery of Jax, bad enough that I didn\u2019t care how much it was going to cost me.</p><p>\u201cMind if we join you?\u201d Lei asked as she and Chad approached.</p><p>Her eyes caught mine. I sank onto the bench, my body still throbbing with unappeased hunger.</p><p>Glancing at Jax, I found his eyes on me. A challenge was there in those dark depths. I held my hand out for the champagne, gripping the bottle by the neck when he handed it to me.</p><p>I lifted it in toast and drank to that dare.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>DON\u2019T DISAPPEAR. See me again....</p><p>Jax\u2019s last words, whispered in my ear as we said goodbye, haunted me on the flight back to New York.</p><p>If I tangled with him I\u2019d get hurt, because I would hope. I wanted more. But what choice did I have? I had to know what had gone so wrong before and what was still holding him back now. I\u2019d always assumed it was me\u2014who I was, where I came from\u2014not meshing with who he was and what he wanted long-term.</p><p>I glanced at Lei, who was seated across from me on the plane, as she opened her clutch and withdrew a folded piece of paper. She slid it over and I smoothed it out on the table in front of us. I read the first paragraph, shot a look down to see the signature at the bottom, then lifted my head.</p><p>\u201cOh, my God... You got Chad to sign?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tentative agreement,\u201d she qualified, \u201cbased on getting Isabelle and Inez on board\u2014and you overseeing the first restaurant\u2014but it\u2019s got him on the hook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d I refolded the document carefully, taking in the fact that I\u2019d just been handed a major responsibility. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you had this with you. Did you know he\u2019d be there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspected, knowing Ian.\u201d</p><p>I handed the agreement back to her.</p><p>\u201cRutledge took care of you tonight,\u201d Lei noted. \u201cIan tried to throw you to the wolves, but Jackson kept you too close for that.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d wanted me even closer.</p><p>I shrugged off her unspoken query, not wanting to get into something so deeply personal. \u201cBy the way, Parker Rutledge explained the connection. Ian introduced Parker to the latest Mrs. Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid he?\u201d Lei\u2019s elegantly arched brows rose. \u201cThen it\u2019s likely Ian knows Regina Rutledge intimately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u2019Fraid not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, then.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head back against the seat. \u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the weekend. Turn off your phone, forget about work. Just recharge. We\u2019ll hit it fresh on Monday.\u201d</p><p>That sounded perfect to me. \u201cI\u2019m more than game, but I\u2019ll leave my phone on in case you need me.\u201d</p><p>Lei smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t need you, I promise. I\u2019ve got a date this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll weekend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m overdue.\u201d</p><p>I laughed. In the year I\u2019d been with Lei, I hadn\u2019t known her to date. She was due for a good time, all right. So was I. \u201cRock it.\u201d</p><p>She shot me a look. \u201cI plan to.\u201d</p><p>WHEN I GOT HOME, it was just past two in the morning and everyone was asleep. I padded to my room on bare feet, eager to strip and scrub down to my bare skin.</p><p>I was reaching for the concealed zipper on the side of my dress when I caught sight of my reflection in the mirrored closet doors. I paused, really taking a good hard look at myself.</p><p>Was Jax attracted to the polished businesswoman I\u2019d become in a way he hadn\u2019t been to the girl I was before? Was I okay with that?</p><p>\u201cGod.\u201d I sat on the edge of my bed, wishing someone were awake that I could talk to. If Nico had been around, he\u2019d be up. He was a night owl.</p><p>Impulsively, I reached for the phone on my nightstand and speed-dialed him. It rang three times before he answered.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said. \u201cThis better be good.\u201d</p><p>I winced at his irritated and slightly breathless tone, suspecting I\u2019d interrupted him when he had someone staying over. \u201cNico, hi. Sorry. I\u2019ll call back tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGianna.\u201d He exhaled roughly and I heard rustling. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. We\u2019ll chat tomorrow. Bye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hang up on me!\u201d he snapped. \u201cYou wanted me, you got me. Spill it.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, figuring the sooner I let him go, the sooner he\u2019d get back to whatever he\u2019d been doing.</p><p>A half second later, the phone started ringing. I answered quickly, hoping it didn\u2019t wake up the rest of the house. \u201cNico, come on. It\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m sorry I bugged you so late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGianna, if you don\u2019t start talking, I\u2019m heading up there to kick your ass. Is this about Jackson?\u201d</p><p>I sighed. I should have known he would\u2019ve heard the news from someone. \u201cI\u2019ve got a free weekend. I thought maybe I could come visit. Give you a hard time. Harass you a little. Or a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow?\u201d</p><p>Actually, I\u2019d been thinking about it, but... \u201cNo, tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBullshit. You don\u2019t call after two in the morning to say you want to stop by tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re busy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the time you get here, I won\u2019t be.\u201d His voice softened. \u201cYou got a safe ride down?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNico\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call a service, have a car pick you up.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, grateful for him and more certain than ever that hanging with him would do me a world of good. It\u2019d been a few weeks since I\u2019d seen him. Too long. \u201cI need to shower and change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes. I\u2019ll see you when you get here.\u201d He hung up.</p> <p>Setting the handset back into its cradle, I hurried to get ready.</p><p>IT WAS CREEPING past four in the morning when I arrived at Nico\u2019s apartment complex. He\u2019d called a few minutes before to check where I was and was standing on the sidewalk waiting for me when I pulled up. Dressed in sweats with a shadow of stubble on his jaw, he looked a bit dangerous in that bad-boy way so many women gravitated toward.</p><p>God knew Jax\u2019s alpha-male qualities could put me into heat.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, taking my duffel bag from the driver and handing over cash. He slung his arm around my shoulder and led me toward his place. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not.\u201d I bumped my hip into his and made us both stumble. \u201cSorry to crash your night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got mine.\u201d He grinned. \u201cShe got hers, too, so it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGross. TMI.\u201d He was such a player. Always had been. \u201cIs she anyone special?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in a serious way. Got no time for a relationship now. My hands are full with Rossi\u2019s Two.\u201d</p><p>He released me to unlock the lobby door, then led me through to the interior courtyard. I\u2019d been to his apartment complex before to help him move in, but it felt different at night. Too quiet and unfamiliar. I wondered if he got lonely without the rest of us. It made me sad to think of it.</p><p>\u201cI wish you had someone to take care of you,\u201d I said.</p><p>\u201cYou first,\u201d he retorted, deftly bringing it back to me. He was good at that.</p> <p>We climbed exterior steps to his apartment. Once inside, I saw that he hadn\u2019t done much more to it since he\u2019d moved in. It was a typical bachelor pad\u2014sparse on decoration and laid out for comfort rather than aesthetics.</p><p>A large flat-screen TV dominated the living room, which had a black leather couch and love seat, coffee table and one end table with an open soda can on it. Light spilled into the otherwise darkened room from the open-plan kitchen and ajar bedroom door, trying valiantly to compensate for the lack of table and floor lamps.</p><p>\u201cSo, Jax is back,\u201d he said, watching me as I dropped onto the couch. \u201cVincent owes me a hundred bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I would\u2019ve thrown a sofa pillow at him if he\u2019d had any. \u201cYou bet on Jax?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBet on you.\u201d He sat on the love seat, setting my duffel on the floor at his feet. \u201cHe was gonzo over you, which meant he was either going to put a ring on you or run scared. I figured he\u2019d run, then come back around once the fear wore off. He\u2019s a guy, but he\u2019s a smart one. Question is, is he too late? I\u2019m guessing no or you wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I just wanted to see you,\u201d I argued. \u201cGod knows why.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said in a tone that told me he\u2019d believe it when hell froze over and pigs flew. \u201cYou still love him?\u201d</p><p>My head fell back against the sofa, and I closed my tired eyes. \u201cYeah. Damn it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd him? Where\u2019s he coming from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s confused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I smack him around some? Knock some sense into him?\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly. \u201cGod, I miss you.\u201d</p><p>WE SLEPT PAST NOON, went out to eat, then sat on the couch and played video games until my thumbs ached from using the controller. I left my smartphone in my purse, powered off and squashed any impulse to check it. I\u2019d left a note for Angelo and Vincent about where I\u2019d be. With Lei off the grid for the weekend, there was no one else who needed to reach me before Monday.</p><p>When it came time for Nico to head into Rossi\u2019s, I got up off the couch with him.</p><p>\u201cNeed an extra set of Rossi hands?\u201d I asked.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cSure. I have an extra T-shirt around here somewhere.\u201d</p><p>By seven, I found myself helping out at Rossi\u2019s and remembering how much I loved the hands-on part of the business. I couldn\u2019t do it long-term, like my brothers, but I was reminded that helping out every now and then was good for my soul. Dressed in jeans and a black Rossi\u2019s T-shirt with my hair pulled back in a ponytail, I could almost believe I was back in high school. I didn\u2019t know any of the customers coming in, but they quickly picked up on my relationship with Nico, due in large part to the playful ribbing we indulged in.</p><p>Crossing my arms on the bar, I leaned over and teased, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Bellini order? Pick it up, Rossi. You\u2019re laggin\u2019. I\u2019m waitin\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYa hear that?\u201d he asked the pretty redhead sitting in front of him. \u201cShe\u2019s rushing greatness.\u201d</p><p>I felt a charge that raised the hairs on my nape an instant before I felt a hand on my hip. I turned my head...</p><p>And saw Jax.</p><p>Blinking, I stared, drinking in the sight of him in jeans and a Rossi\u2019s T-shirt from way back, before we updated the logo. It twisted me up a little to see that he\u2019d kept the gift. And worn it some, judging by how broken in it was.</p><p>\u201cJax. What are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d He smiled.</p><p>Damn it. His dimple threw me for a loop.</p><p>I turned to face him, leaning back on the bar with my elbows and hitching my shoe onto the brass foot rail. It was a deliberately provocative pose and got me the response I\u2019d been hoping for.</p><p>His dark eyes swept me from head to toe and back again, coming to rest on my mouth. \u201cHave dinner with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>His brows rose at my quick reply.</p><p>\u201cOrder up,\u201d Nico said behind me.</p><p>I turned back to him just in time to see him acknowledge Jax with a jerk of his chin and a handshake.</p><p>\u201cJackson,\u201d my brother greeted him. \u201cI was just talking to Gianna about kicking your ass.\u201d</p><p>Jax grinned. \u201cGood to see you, too, man.\u201d</p><p>Nico wagged a finger at him and moved back down the bar.</p><p>As I transferred the three Bellinis onto my tray, I felt Jax\u2019s hands come to rest lightly on my hips, an unmistakably proprietary move. His lips touched my nape, brushing softly. \u201cI missed you,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>My hand shook slightly as I set the last tall, slender glass down. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me, Jax. It\u2019s not cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou missed me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I did. Back up.\u201d I lifted the tray and headed toward the table awaiting the order. \u201cCome on,\u201d I told him over my shoulder.</p><p>I dropped the drinks off, smiling at the party of three women who were clearly out on a girls\u2019 night. They eyed Jax, who leaned against the end of a booth with his arms crossed, his gaze on me as I leaned forward to serve.</p><p>\u201cYou training him?\u201d the brunette asked, grinning at Jax.</p><p>\u201cTried to,\u201d I quipped. \u201cFailed miserably.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m asking her to try again,\u201d he said, winking at the table. A really rotten thing to do since it got the women all riled up...and me, too.</p><p>\u201cGive it a shot, girl,\u201d the blonde encouraged. \u201cTrying is half the fun!\u201d</p><p>They were laughing as I walked away, exchanging words with Jax, who lingered as I hit the bar to drop off the empty tray.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d Nico asked, intercepting me.</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d I straightened my shoulders and abruptly decided on a course of action. Jax and I could dance around each other for days if I let us. I didn\u2019t have the patience for it. \u201cI\u2019m heading out for a bit.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and reached over to squeeze my hand. \u201cGive him hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d I pivoted and nearly ran into Jax, who\u2019d come up behind me. \u201cYou staying somewhere?\u201d</p><p>The faint amusement on his face faded into something darker. Hotter. \u201cI\u2019ve got a room, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me grab my purse.\u201d</p><p>He caught my elbow before I walked away. \u201cGia.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, let him study me.</p><p>His thumb brushed over my skin. \u201cThere\u2019s no rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn three days, you\u2019ve popped up where I am across three different states. Now you\u2019re going to cock-block yourself? Really?\u201d</p><p>A slow smile curved his mouth. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a point. I\u2019ll go get the car.\u201d</p><p>A SLEEK BMW waited just beyond the front doors of Rossi\u2019s when I stepped outside. The car was a rental, but it suited Jax. He was standing by to open the door for me, his lips brushing over my cheek before I took the passenger seat.</p><p>It was addicting the way he touched me, as if he couldn\u2019t help himself.</p><p>Jax slid behind the wheel. The engine purred to life, and we set off.</p><p>Sitting back, I watched him drive, turned on by his confident handling of the powerful car. His grip on the wheel was light, his arm extended in a way that showed off the beauty of his chiseled arms. He was an inherently sexy man and I was crazy in love with him, able to adore every commonplace thing he did.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t fair, I realized. I\u2019d never recognized his flaws, although he surely had some. I had never acknowledged that there might be struggles in his life, circumstances and people who might pull him in different directions and away from me. I\u2019d never scratched below the surface.</p><p>Reaching over, I set my hand on his thigh, feeling my palm tingle as the hard muscle bunched in reaction to my touch. He switched driving hands so that he could hold me in place, his skin warm and dry.</p><p>He glanced at me. \u201cAre you nervous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Wary, yes, but not anxious about it. \u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>He nodded and drove faster.</p><p>We didn\u2019t say anything further on the drive to his hotel or once we arrived. He parked and we entered a center courtyard via a key-card entrance at the side of the building. We took an elevator up, standing on opposite sides of the car, our gazes locked as the seconds ticked by.</p><p>The tension was so thick I found it hard to breathe, my lips parted as I pulled air into my lungs in a near pant. I could feel the need radiating off him, sensed the hunger tightening his muscles and sharpening his focus on every response of my body to his. He was hard already, his cock straining against the button-fly of his jeans.</p><p>And I was wet and ready, aching between my legs, my breasts full and heavy. My nipples were furled so tightly they throbbed and stretched shamelessly toward him.</p><p>His gaze was there on my chest, caressing me, his tongue sliding along his lower lip in a blatant promise of what he\u2019d be doing to me as soon as we were alone.</p><p>The elevator dinged to announce our arrival on his floor and he surged toward me, grabbing my hand in his and dragging me after him. A long hallway later, he was shoving open a door to a suite and then he was on me, grabbing me so tightly my feet left the floor. I dropped my purse and hung on.</p><p>Jax\u2019s mouth found mine as the door clicked shut, one arm around my waist and the other hand shoved into my hair, dislodging the elastic restraining my ponytail. The finesse he\u2019d shown the night before was gone, only animal hunger left in its wake. His lips slanted over mine, his tongue plunging rhythmically into my mouth, luring me to climb his big body.</p><p>My legs wrapped around his lean waist, my arms caging his shoulders, my hips rocking to rub my cleft against the rigid outline of his erection. I moaned as the pressure drove me mad, the layers of denim between us too thick to relieve me.</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d I gasped into his mouth.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d he growled, pinning me to the door.</p><p>My legs straightened, my hands going to the front of my jeans. I popped the button open and yanked down the zipper, struggling against Jax, who was shoving up my shirt.</p><p>His hands found my breasts and squeezed through the thin satin of my bra. I gasped, shocked by the intimacy.</p><p>\u201cChrist, you\u2019re gorgeous,\u201d he breathed, his thumbs circling the hardened points of my nipples.</p><p>My head fell back against the door, my lungs struggling for air.</p><p>His dark head lowered, his tongue licking me through my bra, his lips wrapping around me. He sucked hard, and I writhed, my hands clawing at the door behind me.</p><p>\u201cHurry, Jax. Damn it!\u201d</p><p>His dimple flashed, then he was kissing me again, his body hard against mine, his hands between us as he wrenched his button-fly open. I barely had the sense to dig his wallet out of his pocket before he shoved his jeans down and out of the way. Fumbling, I found a condom and tossed the wallet on the tiled entryway.</p><p>I was ripping open the foil with my teeth when he started pulling at my pants, tugging them roughly. I stumbled, laughing, falling into him, letting him sweep me up again and lower me to the floor.</p><p>Kicking off my shoes, I wrestled with him, our arms and legs tangling as we fought our clothing and our own desperate urgency. Jax yanked off his shirt, pulled the jeans off one of my legs and ground out, \u201cThat\u2019s good enough.\u201d</p><p>He ripped my panties to get at me, hissed through his teeth when I sheathed him in latex. Then he pushed my thighs wide to sink between them.</p><p>His first thrust inside me had my back bowing off the floor.</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d</p><p>With his neck arched, shoulders straining, sweat glistening on his chest, Jax was impossibly beautiful. He throbbed inside me, so thick and hard, so deep. My heels dug into the carpet, my hips churning as I struggled to accommodate him.</p><p>\u201cBaby, wait,\u201d he gasped, gripping my waist to hold me still. \u201cI\u2019m too close....\u201d</p><p>\u201cJax...please!\u201d</p><p>He looked down at me fiercely, his eyes glittering in the semidarkness of a room lit only by light spilling through the windows.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you want?\u201d He pulled back, sliding out of me. Then thrust.</p><p>\u201cOh, God,\u201d I moaned, quivering. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>One hand at a time, he linked his fingers with mine and pulled my arms over my head. Rolling his hips, he stroked deep on the inside, rubbing me perfectly on the outside. For all his impatience to get at me, once he was there, he took his time. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His lips touched my ear and he whispered, \u201cGive it to me, baby. Let me feel you.\u201d</p><p>Rocking upward, I wrapped my legs around him and took it, climaxing with a low pained moan, shivering with pleasure as my sex clenched in desperate ripples around him.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he coaxed hoarsely, beginning to move. \u201cAh, Jesus, you feel amazing.\u201d</p><p>I held on, his measured drives keeping me hot and wanting. My core tightened, reaching again.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so hard,\u201d I whispered, loving the feel of him, the smooth slick glide.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d He kissed me, his hands tightening on mine as his hips lunged again and again, taking me with long, deep plunges. \u201cGia, baby...you\u2019re making me come.\u201d</p><p>His pace quickened, then he tensed, his head thrown back as the orgasm hit him. I watched, awed, as shudders racked his powerful frame. He groaned my name, his eyes squeezed shut, his neck straining as he came with such intensity it brought me off again.</p><p>Turning my head, I sank my teeth into his forearm, muffling my cries as the hunger sharpened painfully, then receded into a hot, sweet ache.</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d He clutched me firmly, nuzzling his sweat-slickened face against mine.</p> <p>Wrapped in him, filled with him, I released my bite and pressed my lips to the mark. Wishing it was possible to so easily brand him as mine.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>JAX ROLLED TO his back beside me and groaned. \u201cI can\u2019t feel my legs.\u201d</p><p>I laughed, knowing just how he felt. I was tingling all over, as if my entire body was reawakening after a long hibernation.</p><p>Which was sadly true.</p><p>He turned his head toward me. I looked at him.</p> <p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, reaching for my hand and lifting it to his mouth for a kiss.</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d I studied him, seeing that soft warmth in his eyes I\u2019d missed so much.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t make it to the bedroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cS\u2019okay.\u201d I smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get you there as soon as I can walk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting old, Rutledge?\u201d I teased, knowing that at twenty-nine, he was in his prime.</p><p>He looked at the raised ceiling with its pretty moldings. \u201cOut of practice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right.\u201d I threw my arm over my face, hiding my reaction. I couldn\u2019t think about him with other women. It made me crazy. \u201cI read the papers, you know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEscorting a woman somewhere and fucking her are two different things.\u201d He leaned over me. Catching my wrist, he pulled my arm above my head and exposed my face. \u201cBut it feels good to know you\u2019ve been keeping tabs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jax flashed his dimple at me. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He rose up to his knees and sank back on his heels, removing the condom. His movements were easy and unaffected, but the sight of his half-hard cock glistening with semen made my mouth water.</p><p>I pushed up onto my elbows and licked my lips. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>He responded instantly, his cock stiffening and lengthening. \u201cJesus, Gia.\u201d</p><p>I moved toward him.</p><p>\u201cShower,\u201d he said hoarsely, pushing unsteadily to his feet, then holding out his hand to me. \u201cI\u2019ll taste like rubber without one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d He pulled me up. \u201cOnce I slide into your mouth, I\u2019m staying there awhile.\u201d</p><p>I looked at him, taking him in, finding him so damned sexy standing there\u2014tall and bare chested, his jeans open and shoved down, his cock exposed and curving upward toward his navel. I\u2019d never seen anything so blatantly masculine and erotic.</p><p>This was the Jax I knew. And loved so much.</p><p>\u201cLook at you,\u201d he murmured, his thumb brushing over my swollen lower lip. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking sexy. So soft and beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight.\u201d My mouth curved as I checked myself out. My jeans and torn panties clung to one leg and my shirt was shoved up over my breasts. No doubt my hair was a mess. \u201cSpoken like a man who just had an orgasm and wants another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d He caught my chin, tilting my head up. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask me to give you everything I\u2019ve got, then take it lightly. It\u2019s not fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d I agreed. \u201cIt isn\u2019t, is it?\u201d</p><p>From the tightening of his jaw, I knew he got the message\u2014he\u2019d taken me lightly...then left me behind.</p><p>Crouching, he held my jeans down so I could pull my leg free. Then he caught my hand and led me around the wrought-iron-and-glass coffee table.</p><p>We crossed the taupe carpet to enter a bedroom boasting a king-size bed with a dark wood headboard matching the desk and armoire also in the room. There was a seating area by a window that stretched up to the high ceiling, and the entry into the bathroom was a beautifully simple archway.</p><p>I tried not to show how astonished I was when Jax flipped the light on, but was glad he didn\u2019t look at me because I was pretty sure I failed. The room was huge, with a shower that could accommodate three people and a separate sunken tub with jets. A television was embedded in the wall and the dual-sink vanity resembled the heavy wooden furniture in the bedroom.</p><p>I had to ask. \u201cDid you book this room thinking you\u2019d get me to come here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hoped.\u201d Jax let me go to turn on the shower. I whistled, impressed by the giant showerhead embedded in the ceiling, which sprayed water straight down like a waterfall.</p><p>He faced me with a smile that dazzled me. \u201cCan I finish unwrapping you?\u201d</p><p>A sharp ache spread through me. Gia, baby, you\u2019re my present to myself after a long, hard day. One of the many things he\u2019d said to me back in Vegas that had made me love him.</p><p>I wondered suddenly if that was just who Jax was and the way he talked to whatever woman was with him at the time. Maybe he hadn\u2019t a clue about how sweet nothings like that could turn a girl inside out. Or maybe he did. The thought depressed me.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d He caught my chin, tilting my head back. \u201cDon\u2019t check out on me now. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m in this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor how long? The weekend?\u201d I backed away, some niggling sense of self-preservation warning me to get out while I was ahead. \u201cI can\u2019t do this, Jax.\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cGia...\u201d</p><p>I turned and hurried through the bedroom to get my clothes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d he snapped, grabbing my arm as I crossed over the threshold into the living room. \u201cYou wanted this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was a mistake.\u201d A huge mistake. I was too invested in my feelings for him to find closure this way.</p><p>\u201cThe hell it was.\u201d He tugged me around to face him, grabbing me by the forearms so that I couldn\u2019t get away. \u201cWhy did you ask for this? You wanted to come here. You wanted me to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to fuck you,\u201d I growled, hating how he recoiled from my words. \u201cI wanted to get past the tension so maybe you\u2019d start giving me the truth. I don\u2019t want any more of your smooth-player bullshit. It\u2019s not real. You\u2019re not real.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about? This is as real as it gets, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>I yanked free and stalked farther into the living room, feeling foolish in only socks and my Rossi\u2019s T-shirt. \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for what? Me?\u201d Jax\u2019s long stride easily overtook mine. He reached my jeans first and stepped on the cuff, pinning them to the floor. His arms crossed his chest, displaying the raw power of his ripped body to perfection. He didn\u2019t care at all that his pants were still undone, although he\u2019d hitched his boxer briefs up at some point along the way.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have the time or patience to pretend like we\u2019re building something here when we\u2019re not.\u201d I fixed my ponytail, trying to focus on putting myself back together\u2014at least on the outside.</p><p>His scowl depended. \u201cWho\u2019s pretending?\u201d</p><p>I threw up my hands. \u201cWhy do you talk to me like you do? All that crap about unwrapping and missing me and...and all of it! Why can\u2019t you just be real about what we have, what we\u2019ve always had\u2014nothing but great sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not just fucking,\u201d he growled, leaning forward. \u201cYou don\u2019t fall in love over nothing but sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to be in love with you? Does it make it better for you if I am?\u201d To my horror, I felt my eyes sting with tears. \u201cYou\u2019ve already gotten into my pants. I don\u2019t understand why you have to act like this is a romance. Don\u2019t make something that should be simple so complicated for me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, we\u2019ve never had simple.\u201d He exhaled harshly and reached up to rub the back of his neck. \u201cWhat do you want from me, Gia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think we need to focus on what you want from me, since what I want is irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>He scowled. \u201cThat\u2019s not true.\u201d</p><p>My hands went to my hips. \u201cI want a commitment, a chance, some effort made to see how far this thing between us could go. You\u2019ve already shot that down. So what\u2019s left is what you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to fuck me,\u201d I corrected. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just be matter-of-fact about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d He shook his head and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m an asshole to everyone else in my life. You\u2019re the one thing I\u2019ve cherished. Don\u2019t make me stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee? Like that! Why do you have to say stuff like that? Why can\u2019t you just say you like me or something\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t just like you. You get under my skin. I think about you damn near all the time and I get hard. I see you and I forget who I am. You don\u2019t know what you do to me.\u201d Jax\u2019s voice lowered dangerously. \u201cYou make me want to rut, Gia. I want to pull you beneath me, work my cock into you and ride until you\u2019ve wrung me dry. You make me need\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d God, I was quivering, my hunger stirring in response to the heated waves of desire sizzling off him.</p><p>\u201cYou know how it feels. You\u2019re feeling it, too. Let me give it to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d The refusal cut deep, like restraining part of myself with barbed wire.</p><p>\u201cGive me tonight.\u201d He reached for my hand and squeezed too tightly. \u201cOne night.\u201d</p><p>I laughed softly even as my sight blurred. \u201cOne night to screw me out of your system? That\u2019s a clich\u00e9, Jax. It never works. Great sex doesn\u2019t stop being great just because you gorge on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll have a night of great sex. We both want it. Need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need this.\u201d I tried to reclaim my hand, but he wouldn\u2019t let go.</p><p>\u201cThe hell you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Nothing but the truth would work with Jax. He read me too easily, was too adept at homing in on a challenger\u2019s weakness and exploiting it.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d I said again, holding his gaze. \u201cI\u2019m not like the women you\u2019re used to sleeping with. I can\u2019t do it for fun or to scratch an itch. Not with you. I fell for you the last time. I can\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still in love with me,\u201d he retorted bluntly. \u201cGive me a chance to make that something you stop regretting.\u201d</p><p>I turned away from him, my gaze sweeping over a living room that was bigger than my bedroom back home. \u201cI want you to take me back to Rossi\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a problem.\u201d He came up behind me, his arms wrapping around me. With his lips to my throat, he whispered, \u201cI want to take you to bed. If you don\u2019t want me to talk, I won\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, absorbing the feel of him behind me. The warmth of his body, the scent of his skin now musky with sweat and sex, the soft caress of his breath.</p><p>\u201cYou left the shower on,\u201d I said, latching on to something inane and far less personal.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d turn it off if I wasn\u2019t afraid you\u2019d bail while I wasn\u2019t looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me prisoner here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I want you willing. I want the Gia who demanded I bring her here and give her whatever she wanted.\u201d</p><p>I glanced over my shoulder at him, finding his eyes glittering at me from the shadows that caressed his beautiful face. I felt the pull inside me, that inexorable tugging between us. I didn\u2019t know how to turn it off or ignore it. Some sick cosmic joke had made me hardwired to crave him with every fiber of my being.</p><p>Did I have what it took to convince him to stay? I had what it took to get him to want more; that was a start.</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s not enough,\u201d I said quietly.</p><p>\u201cThank God. I just threw that out there to buy some time to convince you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk away without a goodbye like last time.\u201d I turned in his arms. \u201cI want you to look me in the eye and say you\u2019re through when you decide you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d</p><p>His lips thinned, but he nodded.</p><p>\u201cI want monogamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn straight. I\u2019m not sharing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking about you being monogamous,\u201d I said drily.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a given.\u201d He cupped my face. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy hours are erratic. My job comes first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fit into your life before\u2014I can do it again.\u201d</p><p>I gripped his wrists. I could go on with the list of my wants, but what I needed at that moment was distance and some perspective. I needed some time to back up, catch my breath and my bearings, then I might be able to figure out the next best move to make. \u201cI want you to turn off the damn shower and take me to dinner. I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, but it sounded strained. \u201cYou always did get hungry after sex. Can we actually take the shower first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d I leaned forward. \u201cI want you to smell me on your skin for the next couple hours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jax groaned. \u201cYou want to punish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep,\u201d I agreed. \u201cThat, too.\u201d</p><p>NICO SHOT ME a knowing look when Jax and I returned to Rossi\u2019s. I stuck my tongue out at him.</p><p>We grabbed a table and ordered shiraz. I went with lasagna, Jax went with pollo alla cacciatora. While we waited for our food, I studied him, admiring the way the small candle on the table between us gilded him. He looked softer, more relaxed, his face impossibly more handsome.</p> <p>He had the look of a well-fucked man, one who was sated and yet anticipating further pleasures ahead. I loved that I put that look on him, but I hated it, too. Because I wasn\u2019t in danger just from the things he said; it was everything about him that made me vulnerable. The effect he had on me was in large part due to the effect I had on him.</p><p>I made him happy. Content. And it was difficult not to feel as if that made me special, even though I knew better.</p><p>\u201cSo Regina is your stepmom, right?\u201d I asked, giving my mind something else to think about.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He looked into his wineglass.</p><p>\u201cHow did that happen?\u201d Would he mention Ian and open that door...?</p> <p>\u201cMy mom died ten years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Seeing how he closed up alerted me\u2014I\u2019d touched on a painful subject. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as sorry as I was,\u201d he muttered before gulping down his near-full glass in three swallows. He refilled, then looked at me. \u201cYour mom looks great.\u201d</p><p>I nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s happy. Her kids are doing all right, business is good and she\u2019s about to be a grandmother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s Angelo dealing with impending fatherhood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. It threw off his plans to open another Rossi\u2019s, but that\u2019s probably for the best. Denise\u2014his wife\u2014has a new business of her own, so I think it would\u2019ve been a strain for them if they\u2019d tried juggling two startups and a new marriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you like her?\u201d he asked, his fingertips stroking up and down the stem of his glass.</p><p>\u201cA lot. She\u2019s great.\u201d I looked at the party next to us, a family of four enthusiastically discussing how good their food was. \u201cI thought I saw Allison at the fund-raiser last night. How are she and Ted doing?\u201d</p><p>Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about Jax\u2019s cousin and his bitchy wife, but talking about Jax\u2019s mom made me realize that he knew more about me than I did about him. Aside from his family members who made news because they were in office, I only knew Allison.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re solid.\u201d He took another drink. \u201cShe\u2019s what he needs to run for mayor in the next election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good that she\u2019s there for him.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cThey barely talk to each other. But she knows how to work the press and she\u2019s very active in his campaign planning. He made a good choice with her. She fits him the way Regina fits my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the political marriage/business partnership was a Hollywood stereotype.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jax reached over and lightly brushed the back of my hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be pragmatic about relationships. Marrying for love never works out well. My mom and dad were a love match and they made each other miserable. Now, Regina and Dad... They\u2019ll do just fine. She knows how to play the game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe seems like he genuinely cares for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter what he went through with my mom, she\u2019s got to seem like a gift.\u201d He took another drink, then leaned back as our food was served.</p><p>His change in mood was another warning. Talking about his mother didn\u2019t seem to sit well with him. I\u2019d have to be careful about approaching the topic. \u201cIan introduced them, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich turned out to be really lucky for him, didn\u2019t it?\u201d he said with an edge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cBecause he called in the favor and got you? You can\u2019t save him, Jax.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t asked to.\u201d He shrugged, his gaze hard. \u201cI\u2019m just supposed to keep Lei Yeung at bay. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>Nico walked over with a steaming plate of pasta in hand. \u201cMind if I join you two?\u201d</p><p>Jax pushed out the chair opposite him with his foot. \u201cThe more Rossis the merrier.\u201d</p><p>Sadly, the more Rutledges the scarier. And that had shaped Jax into the man he was.</p><p>I played with that in my thoughts as Jax and Nico settled into the easy banter of men, reminding me of how effortlessly Jax fit into my life...and how uncomfortable I was with his.</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>AFTER DINNER, JAX and I headed out to his rental. I paused before I slid into the passenger seat. \u201cIf I go back to the hotel with you, I\u2019ll need you to take me back to Nico\u2019s when he gets off work.\u201d</p><p>Jax rested his arm on the open car door. \u201cYou won\u2019t stay the night with me? I\u2019d like you to.\u201d</p><p>I did want to. And once, back in the day, I had dropped everything in my life for his visits and ended up resenting him for that. I may not have learned to stay away from him, but I\u2019d still picked up a thing or two about having a healthier relationship. \u201cI came here to spend time with my brother.\u201d</p><p>His chest lifted and fell on a deep breath. \u201cFair enough. Can I schedule time for you to spend with me?\u201d</p><p>We stood so close to each other, pressed into the space between the car and the door, but there was a gulf between us. I\u2019d created it, but I still wished it didn\u2019t have to be there. \u201cWhen are you thinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny night this week and next weekend for sure.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, then got in the car. He shut the door and rounded the trunk, giving me time to think about how the rest of the night could go. More sex. More Jax. I craved both, but it would\u2019ve been nice not have so many doubts and reservations. I missed how carefree we used to be. But then, I guess it was only that way for me. He\u2019d been counting down the minutes all the while.</p><p>He got in and closed the door, but didn\u2019t start the engine right away.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d he began, \u201cyou should know this is hard for me, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d I argued softly. \u201cI\u2019m clueless.\u201d</p><p>Jax twisted in his seat and reached for me, catching me by the nape and pulling me in. I closed my eyes, anticipating the moment when his parted lips would touch mine. His tongue caressed the curve of my mouth, a slow sweep that had me leaning closer for more.</p><p>\u201cSo sweet,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019m going to spread you across my bed and lick you from head to toe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at that,\u201d I said breathlessly, a shiver of eagerness moving through me.</p><p>He pulled back, as if to start the car, then surged forward again, catching my lips in a heated, wet, ravenous kiss. His mouth ate at mine, his tongue stroking deep and fast. I was just as greedy for him, my hand sliding into his hair, holding him by the roots while I frantically tasted him. He cupped my breast in his hand, plumping it, his thumb and forefinger surrounding my aching nipple and tugging rhythmically. I moaned, turned on and needy.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he groaned, releasing me and falling back heavily against the seat. \u201cI want you. Right here. Now.\u201d</p><p>I was more than tempted by the thought. If we had been anywhere but right outside Rossi\u2019s, I might have climbed over the gearshift and gone for it.</p><p>\u201cDrive fast,\u201d I told him.</p><p>He laughed hoarsely and turned his head against the headrest to look at me. \u201cFine. But when we get to bed, I\u2019m taking it real slow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJAX!\u201d CLAWING AT the sheets, my body arching away from the torture of his mouth, even as I craved more. I\u2019d forgotten what he could do to me, how he could strip away my skin to get into the very heart of me, how his complete command of my body made me willing to do or say anything for the pleasure he could give.</p><p>He held me pinned at the thighs, his mouth on my throbbing sex, his tongue licking leisurely. The velvety strokes over my clit had me gasping, the need for an orgasm so fierce I was drenched in sweat, my legs vibrating from the strain.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d I begged hoarsely, squeezing my heavy breasts, the tips swollen and tender from the long minutes he\u2019d spent drawing on them with slow, measured pulls of his mouth.</p><p>His silky hair brushed over my skin. He lifted his head. \u201cPlease what, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, God... Make me come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a little more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease!\u201d I pushed my hand between my legs, desperate to bring myself off.</p><p>He nipped at my fingers and I cried out, panting.</p><p>His head lowered, his tongue tracing the swollen folds. He circled my clit, then rimmed the trembling opening below.</p><p>I grabbed his head, holding him to me, struggling to lift my hips to his mouth. Jax was too strong, restraining me easily, his breath hot against my sensitive flesh. He suckled gently, moving slowly along the length of my cleft, giving me just enough pressure to drive me insane.</p><p>\u201cLet me turn around,\u201d I gasped. \u201cLet me suck you.\u201d</p><p>His chuckle was filled with such wicked amusement it sent goose bumps racing across my skin.</p><p>And then he thrust his tongue inside me.</p><p>\u201cJax!\u201d</p><p>He cupped my butt and lifted me, angling me into his working mouth. His tongue fucked me swiftly, the shallow plunges into my trembling sex driving me hard toward orgasm. His growl vibrated against my clit, his pleasure feeding my own.</p><p>I clutched at his hair, moaning, digging my heels into the mattress to rock against his lips.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d I sobbed, so close, my entire body tingling.</p><p>Jax surged onto his knees, elevating me. My legs spread wide, giving him limitless access. He devoured me, so hungry and greedy. I couldn\u2019t breathe for the pleasure. The frenzied licking against sensitive tissues overloaded my senses. I watched him, as he\u2019d meant for me to. The sight of his dark head between my thighs, the rapid-fire flickering of his tongue, the beauty of his biceps hardened from supporting my weight...unbearably erotic.</p><p>He was gorgeous. Everything I\u2019d ever wanted. And the fierce need that etched his face warned that his demands would take me to the edge before he was through with me.</p><p>Another low moan broke from my dry throat. \u201cOh, Jax...I\u2019m going to come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d he ordered. \u201cI want you milking my dick when you lose it.\u201d</p><p>I gave a clenched-teeth scream of frustration as he lowered me to the bed and reared, snatching up a condom and ripping it open. He was sheathed and coming over me a heartbeat later, but it was too long. I had no patience. I caught him in the cage of my arms and legs, pulling him to me, lifting to him.</p><p>He allowed me to drag him down, his palms flat on the bed by my shoulders, his biceps thick and hard. He reached between us with one hand, fisting his penis and stroking the wide crest through my slickness. I gasped and his eyes darkened, his cheeks flushing as he notched into the grasping opening to my sex.</p><p>\u201cJax,\u201d I growled in warning.</p><p>He thrust hard, sinking deep in one lunge, wrenching a cry from me as I fell hard into orgasm. Neck arched and eyes squeezed shut, I lay taut as the pleasure pulsed through me, my core tightening on the powerfully thick cock inside me.</p><p>\u201cFuck, yeah,\u201d he groaned, grabbing fistfuls of the sheets and pumping that long, rigid column of flesh into my quaking body. The climax grew, spurred by the rhythmic blows of his pelvis into my clit...the feel of his erection plunging relentlessly.</p><p>I writhed, helpless, lost to him, struggling to hang on to the part of my soul that wanted to surrender.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby.\u201d Jax\u2019s lips were at my ear, his breath hot and quick. \u201cDig those claws into me.\u201d</p><p>My nails were grasping at his sweat-slicked back, feeling the muscles flex as his body worked to service mine. His buttocks tensed and released beneath my calves, his thighs bunching and powering the drives of his hips.</p><p>His teeth sank into my earlobe and he groaned, his rock-hard abs contracting against my stomach, his sweat and mine sealing us together.</p><p>\u201cThose noises you make,\u201d he gasped. \u201cGod...they make me so hard.\u201d</p><p>And he was. Like stone.</p><p>\u201cSo g-good.\u201d I swallowed past a dry throat. \u201cJax...it\u2019s so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were made for me,\u201d he said fiercely. \u201cNo one else, Gia. You\u2019re mine.\u201d</p><p>He drove the point home with every plunge, fucking me so thoroughly I couldn\u2019t think beyond the need to come again.</p><p>My body was no longer my own.</p><p>Jax was the only one who could do this to me...make me mindless...an animal. I wasn\u2019t me when I was in bed with him; I was his. Willing and ready to do whatever he wanted, to take whatever he chose to give me, knowing he would make me come again and again...</p><p>I whimpered, feeling his grip tighten, his muscles gathering as his own pleasure grew.</p><p>He nuzzled his damp face against me. \u201cSo tight and hot...Gia.\u201d</p><p>I realized then that he was clinging to me as desperately as I was to him, that urgency laced every breath, every touch. He was screwing me as if he\u2019d die if he stopped, as if it were possible to fuck me hard enough to delve even deeper beneath my skin.</p><p>My eyes stung with tears when the orgasm hit, stealing my breath and causing spots to blur my vision. A low noise poured out of me, unrecognizable as mine.</p><p>\u201cAh, sweetheart.\u201d He kissed me, absorbing the sound, slowing until he was just circling his hips, stirring his raging erection inside me. \u201cI love that sound you make when you come. It tells me how good you feel, how much you love my cock...my mouth...my hands.\u201d</p><p>How much I loved him.</p><p>I was sprawled beneath him, wide open and possessed, while he felt like a dream. Something I\u2019d conjured.</p><p>\u201cFeel me,\u201d he breathed, pushing up to look down at me. His eyes were so dark, his face flushed, the skin stretched tight with lust over the sculpted angles of his face. \u201cInside you\u2014\u201d he rolled his hips, then caught my hand, lifting it to his slick chest \u201c\u2014and you inside me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJax\u2014\u201d</p><p>He took my mouth, kissing me deeply, his tongue rubbing along mine. His hips circled slowly, making me feel every throbbing inch of him. The leisurely, deliberate stroking over tender nerves kept me hot and edgy. He remembered me well, knew just how to keep me revved and needy.</p><p>\u201cI missed you, Gia,\u201d he whispered into the kiss. \u201cDid you ache for me, too?\u201d</p><p>When I didn\u2019t reply, he brushed the wet tendrils of my hair away from my face and searched for the answer.</p> <p>My sex rippled along his length. His eyes closed and his lips parted, his body tightening. \u201cNot yet. I\u2019m not coming yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d I was begging and I didn\u2019t care. I just wanted him to come. I wanted it more than my next breath.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not rushing this.\u201d He reached behind him to grab my wrist, bringing my right arm up and over my head. His other hand pushed beneath my buttock, lifting me into a smooth, easy thrust. \u201cUmm...perfect. It\u2019s always been perfect.\u201d</p><p>I wanted to tease him, to play the game as coolly as he was, but I couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cStop thinking and feel, baby,\u201d he murmured, nibbling on the corner of my mouth. \u201cLet me make you feel good. That\u2019s all I want. To make you feel good.\u201d</p> <p>Turning my head, I caught his lips and let him.</p><p>NICO EYED ME as I slid onto a bar stool at Rossi\u2019s after closing and I knew he saw my makeupless state, which betrayed the shower I\u2019d taken just a half hour before. He had been cleaning up the bar, but he stopped and pulled out a beer, popping off the top before sliding the bottle over to me.</p><p>\u201cForgot how much I like Jax,\u201d he said conversationally.</p><p>I nodded. I liked Jax, too. Thing was, I didn\u2019t know which Jax was the real one.</p><p>\u201cYou two going to work it out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s temporary. But this time, I know the rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMaybe I don\u2019t like him so much.\u201d Nico popped open a second beer and took a long pull. \u201cHe\u2019s in love with you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in lust,\u201d I countered drily, picking at the label on the bottle. \u201cAnd that\u2019s okay, I can live with that. It\u2019s the other stuff\u2014the way he talks to me sometimes, as if there\u2019s more, and the head trip I\u2019m on about why he left and came back\u2014that\u2019s hard for me to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy offer to knock some sense into him still stands.\u201d</p><p>I smiled. \u201cMight be easier and more effective to knock sense into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan do that, too.\u201d He tapped his bottle against mine. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got plenty of sense. You know what you\u2019re doing. You just wish you weren\u2019t doing it. He obviously doesn\u2019t have a clue or else he wouldn\u2019t risk letting you get away. He\u2019ll never find better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, God, don\u2019t get sappy on me now. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d I wasn\u2019t entirely kidding. I felt weepy and emotional. Sex with Jax did that to me.</p><p>Nico grinned. \u201cFine. Get off your ass and help me clean up so we can get the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, I slid off the bar stool. \u201cShit. I should\u2019ve stuck with sappy instead.\u201d</p> <p>AN INSISTENT POUNDING on Nico\u2019s door woke me Sunday morning. I rolled off the couch with a curse, stumbling over with the intention of bitching out whoever it was.</p><p>When I blinked wearily through the peephole, however, I saw beloved faces.</p><p>Pulling off the security chain and turning the dead bolt, I opened the door to my brothers and Denise. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d I groused.</p><p>\u201cYeah. What the fuck?\u201d Nico wandered in from the bedroom wearing sweatpants that barely clung to his hips. Brother or not, I could still appreciate what a good-looking man he was. \u201cYou know what time it is?\u201d</p><p>Vincent came in first. \u201cTime to get up.\u201d</p><p>Angelo followed Denise in, holding her hand in his. \u201cYou put Gianna on the couch? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI offered her the bed.\u201d Nico crossed his arms. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t blame her,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cIf that bed could talk, it\u2019d have its own reality show.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be jealous,\u201d Nico returned. \u201cI\u2019m sure your bed will see some action eventually. Despite everything, you\u2019re still a Rossi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d I interjected. I was really happy to see them. Having my family around brought back normalcy I\u2019d lost the night before in Jax\u2019s bed. I was back to feeling like Gianna Rossi\u2014and not absolutely sure I was the writhing, moaning, clawing woman who\u2019d enjoyed a half-dozen orgasms in a matter of hours. It was as if I were two different people.</p><p>And you\u2019re mad at Jax for having two sides....</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re waiting for you to get dressed so we can grab some breakfast,\u201d Denise answered. Her hair was pulled into pigtails that framed her pale face. She\u2019d matched her lipstick to the pink in her hair, making her look like some sort of anime superheroine. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong with you people,\u201d Nico muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s too fucking early for food or anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nine o\u2019clock,\u201d Vincent pointed out.</p><p>Nico shot me a look and drawled, \u201cAs I said.\u201d</p><p>BY NOON, WE\u2019D eaten and hit the basketball court at Nico\u2019s apartment complex. Not to brag, but I was pretty good at the game\u2014enough that I\u2019d gotten a partial scholarship to UNLV for my skills. Of course, I\u2019d learned everything I knew from my brothers.</p><p>I had just cleared a three-pointer and was waving off the usual good-natured taunts and ribbing when I caught sight of Jax walking up. I stopped right where I was, admiring his long legs in shorts and his loose-fitting T-shirt. He wore shades and twirled his keys around his finger. When Nico bounced the ball to him, Jax caught it up and dazzled me with his dimpled grin.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said, coming to me first and pressing his lips to my flushed forehead.</p><p>\u201cYou found us.\u201d A hot rush of pleasure surged through me. He\u2019d picked me up and dropped me off at Rossi\u2019s, so finding Nico\u2019s place had taken initiative and effort.</p><p>\u201cI missed waking up to you,\u201d he whispered against my skin.</p><p>His damned sunglasses made it impossible to read him. I took the ball and backed up so I could breathe.</p><p>\u201cRutledge,\u201d Angelo greeted him, bristling.</p><p>\u201cKick back, killer,\u201d Denise admonished, rising from the chair her husband had dragged over from the pool area. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Denise. Angelo\u2019s wife.\u201d</p><p>Jax shook her hand. \u201cA pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about you,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of it good. I hope you prove the guys wrong.\u201d</p><p>Jax glanced at me with raised brows.</p><p>\u201cOh, she doesn\u2019t talk about you at all,\u201d Denise qualified, making me smile. The woman knew how to get her digs in.</p><p>Vincent and Angelo both reluctantly shook hands with Jax, then Vincent said, \u201cAre we playing or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to jump in when there\u2019s a chance,\u201d Jax said, surprising me.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Nico ran a hand through his hair. \u201cTake my spot on Gianna\u2019s team. I\u2019m wiped, thanks to some too-fucking-early-in-the-morning visitors.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPussy,\u201d Angelo muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhatev. We were kicking your ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were going easy on you,\u201d Vincent answered, catching the ball when I tossed it his way. \u201cSo we wouldn\u2019t have to hear you bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t hear me if you\u2019d stayed home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d I told them. \u201cLet\u2019s do this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my girl,\u201d Jax said with a smile.</p><p>We started the game. Jax was good. Really good.</p><p>I\u2019ve played hoops now and then. Nothing like you. Never gave it the time.</p><p>I remembered those words of his from before, whispered into my hair while he cuddled me after sex. Clearly, he\u2019d given it time since we parted.</p><p>Had he done so because of me? Was I reaching by making that connection?</p><p>Jax passed the ball and I made the shot.</p><p>If only figuring him out were as easy.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>MONDAY WAS A day like any other, yet it felt so different. It took a lot of work to avoid thinking about Jax. At least until I got to the office.</p><p>I arrived a half hour early, but Lei was already there. She sat at her desk, dressed in a black skirt and blazer embellished with red. Her hair was up, her red-framed glasses perched on her delicate nose. She glanced up when I stepped through the open doorway, her painted mouth set in a hard line.</p><p>\u201cIan got to Isabelle over the weekend and signed her.\u201d She pulled her glasses off.</p><p>\u201cWhat? How did he know?\u201d</p><p>Lei sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s a good question.\u201d</p><p>I felt a flutter of unease in my stomach. \u201cI haven\u2019t told a soul. No one.\u201d</p><p>She nodded grimly. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Isabelle leverage you against Ian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Leaning back, she gestured for me to settle into one of the chairs in front of her desk. \u201cIan is better known than I am.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to the Hollywood-themed eateries she\u2019d envisioned, which Ian had stolen from her. The irony was painful.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think so,\u201d she went on. \u201cOne of the things that attracted Isabelle to working with us is that Savor is headed by a woman. Ian would\u2019ve had to make an offer too good to refuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wonder what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to find out. I\u2019m meeting with Isabelle over lunch to see what I can coax out of her.\u201d</p><p>I took a seat. \u201cI should talk to Chad. Maybe take him out to lunch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I was going to suggest that.\u201d She studied me. \u201cDid you see Jackson Rutledge this weekend?\u201d</p><p>I hesitated a split second before answering, feeling as if a trap were closing in on me. \u201cI did,\u201d I confessed, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t talk business. Not even in a roundabout way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you trust him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...\u201d I frowned. I trusted him with my body. I trusted him to know how much my family meant to me. Was there anything else? \u201cWith what?\u201d</p><p>She smiled in a way that said she knew why I\u2019d hesitated. \u201cWhat are you going to do about him?\u201d</p><p>Sitting back, I let the question really sink in. I\u2019d been fielding variations of that same query all weekend, but I hadn\u2019t given it much thought. What was I going to do? It struck me then that I\u2019d never done anything when it came to Jax. He decided when our relationship began and ended, where we met, and when\u2014and how\u2014we had sex. All along, I\u2019d just gone with his flow.</p><p>It was time for me to start making my own rules. Something beyond asking him to say goodbye when he decided we were over.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet,\u201d I answered honestly. But I was going to work on it.</p><p>WHEN I GOT to my desk, I called the Four Seasons and left a message at the hotel\u2019s front desk for Chad to call me. It was still early, and I didn\u2019t want to risk waking him up. I needed him refreshed and sharp to go over our business plans.</p><p>Isabelle was gone. We needed a replacement. Quick.</p><p>I looked through all my notes, considering the chefs who\u2019d caught my attention previously. There weren\u2019t that many who specialized in Italian, mostly because my background made it really hard to impress me. Then again, going with another Italian was problematic\u2014it would be hard to spin Isabelle\u2019s defection in a way that wouldn\u2019t make the new recruit feel like a second choice.</p><p>I tapped my pen against my jaw, thinking. \u201cAmerican, European...\u201d</p><p>Lei walked out of her office.</p><p>\u201cAsian!\u201d I blurted.</p><p>She came to a halt, her brows raised. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>I stood. \u201cChad represents American cooking. Inez represents European. I think we need to find someone to represent\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAsian.\u201d Her arms crossed. \u201cDo you have any idea how hard it would be to pull together a dueling menu with that combination?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier than convincing some chef he or she isn\u2019t our last, desperate choice.\u201d</p><p>Her lips pursed. \u201cGood point. Do you have someone in mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDavid Lee.\u201d</p><p>Lei\u2019s mouth curved slightly, her eyes warming with a look of approval. \u201cHe\u2019s good, but I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>I nodded, very much in agreement with her. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m thinking I\u2019ll take Chad out to the Asian bistro where Lee works. Introduce them. See how they hit it off. Or not. Chad could steer David along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mentor.\u201d She nodded thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019ll let you run with this and we\u2019ll regroup after lunch. We\u2019ll need to move quickly, but we have the rest of today to decide our plans.\u201d</p><p>I was grateful for her trust and was determined not to let her down. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Lei smiled. \u201cI like your quick thinking, Gianna. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>Smiling in return, I got back to it.</p><p>A BEAUTIFUL BOUQUET of starburst lilies in a lovely pink vase arrived shortly after ten. My breath caught at the sight of them being carried down the hall by LaConnie. I knew they were from Jax. They were my favorite flowers, and he knew it.</p><p>\u201cWho sent you these, girl?\u201d LaConnie asked, setting them down on my desk. \u201cHe might be a keeper.\u201d</p><p>I wish.... I fingered the card, but didn\u2019t want to open it in front of anyone. It felt too personal. \u201cSomeone with good taste.\u201d</p><p>She shot a narrow-eyed glance at me before she backed away.</p><p>\u201cI love your dress,\u201d I told her, admiring the black sheath she wore that had an electric-blue piping to match her heels.</p><p>\u201cChanging the subject won\u2019t distract me from wanting to know who sent you those,\u201d she warned.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d I promised.</p><p>She wagged her finger at me. \u201cI\u2019m going to hold you to that!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When she was a good distance down the hall, I pulled the card from its stake and opened it.</p><p>Dinner tonight?</p><p>The blunt query was so typical of Jax, I couldn\u2019t help but grin. But still, things had to be different the second go-round. He\u2019d insinuated himself into my life so well that I hadn\u2019t been able to escape the memories until I\u2019d left Vegas, yet I had barely dipped my toe in his life. When he broke things off again, it would be the same in New York\u2014I\u2019d have memories of him everywhere. But he would be safe from my ghost.</p><p>That had to change. This time, I was going to haunt the man the way he haunted me.</p> <p>I dug my smartphone out of my purse and found the number he\u2019d called me from the night I\u2019d taken Chad to Denise\u2019s salon. I texted: Only if you\u2019re cooking. Your place?</p><p>It took five minutes before my phone vibrated on my desk. His reply: What time should I pick you up from work?</p><p>The surge of triumph I felt brightened my day. 5:30. And BTW...TY for the flowers. Lovely.</p><p>Yes, you are, he sent back.</p><p>I typed out a quick response: Says the most gorgeous guy I know.</p> <p>There was another pause, one long enough that I thought he wasn\u2019t going to answer. Then he sent, Skin deep.</p><p>That lingered with me for a long time.</p><p>WHEN CHAD CALLED me back, I asked him to meet me at Savor\u2019s offices. I thought it\u2019d be good to remind him of just how successful Lei was. He showed up just before noon, looking handsome in khakis and a tucked-in dress shirt, with his collar open and cuffs rolled up.</p><p>I met him at reception and led him back to my desk under the guise of fetching my purse. I wanted to use it as an excuse to show him around again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you called,\u201d he said, walking beside me. \u201cI\u2019m really starting to have my doubts with all that\u2019s going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you are. I mean, how many roadblocks can you hit before you take it as a sign, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d He shot me a grateful smile. \u201cYou get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to trust me to tell you if the time comes to throw in the towel.\u201d We reached my desk, and I stopped, facing him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to screw you over, Chad. I promise you that.\u201d</p><p>He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle of a tug-of-war between Ian and Lei, and I can\u2019t help thinking that means no one but you is really paying attention to me. I could be anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not anyone. You\u2019re one of the most talented chefs in the world today, and I\u2019m going to see that you shine.\u201d</p><p>Leaning forward, he caught my hand in his. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. You\u2019re giving me the chance to make this happen.\u201d</p><p>He glanced at the lilies on my desk. \u201cNice flowers. You got an admirer? Do I have competition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not serious.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHard to be serious when you\u2019re working as much as we do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the truth?\u201d I caught the handle of my purse and shut the drawer. \u201cI\u2019m married to my fabulous career.\u201d</p><p>Chad nodded. \u201cI know how that goes. I\u2019m glad we\u2019ll be working together so much over the next few months\u2014if everything pans out, anyway. Maybe we can carve out some time for fun. No strings.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cMaybe. Ready to roll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave been since I met you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, I caught his arm and we headed out.</p><p>\u201cRUTLEDGE CAPITAL.\u201d</p><p>I glanced up as Lei reached my desk. I\u2019d been waiting for her to get back so I could tell her the good news: David Lee was going to work out. He\u2019d hit it off with Chad right away. Plus, when I talked vaguely with David about our plans for Chad, he hadn\u2019t been shy. He\u2019d said outright that he was hoping for a similar opportunity to come his way, too.</p><p>\u201cWhat about it?\u201d I asked, rising to my feet.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Isabelle, Rutledge Capital committed to a significant investment in Pembry Ventures. She says she spoke with Jackson Rutledge himself on Sunday and he confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>A heavy lump of ice settled in my stomach. \u201cYesterday?\u201d A weekend Jax had spent in my life. In me...</p><p>I sank slowly back into my chair.</p><p>Lei nodded grimly. \u201cIan offered Isabelle a fantastically lucrative signing package. She would\u2019ve been a fool to refuse it.\u201d She closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose. \u201cSo stupid of him! And petty. Ian isn\u2019t making smart moves. Neither is Rutledge.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d slid out of Jackson\u2019s bed, and he\u2019d slid a knife in my back.</p><p>\u201cWe can get David Lee,\u201d I said hoarsely. I had to focus on the immediate goal. It would happen if I gave it my all. \u201cHe likes the idea of a trio. Less pressure and heat while he finds his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said drily. \u201cIs he really that humble?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a strategic move. He\u2019ll want to cut loose eventually, sooner rather than later, but we can get a couple years out of him, I think.\u201d</p><p>She gave an elaborate sigh. \u201cI went ahead and signed Inez before Ian got to her. It\u2019s contingent upon a deal with Mondego, but it shores us up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re back on track.\u201d I glanced at the flowers on my desk. If Jax were planning on saying goodbye tonight, he was in for a surprise. I wasn\u2019t going to let him just stroll into my life and screw everything up...again.</p><p>Paybacks were a bitch. So was I, when the situation called for it.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d she asked, studying my face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d I said calmly, feeling the chill in my gut spread and numb me. \u201cWe should sign David as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we should probably take Chad back on a site tour of the Mondego in Atlanta. Let him get the sense that things really are moving forward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to do that.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cI think I could use a few days away.\u201d</p><p>Lei leaned her hip against the front of my desk. \u201cAway from Jackson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m having dinner with him tonight, actually.\u201d</p><p>Something in my tone must have given my thoughts away, because her lips curved wryly. \u201cThat should be interesting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can bet on it.\u201d I exhaled the hurt I couldn\u2019t contain and let the anger spread. Worry followed swiftly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a problem with me seeing him, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten why I hired you, Gianna.\u201d Lei headed toward her office. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m good and you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>I would be. But I wasn\u2019t there yet.</p><p>FIVE O\u2019CLOCK ROLLED around and my excitement ratcheted up. Not just because Chad had agreed to head to Atlanta the next day and I was ready to get out of town. The truth: I was ready to see Jax and deal with him. I had to force myself to slow down when I saw him waiting at the curb for me after work, act as if nothing were wrong in my world and I had time to spare.</p><p>He lounged against a black McLaren, a car I recognized because one of Lei\u2019s chefs had bought one to celebrate the five-year anniversary of his first restaurant. Jax\u2019s arms and ankles were crossed, his pose relaxed and sexy. Sunglasses shielded his eyes from the glaring reflections cast by the towering skyscrapers around him. He was dressed in black slacks, a white shirt and gray tie. His dark hair was tousled, like he\u2019d run a hand through it and let his styling efforts go at that.</p><p>Women stared at him as they walked by, their heads turning to keep their eyes on him even as their feet moved. Men glanced his way and altered course some, instinctively recognizing an alpha male at rest. Jax always had that effect on people. When he entered a space, he immediately took it over.</p><p>Squaring my shoulders, I pushed through the revolving doors and walked straight up to him. I wore a black Nina Ricci sheath. It was an elegant, classic piece that I\u2019d paired with the nude peep-toe Louboutins my brothers had collectively given me for my last birthday.</p><p>I looked like the kind of woman who would be seen with Jackson Rutledge. Better yet, I felt like it.</p><p>Keeping my stride, I marched up to him, fisted his tie in one hand, and stretched up to kiss him. Hard.</p><p>A low rumbling sound was my reward, followed by the rapid unfolding of his big body. He got me before I could pull away, catching me by the nape and hip, holding me to him as he deepened the kiss into a full-blown melding of our open mouths.</p><p>Standing on the street, with cars and people streaming by, we kissed as if we were alone.</p><p>\u201cHello, gorgeous,\u201d he said gruffly when I broke away to pull air into my tightened lungs. He nuzzled his cheek against mine.</p><p>I broke free with a quick twist and slapped him across the face.</p><p>His head turned with the blow, his breath hissing out between his teeth. Rubbing his jaw, he looked at me with hot eyes. \u201cI\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not looking to play rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fucked me over, Jax. Right after you fucked me literally. Did you take a shower first? Or were you still smelling like me when you made the call?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet in the car, Gia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole.\u201d I tamped down my simmering anger at him. At me. At the entire situation. But mostly at him.</p><p>\u201cAlways have been,\u201d he agreed grimly. He straightened and opened the passenger door, which involved pulling the door out then pushing it upward. \u201cTook you a long time to figure that out.\u201d</p><p>I stood there a moment, staring at him. He stared back, his eyes hidden behind the damned sunglasses, his mouth an unyielding line.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose your confidence now,\u201d he taunted softly.</p><p>My mind spun as it had all day. Why did he want me to go with him? Why the flowers and the invitation to dinner? \u201cYou angling for a kiss-off screw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ending things. I want you. That\u2019s not news.\u201d</p><p>His brusque, unapologetic attitude made my teeth grind. It was like he was daring me to be the one to walk away.</p><p>I slid into the seat and clicked my seat belt into place.</p><p>Jax ducked his head down. He looked at me over the rim of his shades. \u201cFor future reference, the slap was overkill. You had me down for the count with the kiss.\u201d</p><p>He straightened and shut the door.</p><p>I smiled grimly. In the boardroom and the bedroom, Jackson Rutledge was going to learn a thing or two about playing with me.</p><p>JAX PULLED INTO the subterranean parking garage of his apartment building and two valets greeted us. As one of the bow-tied guys helped me out of the car, I was struck again by the financial gulf between Jax and me. I wasn\u2019t intimidated by his wealth, but it was possible the disparity was a bigger problem for him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t improve my mood to think of it.</p><p>Reaching for my hand, Jax linked our fingers and led me to an elevator. I\u2019d half expected him to fly us out to Virginia or D.C., and realized abruptly that I had never allowed myself to consider the likelihood of him living at least part-time in New York, too. But of course it made sense that he would have a place in the city, which was the financial center of the country.</p><p>The elevator doors closed behind us, and he immediately pulled me into him. I let him. He leaned back against the brass handrail, spread his legs, and urged me to stand between them, his hands running up and down the length of my spine.</p><p>It\u2019d been so long since I\u2019d been held with such intimacy and tenderness.</p><p>He\u2019d been in New York the whole time....</p><p>I closed my eyes and absorbed the warmth of his body, the smell of his skin, the soft caress of his breath against my temple. I\u2019d denied myself the comfort of a man\u2019s touch for too long.</p><p>\u201cHow was your day?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cBusy. How was yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop thinking about you.\u201d</p><p>I closed my eyes, holding fiercely to my wrath. It was a harder task than it should\u2019ve been.</p><p>He laid his cheek against my temple. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Gia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what? Helping Pembry screw the deal I was working on?\u201d</p><p>Jax sighed. \u201cYou knew the score. We talked about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t excuse you. I don\u2019t accept your apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t blame you, but you\u2019ll find a way to handle it. This is a minor setback you\u2019ll have no problem overcoming.\u201d</p><p>I met his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re damned right.\u201d</p><p>The elevator dinged, announcing our arrival on his floor. When I turned around and saw a small foyer and double doors, I realized Jax lived in a penthouse apartment. Which explained why the elevator hadn\u2019t stopped in between the parking garage and what I now knew to be the top floor.</p><p>Grabbing my hand again, Jax led me across gold-veined marble tiles and unlocked the door by placing his palm against a wall-mounted security pad.</p><p>\u201cI bet your dates love this James Bond stuff,\u201d I said as the thick walnut door swung open automatically. I managed to say the words casually, but envy ate at me as I imagined him with other women.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of it?\u201d he asked, looking over his shoulder at me.</p><p>\u201cAh, well, I\u2019m a simple girl at heart.\u201d My gaze raked over the sunken living room with its snow-white carpet, black-leather-and-chrome chairs and sapphire-blue area rug. A sterile, bluntly masculine bachelor pad.</p><p>I frowned. \u201cThis isn\u2019t you.\u201d</p><p>The door shut behind us. \u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>I\u2019d expected warm colors, varied textiles, colorful modern art\u2014decor that reflected the vibrant, slightly rough-around-the-edges, occasionally quirky man I loved.</p><p>Stepping deeper into the room, I struggled with a profound sense of disappointment. Had I really been so wrong about him?</p><p>\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d he asked quietly, coming up behind me. He stood so close I could feel the warmth radiating from his body.</p><p>\u201cDefinitely.\u201d</p><p>His dimple winked at me. \u201cYou won\u2019t throw it in my face, will you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m tempted, I admit,\u201d I said dryly.</p><p>His hands came to rest on my shoulders. \u201cRemember that night at the Palms?\u201d</p><p>My hands fisted. \u201cLow blow, Jackson.\u201d</p><p>I would never forget standing on the fifty-fifth floor\u2019s outdoor sky deck with Jax wrapped around my back and a glass of white wine that we shared in my hand. The city and desert stretched for miles, the glow of the neon lights fading into inky darkness.</p> <p>What a view, I\u2019d said, leaning into him, feeling happier than I ever had. I was dating the perfect guy, a man who made my toes curl at night and my days bright. He\u2019s going to change my life, I\u2019d thought. He\u2019s going to change me, for the better.</p><p>It seemed ridiculous now. Making changes was my responsibility. Having a great guy was just a bonus.</p><p>I started to pull away, but he held me in place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again.</p><p>I tugged a little and he let me go, freeing me to face him. \u201cThen why did you do it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy do I do anything?\u201d he said gruffly, his eyes dark and hard. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a Rutledge. We fuck people over, Gia. That\u2019s just who we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a cop-out,\u201d I snapped.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><p>I walked away, my gaze roaming.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to walk out,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cI won\u2019t stop you. But I\u2019d like you to stay.\u201d</p><p>I paused. Turning, I confronted him, hating how his features gave nothing away. \u201cThat\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it? You want me to end things. Piss me off, get me to storm out. It wouldn\u2019t be a quiet breakup and it\u2019d certainly be a little messy, but quick and final nevertheless. Just the way you like it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d hate it, but I\u2019m no good for you, Gia.\u201d He passed me and moved into the kitchen.</p><p>I tossed my purse on one of the armchairs. \u201cI guess I\u2019m a glutton for punishment.\u201d</p><p>Jax pulled a bottle of white wine out of the fridge, then set it on the counter. The kitchen was as devoid of personality as the living room, with black cupboards and counters, and only a one-cup coffeemaker to show that anyone was in residence. Coming from a family for whom the kitchen was the center of the home, I found Jax\u2019s depressing.</p><p>He watched me step out of my heels.</p><p>When I reached up to release my hair, I warned him, \u201cI\u2019m going to match your backstabbing move and raise you one round of angry sex.\u201d</p><p>His lips parted when I reached under my dress to shimmy out of my panties. \u201cGia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can play this game.\u201d I tossed my underwear at him and smiled tightly when he caught them. \u201cAnd I can win.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p> <p>JAX POCKETED MY underwear and came to me, abandoning the unopened wine.</p><p>He cupped my face. Lowering his head, he kissed me, his lips clinging sweetly. His hands moved to my shoulders, then down my back, his fingers deftly lowering the zipper on my dress.</p><p>I went to work on the knot of his tie, letting the anger simmer and blend with my lust into a raging desire. I focused on him. On us. On the feel of him beneath my hands, the beloved scent that was his alone, the way his breathing deepened and his heartbeat quickened as the hunger grew between us.</p><p>I never noticed things like that with anyone else, which made it so much harder to accept that maybe Jax and I weren\u2019t meant to be together.</p><p>\u201cDid you have this place when you came with me to Rossi\u2019s?\u201d I asked.</p><p>We\u2019d stayed in a hotel during that trip. If he\u2019d had an apartment in town at the time, it shed a whole new light on his feelings for me. After all, how much could a guy care about his girl if he\u2019d rather bang her in a hotel than his own bed?</p><p>\u201cNo. I bought this place last year. Gia\u2014\u201d Standing there with his shirt open and parted, his golden torso on display, his body so beautifully hard and defined, his dark eyes so warm and tormented...</p><p>I caught his hand and pulled him out of the kitchen. Anticipation thrummed through my veins, along with something darker. And more wicked.</p><p>JAX\u2019S HAND CLAWED at the sheet, his stomach clenching as I mouthed the plush head of his cock. He was hard and thick, so aroused that precum streamed from the crest to coat my tongue. I fisted him at the root, milking him with my hands and mouth, relishing the curses and moans that spilled from him.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he gasped as I licked along a thick, pulsing vein. Running my parted lips up and down the side, I teased him, kept him on edge, driving him to the point of no return.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t play, Gia,\u201d he growled. \u201cSuck me or fuck me. Make me come.\u201d</p><p>I smiled, my gaze lingering over the tight lacing of muscle that crossed his abdomen. He was sheened with sweat, his gorgeous face flushed and eyes bright. With his gaze on me, I wrapped my mouth around him and sucked, taking him to the back of my throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said hoarsely, his neck arching to press his head into the pillow. \u201cGod, that\u2019s good. Your mouth...\u201d</p><p>I owned him in that moment. Jackson Rutledge was mine.</p><p>His fingers pushed into my hair, gliding over the damp roots, brushing the strands back from my face. \u201cAh, Gia. Keep sucking me like that, baby.\u201d</p><p>He throbbed against my tongue, his flavor and desire intoxicating me. I loved it. Loved giving him so much pleasure his body quaked with it.</p><p>\u201cGoing to come so hard for you...\u201d he groaned.</p><p>Pulling off him, I sat up, then slid off the end of the bed.</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d His heavy-lidded gaze caught mine. \u201cDamn it. Finish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s tough when you\u2019re working toward something...when the excitement builds and you can almost taste it...then someone takes it away from you, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Snarling, he jackknifed upward. \u201cGet back here.\u201d</p><p>I smiled and snatched his shirt up from the floor. \u201cI think you need to cool off a bit first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you should get your gorgeous ass back in this bed first.\u201d Jax rose from the bed like an orgasmic dream come to life, all hard rippling muscle and golden skin. His cock was thick and long, curved upward and so stiff it barely moved as he walked toward me. He was so perfectly proportioned, so boldly masculine.</p><p>It was damned hard resisting jumping on the bed and letting him fuck the hell out of me.</p><p>He reached for me, and I sidestepped quickly, laughter in my throat.</p><p>The doorbell rang.</p><p>Jax didn\u2019t care. He stalked me with single-minded determination. I danced away, struggling to thrust my arms through his shirt. The fabric smelled like him. I liked that a lot.</p><p>\u201cYou should get that,\u201d I told him.</p><p>\u201cGia,\u201d he said, in a low warning tone. \u201cIf you want to be comfortable when I fuck you, you better get on the bed. Otherwise, I\u2019m pinning you to the nearest flat surface.\u201d</p><p>The doorbell rang again as I darted out of his reach. \u201cSomeone\u2019s at the door!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can wait.\u201d He fisted his cock, stroking it. \u201cThis can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>I feinted to the right, then the left, using moves I\u2019d perfected on basketball courts. It amazed me that he could be naked while chasing me and still look both tempting and formidable. His abs glistened with sweat; his gaze was avid and hot, his body taut with muscle.</p><p>He caught me before I crossed the threshold of the bedroom door. His arms locked around me, hard as steel, his chest heaving against my back.</p><p>\u201cJax\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay no if you mean it,\u201d he breathed roughly. \u201cOtherwise, I\u2019ve got to have you, baby.\u201d</p><p>The note of desperation in his voice swayed me, made me long to give in. Being wanted by Jax was one of the major highs in my life.</p><p>\u201cJackson.\u201d</p><p>We both stiffened at the sound of Parker Rutledge\u2019s voice in the living room.</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re here,\u201d he called out. \u201cWe need to talk, son.\u201d</p><p>Jax cursed. His hand slid into the open lapels of his shirt and cupped my breast possessively, his grip tightening until my feet left the floor.</p><p>\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d he yelled before stepping back and kicking the door closed.</p><p>I thought he\u2019d let me go, but he turned me instead and kissed me breathless. One hand clenched in my hair, the other gripped my buttock.</p><p>When he released me abruptly, I stumbled, my legs weakened by the ferocious passion in his kiss.</p><p>He walked to the en suite bathroom and grabbed a black silk robe, belting it angrily. \u201cStay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me to say hi?\u201d I asked, my voice tight.</p><p>Jax didn\u2019t look at me when he said, \u201cI\u2019m not giving him the satisfaction.\u201d</p><p>The door shut with a bit too much force behind him and then I heard the sound of him talking. His tone was far from welcoming and I scrambled to get dressed. I wasn\u2019t going to hide in his bedroom like a naughty teenager.</p><p>By the time I\u2019d finished, I couldn\u2019t hear the low drone of conversation anymore. And when I opened the bedroom door, silence greeted me.</p><p>I padded out in search of my heels and once I had them on, I felt better prepared to deal with Parker...despite wishing my hair was tied back.</p><p>While I waited for Jax and his father to make an appearance, I wandered around the living room, examining it closely for signs of the lover I thought I knew. What I found were only a handful of framed photos, most of them vintage snapshots of a striking blonde whom I assumed was Jackson\u2019s mother.</p><p>The photos ranged from fresh-faced black-and-whites to more recent ones in color, and the transformation the pictures documented was startling. Youthful softness had hardened over time, had been polished into a glittering facade, then faded. The upturn of pretty lips gradually migrated downward. One candid shot caught her unawares and staring out a window. The look on her beautiful face conveyed a sense of loneliness.</p><p>I picked it up, looking at it more closely, and noted another framed picture lying facedown behind it. I slid it forward, then lifted it, stilling when I discovered a photo of Jax and me.</p><p>It was a shot Vincent had captured with his cell phone and forwarded to me. He\u2019d taken it during that first and last family dinner with Jax at Rossi\u2019s. Jax sat behind me, supporting me as I leaned back against him. We were laughing, his arms around my waist, my arms draped over his. I\u2019d sent the photo to Jax and made it the wallpaper on my phone until it became too painful to look at.</p><p>I propped the photo back up and returned the picture of his mother to the shelf, my heart racing along with my thoughts.</p><p>Where the hell was Jax?</p><p>The apartment was eerily quiet. I went in search of him, my gaze sliding absently past the front door, then stopping on the small security video monitor mounted in the wall beside it. Jax and his dad stood in the foyer, Jax with his arms crossed over his chest and his father with hands tucked into the pockets of his slacks. As alike as they were in physical appearance, they couldn\u2019t have been dressed more differently, and yet Jax was clearly holding his own.</p><p>I studied the distance between them, the way they stood apart and eyed each other warily. Their family dynamic was alien to me, so far removed from the Rossi warmth that nurtured me.</p><p>The Rutledges were demanding. I didn\u2019t know all the details of Jax\u2019s upbringing but it was clear he\u2019d grown up in a high-pressure environment. He\u2019d made it obvious he didn\u2019t hold a high opinion of Rutledges, including himself, but he had chosen his family over me\u2014he\u2019d made sure Ian was able to sabotage the Mondego deal\u2014after saying I was the one person he gave a shit about.</p><p>Some long-overdue research was in order.</p><p>I took off back down the hall, shameless in my search for answers. I figured he owed me something and I\u2019d snoop for it if I had to.</p><p>Turning into his home office, I paused on the threshold, seeing a room more in keeping with what I\u2019d expected of him. Although the overall look was modern and masculine, the space was warmed by neutral walls and honeyed woods, with accents of red and gold. Bookcases hugged the walls, filled with a colorful array of hardcover literary volumes and dog-eared popular fiction paperbacks. There was another picture of me on the shelf, this one upright. I was solo. No Jax.</p><p>The photo was recent. No more than six months old.</p><p>From across the room, I stared at it, feeling my palms go damp.</p><p>He\u2019d been keeping tabs on me.</p><p>The questions kept piling up, but one very important answer was made glaringly clear by the existence of that picture. I couldn\u2019t decide if I felt joy or pain about it. Maybe it was a mixture of both.</p><p>Jax\u2019s desk was covered in scattered pages and open folders, but I turned my back on them. I\u2019d seen enough.</p><p>I headed back out to the living room where I grabbed my purse and set off toward the door. The men outside seemed surprised when I pulled it open. They stopped talking, and I gave a brisk nod to both of them before striding to the elevator with my head held high.</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d Jax took a step toward me. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ride down with you, Miss Rossi,\u201d Parker offered, coming up to me with a smile that was far too friendly. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Rutledge,\u201d I replied.</p><p>\u201cCall me Parker, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad,\u201d Jax growled, coming closer. \u201cYou and I aren\u2019t done talking.\u201d</p><p>Parker patted him on the shoulder. \u201cWe can pick up where we left off later, son.\u201d</p><p>Jax looked at me. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to be having dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll need to take a rain check.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do this, Gia.\u201d</p><p>I smiled grimly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>The elevator car arrived, and Parker gestured me in before him.</p><p>Jax caught me by the elbow. \u201cGive me five minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I call you later?\u201d I said, realizing I wasn\u2019t even tempted to stay. I was too raw, too confused. I needed some breathing room.</p><p>His jaw tightened.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Jackson,\u201d Parker said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll show her out.\u201d</p><p>Jax turned his head slowly toward his father, his features set like stone. \u201cI meant what I said.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou always do.\u201d Parker grinned.</p><p>I stepped into the elevator just as the doors started to close again. Parker joined me, but my attention was on Jax, our gazes locked together. His hands were fisted at his sides, his jaw tense and determined. But his eyes...those deep, dark eyes...they made the same promises they always had. I believed them now. I had the proof.</p><p>Parker faced me as the car began its descent, smiling. \u201cHow are you, Gianna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been better. How about you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou make it awkward to say it\u2019s been a good day so far.\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved. \u201cAnd a good day for your friend Ian, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d His eyes brightened with amusement. \u201cPlease don\u2019t hold that against Jackson.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s just business, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very practical woman. Certainly one of the many reasons why he\u2019s so taken with you. Speaking of which...\u201d He rocked back on his heels. \u201cI\u2019d like to get to know you better, Gianna. Would you and Jax come to dinner with my wife and me? Something quiet at our house in the Hamptons, maybe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d I\u2019d like anything that would let me get a better handle on Jax.</p><p>\u201cGood. I\u2019ll let Regina know.\u201d His smile faded a little. \u201cDon\u2019t let Jackson talk you out of it. He wants to keep you all to himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he?\u201d</p><p>Parker sobered further. \u201cHe\u2019s very protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he? What would he have to protect me from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re men, Gianna,\u201d he drawled. \u201cWe\u2019re not always rational when it comes to women.\u201d</p> <p>I nodded, gathering that Parker was as much of an enigma as his son. It seemed Rutledges were just naturally inclined to be hard to read and cryptic.</p><p>The elevator doors opened into the lobby and we stepped out into a meticulously restored pre-war space that exuded luxury and privilege.</p><p>\u201cI have a car waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I give you a ride?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you but no.\u201d I didn\u2019t even want to contemplate the look on Parker\u2019s face if he saw where I lived. Compared to the marble-lined lobby of Jax\u2019s building, complete with concierge and doorman, my place would look...not so hot. I wasn\u2019t embarrassed by the loft or my family, but I thought it might be wise to not trigger suspicions of gold digging until the Rutledges got to know me better.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then, if you\u2019re sure.\u201d Parker hesitated, as if waiting for me to change my mind. When I didn\u2019t, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll let Jax know the day and time for dinner. I\u2019m looking forward to it, Gianna.\u201d</p><p>I thought of the man upstairs, high in his tower, a stranger in so many ways and yet one who knew me inside and out. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>I HEARD MUSIC blaring in the loft before the freight elevator clanked to a stop on our floor. As I got closer, I recognized the vintage Guns N\u2019 Roses riff. \u201cWelcome to the Jungle.\u201d Considering my evening with the Rutledges, I found it fitting.</p><p>Sliding the door open, I was hit with the full force of Vincent\u2019s rocking sound system and the sight of him doing pull-up crunches via a metal pole he\u2019d mounted between two supporting pillars. He was drenched with sweat and gritting his teeth, the slabs of muscle on his stomach tightening as he brought his knees up to his chest. He wore his hair shorter than my other brothers, nearly a crew cut, and it suited his classically Italian features.</p> <p>I\u2019d read books that compared the hero to a face on a Roman coin, but I guarantee none of them had anything on Vincent. Shirtless, shoeless and wearing only running shorts, he was the stuff other women\u2019s dreams were made of. Unlike Nico, Vincent was a serial boyfriend. He had no problem committing, but he never stayed off the market for longer than several months at a time.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he protested, when I turned the volume down.</p><p>\u201cYou still talk to Deanna?\u201d I asked, referring to the reporter he used to date.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d He dropped to the hardwood floor and snatched up the towel waiting there alongside a bottle of water. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>I set my purse down on the bench by the door and kicked off my shoes. \u201cI need someone to catch me up on the Rutledges.\u201d</p><p>Vincent scrubbed at his hair, scowling. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a douche. He doesn\u2019t deserve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t argue with that.\u201d I sprawled across the couch and stared up at the exposed pipes and beamed ceiling. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be redeemed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cForget the rehab. Find a guy who\u2019s smart enough to know what he has from the get-go.\u201d</p><p>I glanced at him, watching his throat work as he chugged the entire bottle of water. \u201cYou telling me you never screwed up with a girl and wanted a second chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t count. You\u2019re a Rossi. There\u2019s no excuse for him screwing up besides being stupid,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWill you ask her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d He headed toward the kitchen, adding, \u201cOnly because I hope she digs up something that convinces you he\u2019s bad news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re getting the favor for a simple thanks.\u201d He tossed his towel over his shoulder and washed his hands. The kitchen was the most finished part of the apartment, with brand-new stainless-steel appliances, chef\u2019s cooktop, double wall ovens and a massive workstation island with sink. \u201cI\u2019ve got a basket of laundry that needs washing.\u201d</p><p>I sat up. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Better hurry.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m out of Rossi\u2019s T-shirts and my shift starts in two hours.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019D JUST CLOSED the louvered doors that concealed the washer and dryer when I heard my smartphone ringing. I ran to my bedroom to grab it, but missed the call. Didn\u2019t matter, though, because it immediately started ringing again.</p><p>It was Jax.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I touched Answer on the screen and said, \u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were supposed to call,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cSo were you,\u201d I retorted. \u201cTook you two years to get around to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus.\u201d He exhaled harshly. \u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was time. Your dad invited us to dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not going.\u201d</p><p>I shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll go without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you will! Damn it, Gia. You\u2019re swimming with sharks and acting like you\u2019re on vacation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely seeing things I\u2019ve never seen before. Like those pictures you\u2019ve got framed in your pad. How long have you been following me? Creepy, by the way.\u201d</p><p>He cursed. \u201cYou\u2019re fucking a Rutledge. Surveillance and invasion of privacy come with the territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t fucking you at the time that picture in your office was taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in my office? What the hell, Gia?\u201d</p><p>My mouth curved grimly at his inadvertent admission that there were more photos I hadn\u2019t found. \u201cI\u2019m going to be in every aspect of your life\u2014get used to it.\u201d</p><p>Jax was silent for a long minute, then quietly asked, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m processing the fact that you\u2019re in love with me, Jax.\u201d I heard his breath catch and felt a surge of pleasured triumph. \u201cStill, you bailed on me. And now you\u2019re sabotaging my work and your own chances with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on to you, Jackson Rutledge.\u201d My voice was low and hard, unwavering. \u201cI\u2019m going to figure you out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an open book,\u201d he retorted.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a head trip.\u201d I ignored the waiting suitcase on my bed and sat at my desk instead. I woke my computer with a shake of the mouse. \u201cAnd your mystery-man days are numbered.\u201d</p><p>I hung up, shut off the ringer and started my research. </p> </body></html>"]
