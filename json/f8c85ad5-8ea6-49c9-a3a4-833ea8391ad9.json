Not slight like the ponies of other boys, but braw, with a chest like a great cask of ale, and a coat that shimmered dark gray, like a sword, or the dreadful eye of the Corryvreckan itself, a whirlpool so immense as to draw even the most magnificent of ships to a terrible fate far below.</p><p>His pony.</p> <p>Young Will cradled the oval-shaped currycomb in his palm, gingerly scuffing circles along the animal\u2019s neck and shoulder, even though there wasn\u2019t a speck of dust left to dislodge.</p><p>He\u2019d need to choose a name. Something reminiscent of the great heroes of old. Something suitable for kings.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re better than me just because Da gave you some old hack.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s hand froze. Though his heart jolted, he forced himself to stillness. It was best to suffer his older brother\u2019s taunts in silence.</p><p>He waited for the inevitable cuff on the shoulder, or along the side of his head, but it didn\u2019t come.</p> <p>Slowly Will resumed his currying.</p><p>\u201cNaggy old swayback old hack.\u201d Jamie was at his shoulder now, singsonging his insults. His voice had just begun to change, and the awkward cracking seemed to enrage the already volatile youth.</p><p>Will felt his cheeks redden. He concentrated on the comb, making intent circles, until his pony\u2019s skin shivered.</p><p>\u201cOh, are you going to cry?\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand reached over Will to slap the beast sharply on the neck.</p><p>Ears flicking impatiently, the animal gave its tail an abrupt swish.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, little Willie.\u201d</p> <p>He stilled. It was his seventh birthday. He\u2019d not see this day ruined like all the others.</p><p>\u201cAre you sad I don\u2019t like your wee naggy beast?\u201d</p><p>Not this day. It was already so much more special than any he\u2019d known. The most special of his life. His father had woken him early, leading him to the stable at dawn, where his birthday present had been waiting.</p><p>\u201cThis old hack isn\u2019t that great.\u201d Jamie began to pace a slow circle around them.</p><p>Will used the opportunity to slide the halter from his pony\u2019s head, wanting to replace it as quickly as he could with his bridle.</p><p>The leather was tacky in his fingers, just polished, and the scent of oil gave a twinge in his nose. The pony took the bit placidly, and Will nearly crumpled with relief. He\u2019d not have to struggle in front of Jamie, and in that moment, he thought surely that he and this animal were destined to be as one. Will eased the straps of the bridle over his ears, thinking it impossible to love an animal more.</p><p>\u201cAll the lads get their own mounts.\u201d Jamie squatted at the pony\u2019s rear, as if examining the legs. \u201cHe\u2019s not so special.\u201d</p><p>Anger swelled in Will. His brother dared pretend to inspect his pony, when all knew the boy knew next-to-naught about them.</p> <p>It was Will who knew horses. Will whom their father had singled out, time and again, for special instruction. See this, Will, this is how to mend a split hoof. See here, Will, how this beast was lamed.</p><p>It was Will who\u2019d been given his own pony well before any of the other boys had.</p><p>It was time to stand up to his brother\u2019s bullying. He would fight back this time. He would.</p><p>Will\u2019s breath came quickly, shallow panting high in his chest. He overturned a bucket and kicked it to rest beneath the stirrups. Taking both reins into his left hand, he relished the feel of supple leather sliding through his fingers. He stepped onto the bucket, placed his foot in the stirrup, and hauled himself over.</p><p>His pony made a low chuffing sound and the mass of him felt so right beneath the saddle.</p><p>Though there was a quiver in his voice, Will turned his head and said, \u201cYou\u2019re just sore Da thinks me the better horseman.\u201d A small smile pursed his lips, pleased at how the words had come out.</p><p>The answering silence made him look, finally, at his brother.</p><p>Jamie was twelve and the meat on his bones had yet to catch up to the scrawny length of him. Will recognized bits of their Da on his brother\u2019s face, but it was the look their father wore when he was riled. As if the Rollo features had settled sharp and angry onto his brother: the precise nose, but thinner and hooked almost to a point. The edge of cheek and chin turning Jamie\u2019s face gaunt instead of fine.</p><p>Exhilaration and fear both spiked in Will\u2019s veins. It was a heady feeling, looking down from the saddle, watching Jamie\u2019s face pale, that mouth sputtering, for once speechless.</p><p>His response, when it came, was deathly quiet. \u201cHorseman ? You\u2019re a boy. A baby. Not a horseman.\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s hand was swift, darting at the pony\u2019s rump like the lash of a whip.</p><p>Will didn\u2019t have a moment to contemplate the jostle of the saddle beneath him before his mount took off with a start, tearing through the stable like a rabid animal.</p><p>Jamie\u2019s laughter and the startled whinnies of the other horses flashed like a thunderclap, then were gone as Will\u2019s pony burst out, taking the pasture at a full gallop.</p><p>\u201cWhoaa.\u201d His voice was unsteady. Will tugged at the reins, his breath loud in his ears.</p><p>\u201cHo . . .\u201d He pitched his voice low, trying to soothe the animal.</p><p>\u201cHo,\u201d he tried again, and this time he gently snugged his legs tightly around the pony\u2019s belly to settle him. The animal answered with an outraged shriek. It was a hideous sound, a demon sound, not a noise a creature should make at all. The pony squealed again, a possessed thing, baring his teeth, rearing up and down, and up and down, hooves skittering madly at the air.</p><p>Will held tight. Leaning forward, he twined his small fingers in the pony\u2019s mane.</p><p>He began to slide.</p><p>He wound his hands more tightly into the coarse hair. Dirt and leather oil had darkened his nails into black half-moons, and his fingertips began to go blue.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t hold on. He needed to let go.</p><p>Will released one foot and was ready to leap off, when he realized his left side was caught. His foot had slipped all the way through the stirrup. He wriggled madly, terrified now. The heel of his boot caught.</p><p>He\u2019d have to ride it out.</p><p>Swinging his free leg back over, he found the right stirrup. Again the pony took off like a bullet.</p><p>He saw the rise in the ground before him and tried once more pulling on the reins. Will leaned back hard now, using the whole of his small body to coax the animal to slow, to stop.</p><p>The pony shrieked again, and Will\u2019s skin crawled. He realized it was his shifting weight that caused the pony\u2019s cries. What had Jamie done? He remembered his brother jostling the saddle just before the pony went mad.</p><p>Carefully, he reached back. His hand fumbled along the hard stretch of leather while his eyes remained pinned on the hill before him.</p><p>The small scree-covered slope grew closer by the second. Before, it was an innocent thing, and now it loomed, threatening.</p><p>Will\u2019s fingers gingerly probed along the back of the saddle, down to the pony\u2019s coat, now slicked warm and wet with sweat. He pulled his hand back. A thin smear of blood stained his fingertips brownish red.</p><p>Jamie. Curse him.</p><p>It would be the last rational thought Will had for some time.</p><p>His pony reached the rise. He reeled away in last-minute panic to careen along the base of the hill. But not before the hooves on his right side hit gravel, slid. Still galloping, the beast faltered.</p><p>Will wriggled, his terror at fever pitch, trying desperately to dislodge his trapped left foot.</p><p>The pony fell, rolling onto his right side. Will heard the sound of his leg being crushed. An all-consuming pain blanketed him. Smashed him.</p><p>He felt his left calf bone snap, his foot finally loose.</p><p>In an unnatural, awkward movement, the pony heaved back up and charged away.</p><p>Leaving Will lying there. Broken. On his seventh birthday.</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>San Francisco, present day</p><p>\u201cJerk!\u201d Felicity slammed her sangria onto the table, sending her bangles clattering to her wrists. \u201cEvil, nasty, two- timing jerk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI warned you about Scorpios,\u201d her Aunt Livia said. \u201cThey\u2019ll sweet talk you, then turn around and sting.\u201d She pulled an orange slice from her glass and snapped a bite from it to underscore her point.</p><p>\u201cDo you realize he actually called himself a feminist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Livia grimaced. \u201cPut a man in a protest march and all of a sudden he\u2019s freaking Gandhi.\u201d Her aunt nodded sagely, tucking her long, unnaturally red hair back behind her ears. \u201cI met the same in my day. Trust me, sweetheart, I\u2019m much happier living in my little cottage all by my lonesome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, Livvie . . .\u201d Felicity deflated. \u201cI love your place, but I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t give it all up and live in a canyon somewhere with a bunch of coyotes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only had trouble with the one coyote, and my little cottage was good enough for you when you came to live there as a child.\u201d</p><p>Felicity picked a big, green olive from her plate, taking a moment to think. The last thing she wanted to do was inadvertently offend her aunt. Livia had taken her in when Felicity\u2019s parents died in a car accident, and her aunt\u2019s eccentric lifestyle had been what pulled young Felicity through her grief.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Livvie. Your place was, is wonderful, but I\u2019m not eight anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould that you were.\u201d Livia looked around the tapas joint. It was in San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, and it was packed with the gamut of city dwellers: the pierced and the straitlaced, nonnative speakers mingling with middle America. \u201cI do without you for a whole year so you can see the world, and then you move all the way out here. I hate having to come all this way just to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only in Central America, it was only nine months, and it was your idea, as I recall. Anyway, your trips to San Francisco would go much faster if you flew instead of insisting on the bus.\u201d</p><p>Livia ignored the jibe. \u201cI see why the city beckons, sweetheart, but I wish you were back where you belong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI belong here,\u201d Felicity said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not as though you\u2019re living on holy ground. I mean, come on, Livvie, you\u2019re in LA.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOutside Los Angeles, dear.\u201d She eyed the table full of tiny plates thoughtfully, and speared a bit of quiche with her fork. \u201cDid you do that online dating thing you were telling me about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one in the TV commercials?\u201d Felicity shrugged. \u201cYeah, I did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would stay away from that Internet stuff. I told you, Tarot is better for this sort of thing than that w-w-w business. Who knows what kind of characters\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone is screened.\u201d Felicity smiled patiently. \u201cIt\u2019s scientific. There\u2019s a formula. Fill out a questionnaire and they match you to your \u2018Perfect Mate.\u2019 Find your true love with Formu-LOVE!\u201d she added brightly.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Her aunt sipped her drink, looking skeptical. \u201cYou should use the cards like I taught you. And don\u2019t forget the candle. The candle is the key. You need to find yourself someone better than that . . . that guitar-strumming . . . person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked those crunchy hippie-dude types.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to. But times have changed.\u201d Livia gazed at her a moment, her eyes softening. \u201cHoney, I\u2019ve just seen one too many of those types screw my little niece over.\u201d</p><p>A shocked laugh burst from Felicity, and she raised her nearly empty glass in a toast. \u201cTo hypocrites. Good-bye to the lot of them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHear, hear,\u201d Livia said. \u201cYou need yourself a real man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah! A real man . . .\u201d Felicity nodded enthusiastically, refilling her glass. \u201cSomeone who pulls grandmothers from burning buildings.\u201d</p><p>Her aunt let out a tipsy giggle. \u201cThat\u2019s the ticket, honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019d jump into icy water to save a stranger. A big Viking of a man. Who\u2019d fight to protect me. Who does things like . . .\u201d Felicity thought for a moment, then slamming her hands onto the table, announced, \u201cFish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want your man to fish?\u201d Her aunt\u2019s exuberance momentarily waned.</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Felicity shrugged. \u201cI want a man\u2019s man, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready for any hunters yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHa!\u201d Livia\u2019s shriek drew a few pairs of eyes to their table. Ignoring them, she declared, \u201cThen here\u2019s to fishing.\u201d</p><p>They both tossed back the rest of their sangria.</p><p>\u201cUgh.\u201d Felicity grabbed the table edge to steady herself. \u201cWe should get the bill and go.\u201d Scowling, she reached across the table to pluck the last mushroom cap from its puddle of oil. Her stomach roiled in preparation. She always forgot what a bad idea tapas were. Sangria flowing from long-spouted jugs, with only some garlic prawns and bits of quiche to absorb it all.</p><p>She gestured to the waitress, then put a hand to her head. She lived only a short walk down Valencia Street, but she\u2019d rather wobble home before all that cheap wine hit her any harder. And she still needed to make up a bed for her aunt. \u201cDo you want the futon or the mattress?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuton\u2019s fine, honey.\u201d</p><p>Felicity reached for her bag, but her aunt stopped her with an exaggerated frown, tossing a couple of twenties on the table before she had the chance to. \u201cBut first I\u2019d like to walk off my sangria.\u201d Livia glanced at her oversized men\u2019s watch. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much to see for me to be going to bed this early.\u201d</p><p>Felicity stood abruptly. Normally she\u2019d put up more of a fight, but the sangria had begun to burble in her belly. \u201cYou sure?\u201d She pulled on her brown suede jacket and tugged the long length of her blonde hair free.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I may be long of tooth, dear, but I\u2019m not dead yet.\u201d Livia shooed her toward the door. \u201cGo, go. You\u2019re looking green around the gills, as your lovely mother would\u2019ve said. Go get some rest.\u201d</p> <p>Felicity pulled her into a quick hug. Mom. Livvie\u2019s sister.</p><p>She swallowed back a pang of grief. Though it was still sharp, the passing years had dimmed her memories. Now the occasional washes of melancholy were less about her mom and dad in any specific way, and came more from the vague sense of what she\u2019d been missing.</p><p>She made it home to find a letter waiting for her. She\u2019d almost walked right past it. It must\u2019ve been delivered to the wrong mailbox, and someone had slipped it under her apartment door.</p><p>Felicity picked it up and frowned. It was from Formu-LOVE. Scrunching her brows, she focused on the pink and purple envelope. Based on Scientific Research! Find your true love with Formu-LOVE!</p><p>She\u2019d been waiting for it, and now that it was here, she was afraid to open the thing.</p><p>Felicity had answered pages and pages of questions, covering everything from \u201cKetchup or mustard?\u201d to her thoughts on religion, birth, and death.</p><p>Could this be it? Would there be a name and a little mug shot of her \u201cperfect mate\u201d inside?</p><p>Her hands trembled as she tore it open. She looked at the front and back of the single sheet, then peeked in the envelope to make sure she\u2019d gotten everything out. Shouldn\u2019t there be more?</p><p>It was just a form letter, with her online nickname and pertinent details filled in with an elaborate, loopy font.</p><p>\u201cThe least they can do for my two hundred bucks is send me a real letter,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>Dear Mellow Yellow,</p><p>We are sorry but the profile you provided</p><p>Formu-LOVE! was UNMATCHABLE.</p><p>But don\u2019t be discouraged. Scientific research</p><p>has proven . . .</p><p>She stopped reading, crumpled the paper, and flung it across the room, where it fell short of its mark. She stared angrily at the trashcan, a grimace holding back her tears.</p><p>Staggering to the couch, Felicity curled into a fetal position. \u201cUnmatchable.\u201d</p><p>Stupid online formula. Nobody is unmatchable.</p><p>She bit her knuckle. What if she was?</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to end up alone like her Aunt Livia. Felicity adored the woman, but she just wasn\u2019t a nomad like her aunt. Traveling had been exciting, but now she was ready to nest, to build a life. Find that one true someone she knew her father had been for her mother.</p><p>\u201cAlright, Liv.\u201d She popped back up, striding to the cabinet where she kept her Tarot cards. \u201cYou win.\u201d She lit her candle and flicked off the lamp.</p><p>She plopped onto the rug, spilling the deck out before her. It had been a gift from her aunt, not long after her parents had died. Felicity had felt guilty when she\u2019d first contemplated those intricate and old-fashioned images. The brightly colored Hanged Man and the ominous Devil seemed like such transgressions.</p><p>But they never failed to pull her in, the cards alternately majestic, ominous, triumphant. Each suggesting a mysterious and unexpected tale, where a smiling countenance could bode ill and a dying man meant rebirth.</p><p>Felicity spread them out wide before her, rummaging them under her palms in a sloppy shuffle. They were reassuringly cool and waxy under her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the one man who\u2019s right for me?\u201d</p><p>She gathered the cards back into a stack and did one more quick shuffle for good measure.</p><p>Unmatchable.</p><p>No, she wasn\u2019t without a match. There was one man in the universe just for her. She shut her eyes and tried to visualize him. \u201cWhere is my great big Viking of a man?\u201d</p><p>The candle flickered, and a shiver crawled up her skin. Taking a deep breath, she gave a shake to her sangria- fogged head. It was only the candlelight, she told herself.</p><p>Still, Felicity grew somber. Alone with the cards in the darkness, it was impossible to avoid the sense that she was tapping into some great, unknown energy.</p><p>She slowly began to deal out six cards. It was an arrangement her aunt called The Great House. A simple spread, but powerful.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she whispered, \u201cShow me where you are.\u201d</p><p>She put her fingers on the first card, what her aunt called the Querent. It was her card, the one that represented Felicity\u2019s situation. She rubbed it between her fingers before turning it. \u201cI need you,\u201d she whispered again. \u201cHow do I find you?\u201d</p><p>The crisp flip of the card resonated in the silence of her apartment.</p><p>She drew in her breath. The Chariot. \u201cCool,\u201d she said quietly. She loved this card. A conquering hero, bearing a spear, in armor decorated with stars and moons, riding in a chariot drawn by sphinxes. In the dim light, he seemed to be riding straight for her.</p><p>A small smile touched her face. It was a Major Arcana card, representing success. Turmoil, conquest. Possibly an imminent voyage, or a life-changing event.</p><p>She\u2019d be off on a new venture soon. \u201cAre you saying I have to come to you?\u201d she mused, her smile growing.</p><p>She turned the next card quickly.</p><p>The Lovers. \u201cYesss . . .\u201d she hissed, grinning outright. It was a man and a woman. Some sort of glorious, celestial being watched over them, his hands outstretched in a beneficent gesture.</p><p>Lovers. Her optimism swelled. There was her Viking right there. \u201cDoesn\u2019t get much clearer than that.\u201d</p><p>Felicity flipped the next one more quickly than the last, and her hand froze. \u201cWhat\u2019s with all the Major cards?\u201d It was the Wheel of Fortune.</p><p>She tried to remember what that one meant. A profound realization taking place? But it also meant twists of fate. She studied the spinning wheel and gave a shrug. \u201cRound and round she goes, where she stops nobody knows . . .\u201d</p><p>Felicity held her hand poised over the fourth card. \u201cCome on. Give me something nice and easy.\u201d</p><p>The Two of Cups.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah!\u201d She patted the card triumphantly. \u201cYeah, baby.\u201d She studied the image. Two people gazed at each other, both ready to share their oversized golden cup. Partnership, marriage, commitment.</p><p>Placing her fingers over the back of the next card, she rubbed it into the rug with the anticipation of a Vegas blackjack dealer. \u201cLove and marriage, love and marriage, go together like a . . .\u201d She flipped it.</p><p>The Five of Pentacles.</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d</p><p>Adversity and loss. This card pictured another man and woman, but this time they were trudging through snow, looking cold and hungry. The man\u2019s leg was bandaged, and he struggled with his crutch in the snow. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her excitement left her like air from a balloon.

But now she sensed she should\u2019ve waited for Livia to do the reading for her.</p><p>Should now wait for her to finish it.</p> <p>Felicity rubbed the edge of the last card with her fingertip. She had to know. She could ask her aunt what it all meant later. She needed to see what was hidden beneath this last card.</p><p>She turned it before she could chicken out.</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d Her voice was tiny. She looked at the hideous card in front of her and groaned. This last card, the one that defined the entire reading. And it represented a total breakdown in one\u2019s life and world.</p><p>Lightning struck a great spire into flames. There was a toppling crown, and people falling to the earth. \u201cNo, not that.\u201d</p><p>The Tower.</p> <p>Only a fine thread of anger stopped her despair from turning to tears. Why couldn\u2019t she have happiness? For once, something simple and pleasant. Felicity had always been dealt the bad hand.</p><p>Her parents had died when she was still in elementary school, and she\u2019d never been the same. She\u2019d never been quite a part of things, something always just slightly off as she made her way through the world.</p><p>All she wanted was for the loneliness to go away. For a decent boyfriend, someone who was who he said he was. It wasn\u2019t so much. A good man.</p><p>Felicity abruptly raked her hands through the cards, sweeping them before her on the shag rug. \u201cI wish . . .\u201d</p><p>She plucked the Chariot card from the pile and rubbed it between her fingers. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d The glowing, triumphant warrior. \u201cI wish . . . I wish I could meet you.\u201d</p><p>The dying light drew Felicity\u2019s eyes. Her candle was guttering out. She looked back down at the cards, and the movement set her head to whirring. Please no nausea. She pursed her lips. Damned sangria.</p> <p>Her hands still on the cards, she slid down onto the rug. She\u2019d lay there a moment, waiting for the spinning to stop.</p><p>Waiting, and wishing for her one, true man. Her Viking.</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>London, 1658</p><p>Not again, Will Rollo thought sourly. He\u2019d saved his friend Ormonde from many a scrape, but the Tower of London? Frowning, he pulled his cowl further over his head. An escape from the Tower far exceeded the obligations of friendship.</p><p>He nodded to his companion, and they pulled the oars up to skim near the surface of the water, dragging the small boat to a stop. Traitor\u2019s Gate loomed just ahead, connecting the Thames to the moat that encircled the Tower complex.</p><p>\u201cWho goes there?\u201d the guard shouted, jangling his keys as if to stress the gravity of his position.</p><p>It was early evening, and though there were hours yet before the gate would be locked for the night, traffic that time of day was uncommon.</p> <p>His hired man shifted nervously at his side, and Rollo put his hand out, gesturing for calm. Coin bought men, but it didn\u2019t always buy composure.</p><p>Truly, he thought, this is the last time.</p><p>Rollo cleared his throat, trying his best to shed the Scots from his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve come wi\u2019 ale, gov\u2019ner.\u201d</p><p>He frowned at the answering silence. He had one shot to get Ormonde out and needed to think quickly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for his lordship,\u201d Rollo added. He\u2019d grown up on the other side of the servant-lord relationship, and knew invoking the wrath of an angry nobleman\u2014even an anonymous one\u2014was good for getting results. \u201cHe says I deliver it before the gates is locked for the night, or it\u2019s all our hides.\u201d</p><p>Rollo let out a quick, sharp cough. Keeping up the false accent was a struggle and an annoyance. Ormonde might thrive on these sorts of intrigues, but Rollo much preferred fighting his battles in the light of day. Preferably on horseback.</p><p>There was a pause, then a strained, \u201cBe on your way then.\u201d</p><p>Rollo\u2019s shoulders eased. Without question, the last, he thought, giving the guard a nod as they rowed past.</p><p>He noted the man\u2019s greedy eyes paused on the cask, and fought the urge to heave a visible sigh of relief. The thing was empty, but for a stretch of rope, over twenty fathoms long. It was his ticket in and Ormonde\u2019s ride out.</p><p>Rollo spared a quick, satisfied smile. The barrel and its promise of drink had been just the thing. Only a painted French whore would\u2019ve bought him swifter passage.</p><p>They cut a sharp right, rowing into the moat toward Cradle Tower, which jutted out along the southeastern side. Long ago, Edward III had built it as his own private water entrance. The days of such niceties were long gone, and Cradle Tower was now filled instead with prisoners from the Civil Wars. Cromwell\u2019s enemies all.</p><p>The fortress rose high above them, its beige and brown stone an ominous gray in the night\u2019s growing dark. As they glided in and toward the Galleyman Stairs, he contemplated the thin arrow slits along the fa\u00e7ade. The small openings offered no help\u2014he\u2019d have to get Ormonde out from above.</p><p>Even though it was his crippled legs that were stiff, Rollo rubbed his shoulder, remembering his long-ago wound. He\u2019d been shot on the field at Philiphaugh, and left for dead. But it was Ormonde who\u2019d found him. Ormonde\u2019s boyish persistence that had pulled him from the field to safety.</p><p>He rolled his shoulders, eyeing a second guard coming into view. The last time, Ormonde.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you there?\u201d The guard was a beefy man, and it was at times like this that Rollo was glad of his cane.</p><p>\u201cAle.\u201d He stood, his cramped legs trying to find balance in the wobbling boat. His hired man pulled them close to the stone landing, and Rollo used the cane to make his way from the craft. \u201cFor you guards, mayhap?\u201d</p><p>Rollo tried to wrench his face into a smile, but his thoughts were only for the blood that flowed too slowly back into his limbs. Damned boats. He despised them.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this then?\u201d The guard laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re lame!\u201d He shook his head in wonder. \u201cCan\u2019t be an easy job of it, hauling ale on feeble pins.\u201d</p><p>Rollo found his footing. He tossed his cane up, catching at its midpoint, and swung. He caught the guard behind his ear, and the man fell in a solid heap. \u201cNot feeble,\u201d he gritted out.</p><p>Taking the man by the heel, Rollo dragged him under the wooden staircase. He patted down the guard\u2019s coat, plucking a ring of keys from his inside pocket.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll wake,\u201d he said, returning to his companion. \u201cBut we have time.\u201d</p><p>Rollo noted the heavy length of rope that his hired man had hauled onto the landing. \u201cGood work. You\u2019re earning your coin, and a bit besides.\u201d He looked back out to the moat, almost completely shrouded in darkness. \u201cBe gone now,\u201d he told him. \u201cWait on the far side. You\u2019ll see us.\u201d</p><p>The sound of Rollo\u2019s shuffling step echoed off the dank stone as he made his ascent. The thick loops of rope cut heavily into his shoulder, but he dare not risk the noise of dragging it.</p><p>He headed straight for the end of the hall, knowing exactly where he\u2019d find Ormonde. The Sealed Knot was a clandestine bunch, working anonymously to topple Cromwell and reinstate the true king. But they weren\u2019t so secretive as to watch in silence as one of their own was imprisoned. When alerted that Rollo planned on freeing his friend, an agent had sought him out, pointed him to trustworthy hired help, detailed Ormonde\u2019s position, and all but escorted Rollo to the Tower.</p><p>Ormonde was a nobleman, and his cell was actually quite an accommodating affair, with a settee, fireplace, and small desk. \u201cHow\u2019d you know where to find me?\u201d he asked the moment Rollo found the right key and slipped in.</p><p>Rollo chuckled at his friend\u2019s exuberance. Ormonde\u2019s bright red hair was in a tousle, and could use a fair spot of barbering besides, but these things only heightened the man\u2019s boyishness. Though Ormonde was in his forties, Rollo expected he\u2019d never lose his bright-eyed zeal.</p><p>\u201cYour Sealed Knot men seem to have much information at their disposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater.\u201d Rollo eyed the windowless room. They\u2019d have to continue up, making their escape from the roof. \u201cLet\u2019s away from here before your guard wakes sore and angry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that.\u201d Ormonde gestured to the rope.</p><p>\u201cI can manage,\u201d Rollo said coldly.</p><p>\u201cYou never change, do you? I know better than most how well you can manage\u201d\u2014he reached for the heavy mass\u2014\u201cbut I\u2019ve been cooped up here for weeks, and if I don\u2019t set this nervous energy to something, I swear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d Rollo shrugged the rope from his side. \u201cLet\u2019s just be gone.\u201d</p><p>They made their way up a cramped spiral staircase to the rooftop. Rollo had read of a Jesuit priest who\u2019d made this same escape not one hundred years prior, and he figured if a man of the cloth could do it, two battle-hardened soldiers could manage as well.</p><p>\u201cWhat mission do you risk your head for this time?\u201d Rollo placed his hands on the cold stone of the battlements and peered down. The moat\u2014and he hoped his boat\u2014waited for them in the blackness below. \u201cHand me that,\u201d he said, pointing to the rope.</p><p>\u201cThe same as ever. I\u2019ll see the true Stuart king reinstated before I die.\u201d Ormonde helped Rollo secure the end of the rope around one of the battlements. \u201cCromwell and his Parliament may have beheaded King Charles I, but they dare not behead his son. I vow, Charles II will be restored to the throne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do call it a kingdom, after all,\u201d Rollo said dryly, tugging the rope tight, testing his knot. \u201cThere now. Who shall be first to give it a go?\u201d He spared Ormonde a smile.</p><p>\u201cI need to tell you something, Will.\u201d</p><p>Rollo\u2019s face grew stoic once more, waiting in silence for what his friend had to say.</p><p>\u201cYour brother.\u201d Ormonde looked into the distance, weighing his words. \u201cIt\u2019s Jamie. Jamie\u2019s the one who orchestrated my capture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew . . .\u201d Rollo inhaled sharply. \u201cI anticipated this day. I knew, when he traded wives. To go from Graham\u2019s sister to Campbell\u2019s. Aye, getting in league with Cromwell himself wasn\u2019t far behind.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not . . . surprised?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no ill my elder brother could conceive that would give me surprise.\u201d He glanced quickly at his legs before he gave the rope one more tug. \u201cUp and over, you.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde smiled, shaking his head, and clapped his friend on the shoulder. \u201cI thank you for this, Will.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye,\u201d he muttered, watching Ormonde\u2019s descent. \u201cAnd it\u2019s the last time, for certain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, cripple.\u201d</p><p>Rollo turned sharply, though he knew from the voice whom he\u2019d find. \u201cJamie. So happy you could join me. \u2019Tis a lovely wee fortress you have here. Though it does seem to have sprung a leak.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think I\u2019d not hear your clopping about?\u201d Jamie eyed his brother with disdain. \u201cThe years pass, and still you trudge around like a one-legged fishwife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Rollo smiled broadly. \u201cThe years pass, and still you talk to me as if you\u2019re the same twelve-year-old in our father\u2019s stable yard.\u201d</p> <p>The hiss of Jamie\u2019s unsheathed broadsword cut through the night.</p><p>\u201cDear Jamie, you surprise me.\u201d Rollo laughed softly, tapping his cane lightly on the toe of his boot. \u201cYou\u2019re fighting your own battles now? Or is it that Cromwell doesn\u2019t have a sister for you to bed?\u201d</p><p>Jamie leapt for him, but Rollo was ready. Tossing his cane up, he grabbed the curve of the pistol-handled grip in one hand and pulled his sword free of its wooden sheath.</p><p>\u201cHiding a weapon in your walking stick.\u201d Jamie slashed hard, and their swords crossed with a sharp clang. \u201cNot fair, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou speak of fair?\u201d Rollo cut his sword in the sharp diagonal slash he\u2019d perfected in years of cavalry fighting, and his brother\u2019s blade caught it just before it bit into his shoulder. \u201cWhat\u2019s not fair is destroying an innocent seven-year-old simply because you don\u2019t like his pony.\u201d</p><p>Jamie unleashed then, thrashing with rapid but sloppy strokes. Rollo\u2019s legs prevented him from bobbing and weaving as another swordsman might, and he suffered the onslaught, meeting each thrust with his own block and parry.</p> <p>He recognized his brother\u2019s style, though, and planned to let Jamie flail himself into exhaustion. He was younger than Jamie and, ironically, it was Rollo\u2019s injury that had kept him fitter than most men, regardless of age.</p><p>Jamie bobbed forward for what he clearly thought would be a killing lunge, and Rollo saw his chance. Though he refused to kill his brother, he found he was quite eager to bruise the lout.</p><p>Rollo stepped forward, meeting Jamie\u2019s lunge. Their swords crashed, blade sliding down blade, until the brothers\u2019 hands were inches apart.</p><p>\u201cYou always\u201d\u2014jutting his foot forward, Rollo grabbed his brother\u2019s wrist and flung him over his extended leg\u2014\u201cmake this same blunder.\u201d As Jamie fell, his sword came loose and clattered across the timber roof.</p><p>Rollo put the tip of his blade to Jamie\u2019s neck. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, brother. My injury makes me stronger than you. You can\u2019t admit that you gave me that strength?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d Jamie grabbed the blade in his palm, and a thin trickle of blood seeped from his fist. \u201cYou will never be the stronger man.\u201d</p><p>He rolled from beneath the sword, shouting at once for a guard.</p><p>Rollo looked for a split second from the sword in his hand, to its wooden sheath tossed halfway across the roof, then to the battlements. With a curse, he tossed his blade down. The cane had been a fine little treasure, but he had neither the time nor the hands to spare.</p> <p>He heard his brother\u2019s shouts and the scrape of his broadsword as he retrieved it.</p><p>Rollo pulled himself up between the battlements, the stone scraping his back and arms as he wriggled through. Fumbling in the dark, his hands found the rope. The rock scored his knuckles as he eased down into the blackness below.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d Ormonde hissed. \u201cJust here. Hurry now, I hear the guards rallying.\u201d</p><p>Rollo dropped the last foot, landing clumsily in the boat, and his hired man set at once to rowing them back toward Traitor\u2019s Gate.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Rollo sidled toward the empty cask, still waiting in the prow of the boat. \u201cYou were supposed to hide in there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has beat me to it.\u201d Ormonde\u2019s voice had a peculiar edge.</p><p>Rollo swung his gaze to him. \u201cYou sound amused.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave a look-see,\u201d the hired man said, offering his dagger.</p><p>Rollo took the knife and pried the lid free, revealing a woman. She was curled up, fast asleep, her heavy breath echoing in the tiny chamber. \u201cWhat the devil?\u201d</p><p>He peered in. It was impossible to make out any details in the dark. \u201cHelp me,\u201d he said to Ormonde. \u201cI\u2019ll get her\u201d\u2014he put his hands under her arms and pulled\u2014\u201cyou steady the barrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d Ormonde said, turning his face away. \u201cIs that her or the cask?\u201d</p><p>Rollo grimaced at the smell of stale wine. \u201cI think mayhap . . . it\u2019s both?\u201d</p><p>He laid her down gently, staring for a moment in dumbfounded silence. She was a small, fine-boned thing, with pert little features and hair that flowed long and loose down her back. The moon had risen and illuminated her face with an unearthly light, making her seem like some sort of wayward fairy princess.</p><p>Rollo spied something on her, and he carefully took her bare arm in his hand. Her skin was warm and smooth, and he couldn\u2019t help but run his thumb over the delicate bones of her hand, her fingers longer and more graceful than he\u2019d have expected.</p><p>He turned her arm to see what had stuck to her and peeled a strange card from the thin skin of her forearm. It pictured a man, walking blithely along, the sun at his back and a bloom in his hand. The man in the drawing gazed up at the sky, heedless of the cliff from which he was about to step. Beneath the image was written, The Fool.</p><p>Rollo quickly pocketed the peculiar thing, his skin prickling to gooseflesh.</p><p>The distant rumble of talk floated over the water from the direction of Traitor\u2019s Gate, calling him back to himself. \u201cHurry,\u201d he said to Ormonde. \u201cIn the cask. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat of her?\u201d Ormonde pointed to the girl with a mix of bemusement and panic.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll give her my cloak.\u201d Rollo slipped his arms from the blanket of dark wool, eyeing her strange and colorful skirt. \u201cSomething to cover the clothes she wears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019ll recognize you. You can\u2019t risk so much for some drunken wench.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you have me do? Drop her in the moat?\u201d He settled the strange woman on his lap, leaning her against his neck as if she nuzzled him. \u201cThe guard\u2019s eyes will be on the lass, not me.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde stared at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind. Rollo glared back, and his friend simply shrugged, climbing awkwardly into the barrel.</p><p>\u201cMake it fast.\u201d Rollo angled away from the guard\u2019s side of the boat, draping the woman\u2019s hair over his face. The smell of lavender filled his senses, and an unsettling feeling seized him, something visceral, both foreign and yet somehow dimly remembered. He swallowed hard, reminding himself where he was. \u201cWe approach the gate.\u201d</p><p>His hired man began whistling with affected boredom as they rowed closer, and Rollo thought he had well earned his keep.</p><p>Just as he\u2019d predicted, the guard had eyes only for their drunken passenger. The man shot Rollo a rakish and congratulatory wink, nodding them through the Traitor\u2019s Gate and out to the Thames.</p><p>But Rollo gazed sightlessly in the distance, breathing the scent of lavender and thinking he\u2019d wager anything that this lass was more than a mere wench.</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>She gradually came to, her body swaying back and forth. The cheery chirrup of birdsong twittered around her. The rustle of greenery under . . . hooves?</p><p>Horseback riding?</p><p>Where am I?</p><p>Events of the previous evening played rapid- fire in her brain as she tried to place when and where. Tapas with Aunt Livia. Sangria.</p><p>Ugh . . . sangria.</p><p>Felicity peeled her eyes open. They were gritty, courtesy of all that alcohol. Her tongue, tacky and thick in her mouth.</p><p>She took in the countryside. A patchwork of green farm-land and the darker green fringe of dense trees stretched into the distance, lush and fragrant all around.</p><p>She tried to make sense of it. She was on a horse. There were two horses.</p><p>She glanced at the man riding the horse next to hers. Frizzy red hair. An elaborate goatee and moustache pointed about his mouth. He was oblivious to her. Concern furrowing his brow, he seemed focused only on the path ahead.</p><p>She\u2019d never been one for elaborate facial hair.</p><p>Wait. How drunk had she been?</p><p>Where had she been? But she knew\u2014she\u2019d been in her apartment. In the Mission. In San Francisco.</p><p>And now she was on a horse.</p><p>She\u2019d had sangria, but not that much sangria. She\u2019d been in her apartment, wishing on a star for her true love. Or rather, on a deck of Tarot cards and Livvie\u2019s trusted candle.</p><p>She stared at the horse\u2019s neck in front of her, damp and rank with sweat, and hoped she wasn\u2019t that unfortunate.</p><p>Felicity glanced down. A pair of arms encased her.</p><p>Could it be? Adrenaline dumped into her veins, making her feel tingly all over. Had she done it?</p><p>She was sideways on a saddle, curled into someone\u2019s arms. Someone\u2019s strong arms.</p><p>Her heart gave a sharp kick in her chest.</p><p>Her eyes grazed down further, at the very masculine legs cradling her. They were encased in tight, muted blue, green, and yellow plaid. Weird.</p><p>But kind of . . . hot.</p><p>Slowly, she turned her head. Her neck was stiff and her eyes dry. Forget that.</p><p>All she knew was that the chest she leaned into was manly. She was being swept away on a horse. She\u2019d made a wish on a star and was being swept away. Just like in a romance novel!</p><p>Had Livvie set this up? If so, she was going to thank her aunt for this fantasy for the rest of her life.</p><p>She turned. Velvet was soft along her cheek. Velvet, the color of brandy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ooh! On the romance covers, their shirts are always open. Will his shirt be open?</p><p>Slowly she lifted her chin. A dozen tiny buttons marched up the broad, flat plane of the man\u2019s belly and chest. A collar rested just below his throat, its points draping long and loose.</p><p>A strong chin. Dark stubble on a strong chin.</p> <p>Oh God, oh God.</p><p>The man holding her looked down, and time stopped.</p><p>Hazel eyes pinned her. They were steady and bright, the color of his velvet jacket.</p><p>Thick waves of chestnut brown hair rested over his collar. Just then the wind tousled it from his brow.

She felt a big, stupid grin spread like molasses over her face.</p><p>His brows furrowed as he contemplated her. Still she couldn\u2019t wipe the dumb smile from her face.</p><p>\u201cAre you still drunk, lass?\u201d</p> <p>Lass. He called me lass!</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hope not,\u201d she murmured. Exhaling something like a dreamy sigh, she nuzzled into his arms.</p><p>How strange, though. Were they somehow at the Renaissance Faire, in Golden Gate Park? Nothing really looked familiar.</p><p>Hmmm. She studied him. Ren faire guy. Made sense. His accent could use a little work, though. But, man, he was hot. She could play along.</p><p>Something struck her, and she glanced around. There were no roads. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh!\u201d the man at their side exclaimed. \u201cOur fair maiden has decided to join the land of the living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are currently trying to get our hides safely out of England,\u201d the man holding her said evenly.</p><p>\u201cEngland?\u201d She scrunched her brow. \u201cIs that part of the fantasy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf only!\u201d The red- haired man barked a laugh. \u201cA fantasy. That\u2019s rich . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d her guy said, \u201c \u2019tis England indeed.\u201d</p><p>England? She stiffened, her heart kicking up a notch. He couldn\u2019t be serious. How the hell could she have landed in England? Unless they\u2019d kidnapped her. But how? Her apartment had actual bars on the windows.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d I get here? Did Livvie set this up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s still feeling her wine,\u201d the red- haired man said.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she protested. She\u2019d been mustering outrage, but confusion made her voice small. \u201cI\u2019m not drunk.\u201d She inhaled deeply, and trying to gather herself, focused on the rhythmic sway of the horse\u2019s gait.</p><p>Horse. What was up with the horses, anyway? Clearly these guys weren\u2019t kidnappers. Two horses weren\u2019t exactly the fastest getaway. A kid on a skateboard could pass them. If there\u2019d been any roads. Which there weren\u2019t. Here in England.</p><p>But of course there were roads in England. So why weren\u2019t there any roads here? Even in those British movies where everyone hied to their country manors by carriage, there were roads.</p><p>But this? This looked like . . . like the land of Robin Hood.</p><p>Her heart slammed harder in her chest as she tried to make sense of it.</p><p>She\u2019d made a wish. She\u2019d made a wish and ended up here.</p><p>She just needed to figure out where here was. She craned her head. Bucolic fields stretched gently before them, like paradise. He\u2019d said England, but there was nothing modern, as far as the eye could see. She\u2019d traveled to some pretty remote spots in her life, and still, you could always see something. Distant cars, power lines, something.</p><p>But here there were just horses, and men in fancy velvet coats, and lush landscape all around. Just like Robin Hood. Or like a fairy tale. Some strange world offering a snapshot from the past.</p><p>Could it be the past? She gave a breathy laugh. No way.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have been transported from the real world, from her world. She was supposed to show up for the morning shift. She\u2019d waited weeks for that cute coffee shop to have an opening. And who\u2019d water all her plants?</p><p>Maybe her mind was playing tricks on her. She could only manage shallow breaths now, as though her chest had shrunk. She did another scan of the countryside. Impossible.</p><p>No cars, no airplanes, no telephone wires. No modern world. Anywhere.</p><p>\u201cHang on,\u201d she said suddenly. She was losing it. People didn\u2019t just land in fairy tales. She\u2019d call Livvie, get a reality check. \u201cA phone. Do you have a phone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave we a what?\u201d the red-haired man asked.</p><p>\u201cTelephone?\u201d she asked in disbelief. \u201cNo? You don\u2019t . . . You don\u2019t know a Maid Marian, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTele . . .\u201d The man holding her glared. \u201cIs that French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never heard of a phone,\u201d she muttered, her heart thundering now. \u201cBut you speak English, right? Here in . . . England? Where you don\u2019t have phones?\u201d</p><p>England. She studied the sword dangling from the red-haired man\u2019s hip. Old England.</p><p>What had she done? That crazy candle. How would she ever get back? And what about Livvie? Livvie would be so worried.</p><p>Holy crap. Could it really be the past? Didn\u2019t they have all kinds of wars in the past? And plagues? Oh God, plagues. Why hadn\u2019t she paid more attention in history class?</p><p>Okay, be cool. Maybe it wasn\u2019t what it seemed. She didn\u2019t seem to be in any immediate danger. How to handle it?</p><p>She strained eyes and ears for some sign of life, but there was nothing. Hell, there weren\u2019t really even any sounds, apart from the horses. And the breathing of the men.</p><p>Of the man, behind her.</p><p>She finally managed a deep breath. The man behind her. He sure was hot.</p><p>Calm down. The universe was telling her something. She just needed to open herself to it.</p><p>Those matchmaking dummies had told her she was unmatchable, and the universe had proved them wrong. She apparently did have a true love. He just happened to be . . . medieval dude. Hunky medieval dude.</p><p>Maybe it was the past. How bad could it be anyway? People had survived it. No phones, no television. It seemed kind of nice, actually. Simpler.</p><p>Surely she could find a way to get word to Livvie\u2014somehow. She\u2019d figure that out later. Her aunt would be so mad if she found out that Felicity had spun out worrying about her instead of just relaxing into the experience.</p><p>She tilted her head back for another look at the man behind her. She knew one thing\u2014she couldn\u2019t do any better on the One True Love front. He sure was good-l ooking. Seemed like a gentleman. Intense, intelligent eyes. Clean and well-dressed.</p><p>Maybe he had a castle. Maybe he hung out with princes and stuff. Maybe he was a prince.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said breathily. \u201cDo you have a castle? In England? England . . .\u201d She shook her head, marveling. \u201cWill we get to see stuff like Big Ben, and the Tower of London?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pray not,\u201d the red-haired man muttered.</p><p>The man at her back frowned. \u201cI hadn\u2019t counted on needing three, not two, mounts.\u201d He pinned her with narrowed eyes. \u201c \u2019Twould be a long journey to Scotland, with you riding pillion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you, Will,\u201d the other man said. \u201cRiding is folly. Our journey is too long. One month in which Cromwell can sniff us out with his dogs? I think not. A boat it must be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotland?\u201d She pushed up and away from his chest, craning her neck. \u201cI thought you said England. I\u2019ve always wanted to see Scotland too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn time,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cFor now, it\u2019s England. At least until we sort our transportation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Scottish?\u201d She glanced down at his tartan-clad legs and smiled. \u201cDo you have a kilt too?\u201d</p><p>He stared blankly.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d she said gesturing to his legs, \u201cone of those hot . . . man . . . skirts.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cAye, I\u2019m a Scotsman, and aye, I\u2019ve a breacan feile.\u201d He spoke slowly and with great effort, as though moderating his patience. \u201cNow, tell us where to bring you.\u201d</p><p>His companion only chuckled.</p><p>\u201cBring me?\u201d She had nowhere to be except right where she was. San Francisco was probably still just a stretch of waterfront wilderness.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d her handsome man said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do that much, lass.\u201d</p><p>Their eyes locked. Lass. He\u2019d said it again. He\u2019ll wear his kilt and call me lass. Butterflies danced in her belly. \u201cCan you ride horses when you wear your kilt . . . whatchamacallit?\u201d</p><p>A low growl escaped him. \u201cWhere should I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d she said, coming back to herself. \u201cI\u2019ve got no place to go. I think . . . I think I\u2019m supposed to be here. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked innocently.</p><p>The red-haired man cleared his throat. \u201cDare we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRollo,\u201d her man answered, \u201cWilliam Rollo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRollo,\u201d she repeated, sounding the name slowly. \u201cWhat kind of name is Rollo? It doesn\u2019t sound Scottish. Shouldn\u2019t it be something like MacRollo instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Tis an old name,\u201d he clipped out. \u201cA Norse name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHail Rollo the Viking!\u201d the red- headed man jested. \u201cYour forefather became none other than the Duke of Normandy, was it? That would\u2019ve been, what, eight hundred years ago?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy Viking . . .\u201d Felicity sighed. She would never mock Livvie or her candles ever again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a Viking,\u201d Rollo snarled.</p><p>His companion laughed. \u201cOh, but you seem quite barbarous to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d Rollo nudged their horse into a brisker walk. \u201cWho are you, woman? And where do I deposit you?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring him, Felicity turned to the red-headed man. \u201cAre you Scottish too, then? Or do you live here?\u201d</p><p>He stared, amused, as if she were nuts. \u201cGood luck with this one, Will.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThe name is Ormonde, dear lady. James Butler, the Marquis of Ormonde, so pleased to make your acquaintance. And, if you\u2019re one of Cromwell\u2019s lackeys, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to kill you now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cQuit your jesting,\u201d Rollo snapped. \u201cTruly, lass. Tell me with whom I should\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really.\u201d Felicity tried sitting up in earnest. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be here. I\u2019m not from . . .\u201d\u2014she pitched her voice for his ears alone\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not from here. I was sent to you. I\u2019m sure of it. Hold on!\u201d she said suddenly. \u201cWhat year is it?\u201d</p><p>She studied his coat and lace-edged collar. Maybe she\u2019d get to wear some lacy getup too. And she couldn\u2019t wait for her first carriage ride. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this is really happening. It\u2019s so exciting.\u201d</p> <p>There was a strained pause, and then Rollo said simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Will eyed the lovely creature in his arms, disbelief snaking through him. His gaze took in the clattering armful of bracelets, the strangely ruffled skirt. Her feet were bare and delicate, each toenail painted a cheery pink.</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d he said again.</p><p>Their eyes met, and she grinned at him, raising her brows in exaggerated innocence.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cNo, it couldn\u2019t . . .\u201d</p> <p>But it could, he thought. Time travel. It could, and did happen, with a frequency that had him doubting his own sanity. Rollo scowled.</p><p>Because damned if each time he didn\u2019t find himself in its very nexus. Some great, dumb insect trapped in a web.</p><p>In what manner of dark era did they find themselves, in which witchcraft burbled and roiled as matter-of-factly as the clouds above? What was the meaning of it?</p><p>First, there had been his friend James, whose bride fell through a portrait, landing in his very own bed.</p><p>And then that great brute of a man MacColla. It made sense that the only woman with backbone enough for Alasdair came from some distant future.</p><p>But now this? What was happening?</p> <p>A great, dumb insect trapped in a web, though this time the beautiful spider had come for him.</p><p>He eyed the woman once more. He\u2019d known, on some level. Known the moment he first saw her that she wasn\u2019t some ordinary wench.</p><p>Lovely, fragile, and open. Smiling giddily up at him as if he were Lancelot.</p><p>Some unnamed grief stabbed him. Rollo pushed it away. He flexed his legs, deadened and worthless beneath him. The riding was difficult enough. But bearing it with someone else\u2019s weight, it became a grueling challenge.</p><p>He took a hand from the reins, pounded life into his thigh.</p><p>No. He was no woman\u2019s Lancelot.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said again, baldly.</p><p>\u201cAre you quite well, Will?\u201d his friend asked.</p> <p>\u201cI am . . . well enough.\u201d Rollo kicked his horse into a trot. \u201cI must away to Perthshire. To home. With the woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd no boats, Ormonde. I\u2019ve had my fill of water.\u201d Men spoke dismissively of sea legs, when Rollo\u2019s were barely fit for land. He\u2019d claim some dignity in this whole enterprise. \u201cWe find a carriage to take us from England. Then away to my family\u2019s Duncrub Castle.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at the woman in his arms. With her long, flowing hair and doll-like features, she had the air of a pixie. So guileless, a look of expectancy on her pretty face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, lass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicity.\u201d She gave him a broad smile, and he felt his heart crack.</p><p>Felicity. Was it a cruel joke? He\u2019d not felt true joy in decades, and in his lap he held a woman with the name Felicity.</p><p>Come for him? He couldn\u2019t fathom it.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>Perhaps for another, more like.</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>\u201cThis is not particularly what I\u2019d describe as fleeing London.\u201d Ormonde looked around nervously.</p><p>Felicity couldn\u2019t understand the problem. They were taking a lovely stroll around the fringes of what Will had told her was Hampstead Heath. But, despite the acres of greenery and tranquil ponds all around, the red-headed man flinched at the sight of every new person who passed by.</p><p>\u201cWe are simply three taking the air,\u201d Rollo responded flatly.</p><p>\u201cWhy did we come to this godforsaken place anyhow? A stroll in the park?\u201d His eyes flicked to Rollo\u2019s cane.</p><p>It was pretty, carved from a stretch of honey-colored wood, and Felicity didn\u2019t understand why her Viking had been so grumpy about getting it.</p><p>\u201cYou of all people . . .\u201d Ormonde shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019ll be three taking to the dungeons if we don\u2019t leave soon.\u201d</p><p>Dungeons? She frowned, trying to remember her history, but academics had never been her thing. She knew England and Scotland hadn\u2019t exactly been lovey-dovey in the old days. What does he mean, dungeons?</p><p>She eyed the two men. They acted like they were on the run. Ormonde looked nervous, impatient at the pace Rollo was setting.</p><p>But Rollo. She sighed. William Rollo. So handsome. And the new silver-h andled cane only made him look more dashing. Her frown blossomed into a smile as she deduced that her One True Love must be some grand and misunderstood nobleman.</p><p>\u201cI am quite capable of strolling,\u201d Rollo snapped.</p><p>Ormonde attempted good- natured reassurances, but Will cut him off. \u201cI needed this\u201d\u2014he waved his cane with revulsion\u2014\u201cand we needed a place where we could speak safely as well. A small village Hampstead might be, but aye,\u201d he admitted, \u201cit\u2019s true, Cromwell\u2019s ears are everywhere. You have the right of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Ormonde stopped in his tracks. \u201cWait. I do?\u201d</p><p>Though Ormonde\u2019s freckled cheeks broke into a grin, Rollo\u2019s response was grave. \u201cThree heading north in a carriage will raise too many brows. I think you should divine that boat you so long for. I shall more appropriately clothe this one\u201d\u2014he gestured to Felicity\u2014\u201cand hire a carriage.\u201d</p><p>Clothes\u2014thank God. In a whispered exchange, Rollo had handed their horses off to some wizened villager who\u2019d disappeared and promptly reappeared bearing the clothes she now wore. Just the mention of it had her furtively scratching at the waist of a skirt she\u2019d swear was made of burlap.</p><p>Now if only she could find herself a rubber band. Her hair was driving her batty. Or a headband. Hell, she\u2019d settle for an old scrunchie.</p><p>\u201cI shall be back in Perthshire by month\u2019s end.\u201d Rollo\u2019s jaw tightened. \u201cBut I\u2019ll not join your . . . club. Though I long for the restoration of King Charles II as much as you, I\u2019ll leave games of intrigue to you and your Sealed Knot Society men.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde was silent for a moment, then gave a brusque nod. \u201cI understand. Though if it\u2019s intrigues you fear, I don\u2019t see why you persist, Will.You\u2019re one of the most honor- bound men I\u2019ve known, but she\u201d\u2014his eyes went to Felicity\u2014\u201cshe far exceeds the responsibilities of a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are saying she is not of my concern?\u201d</p><p>Ormonde nodded vigorously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing right here, guys,\u201d she chimed, but they both ignored her.</p><p>\u201cThen it is not of your concern either,\u201d Rollo stated with finality. He looked at Felicity, his eyes locking with hers for a heartbeat. Her heart swelled.</p><p>She\u2019d known she\u2019d found herself the one.</p><p>Okay, if she had to admit it, the whole situation was a little weird. She glanced around the park. It was like Jane Austen-land. A couple walked on the path ahead, and the woman carried a darned parasol. And it was the fourth one she\u2019d seen all day.</p><p>Apparently she really was in the past. Where there were parasols. And dungeons.</p><p>Can I deal with this?</p><p>She looked back at Rollo. Tall, dark, handsome, and so sexy serious.</p><p>Would he look that intense when he . . .</p><p>She flushed.</p><p>Oh yeah, she could deal.</p><p>\u201cI have an inkling of this woman\u2019s origins. She needs my assistance and that is what I shall give. Fear not, I\u2019ll see her soon gone from Perth.\u201d</p><p>Gone?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo now,\u201d Rollo told his friend, cutting her off. His hard features softened for a moment. \u201cYou\u2019ve been fancying a boat. Go find one already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know where I\u2019m from?\u201d she asked the moment Ormonde strode away. She\u2019d been dying to ask, but had wanted to wait until she and Will were alone.</p><p>\u201cAye. I know enough.\u201d He took the cane from his hand to flex and stretch his fingers. \u201cNow we must get to the clothier before he closes for his midday meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you . . .\u201d She watched him as he turned to head back toward the village. Rollo set a slow and shuffling pace, and yet stood tall and elegantly upright. She eyed his uneven gait, marveling at the thick knots of muscle that had been carved into his physique, as if his body was overcompensating for his injured legs.</p><p>She jogged a couple paces to catch up to him. Felicity could see the pain clearly on his face, at the corners of his eyes and mouth.</p><p>He was obviously a tragic figure who also happened to have movie star good looks.</p><p>Clearly she\u2019d been sent through time for him.</p><p>The problem was, he didn\u2019t seem too interested in her. Yet.</p><p>\u201cHere\u201d\u2014she took his arm, giving it a warm squeeze\u2014\u201clet me help\u2014\u201d</p><p>Rollo abruptly pulled from her. \u201cI need no help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Felicity recoiled as if stung.</p><p>\u201cListen.\u201d Rollo stopped, the chiseled steel of his features blunting momentarily. \u201cThe future, is it? I\u2019ve met others like you.\u201d</p><p>Her face widened in shock. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Others there have been. I will help you. To return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut, you\u2019re not listening. I don\u2019t want to return.\u201d She gave him an earnest smile. \u201cThe universe thinks you\u2019re the one for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He stood still as granite then, his mind seeming far from where they stood. His eyes blazed a trail down, then back up, her body. Abruptly, Will gave his head a shake. \u201cI am no woman\u2019s man. Now come.\u201d He gestured to the path that had taken them to a quaint village square. \u201cIt\u2019s to the clothier for you. Then to Perthshire. Then home. Your home.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The road was a mucky minefield of horse manure, puddles, and uneven runnels in the mud. She marveled how she had to struggle to keep up with him, even though he didn\u2019t have the easy gait of other men.</p><p>Breathless, Felicity caught up to his side, but before she could speak, he announced, \u201cHere.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see an elaborate hand-painted sign reading: Jos. Pemberley and Sons ~ Millinery and Fine Dress Making for Ladies.</p> <p>\u201cJoseph Pemberley,\u201d she read aloud. \u201cYou brought me to a . . . mill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA milliner.\u201d He chuckled. The sound was unexpected\u2014low and husky, it sent goose bumps rippling across her skin. She\u2019d gathered that laughter was a rarity for the man, and yet, she thought wistfully, it utterly transformed him.</p><p>\u201cFor hats, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to buy me a hat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAmong other things.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, fun.\u201d And sexy, she thought, unable to identify the hooded look that clouded his features.</p><p>The shop was dim and cool, with a bustling shopkeeper straight out of a BBC movie.</p><p>As his gaze alighted on Felicity, though, a look of such comical distaste puckered his features, she had to bite back a giggle.</p><p>She forgot the old grump at once, though, when she spotted the tables topped with pile after pile of cloth. She gasped. There were lush swaths of jewel- toned velvet, delicate fabrics in pale colors, and bolts bearing thick stripes of colors in alternating shiny and matte textures.</p><p>\u201cThis is so\u2014\u201d She felt Rollo\u2019s hand wrap firmly around her upper arm. Her heart gave a kick, even though the stern look on his face told her to quiet. \u201cThis is so exciting,\u201d she finished in a stage whisper.</p><p>She surreptitiously ran her fingers over a luxurious pile of satin, cascading like a royal blue spill of water across a table near the front of the shop.</p> <p>She heard a clipped hiss, and looked up to see the clothier eyeing her suspiciously.</p><p>Grabbing Rollo\u2019s arm, she hastily spun to eye another table. She wasn\u2019t sure how she was supposed to act. \u201cI worked retail for years,\u201d she whispered, \u201cand this guy would\u2019ve been so fired.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, woman.\u201d Momentarily switching his cane to his left hand, Rollo loosened the death grip she had on his upper arm.</p><p>\u201cCan you get me something in that blue?\u201d she asked him, pointing to the bright blue satin. \u201cThat is just totally\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d the shopkeeper asked at their backs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like\u2014\u201d she began, but Rollo cut her off at once.</p><p>\u201cThe lady requires a dress.\u201d The sharp edge to Rollo\u2019s voice challenged the peevish old shopkeeper to just try and disagree.</p><p>Lady. Felicity beamed. The lady.</p> <p>Looking as though he was holding his breath, the man eyed her dingy clothes and pulled a long looped stretch of twine from his coat.</p><p>\u201cMeasurements won\u2019t be necessary,\u201d Rollo said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a hurry and require something ready-made.\u201d</p><p>This time, the man didn\u2019t even try to disguise his contempt. \u201cI am a clothier, sir, and an expert tailor. I do not cater to a . . . ready-made clientele.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is that, then?\u201d Rollo pointed to a display in the window.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Felicity gasped. It was a frothy rose-colored confection on a dress form.</p><p>Total BBC movie.</p><p>There was thick gold stitching along the sleeves. Real gold, she realized. Fancy.</p><p>\u201cThat, sir, is not for sale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything has a price.\u201d His voice was steel, drawing Felicity\u2019s gaze to him, and she saw the edge reflected in his eyes, cold and flat.</p><p>So intense.</p><p>It struck her that, though he might be talking about a dress, Rollo could be speaking to much more.</p><p>And deep too.</p><p>\u201cHow can you be certain it will even fit this . . . lady?\u201d</p><p>The two men stared a challenge, and it was the shopkeeper who lost the battle. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said on a sharp exhale. \u201cBut this is highly irregular.\u201d</p><p>As the man toddled over to remove the dress from the window, she frantically pulled Rollo to her. \u201cHow am I supposed to\u2014\u201d</p><p>The shopkeeper turned, the dress draped gingerly over his arm. Appalled, he stared at Felicity whispering in Rollo\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cShe will surely require those . . . other garments . . . as befits a lady?\u201d He eyed the coarse and slightly soiled dress she wore.</p><p>\u201cSurely,\u201d Rollo bit out, patting Felicity\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cAnd a farthingale as well, I presume?\u201d Chin trembling, the man skimmed his eyes over her skirts.</p><p>\u201cNot necessary.\u201d</p><p>His eyes shot up. \u201cNecessary, I think. With a dress such as this\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a\u2014?\u201d she began in a furtive whisper.</p><p>\u201cNot necessary.\u201d Rollo peeled his lips back into a smile that looked something like a grimace. \u201cI think the lady may be required to do some riding and so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiding?\u201d the man sputtered. \u201cNot in my gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer gown now.\u201d Rollo tossed a bag of coin onto the counter. \u201cAnd if you\u2019d be so kind, the lady will require a dressing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u201d\u2014the man looked from Rollo to Felicity and back again, clearly alarmed\u2014\u201cshe will don it here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d she whispered urgently.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s here or in the carriage,\u201d he told her under his breath. Rollo nudged her to the back of the shop.</p><p>\u201cBe so good as to shutter the place,\u201d he called to the shopkeeper over his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she purred quietly. He was sending the shopkeeper from his very own shop. \u201cSo . . . alpha.\u201d</p><p>The man began to protest, but a quick flick of Rollo\u2019s eyes to the leather coin purse lying conspicuously on the counter silenced him.</p><p>\u201cAnd do occupy yourself elsewhere,\u201d Will ordered, indicating the door.</p><p>What was he planning? She shivered in anticipation.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a good man. We\u2019ll let ourselves out.\u201d</p><p>He guided her toward a screen in the back corner. Cranes of crimson lacquer held graceful poses atop a shining black background.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d a little chirp of pleasure escaped her. She could do a sexy little striptease behind the exotic screen. Visions filled her head and brought a muzzy smile to her face.</p><p>Too bad the outfit she was about to remove was closer to a burlap sack than a silk negligee.</p><p>Though maybe . . .</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t these come with bustiers or something? Can we get any other clothes while we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust dress yourself, lass,\u201d he snapped, shooing her behind the screen. \u201cYou have no notion the danger we\u2019re in. You\u2019ve called enough attention to us as it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Deflated, she stepped behind the screen. \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>So much for saucily rolling off a pair of stockings and swinging them over her head.</p><p>Felicity heard the tap of his cane on the floor as Rollo walked from the dressing area. She\u2019d been eyeing the cane since he\u2019d gotten it, and the question burst from her lips before she could think twice. \u201cWhat happened? To your legs, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Unknotting the sash at her waist, she began to peel off the soiled clothing. \u201cWere you hurt?\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cAye. You could say I\u2019ve been hurt.\u201d</p><p>She heard him breathing heavily, sounding something like a restlessly slumbering dragon.</p><p>She gave a dramatic pout behind the screen. She really couldn\u2019t get a bead on the man.</p><p>It had been such a thrill\u2014she\u2019d made her wish, done her magic, and it had come true. She\u2019d actually landed back in time\u2014he\u2019d said the year was sixteen-something\u2014and been deposited with some Scottish hunk with a crazy Viking name.</p><p>He even believed her, which really was a sign. If someone were to plop into her life from out of nowhere, claiming to be from the future, she\u2019d think he was nuttier than a fruitcake.</p><p>So why was he making this so difficult?</p><p>Time to try another tack.</p><p>She stood up on her tiptoes to pop her head over the screen. \u201cWho are you running from anyway?\u201d</p><p>Rollo\u2019s eyes quickly flicked to her bare shoulders.</p><p>She was naked. He couldn\u2019t see her, but he knew. Just on the other side of the screen, not four paces from him, this woman was bare. Utterly and completely naked but for what flesh would be concealed by that lovely, long, yellow hair.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak but nothing came out. Licking his lips, he made as if he were formulating something of import to say. What to say?</p><p>Her shoulders were pale and delicate, covered by that fine web of her hair, the color of sunlight.</p><p>He resolutely pinned her gaze with his. \u201cDon\u2019t you know where you are?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said England. So, yeah, England.\u201d She seemed to stand a little taller.</p><p>Her attempts at temper amused him.</p><p>Better amused than aroused. The thought gave him clarity.</p><p>\u201cI am on the run from Cromwell. Who, by the way, would have my head on a stake for supper and your fine body on a pyre for dessert.\u201d</p><p>Fine body? What was he doing speaking such phrases to her?</p><p>She\u2019d caught the phrase too, and pink flushed along her skin like the blush of passion. He wondered if the color infused the rest of her body.</p><p>Rollo gave his head a shake.</p><p>He was not one for smooth dealings with women, his experience not extending beyond the sisters and wives in his extended circle.</p><p>If only he could have her fine body for dessert.</p><p>Rollo made a sound like a growl in his throat and turned to walk to the front of the shop. Would that he could do as other men and spin on his heel with haste and flair, but instead he shuffled forth.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><p>He stopped. Leaning on his cane, Rollo waited for her to finish. He kept his back to her, his hand jammed in his pocket. All these thoughts of Felicity\u2019s naked flesh had him decidedly bothered.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t . . . I don\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>He heard the rustle of silk.</p><p>\u201cI need you to help me,\u201d she finally said. Her voice sounded muted, as if she spoke from under layers of fabric. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put this thing on.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSimply place it over your head.

She would\u2019ve made her way up and through all that fabric, then.</p> <p>\u201cBut this . . .\u201d She paused, and Rollo heard more rustling. \u201cWell, you can\u2019t expect me to do all these buttons by myself.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d seen the dozens of tiny fabric buttons running up the back of the dress. He just hadn\u2019t realized their import until now. Of course she\u2019d need help. Women needed the assistance of maids to get ready.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d he stammered. \u201cYou . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Will. I\u2019m decent. I just need you to button this thing up for me.\u201d</p><p>Will. She\u2019d called him Will.</p> <p>Women in his acquaintance were generally more formal. And then there had been MacColla\u2019s bride, Haley, who\u2019d called him \u201cRollo\u201d with the carefree ease of one of his school chums.</p><p>But his given name, rolling from a woman\u2019s tongue with such careless intimacy? The sound stabbed him and thrilled him both.</p><p>He turned again, staring at the screen as if it were an approaching marauder.</p><p>\u201cUh . . . You there?\u201d She popped her head up again. \u201cWill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d He\u2019d never buttoned a woman\u2019s gown before. But they had to make haste. He\u2019d paid a lad to fetch a carriage from the mews\u2014it would surely be out front by now. Waiting to put as much distance between them and England as possible.</p><p>Cromwell\u2019s Parliamentary soldiers had captured Ormonde, imprisoned him in the Tower. And Rollo had freed his friend right from under their noses.</p> <p>From under his brother\u2019s nose.</p><p>His brother Jamie would be on the lookout for him. Blood or no, Jamie would not let such a slight stand.</p><p>Rollo girded himself. Tried to let thoughts of Roundheads and Royalists tamp down his unruly flesh.</p><p>He inhaled deeply, a white-knuckled grip on the head of his cane. \u201cButtons are buttons,\u201d he muttered, and stepped behind the screen.</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Why was he being so quiet?</p><p>\u201cAre you still there?\u201d Felicity clutched the dress to her chest. Despite the fact that she was, for all intents and purposes, almost completely covered, she suddenly felt very self-conscious.</p><p>She shook her head, amused. She wasn\u2019t usually so modest. She supposed she was getting into the spirit of the time period. Or maybe it was just in reaction to the strangely grave and proper man on the other side of the partition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay, come in,\u201d she said, seeing that he stood at the edge of the screen.</p><p>She turned back around, offering him her back for buttoning. The dress began to slide, and she tucked her elbows to her sides to hold it in place.</p><p>\u201cThe corset thingy tied in the front\u201d\u2014hooking a thumb at the top, she gave a little tug to her stays\u2014\u201cI think I did it right.\u201d It was a ridiculously tight contraption, but she had to wear something, and this was all the shopkeeper had left behind for her.</p><p>Still, she thought her breasts were going to pop up and out at any moment.</p><p>\u201cAre you there?\u201d\u2014she twisted to make sure Rollo hadn\u2019t disappeared\u2014\u201cugh, does this need to be so tight?\u201d</p><p>He was staring at her with narrowed eyes and a clenched jaw.</p><p>\u201cI just need you to button me. I can\u2019t reach up the back.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t budge. He could make this a little easier. Felicity raised her brows. \u201cPlease?\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod.</p><p>Is he angry or something?</p><p>\u201cSorry.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI tried to . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo apologies, lass.\u201d Rollo\u2019s voice was ragged. His eyes grazed her bared shoulders. He cleared his throat.</p><p>The tense silence was unbearable. She shrugged again.</p><p>\u201cBe still.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sorry. I mean . . . Sorry I was sorry.\u201d She scrunched her face, happy her back was to him. She tried to stand as still as possible. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll just shut up.\u201d</p><p>Felicity sensed Rollo placing his cane down. She heard his shuffle at her back. Felt his approach. Heard his breath, suddenly close at her ear.</p><p>She shivered, and felt her skin pebble tight.</p><p>Why was he just standing there?</p><p>She fought the urge to apologize again, just to fill the silence. Could this really be her Viking? He sure was a serious one.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he buttoning\u2014?</p><p>His hands skimmed along her back. The silk of her dress under his fingertips made a muted shushing sound.</p><p>Oh. A breath escaped her, and she clamped her lips between her teeth.</p><p>Rollo\u2019s fingers went to her waist, tugging the fabric together, securing the first button.</p><p>The room was suddenly unbearably hot.</p><p>\u201cAre . . . are you sure this dress will fit me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His voice had a steely, sharp edge. She felt his breath on her neck. He did the next button. And then the next.</p><p>His fingers found a rhythm. Dip beneath the fabric, pull gently, flick the button through. Dip, pull, flick. She felt the warmth of his fingers through the linen of her corset all the while.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she managed. Heat rippled beneath the surface of her skin, suffusing her body. \u201cI . . .\u201d</p><p>He was almost done. She didn\u2019t want him to be done. She\u2019d thought the stays were tight, but the dress snugged her even more, and it was the most erotic sensation she\u2019d ever experienced. The feel of her breasts pressed tight, rubbing up against so much stiff fabric.</p><p>She glanced down. Her breasts were two pale, perfect mounds above the rose-colored silk.</p><p>She hoped her nipples didn\u2019t pop out.</p><p>But it looked pretty hot.</p><p>Oh, wow.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized her breasts could do that.</p><p>He froze behind her.</p><p>He was done.</p><p>She blushed. He hadn\u2019t even seen the front of the dress yet, but still the anticipation of it made her blush.</p><p>She turned slowly and his gaze was waiting for her. Simmering, and deadly serious.</p><p>Rollo ran his eyes down the length of her, pausing at her breasts.</p><p>She struggled to inhale.</p><p>He ran his eyes back up.</p><p>And this time she saw something raw there. Those hazel eyes, the color of chocolate in the dimly lit room, stared at her. Didn\u2019t budge from her.</p><p>Wanting him overwhelmed her. She leaned closer, taking him in. Taking in his gorgeous face, that thick, wavy brown hair. That perfect mouth.</p><p>So damned handsome.</p><p>She leaned closer.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move, and her heart thrilled with it.</p><p>Her Viking. She\u2019d kiss her Viking now.</p><p>Closer.</p><p>His lips parted. She trembled, getting closer.</p><p>She brought her hand to his chest. Rested her palm lightly on him. She felt his muscles tense, so tight and hard beneath his waistcoat.</p><p>She was mesmerized. Those eyes of his, with just a little bit of gold that she could see now, up close.</p><p>Lean down, Will.</p><p>Why wasn\u2019t he leaning down? She had the bodice on, now it was time for her Viking to rip it from her.</p><p>He tilted his chin down. Brought his hand slowly up, cupped her cheek.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>A bell jingled as the front door opened, and Rollo closed his eyes as if in pain.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The shopkeeper sounded confused, suspicious.</p><p>Rollo brought his hand back quickly to his side.</p><p>Felicity made a tiny deflated sound, and he marveled at the endearingly feminine noise.</p><p>Had she truly wanted him to kiss her?</p><p>Good Christ.</p><p>He\u2019d almost kissed her.</p><p>He inhaled deeply, exhaled sharply, and opened his eyes to her. What had he been thinking?</p><p>That open and guileless gaze snagged his. He held it as he called, \u201cAye, just here. We\u2019ve finished.\u201d</p><p>They needed to go, but still, Rollo couldn\u2019t take his eyes from her.</p><p>Those brown eyes with that yellow hair. The delicate features of some fairy-tale beauty. And breasts that he wanted to free from her gown, take in his mouth. And suck. And ravage.</p><p>Those goddamned buttons had mocked him. He wanted to tear them off, to take her in his arms, and see if the rest of her was as creamy and pale as the delectable stretch of d\u00e9colletage that he\u2019d decided would surely then and there be the death of him.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d The disembodied voice was closer now.</p><p>Rollo turned, reached for his cane, and just then stumbled. His damned legs had cramped up, so tightly wound had he been holding himself.</p><p>The shopkeeper peeked behind the screen just as Rollo cursed under his breath. Scandalized, the man\u2019s eyes grew wide. \u201cIf you\u2019d be so kind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Rollo gritted out, \u201cyou\u2019ve my coin. We leave you now.\u201d</p><p>The click and drag of his cane and feet were the only sounds as they made their way, excruciatingly slowly, from the shop.</p><p>Rollo felt Felicity\u2019s eyes on him in the carriage, and he pushed himself as far into the corner as possible.</p><p>She smelled so . . . lush. Womanly and rich, her scent filled the small enclosure, driving him to distraction. Did she have to watch him so?</p><p>The wheel caught on a rut. The carriage gave a sharp jolt, and Felicity bounced closer in his direction.</p><p>\u201cSixteen fifty-eight,\u201d he said suddenly, his voice cracking. \u201cThe year. Is 1658.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She looked confused for a moment. \u201cOh. Okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t . . . shock you?\u201d And he\u2019d thought MacColla\u2019s woman Haley had been a peculiar one.</p><p>\u201cShock me? What about you? I\u2019m from the twenty-first century, and you act as though women pop back in time every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, but it seems you all do . . .\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She leaned closer to hear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen . . . this\u201d\u2014he waved his hands, gesturing to her\u2014\u201cbefore. But don\u2019t fash yourself.\u201d He glanced away from her to stare back out the window. \u201cAs I said, I will help you return to your proper place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to tell you. I think this is my proper place. I did . . . something\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis couldn\u2019t possibly be your proper place.\u201d He sat upright to confront her. \u201cNot very long ago, our king was relieved of his head. His son, the rightful king, Charles II, lives in exile, rallying to be restored to the throne. And Cromwell\u2019s agents comb the countryside seeking men like me to hang from a gibbet in the market square.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, maybe I was sent back to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need your help,\u201d he snapped.</p> <p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Her shoulders fell. \u201cIs this about your legs or something?\u201d</p><p>He bristled. Would she not leave it alone?</p><p>\u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t saying you needed help help. Gosh, you\u2019re sensitive. I was just saying, I think for some reason I came back to you specifically.\u201d She poked her finger at his chest. \u201cI made a wish, asked for a Viking, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>The laugh exploded from him, surprising them both. \u201cYou asked for a Viking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, not a real Viking. It was . . . a metaphor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou requested a metaphorical Viking from the universe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She crossed her arms. \u201cThough it didn\u2019t sound so silly at the time.\u201d</p><p>He sank back into the seat, staring fixedly at the ceiling of the carriage. Why had he insisted on hiring a carriage? Why hadn\u2019t he put her on that boat with Ormonde instead? He could\u2019ve ridden to Perthshire. It could\u2019ve taken him months.</p><p>\u201cI am no woman\u2019s Viking,\u201d he grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t . . .\u201d She froze, a look of horror crossing her face. \u201cWait, you\u2019re not married already, are you?\u201d</p><p>He swung his head to look at her, his face dark. \u201cDo I look married?\u201d</p> <p>She merely stared blankly.</p><p>Rollo gestured to his legs. Was she purposely misunderstanding? He raised his brows, waiting impatiently for his point to dawn.</p><p>\u201cWhat, you think because you limp, you can\u2019t get married?\u201d Her laugh was the one to shock him then. \u201cYou have got to be kidding me. You\u2019re, like, the hottest man ever. Big whoop, you\u2019ve got a limp.\u201d</p><p>What could she mean by hot?</p><p>She scooted closer to eye his legs. \u201cThey don\u2019t look so bad, anyhow. Not set correctly after a break\u2014that\u2019s it, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He looked again out the window. The carriage suddenly felt intolerably small. \u201cA horse crushed my legs when I was but a lad.\u201d</p><p>Her indrawn breath drew his eyes back to her. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d</p><p>He had to chuckle at the earnest look on her face.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she scolded. \u201cThat\u2019s, like, the worst thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d</p><p>Felicity reached her hand out tentatively, then brought it back to her lap. \u201cMay I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay you what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI studied massage for a while. I think . . . Well . . .\u201d She tilted her head to get a better look.</p><p>Her eyes on him were agony. And yet somehow the shame that usually overtook him at the topic of his legs remained at bay.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen you pound at your leg. Like this.\u201d Felicity balled her hand into a fist and thumped at her thigh. \u201cBut that\u2019s not going to help you at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod save me, is that what I look like?\u201d He shrugged on the familiar self-loathing like a pair of well-worn boots.</p><p>Felicity wore her frustration plainly on her face, and he thought it would\u2019ve been comical if she weren\u2019t so damned pretty.</p><p>In answer, she simply reached out and grabbed his upper thigh.</p><p>\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d</p><p>Losh, but her hands were strong.</p><p>\u201cThis is really . . .\u201d</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>\u201cQuite . . .\u201d</p><p>Good Lord save him.</p><p>\u201cInappropriate.\u201d</p><p>Oh . . . He shuddered, the breath leaving him slowly, as decades of tension unspooled and the pain that had been a constant slowly began to dissolve.</p><p>She instantly lightened the pressure. \u201cThat didn\u2019t hurt, did it?\u201d</p><p>Rollo responded with a tight shake of his head.</p><p>\u201cOh, good.\u201d She redoubled her efforts, using knuckles and thumbs to ease the tightness at the front of his legs. \u201cBecause I only studied massage for a year. Well, not really a year. Almost a year.\u201d</p><p>She found a sensitive spot and he flinched.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re okay?\u201d</p><p>He gave a single nod, his eyes shut tight.</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t need to be mister tough guy. Just tell me if it hurts.\u201d Her hand grazed the side of his thigh.</p><p>Rollo held his breath\u2014what was she doing?</p><p>She dug her thumb in hard, and everything else fell away.</p><p>This strange . . . massage . . . was shaping up to be one of the single most memorable moments of his life, and yet, seemingly oblivious, Felicity chattered on.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, I was really into it,\u201d she said, making circular motions with her thumb. \u201cInto massage school, I mean. But boom, my first hairy back and that was it.\u201d She laughed.</p><p>\u201cWait.\u201d She froze. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a hairy back, do you?\u201d</p><p>What was she on about?</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he managed. \u201cNot that I know of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh good. \u2019Cause that\u2019s a deal breaker. Though it\u2019d be a shame to have come all this way . . .\u201d She giggled.</p><p>\u201cSo anyway, I\u2019d really thought it would be my thing. Massage, I mean. Livvie, my Aunt Livia, that is, used to . . .\u201d</p><p>She sighed wistfully. The sudden sadness in her voice had him cracking open an eyelid to watch her. Felicity\u2019s lively brown eyes were suddenly quiet. He studied her hand on his leg and fought the urge to take it in his.</p><p>\u201cMy parents died in a car accident. I was just a little kid, but . . . I was in the car with them.\u201d She grew utterly silent, her uncharacteristic stillness jarring.</p><p>\u201cYou probably don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d she finally said. She sighed, resuming a slow, stroking motion along the side of his thigh. \u201cA car . . . It\u2019s like a really fast carriage. But with no horses attached.\u201d</p><p>She worked silently then, seeming to collect her thoughts.</p><p>Rollo watched her, and wondered at the foreign emotion that stabbed his chest. The poor lass, baring her thoughts for all and sundry. And yet, in that instant, he couldn\u2019t fathom what she might be thinking.</p><p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d she said finally, \u201cI was hurt. My back. It was bad, for such a little kid.\u201d</p><p>She paused, using the opportunity to dig her fingertips in deep. \u201cI guess we have that in common, huh? Getting hurt at such a young age. But I had Livvie to massage my back every night.\u201d</p><p>She slowly released the pressure and it was like a torrent of blood was released, rushing through his leg, up his spine, to the base of his neck, making him light-headed.</p><p>Groaning, he let his head fall back, savoring the feel of tendons and fibers that had long been in iron knots relaxing for what felt like the first time. Even his chest felt as if it were opening, his breathing somehow freer, his neck, his jaw, all somehow eased.</p><p>\u201cGood, huh?\u201d She smiled at him, then looked back at his leg. His left had been snapped in two, but it was his right that had been utterly smashed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that this wasn\u2019t set right. I had to have a back brace myself, for a while. But it was the feel of Livvie\u2019s hands on me every night. That\u2019s what really saved me. So, I thought, maybe massage. But, no. All those hairy backs.\u201d She gave a quiet, sad laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t really seem to find my thing. But I will,\u201d she finished, sounding an upbeat note.</p><p>All that talking had eased her, and she became immersed in the muscles around his right knee, finding knots, digging, stroking.</p><p>Rollo let himself grow easy too, shutting his eyes, savoring the feel of a pair of deft hands working his body.</p><p>It was entirely inappropriate, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to make her stop. He hadn\u2019t felt this good since before the accident. How did she manage it with just a single touch?</p><p>And if she was capable of making him feel so good with a mere hand on his leg\u2014?</p><p>The thought sent a bolt of heat straight to his groin.</p><p>His eyes flew open, and his first sight was Felicity doggedly massaging his calf between two hands. Deep in thought, she licked and bit at her lower lip.</p><p>He felt himself growing hard, and harder still. His eyes flew from her mouth.</p><p>But they landed on her chest. She\u2019d had to lean down, and her dress was tugged dangerously low, her breasts rising and falling with her efforts.</p><p>Losh, but was she trying to pull herself out of that thing?</p><p>He tried to move away, and must have made some sound, but the effect was the opposite of what he\u2019d intended.</p><p>\u201cOh gosh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, placing her palm flat on his thigh.</p><p>Move the hand. Move the hand.</p><p>\u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>He tried to answer but couldn\u2019t, and she began rubbing slowly again. \u201cSorry, I\u2019ll go lighter. I found a good spot\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her hands grew still.</p><p>Surely she didn\u2019t realize how hard she was making him. Curse his body.</p><p>At least he knew one aspect of his physique that was in strong, working order. All the good that did.</p><p>Of course . . . he could touch her.</p><p>She seemed determined that they were meant for each other. He had only to reach out. Touch back. Her thigh\u2014would it be soft or firm beneath his fingertips?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough lass,\u201d he croaked.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She sat back. \u201cEnough, yes, of course.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his eyes shut tight. A woman like her would want a man whole. A man to sweep her into his arms and climb stairs. Climb mountains.</p><p>Not an object of pity. For one day she would pity him. Something, somehow would come to pass, and she\u2019d offer him that look he knew so well. He didn\u2019t think he could bear to see that look, clouding the open joy that was her lovely face.</p><p>His realm would forever be one of battles and kings. Not secreted moments in dark carriages.</p><p>What she would do next, he had no idea. Rollo could only sit back, shut his eyes tight, and damn his body. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She wasn\u2019t a fairy princess. She was the devil\u2019s own.</p><p>Felicity. What a name. Joyously damning him to a hell of soothing touches and creamy skin that would be forever out of his reach.</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>\u201cCool!\u201d Felicity said, walking off the day\u2019s ride by stamping her feet and stretching her legs. She was trying her best to be cheery, even though she was sore, dirty, and hungry. And Will hadn\u2019t even kissed her once.</p> <p>Travel by carriage had become impossible. They\u2019d switched to horses just north of Stirling, and now she didn\u2019t even get to sit next to him anymore.</p><p>But, she was keeping it together. She\u2019d muster a bright outlook, and soon he\u2019d realize they were destined for each other.</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d she said, looking around her. The sun had shone brightly all day, igniting the lush countryside to glowing greens, reds, and yellows. \u201cScotland is sooo gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>Hills rose like a promise on the horizon. The Highlands, Will had told her, with glens and heather and, she was certain, a goodly number of tartan-clad men too. Though she\u2019d be surprised if any of them were as grimly sexy as her Viking.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait til we\u2019re in the hills.\u201d She shaded her eyes and looked into the distance. \u201cBut, wait, what about moors? There are moors here too, right? I mean, what exactly is a moor, anyway? Gosh, it all sounds so Wuthering Heights,\u201d she added in a murmur. \u201cAnd you mentioned thistle. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever even seen thistle. Does it smell good?\u201d</p> <p>Her question was met with silence.</p><p>They\u2019d been traveling for weeks. Mostly, the weather was gloomy and the food was gross, but through it all, Felicity had remained what she thought was quite the chipper and easygoing travel companion. And still, he barely even spoke to her.</p><p>\u201cAnd all these lakes, or what do you call them, lochs?\u201d She studied his back, willing him to chat. She wasn\u2019t used to so much quiet. Back home there was always some sort of ambient noise\u2014cars, distant sirens, the neighbor\u2019s television\u2014even at night. And besides, she could usually get a person to talk. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to such a silent companion. \u201cAll these lochs are so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he said, the sound drawn out like a hiss in the back of his throat, \u201cplease, lass.\u201d Will gestured with his free hand for her to be quiet. \u201cI\u2019m trying to catch our dinner.\u201d</p><p>Rollo sat in the grass, and Felicity stilled, watching in fascination as he gently tugged and spun clumps of found sheep\u2019s wool into string, fashioning a small noose.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth\u2014?\u201d She clapped a hand to her mouth. \u201cOops, sorry!\u201d she whispered, her chirpiness untouched by his mood.</p> <p>This would be their first night sleeping outside, and she wasn\u2019t sure if the elation she felt was due more to the prospect of camping in old Scotland or to the fact that they were going to be spending the night not separated by the walls of an inn.</p><p>Maybe beside a romantic fire. With him snuggling her close for warmth.</p><p>If only she felt cuter.</p><p>\u201cGod I wish I had a brush.\u201d For what felt like the millionth time that day, she wound her hair into a thick rope, twisting and knotting it into a bun. \u201cHow do women deal with their hair here? Hey,\u201d she exclaimed suddenly, \u201ccould you rig some of that wool into a hair band for me?\u201d</p><p>He shot her a glare over his shoulder and she shrugged, giving him a smile in return. Will couldn\u2019t step on her buzz. He\u2019d changed into a kilt when they\u2019d switched to horseback, and she just about thought she\u2019d pass out from the now constant hum in her girl parts. A man in a kilt\u2014who knew?</p><p>Her eyes were continually drawn like a magnet to bits of his exposed calf and knee. Once they\u2019d dismounted, she kept finding excuses to walk behind him. At one point, a renegade gust of wind had almost blown the thing up, and she was desperate to see what he had on under there.</p><p>She was also eager to see what sort of shape his legs were really in. It appeared his left one had healed relatively straight, but his right bowed at an angle that made her heart pang at the thought of the boy he\u2019d been when he\u2019d suffered so.</p><p>She watched him work, trying to remain quiet, but couldn\u2019t bear it. She asked in a loud whisper, \u201cWhat on earth is that little noose thing for?\u201d</p> <p>A dark cloud skittered across his brow.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI\u2019ll shut up for real. Promise.\u201d</p><p>Despite the million questions rattling around in her mind, she forced herself to silence. But it didn\u2019t mean she\u2019d budge from the spot, and she alternately studied him and gazed at the gorgeous panorama awaiting them.</p><p>She felt his stillness and glanced to find he was watching her. They locked gazes for a curious moment.</p><p>\u201cSee the wee den,\u201d he said finally, his voice a low rasp. He pointed to a small rise roughly twenty feet away. \u201cJust there.\u201d</p><p>She squinted her eyes, but it all looked like brush and ragged grass to her. \u201cI don\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wee hole. Just there, lass.\u201d He pointed again. His exasperation of the past weeks had mellowed to something sounding like resignation. Felicity thought it was a promising development.</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t see it.\u201d She stood to get a closer look. \u201cWhat\u2019s in there, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRabbit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, you\u2019re going to catch a little bunny?\u201d He\u2019d risen, and she joined him on his approach to the den.</p><p>\u201cYour other option is black pudding.\u201d He stopped by the side of a shallow grassy rise, and sure enough, a small shadowy hole spoke to an animal living within.</p><p>\u201cOoh\u201d\u2014she put her hand on his arm to stop him\u2014\u201cpudding sounds much better.\u201d She was hungry, but that tiny noose was just too grim. \u201cBut how can you even make that here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlack pudding? I\u2019d find a cow . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do with some dairy,\u201d she said optimistically.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d make a cut at the shoulder, bleed just enough from the animal to mix with a spot of our oats\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that is disgusting.\u201d She stopped him with a raised hand. \u201cI wanted alpha male, but not that alpha.\u201d She shook her head, then gestured to a patch of loch glittering in the distance. \u201cSurely with all these lakes you could just catch us a fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is much faster. And besides, you could use the meat. I could use the meat. We\u2019ve long days ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d She was starving. \u201cYou\u2019ll cook it though, right?\u201d</p><p>He gave an exasperated grunt in response and leaned down by the rabbit den. He grabbed hold of a branch from some nearby gorse, and then pulled a dagger from his sock to slice it free.</p><p>\u201cOhmygod,\u201d she gasped. \u201cThat is too hot. What else are you hiding in those socks, Will?\u201d</p><p>Though silent, he turned a satisfying shade of beet red.</p><p>\u201cWilliam Rollo, you\u2019re blushing.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, he jammed the small stick just above the hole and began to wind the end of the noose around it.</p><p>\u201cThat thing is hideous. Like something from some little bunny horror movie.\u201d She eyed the elaborate pistol holstered at his waist. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just shoot one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not partial to the taste of iron in my meat. In any case, bullets are a hard-won commodity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah . . .\u201d She grew momentarily thoughtful. \u201cWhere do you get bullets, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMetal,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cDuh. But where do you get the metal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, woman, do you ever give up?\u201d Impatiently, he wound the string around once more, setting his trap. \u201cMen melt it. Now let\u2019s away from here, and pray for some roast meat for supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take a walk?\u201d she asked at his back. Preferably someplace very windy, she thought, eyeing the sway of his kilt along his thighs.</p><p>\u201cA . . .\u201d He stopped in his tracks, staring at her in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019ve been riding all day and now you\u2019d like to walk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest. She hadn\u2019t really really wanted to, but now she was just feeling contrary.</p><p>\u201cWalk where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Around.\u201d She panicked suddenly, realizing that, with his legs, the last thing he\u2019d want to do after a day of hard riding was walk. \u201cMaybe we could find something to go with the bunny.\u201d</p><p>Felicity was a whiz in the kitchen, and made a wicked good stew. Men loved it. They always loved her cooking.</p><p>There had even been a time she\u2019d dreamt of working in a restaurant, and had taken a bunch of cooking classes. She ended up scoring a plum job as a chef\u2019s assistant, but her first night on the job had shocked her into reality. Everyone shouted at each other, cursing and jostling around in what felt like a thousand-degree kitchen. It\u2019d been enough restaurant work for a lifetime.</p><p>But a simple rabbit stew? She could definitely swing a decent rabbit stew. She just needed to find the right herbs. Then Will would see how clever she was. That she could take good care of him.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be something green around here that we can eat,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m dying to actually crunch into something fresh.\u201d</p><p>She gave him an encouraging smile.</p><p>\u201cOch.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cA walk. Aye, walk on, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to be so grumpy about it,\u201d she mumbled under her breath.</p><p>Rollo pointed out a juniper bush, assuring her that the dark berries were edible, and with a whack of his cane, sent a shower of berries raining down.</p><p>\u201cBut we need something else,\u201d she mused, walking slowly along the old drover\u2019s path. \u201cHow about this?\u201d Felicity knelt by a thick, weedy clump of foliage. \u201cI keep seeing it. It looks like it could be . . . I don\u2019t know, mint or something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord no, lass. Those are nettles. Don\u2019t even think about\u2014\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know why she did it, all she knew was that the draw was irresistible. Her hand was out and gripping the nettle leaves before she knew what she was doing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOw!\u201d There was a moment of tingling, then a sharp sting flushed over her palm and fingertips. \u201cOw ow ow.\u201d She shook it out hard, but that didn\u2019t stop the burning, or the tiny red welts that bloomed sudden and complete on her hand.</p><p>\u201cThat was a fool thing to do.\u201d His voice cut her, and Felicity didn\u2019t know which stung more, the nettles, or the fact that his sharp words probably constituted the most he\u2019d said to her for some time.</p><p>\u201cWhatever. It\u2019s no big deal.\u201d She wanted to shoot him a defiant glare, but felt her chin begin to quiver, and so turned her back on him instead.</p> <p>Her hand was killing her, but she wasn\u2019t about to let him see that. \u201cLet\u2019s just see if you\u2019ve successfully murdered little Bugs or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, lass\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name\u2019s not lass,\u201d she snapped. Felicity heard him rustling at her back, but she refused to turn and look at him. She\u2019d not be able to bear it if his face was as cold as his words had been. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, lad, I dig the ochs and ayes and all that. But I haven\u2019t heard you say my name once. Do you even remember my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicity.\u201d His voice was taut, the single word containing an apology, a scold, a plea. \u201cOf course I know your name. It\u2019s a beautiful name. It suits you,\u201d he added quietly. \u201cTurn around, Felicity. Please.\u201d</p><p>Drawing her features into a careful blank, she turned.</p> <p>He stood there, the sharpness of his gaze blunted into something approaching tenderness. Rollo stretched out his hands, and she saw he\u2019d filled them with fistfuls of oblong green leaves.</p><p>She looked up at him, a question in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDock leaves, las\u2014\u201d He crooked the corner of his mouth into a gentle half smile, and she felt suddenly warmed deep down. \u201cA docken plant, Felicity. For your hand.\u201d</p><p>He stepped carefully toward her, crushing the coarse leaves between his fingers. He reached for her, took her hand, and it was as if an electric shock arced between them. He drew a sharp breath in between his lips, and she swore he\u2019d felt it too.</p><p>He rubbed her palm and fingers with the weed, and, mesmerized, she watched the play of bones and tendons under the skin of his hands. They were broad and masculine, just a little dirty, but not coarse, and she was desperate to feel them on her.</p><p>As he rubbed, she tried to imagine whether his touch would be rough or gentle. Would he grab her and claim her, or stroke lightly, teasing her?</p> <p>She could just squeeze his hand, she thought. Right then and there, just squeeze it. Maybe give a quick, saucy little rub of her thumb on his palm. Would he glance up, look longingly into her eyes? Kiss her like he almost did in the dress shop?</p><p>Or, what would he do if she just tackled him? Simply grabbed the man and kissed him. She could jump him and they could roll to the ground in a passionate embrace. Unless, of course, they landed in that evil mint stuff. All that stinging would put a damper on things.</p><p>The stinging. She realized the sting on her palm had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWow . . .\u201d Smiling, she looked up at him. But his eyes were shuttered once again. Feeling herself deflate, she pulled away and thanked him quietly.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said suddenly.</p><p>She glowered. This time she knew she hadn\u2019t said anything.</p><p>A brisk shake of his head and a firm grip on her arm alerted her that something was wrong. He leaned down, taking his cane where he\u2019d laid it on the ground at their feet. He held her gaze as he listened carefully.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she mouthed, and then she heard it. The distant sound of men singing. A kick of fear hammered her heart against her chest.</p> <p>Though Rollo\u2019s face was calm, Felicity sensed the shift in his posture. Tensed, poised, like a wary wolf measuring approaching intruders.</p><p>He looked from her, to the thick tangle of birch and alder that had shadowed their path, and then back again. He gave her a quick nod and, holding her arm, led her with surprising stealth into the woods.</p><p>Her breath was loud in her ears, but she felt unable to calm herself. His steady hand on her was the only thing keeping her focused.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, she told herself. She knew she was being as quiet as possible. I am the only one who can hear my heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cWe must get back to the horses.\u201d His whisper at her ear startled her.</p><p>Trembling now, she mustered a nod, straining to hear where the men might be, how many there were. What would they do if they found them?</p><p>The woods seemed suddenly loud around her. The rustle of leaves as birds flitted from branch to branch. The tinkling sound of a faraway stream.</p><p>A trick of the trees sent another sound bursting to them, abrupt and close. It was the men, shouting, singing, laughing. Her legs froze.</p><p>She felt Will\u2019s hand graze the small of her back. It was warm, and she realized how fear had made her skin clammy.</p><p>\u201cBe easy, Felicity.\u201d He gave her waist a squeeze. He gestured to a break in the trees, carefully guiding them to where he\u2019d tied the horses for grazing. \u201cEasy, lass.\u201d</p><p>There it was again: the \u201class\u201d thing. He caught it too and shot her a shrug and a half smile, a flash of humor to gird her. And she thought this man could call her whatever he wanted, as long as he kept doling out those rare glimpses of warmth.</p><p>The men\u2019s voices were closing in, and the sound echoed strangely underneath the canopy of trees.</p><p>\u201cNow.\u201d Gripping her waist tight, he pulled her across the final yards. His right leg swung in a stiff jog.</p><p>A thick carpet of bracken slowed their progress, much of the fern reddened into the color of late summer. The rustle was unbearably loud, and she sensed a change in the approaching men.</p><p>Will and Felicity hurtled from the trees. The contrast between the oppressive copse and the wide-open air was dramatic, and she gulped in a lungful of fresh oxygen.</p><p>The horses were oblivious to the threat, and greeted them with vacant eyes, chomping on grass with docile focus.</p><p>Will had his hands on her from behind, and she shivered at the feel of him, powerful at her back, sweeping her up and onto the saddle in a single, fluid motion.</p><p>He was on his own horse in an instant, cane tucked between thigh and saddle, urging the animals back and away down the drover path.</p><p>\u201cHo there!\u201d a voice called from behind. Rollo glanced back, and the grim look crossing his face made her afraid to turn around.</p><p>Will wore a dirk belted at his side, and he pulled it free, slapping the flat of the blade on her horse\u2019s rump, sending it careening from him.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d she shrieked, yanking hard on the reins, trying to slow the animal down. In the back of her mind, Felicity knew she needed to get out of there, but terror muddled her. She knew only Rollo, and wanted to stay by his side.</p><p>\u201cOh my God, oh my God,\u201d she chanted, her voice hitching, breathy and frantic. Her horse reeled and spun to an uneasy stop, and she watched the scene unfold. Three men on three burly ponies stood there, surrounding him. \u201cWill, watch out!\u201d</p><p>He resheathed his dirk, and she screamed again, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>The cane was in his hand. He tossed it up, catching it by the base. Standing high in the saddle, he cantered past the knot of men and swung, whacking one sharply on his temple with the cane\u2019s silver handle.</p><p>A hollow noise like a golf club clocking a ball resonated to her, a grotesque sound that sent a peculiar, animal shot of elation through Felicity\u2019s veins. The man slid to the ground, his mount turning and making a wild-eyed dash into the woods.</p><p>She caught the quick, nervous glance shared by the two remaining men. Will, however, was methodical. He appeared to think nothing of the two beyond what he\u2019d sized up, and his face was utterly still as he set to dispatching them as neatly as a farmer would till a field.</p><p>Not waiting for either of his enemies to strike first, Rollo slid the cane through his grip and, kicking his horse into an abrupt gallop, closed the short distance between him and the closest man. Gripping the silver handle, he jousted the man in the throat. The man toppled backwards, and the horse skittered away, its rider hanging limp from the side of the saddle.</p><p>\u201cHup, hup,\u201d was all she heard Will say as he reeled his horse about in a tight circle. The animal gave a single, brisk toss of its head, but was otherwise still.</p><p>The sight astounded her. This creature that had seemed just minutes before like a normal, perhaps slightly worse-for-wear horse, was now fit for a dressage arena.</p><p>One man remained, and, thumping his legs hard at his horse\u2019s belly, he charged Will, a broadsword swinging wildly before him.</p><p>\u201cWatch out!\u201d she shrieked again, but Rollo was cool, and merely ducked, his hair wild from the near miss.</p><p>Using only his seat, Will spun his horse once more. He tucked the cane back under his thigh, swapping it for his dirk, which he had out and ready.</p><p>The men charged each other, and Felicity\u2019s heart slammed hard against her chest. There was no way Will\u2019s short dagger could be a match for the long blade of his opponent.</p><p>Rollo was like stone in the saddle, standing slightly in the stirrups, utterly calm. The other man whooped, riding hard for him. A black grin bisected the man\u2019s face, thinking he had the advantage. Felicity heard her own hollow screeching as if from a distance.</p><p>She saw Will shift ever so slightly. His left calf twitched, left foot cocking out at a sharp angle. And she gasped as Rollo\u2019s horse danced one, two, three perfect steps to the side. An elegant little prance, and Will was to the man\u2019s left.</p><p>He\u2019d switched the dirk to his opposite hand, and leaning in, easily sliced the man\u2019s neck as he galloped past.</p><p>Felicity\u2019s cheer stuck in her throat. Sensing a body near, she looked down to see an ugly man staring back up at her. It was shocking, and surreal, this gap-toothed face gazing hungrily up at her.</p><p>He came to her as a vivid snapshot, his close-cropped hair a faint yellow dusting on the top of his head, thick beige clinging in his smile, as if he\u2019d not sucked all the bread from his teeth. And he held her reins in his hand.</p><p>\u201cWill?\u201d His name was a tremulous question in her throat, swallowed at once by the clamor of hooves galloping toward her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her horse shied from Rollo\u2019s approach. Though the man\u2019s hand slid down the leather straps, he continued to hold them tight.</p><p>It happened in an instant, in a patchwork of impressions. Her horse dancing nervously beneath her. The dramatic whoosh of Rollo\u2019s advance.</p><p>His horse stopped short and sure, rearing up and landing with a hideous crash onto the man\u2019s head and body. His fall was hard and complete, his tenacious grip tugging Felicity\u2019s reins down with him, giving a sharp yank to her horse\u2019s head before his fingers finally slipped from the leather.</p><p>She trembled in shock, staring at the man lying still at her feet. Blood soaked his brow and one arm canted at an unnatural angle from his shoulder.</p> <p>He flinched to life and Felicity screamed.</p><p>She sensed Rollo\u2019s movement at the corner of her eye. His horse hovered close to hers now, as if he could shield her from danger by his proximity alone. She felt rather than saw the sweep of his arm, and shuddered a sob to see the small dagger from Will\u2019s sock now quivering in the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>Fighting hysteria, she made a shrill giggling sound, half sob, half laugh. \u201cTalk about going for the throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all? Aye?\u201d Do the yoga breathing. \u201cGood Lord, but I\u2019m not in Kansas anymore.\u201d</p> <p>She stared at him, sitting composed and grimly handsome on his horse. He wore the edge of his plaid swept up and over his shoulder\u2014the wool was green and yellow, blue and black, and it flapped dully in the breeze.</p><p>\u201cHe just kills four men, neat as you please, and all I get\u2019s an aye,\u201d she muttered, feeling herself calming.</p><p>Her eyes roved his face unabashedly. He\u2019d gotten a shave in Stirling, and stubble had already reappeared, a brown shadow along his strong jaw. His wavy hair had been tousled from his efforts, but he\u2019d already raked it impatiently back in place.</p><p>\u201cI mean, come on. No jaunty comebacks, like, \u2018I\u2019ll bet he found that one hard to swallow?\u2019 Or, maybe something about him clearing that from his throat.\u201d She shuddered a sigh, her breathing finally even. \u201cWho were those guys anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know not. Nor will we wait to find out.\u201d His eyes scanned her, making certain she was settled.</p><p>Just that flicker of contact had her body crackling, and her mind agitated at such a silly response. She thumped her heels on her horse\u2019s belly, nudging the beast into a walk.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll want to turn your horse about.\u201d She felt herself flush a hot shade of red. She and dignity didn\u2019t seem to be fast friends these days.</p><p>\u201cThat means it\u2019s black pudding for me tonight, huh?\u201d she asked, struggling to turn her mount on the ragged drover\u2019s path.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he replied, his horse already ahead of hers. \u201cBut you\u2019ll find the proof of the pudding is in the eating.\u201d</p><p>And this time she could\u2019ve sworn she heard a smile in his voice.</p><p>Will flinched and tossed on the bed of heather. It molded to him, easing his body, yet his eyelids still fluttered with renegade dreams.</p><p>Running. The sand was packed hard and cool at his feet and it kicked up, sounding a raspy chuff with each step.</p><p>His arms pumped, his legs stretched and flexed, pounding out a powerful gait along the sand. The wind tasted chilled and briny in his mouth. He smiled with the joy of it.</p><p>And then she was there, standing on the horizon.</p> <p>She wore a dress of gauzy white, and it fluttered around her legs and clung tight at her breasts. If only he could get a little closer, he\u2019d be able to see her body through the gossamer fabric. See the rise of her breasts, the slope of her thigh.</p><p>He ran to her, calling her name. Felicity.</p><p>Her yellow hair whipped behind her in the breeze, and he wondered why she didn\u2019t turn to him. The water was at her knees now, yet still she stood, unmoving, waiting and watching for something on the horizon.</p><p>The joy in his heart flicked into panic. She needed to step back, step away from the water\u2019s edge. Why would she not turn to him?</p><p>He ran harder, and yet he couldn\u2019t close the gap between them. The water rose higher, to her waist now, and he saw her stumble in its pull.</p><p>His arms pumped harder. Legs that never failed him in his dreams felt stiff, his joints popping and tendons cracking. He couldn\u2019t reach her. He tried to call to her, but could make no sound.</p><p>Felicity turned, finally. Finally, she caught and held his gaze. Ever so slowly and without a splash, she disappeared beneath the surface of the waves.</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>He\u2019d been sensing trouble for days, and by the time the sun crested the sky, Will knew they had a problem.</p><p>Once again the horse swung his head back to nip at his flanks. \u201cEasy, lad,\u201d he soothed, leaning forward in the saddle to stroke at the animal\u2019s neck. The creature had grown increasingly agitated throughout the morning, and now the nipping and grunting had become constant.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for it,\u201d he grumbled, pulling to a halt.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Felicity looked at him, perplexed. \u201cWhy are you stopping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve a problem with the horse.\u201d He scanned the horizon and pointed to a stand of trees in the distance. \u201cWe\u2019ll rest there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we just ate lunch.\u201d The air was brisk, but the noon-day sun glared hazy and bright, and she shaded her eyes to look at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the horse?\u201d</p><p>Will tried to ignore the way the light picked white and golden highlights in her long, blonde hair. Pulling his eyes from her, he swung his leg over to dismount. \u201cColic, lass. The horse has colic, and he\u2019ll be horsemeat if I don\u2019t tend to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just thought he was a cranky old guy.\u201d She got down, and keeping hold of her reins, reached over to pat at Will\u2019s horse. The animal swung his head to bite at her, and Felicity squealed.</p><p>\u201cEasy,\u201d he said quickly. He pulled Felicity close, putting himself between her and the animal. \u201cYou\u2019ll do no good for the horse. Or for yourself. A horse in pain can be a dangerous thing.\u201d</p><p>She edged further from Will\u2019s horse as they walked, and he watched as she cut nervous sidelong glances their way. He hoped she\u2019d be all right. There was no choice, though. It was imperative Will find healing herbs, and he\u2019d need to leave Felicity behind to mind the animal.</p><p>Despite the saddle on its back, the horse dropped to a roll the moment they stopped to rest by the trees. \u201cOch, lad,\u201d Will snapped. \u201cUp. Up, up.\u201d With a quick swat to its rump, he urged the animal back to standing and handed the reins to Felicity. \u201cYou\u2019ll need to keep him walking. Don\u2019t let him roll.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed in concern. \u201cBut rolling looks like it feels so good.\u201d</p><p>She was so guileless and sweet, and Will quickly shoved such thoughts from his mind. \u201cHe\u2019ll twist his gut,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cIt could kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Jeez. That\u2019s horrible. Wait,\u201d she said suddenly, trying to hand the reins back. \u201cI can\u2019t hold him. What if he bites me? You said he could be dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust keep him moving,\u201d he said, taking the healthier of the two horses from her. \u201cWalk him a quarter hour every hour. I\u2019ll take off the saddle, and you can lead the poor lad by the reins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean walk him?\u201d She looked at the animal as if he were infected with cholera, not colic. \u201cWhere will you be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, woman.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t use your soothe-y horse-y voice with me. Where are you going? You can\u2019t just leave me with a huge, sick animal. What if he dies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t if I leave now.\u201d Will gave her what he hoped was an encouraging nod. He knew Felicity was nervous. And well she should be. But they needed their mounts, and the animal would die without immediate care. \u201cHe won\u2019t get well on his own. I promise to return soon. I\u2019ll need to gather mint,\u201d he thought aloud, \u201cvalerian if I can find it. We passed a wee marsh late yesterday. I\u2019m going to double back. See what I can find.\u201d</p><p>She held the reins away from her body, arm outstretched rigidly. \u201cBut . . . You . . . What if . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, calm yourself, and the beast will calm too.\u201d He smiled. \u201cRelax, and he\u2019ll not hurt you. It\u2019s men I fear more than any animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh great.\u201d The horse looked as if he might roll again, and she hopped into a hasty walk. \u201cThat makes me feel so much better,\u201d she said over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll return as soon as I can.\u201d</p><p>As soon as he could was well after dark. She\u2019d spent the first hour terrified that the animal would rear up and trample her like she\u2019d seen him do when Will was in the saddle. The rest of the time she\u2019d worried that snaggle- toothed, sword-wielding men might pop out of the woods at any moment.</p><p>The nighttime sky was overcast, and had darkened into a uniform gray-black overhead. Being alone, in the eerily quiet night, with an enormous, sick horse had her filling the silence with an anxious monologue. About the horse, about his belly, about how Will would be back at any moment. But as she walked, her nervous chatter became low coos, and quick pats slowed into lingering strokes, until she was at ease, and the horse seemed so too.</p><p>She walked the animal in a close circle along the fringe of trees, worried that they\u2019d trip in the shadows. The night was bitter cold, and though the walking kept the chill from her bones, it did nothing to alleviate the very urgent needs of her body.</p><p>\u201cFelicity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d she said, hearing Will\u2019s voice calling low. \u201cWe\u2019re still here. Please hurry, I really need to . . . you know . . . go.\u201d</p><p>He laughed quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll be but a moment.\u201d</p><p>Will rustled in the dark, a tapestry of sounds floating to her on the crisp air. His low murmurs to her mare, the dull smack of a hand patting solid horseflesh. Stillness, and then the nascent crackle and pop of a fire.</p><p>He materialized from the shadows, tall and silent, and she gave a start.</p><p>\u201cHere, lass,\u201d he said, tucking something in her hair. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The feel of his fingers tracing along her scalp made her breath catch. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMint. They say it keeps the midges away.\u201d</p><p>She fingered the sprig in her hair, limp and softly fuzzy. Will could be so disarmingly thoughtful. She smiled up at him. Just a silly bit of mint, and yet her impulse was to press it in a book.</p> <p>He cleared his throat. \u201cHow\u2019s the lad?\u201d he asked, taking the reins from her. He ran a hand down the flat plane of the horse\u2019s cheek.</p><p>\u201cOkay, I think.\u201d She leaned over to stretch her legs. \u201cI\u2019m beat though. Do you mind if I\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course,\u201d he said quickly, with a nod to the trees.</p><p>She ducked away to relieve herself, and when she came back, the horse was lying down with Will seated by his side. The animal grunted and nipped once at the air, then rested his head in the dirt.</p><p>\u201cI thought he wasn\u2019t supposed to roll,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAye, rolling is bad. But rest is a fine thing. Come.\u201d He gestured to the ground. \u201cYou could use a spot of it yourself. Come bide a wee by the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to sit by the fire,\u201d she said, plopping down next to him. Just that little bit of physical relief, combined with the promise of heat and maybe even a drink of water, had her nearly giddy with pleasure. \u201cNow if only we had s\u2019mores.\u201d</p><p>He met her eyes, confusion flickering on his brow, and she felt a little thrill when their gazes caught. The flames popped and crackled, casting an orange glow along one side of his face. The light danced in his eyes, and far from feeling chilled now, she thought she might melt there on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have much, but I do have water with herbs on to boil. We\u2019ll see if we can get some into him, and mayhap we can spare some for you too,\u201d Will told her, offering a rare smile.</p><p>\u201cHow is he? Can I . . .\u201d She reached a hesitant hand to the horse. \u201cCan I pet him? Would that be all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will had replaced the bridle with a halter, and he offered her the length of rope. \u201c \u2019Twould be a fine thing,\u201d he told her, urging her to take hold of the animal.</p> <p>The horse chuffed and flinched, making as if to roll, and Felicity scooted closer, instinctively guiding his head into her lap. She smoothed the wiry forelock from his eyes, and to her surprise, the horse eased.</p><p>\u201cThe beast has taken to you.\u201d Will used his cane to pull a small pot from over the fire. There was a hiss as hot water sizzled along cast iron, and the sharp smell of mint tingled pleasantly in her sinuses. \u201cYou did well today. Despite your worries.\u201d</p><p>It was modest, as compliments went, but still she swelled with pride. The horse did seem soothed, she thought, stroking her palm down his sleek neck. \u201cThanks. I never realized how nice horses were. I\u2019m such a city girl. Before all this\u201d\u2014she gestured around her\u2014\u201cthe closest I\u2019d ever gotten to a horse was when my Aunt Livvie took me to the racetrack for my eighteenth birthday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut surely you\u2019d ridden before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Never.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s remarkable,\u201d he said, astounded. \u201cYou got on a saddle without a word, never having ridden before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Wait,\u201d she amended quickly. \u201cScratch that. I went on a pony ride when I was a kid, but\u2014\u201d She stopped herself, remembering Will\u2019s horrific tale of his childhood accident. \u201cOh, God, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know . . . the pony thing.\u201d</p><p>To her surprise, he gave a low laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t fash yourself, lass. I remember the pony thing daily. It\u2019s not as though your words remind me of something I don\u2019t already know.\u201d</p><p>She stroked the horse\u2019s neck. It was pure power, silky and muscular under her fingertips. Will watched her, and she felt oddly shy, unable to meet his eyes. She hoped she was petting the animal correctly.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said finally. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable how the beast has taken to you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cMaybe horses are my thing, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour . . . thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She sighed. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you? I\u2019ve tried it all. But I\u2019ve never managed to find my calling. Lots of things interest me, but nothing has ever really sparked my passion.\u201d</p><p>He was quiet for a moment, and just when she began to worry that her last sentence was somehow inappropriate, he spoke. \u201cI believe horses are my calling. I can\u2019t imagine never having ridden. Horses are the one thing in my life I can rely on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your family? Surely you can rely on them.\u201d</p><p>Will stiffened. \u201cI suppose you could say their behavior is . . . reliably predictable. But I\u2019ve found horses are really the only dependable thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad,\u201d she said at once. This was possibly the most Will had ever opened up to her, and Felicity wanted to press him, explore every little aspect of what he said to her.</p><p>\u201cNot sad,\u201d he told her with cool finality. \u201cIt simply is.\u201d</p><p>So much for sharing.</p><p>\u201cWhat is colic, anyway?\u201d she asked after an extended silence.</p><p>\u201cIt might be a number of things. Something could be blocked. His belly,\u201d he said, running his palm along the horse\u2019s stomach, \u201cfeel how it\u2019s warm.\u201d</p><p>She brought her hand next to his. The horse\u2019s stomach felt hot, distended. Felicity felt the heat of Will\u2019s arm, so close to hers. Her gaze went to his fingers, long and strong in the firelight. Concern for the animal warred with the sudden and complete awareness of Will, in such close proximity.</p><p>\u201cIt could be as simple as gas, or as dire as a twist in his gut. Either way, the beast needs water.\u201d Will rose. Taking the rope from her, he pulled the horse to standing. \u201cCome now, laddie,\u201d he said in a low voice. \u201cLet\u2019s have a wee drink, shall we?\u201d</p><p>She stood too, using her skirts to pick up the pot. The water had cooled quickly in the night air, and Rollo took it from her with his bare hands.</p><p>He held it to the horse\u2019s mouth, but the animal merely lipped it, not drinking. Will grunted.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in the water?\u201d</p><p>\u201cValerian, to relax the gut. Mint too. If he doesn\u2019t work it out, the colic will be the death of him.\u201d He pulled the horse into a walk. \u201cYou should rest, Felicity. I\u2019ve a long night ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sleep.\u201d She fell into step on the other side of the horse, scratching lightly behind his ears. It killed her to see the poor thing in such distress. \u201cAnd I like being able to help.\u201d</p><p>They walked in peaceable silence for some time, then Will asked, \u201cWould you like to assist me, then? With the horses, I mean.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the horse to a halt, and steadied Felicity\u2019s hands as she brought the water once more to the animal\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She let her heart soar over what she knew was probably such a silly thing. \u201cYou\u2019d let me do that? Maybe show me some things?\u201d</p><p>Their eyes met in the dark, and Will was the first to look away.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His answer was clipped, distant once more, and Felicity wondered if she\u2019d even heard him correctly. Will studied the night sky. \u201cThough it\u2019s mostly stablemen who\u2019ll be minding the horses from now on. Winter is in the air, and the beasts need hay for bedding and fresh feed for their bellies.\u201d</p><p>Thoughtful, he stroked the animal\u2019s side. \u201cWe\u2019ve no choice. I fear it shall be inns for us, from now on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 8</p><p>\u201cNot another one,\u201d she grumbled, studying the dingy sign swinging above the inn\u2019s front door. Felicity wondered just how many seedy inns with fleas and rodents and leering men there were between England and wherever it was they were headed in Scotland.</p><p>It had been so nice, that one night\u2019s respite with Will and the horse and the great outdoors. Though they\u2019d walked in silence, his proximity had sent a warm buzzing through her body. She\u2019d felt connected to another person in a way she\u2019d never before experienced.</p><p>She\u2019d also felt genuinely useful for the first time ever. Like she\u2019d been needed, and had been able to help. And she\u2019d loved doing it.</p><p>But the animal had recovered, and Rollo quickly receded back into himself. His retreat stung. Every day that passed left Felicity wondering even more if that night had actually happened, or if it had just been some strange and disjointed dream.</p><p>The Pipe and Tabor Inn. She scowled. \u201cWhat the heck\u2019s a tabor anyhow?\u201d she asked, urging her horse to catch up with Rollo\u2019s.</p><p>She\u2019d thought old Scotland would be a real hoot, but after God knew how many days on horseback and God only knew how many roasted rabbits she was supposed to be grateful for, Felicity thought she might just be ready to pack it all in and head for the nearest spa.</p><p>\u201cOh man, I\u2019d give anything to soak in a great big Jacuzzi tub.\u201d She sighed wistfully. \u201cAnd a shampoo. My hair\u201d\u2014she rubbed vigorously at her scalp\u2014\u201cis driving me insane. I can\u2019t keep it out of my face.\u201d</p><p>She noticed he\u2019d gotten ahead of her. \u201cHey, Will,\u201d she said to his back, kicking her horse into a grudging trot, \u201care there any hot springs around here? There\u2019s got to be something in, like, Italy right about now. I mean, it\u2019s only about a two-hour flight there. How long a ride could it be?\u201d</p><p>She noted him shaking his head. Was that a no or just an annoyed headshake? If it was a no, why couldn\u2019t he just say no? What would it take to get a rise out of the man? Get him to chat, just a little.</p><p>\u201cI mean, it\u2019s Europe,\u201d she continued, \u201cit\u2019s all mushed together here. Or maybe Switzerland,\u201d she mused to herself. \u201cIsn\u2019t there some hot mineral spring thing in Switzerland?\u201d</p><p>She caught up to him just as he was pulling his horse to a halt. They\u2019d walked their mounts around the inn to a barn and paddock area at the back.</p><p>\u201cAt least this getup is easier to ride in. That pink dress was impossible.\u201d She fiddled with her skirts, untangling them from the ridiculous sidesaddle he\u2019d gotten for her. \u201cBut do all seventeenth-century women wear the same dress, day after day after day?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on the road, lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally, he speaks!\u201d</p><p>Rollo glowered at her.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know . . . God this thing itches,\u201d she said suddenly, scratching at the drab blue-gray bodice. \u201cI\u2019m pretty skeptical, Will.\u201d She fought a flicker of despair. \u201cPlease tell me I\u2019m not going to spend the rest of my life in this riding dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called a riding habit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that appropriate.\u201d She unhooked her leg from the saddle and studied the drop to the ground. \u201cSeeing as life in a convent might just be a little more thrilling than watching your back as we ride through the never-ending countryside.\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged, focused instead on scanning the distance, looking, she presumed, for the stableman.</p><p>His nonreaction to her peevish mood was making her even more peevish. She studied him, so in his own world. Could it be Will wasn\u2019t the one? She\u2019d come all the way back in time, just for him, and he hadn\u2019t shown her one bit of emotion. Well, she\u2019d thought there\u2019d been a flicker of something, that night with the horse. But that had been weeks ago, and since then, nada.</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t even tried to kiss her. And really, Felicity thought, what red-blooded man wouldn\u2019t even try? She was cute. She dusted off her skirts. Kind of dirty, but surely cute enough to kiss.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s a tabor? And where the heck are we, anyway?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, looking at her with a cocked brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly that you have a strange way of speaking, lass.\u201d He slid from his custom saddle and began to loosen his horse\u2019s girth and carefully shorten and tuck up the stirrups.</p><p>Watching him, she felt a pang of sympathy. It struck her that what looked like an exercise in great care\u2014readying his horse\u2014was actually an opportunity for Rollo to get his blood flowing once more.</p> <p>\u201cA tabor is a drum,\u201d he said, catching her stare. \u201cFor pipers. And we are in a place called Muirton.\u201d</p><p>The sympathy dissolved and was replaced by peevishness once more. For a man who looked like he was in pain at the end of every day, he sure thought nothing of riding all over the country. How far away did his family live, anyway?</p><p>She frowned at him, just waiting for an excuse to snap. \u201cI hate rabbit, you know,\u201d she said abruptly.</p><p>A rare smile cracked at the edges of Rollo\u2019s mouth. \u201cAnd what has the wee creature done to invoke your wrath?\u201d</p><p>Ignoring his question, she rattled on, \u201cI was even a vegetarian for a while. But I do love my In-N-Out Burgers.\u201d She shivered. \u201cWith special sauce. And fries. Do you know they make their fries fresh? You can even see them chopping up the potatoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should be grateful\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know. Grateful for the food.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI am.\u201d Felicity began to stretch out her legs. \u201cHey,\u201d she added brightly, \u201cdo you think they have any oats here? I could sure use a big bowl of oats. I haven\u2019t had oats in, ohhh, six hours now.\u201d She giggled to herself.</p><p>\u201cYou can be facetious all you like, it won\u2019t make my home materialize any more quickly. Though Duncrub Castle is but a day\u2019s ride away now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you really live in a castle?\u201d Visions of the Disney castle filled her head with turrets and flags and grand balls. She sighed.</p><p>\u201cMore manor house, truly. But generations of Lords Rollo have preferred calling it a castle.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cA man can call a goat a horse, and he\u2019ll still have to walk to market, aye?\u201d He chuckled to himself.</p><p>Oh . . . That sound again. That hesitant, husky laugh. She caught his gaze and felt her insides go all gooey. Surely he knew what he did to her . . . right?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll secure our rooms,\u201d he said, once again hard as granite. He handed her the horses\u2019 reins. \u201cDo not stir from this spot. These mounts would fetch a dear price this far north. It\u2019d be a shame if harm came to them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine too, don\u2019t you worry. Thanks for the concern, though.\u201d</p><p>Was that another smile she caught cracking his features?</p><p>She crossed her heart in her best Girl Scout promise. \u201cNo harm will come to the mounts,\u201d she told him, affecting a deep bass voice.</p><p>Felicity watched Rollo shuffle away, then turned her energy to the horses. \u201cYou appreciate me, don\u2019t you,\u201d she cooed, running her hand down the long, hard plane of her horse\u2019s nose.</p><p>Will\u2019s horse nudged her with his head, and she giggled, patting him hard along the neck. \u201cYou too,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t forget you, laddie. We need to find you two something to munch on.\u201d</p><p>She felt so at ease with the animals, and marveled at how her attitude had shifted so dramatically from fear, to apprehension, to real affection.</p><p>Which wasn\u2019t to say she hadn\u2019t fantasized a million times about riding the rest of the way to Rollo\u2019s in Aunt Livia\u2019s old Volvo.</p><p>Livvie. She sighed.</p><p>Livvie would know she was gone by now. What would she be thinking? Would she have been back to Felicity\u2019s apartment? Had she seen the candle? The cards? What would she make of it all?</p><p>Felicity reached up to scratch the mare\u2019s head, and the animal flicked her ears.</p><p>She knew in her heart of hearts that Livvie would want her to stay. Liv would miss her terribly, sure, but, more than anything, her aunt would want her to have a grand adventure with a man meant for her. Livvie, who\u2019d sent her off to Central America so Felicity could have a \u201cvision quest.\u201d</p><p>She laughed to herself.</p><p>Livvie most of all would tell her to grab hold of Mister Right and hold on tight.</p><p>Now if only there were a way to communicate with her aunt just one more time. Tell her she was safe.</p><p>\u201cSuch a symphony of expressions on such a lovely face.\u201d</p><p>The voice was smooth, a mellow, masculine sound the aural equivalent of velvet.</p><p>Felicity turned to find a face that matched the voice, on a man standing not five feet away, smiling at her.</p><p>\u201cCute,\u201d she whispered under her breath. Was the seventeenth century where all the hotties were hiding?</p><p>Acute self-consciousness swamped her. Did she have to be such a filthy mess? She curled her hands into fists to hide her blackened fingernails.</p><p>\u201cI must know what thoughts whisk you along such a spectrum of emotion.\u201d His smile was broad but polite, he was long and lean without being skinny, and his sandy blond hair shone in modestly cut waves along his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, mustering a big, surprised smile. She knew her teeth were whiter than anything old Scotland offered, and so she\u2019d taken to playing it up in the past weeks.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d he purred.</p><p>\u201cWell . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Maybe she had it all wrong. Could this be Mister Right?</p><p>She gave the thought a second to germinate while she stared openly at the man.</p><p>Nope. She wasn\u2019t feeling it. Wasn\u2019t feeling that crazy zing thing she always felt when Rollo caught her eye. As if every molecule in her body stood to attention in Will\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cAh, I see confusion too.\u201d Beaming, the stranger stepped closer. He was a foot away now, tilting his head this way and that, admiring Felicity\u2019s face. \u201cFirst mirth, then melancholy, and now hmm . . . I dare say we need another m.\u201d</p><p>She froze, feeling a blush creeping all the way to her hairline.</p><p>\u201cMystery,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it. I see such mysterious machinations playing on your bonny mien. Was that too much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhhh . . .\u201d It was nice to be paid attention to, but the dude was trying way too hard.</p><p>\u201cToo many m\u2019s, that is?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wink, and something inside her drooped a little. Will never winked at her. What she wouldn\u2019t do for a wink from Will.</p><p>\u201cBut what am I thinking?\u201d He playfully slapped his brow. \u201cI have been remiss. I must introduce myself.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand into his, lightly kissing her knuckles, and she wasn\u2019t sure if she was more elated at such a thrill ingly gallant gesture, or horrified by the stinky, horsey grime that she knew encased her hand like a glove.</p><p>\u201cAlexander Robertson, utterly charmed to make your acquaintance.\u201d</p><p>She began to pull her hand away. Surely she stank like muck and dirty leather.</p><p>He only gripped tighter, giving her fingers one final squeeze.</p><p>She shivered. If only Will would grab her hand and give her a proper squeeze.</p><p>\u201cAnd who do I have the pleasure of meeting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d She and Rollo had discussed this. She was to give her real name. It worked out quite nicely that her last name, Wallace, not only sounded Scottish, it was also a large, relatively amorphous clan hailing from outside the city of Glasgow.</p><p>As for how to explain their travel together, Rollo had told her she could claim a betrothal to him.</p><p>Now that had been like pulling teeth.</p><p>\u201cFelicity Wallace,\u201d she hesitated.</p><p>\u201cFe-li-ci-ty,\u201d he let the sound trip joyfully over his tongue. \u201cA name as delightful as she who bears it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. Will had sounded stricken at the name. This was more like it.</p><p>\u201cAnd what brings you to stand so lovely and forlorn, here in this modest village, bearing two mounts? Please do not tell me you await your husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d She blushed. \u201cHe\u2019s not my husband, exactly\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapital!\u201d He stepped closer. His proximity cast her in shadow, and she instinctively took a slight step back.</p><p>\u201cNow, do tell where you are from, Felicity of not-exactly-a-husband.\u201d He smiled wider, placing his hand on her horse\u2019s back. It struck her as an overly familiar gesture.</p><p>\u201cOutside Glasgow.\u201d She looked around. What was taking Will so long?</p><p>\u201cAnd is your almost-husband from Glasgow as well?\u201d</p><p>The way he referred to him made her blush, as if she\u2019d done something improper. Were women not supposed to travel with their fianc\u00e9s? Was she giving him some horrible impression of her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, standing a little straighter, trying to look the part of an affronted seventeenth-century lady. She took another step back.</p><p>\u201cIf he leaves you unguarded, it\u2019s his own fault I\u2019m here to sweep in and get better acquainted.\u201d Robertson leaned closer.</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAh!\u201d he exclaimed, opening his palms up to the sky. \u201cYou do not recognize my name?\u201d</p><p>Definitely not Mister Right.</p><p>\u201cI am minister of the village of Dunning. If you are not from these parts and, I dare say\u201d\u2014he eyed her in a way she knew couldn\u2019t have been entirely appropriate for the time period or a minister\u2014\u201cyou are not, Dunning is a cheery wee village here in Perthshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, how\u2014\u201d</p><p>He cut her off, continuing merrily, \u201cMy journey has been neither easy nor brief, but I find that to adventure through the countryside is to rouse the senses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow far\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd \u2019tis well worth it too,\u201d he interrupted again, adding a knowing and self-satisfied little chuckle.</p><p>She crossed her arms impatiently. This man didn\u2019t strike her as particularly ministerial. \u201cWhy do you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDunning can feel quite isolated. A minister I may be, but I\u2019d not have my existence be quite so cloistered.\u201d He laughed outright then, pleased at his own wit.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a minister?\u201d The words burst from her, coming out more loudly than she\u2019d expected. Actually, she hadn\u2019t really even expected to be able to fit them in edgewise.</p><p>\u201cWhy, yes indeed. I know I am quite young for my own parish,\u201d he added, mistaking her confusion for admiration.</p> <p>He edged closer. Did he expect her to be wilting with attraction to him?</p><p>\u201cBut truly, I do find travel so invigorating. And, indeed, necessary!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d she repeated, stealing furtive glances over the man\u2019s shoulder. Any day now, Will.</p><p>\u201cI am a man of enterprise! I say, if a man is to have any ambition in life, he must keep abreast of the goings on in his country, do you not agree?\u201d</p><p>Felicity managed a little half nod. She\u2019d thought he was cute. Talk about wrong first impressions.</p><p>\u201cI believe my successes are owed to zeal and industry, in equal parts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please,\u201d she whispered, scooting back a little more.</p><p>\u201cGod gives each of us certain gifts, and I dare not squander mine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be so aware of your talents,\u201d she said, trying to bite back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d he beamed.</p><p>Indeed, another indeed. Felicity glanced around again, just in time to see Rollo reappearing, with grooms in tow.</p><p>Saved.</p><p>The two men met each other with stony silence.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure how a seventeenth-century woman would approach the situation. \u201cUh . . . Alexander,\u201d she stammered, \u201cthis is\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Rollo,\u201d the minister said, giving a curt nod to Will. \u201cEveryone has heard of the great exploits of the esteemed Lord Rollo.\u201d</p><p>Felicity would\u2019ve sworn she saw Will\u2019s cheek twitch.</p><p>Fascinating.</p><p>Alexander turned back to her, his tone a bit more subdued. \u201cHad I known you were thus . . . spoken for, I\u2019d not have hoped to press my suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPress your\u2014? Ohhh . . .\u201d Ew. Thanks, but no.</p><p>\u201cShe is most definitely spoken for.\u201d Will took her arm in his, and her heart did a flip-flop.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s more like it,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you thinking speaking with . . . that one?\u201d he asked after Alexander, the grooms, and the horses had all gone their separate ways.</p><p>\u201cWhat are your \u2018great exploits\u2019?\u201d she asked eagerly.</p><p>Will ignored the question. \u201cHow long were you with Robertson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d She perked up. Did that mean he had feelings? Maybe jealousy was the key to Will Rollo.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks, a black cloud darkening his features. \u201cJealousy has naught to do with it. Just . . . simply . . . stay away from that man. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDangerous? He\u2019s a minister. How can he be dangerous?\u201d</p><p>He stilled once more, and this time she stumbled slightly, catching herself.</p><p>\u201cYou are not to speak with that man,\u201d he hissed. \u201cEver. He travels about doing the devil\u2019s work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevil\u2019s work?\u201d She giggled at the unexpected reply.</p><p>He gestured for her silence.</p><p>\u201cDevil\u2019s work?\u201d she asked again, in a mockingly grave whisper. \u201cHe said he just liked to see the countryside, meet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a witch pricker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPricker?!\u201d A loud laugh burst from her. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what he was\u2014a little pricker!\u201d She had to wipe the tears from her eyes it was so funny.</p><p>Will glowered at her, and Felicity thought steam might whistle out of his ears at any moment.</p><p>\u201cListen well, woman,\u201d he said in a voice that was deadly quiet. \u201cThis . . . minister . . . says he does God\u2019s work, but I say he\u2019s an ambitious prig who thinks to accelerate his ambitions through sensational trials that are a mockery of justice.\u201d</p><p>She stared blankly. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>His jaw tightened. \u201cThe man claims he has a gift. For identifying witches. He kills those he finds.\u201d</p><p>Dread prickled like ice in her belly. \u201cDo you mean like . . . a witch hunt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s precisely what I mean. He\u2019s ordered the death of hundreds of women. And this has brought him fame.\u201d Rollo looked quickly to the right and left. Gripping her arm, he began to walk them slowly toward the inn\u2019s front door. \u201cThese were innocent women. Some were sick, perhaps. Some practiced midwifery. And others, I think, Alexander Robertson simply determined he didn\u2019t like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she replied, subdued. \u201cIt seemed like he liked me . . . He asked so many questions. I think I answered them all right . . .\u201d Her voice petered out.</p><p>\u201cYou must never forget who you are,\u201d Rollo whispered urgently in her ear, and the feel of his breath sent an inadvertent shiver along her skin.</p><p>Focus. She had to focus.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so guileless,\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cYou make it sound like that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, Felicity, lass, it\u2019s a bonny thing,\u201d he said with an earnestness that broke her heart. \u201cBut you betray yourself. With a mere look, a mere word.\u201d</p><p>He slowed even more to buy them more time. \u201cWhy do you think we\u2019ve been taking this godforsaken route, avoiding the larger burghs in favor of these pitiable villages?\u201d He gave a squeeze to her arm. \u201cTo keep you safe, Felicity.\u201d</p><p>He had to stop speaking, for they\u2019d reached the door.</p><p>Rollo. Her Viking. He\u2019d been so cold and distant. But it was because he\u2019d been worried, trying to protect her.</p><p>Because she had more to fear than anyone.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t like those innocent women.</p><p>She\u2019d made herself travel back through time.</p><p>Which would mean . . .</p><p>I am a witch.</p><p>Rollo hesitated at her door. What he was about to do was entirely inappropriate. He looked behind him. The hallway was dim and empty. Dinner had come and gone. Folk had returned to their rooms for the night, or were drunk in the inn\u2019s common room. Nobody would see.</p><p>Or, he could simply turn and head downstairs for a mug of ale and some stew.</p><p>But Felicity had seemed so alone.</p><p>He knew he\u2019d scared her. He was glad of it. The lass needed some scaring. It was as if she thought she were a part of some great and merry romp.</p><p>He\u2019d insisted she stay in her room for the night. What she really needed to do was return to her own time. To let him help her find her way home. But she seemed determined that she\u2019d come back for him.</p><p>Anguish pierced straight to his heart. A woman, wanting to lay claim to him.</p><p>It was too much.</p><p>Too tempting.</p><p>And too risky. She needed to get away, now, far away, from Will, from this time and place.</p><p>He dared not get too close. He didn\u2019t want to know too much about her. Every day she spent with him was one day too many.</p><p>Danger simmered. Fear and greed drove men to heinous acts. Like beheading a king.</p><p>Like torturing women in the name of superstitions that should\u2019ve gone out with the Dark Ages.</p><p>The thought brought the handle of his cane up, cracking a knock at her door.</p><p>He regretted it instantly.</p><p>She is likely afraid, he told himself. She would long for company. Might fear the danger she found herself in.</p><p>The door opened, and it was like a wash of sunlight on chilled flesh.</p><p>She stood there, and he knew.</p><p>Perhaps the gravest danger was to his heart.</p><p>Chapter 9</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said in a relieved voice, stepping aside for Rollo to enter. \u201cI\u2019m dying in here. I\u2019m sorry. I know you said not to leave, but I\u2019m about to crawl out of my skin, and so I finally just ordered a bath. I heard the woman right outside, so technically I didn\u2019t really leave the room, and she said she\u2019d bring the hot water in here so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush.\u201d He touched a finger to her chin, then pulled his hand away at once.</p><p>The ghost of his touch lingered on her skin. She\u2019d been desperate to eat, to bathe, to talk to someone, but that one moment of contact made it all fall away. Felicity stared dumbly as he clicked the door shut behind him.</p><p>\u201cDo you think you can eat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d She brightened at once. \u201cAll I\u2019ve had is bread and cheese. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>He gave a curt nod and turned to go.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d She reached around him to slam her palm against the door. \u201cYou just got here. Where are you going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy, woman.\u201d He chuckled.</p><p>Wow, how she loved it when she made him make that sound. And calling her woman . . . It felt so seventeenth-century alpha male, in such a strangely good way.</p><p>She pulled her hand back, and let it graze along his side in an accidentally-on-purpose sort of way. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll return shortly,\u201d he told her. His voice had grown tight, and she hoped maybe she and her hand were the ones to put the edge there.</p><p>But then fifteen minutes passed, and then another fifteen, as Felicity paced her room, waiting for Will to come back.</p><p>She heard another knock and sprang to the door, opening it with a broad smile on her face. \u201cThere you\u2014!\u201d</p> <p>Not Will.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she said, feeling a fierce blush creep along her cheeks. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d</p><p>A virtual army of inn workers were assembled outside her door. A wall of smells assaulted her. Some good, others not so much.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d she asked, muting a small cough.</p><p>\u201cAye, mum.\u201d A woman stepped forward. Faded linen clothing like something straight out of the costume department hung from her plump frame.</p> <p>\u201cLord Rollo asked that we deliver this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDeliver\u2014?\u201d</p><p>The bodies all parted, revealing a small side table absolutely smothered in food.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d Felicity gasped. Those would be the good smells.</p><p>She stepped aside to let the wave of them bustle in, setting up chairs, arranging plates and cutlery, decanting wine.</p><p>\u201cWine!\u201d She grinned, her hands fisting in anticipation.</p> <p>Felicity felt eyes on her and looked up to find Rollo watching her intently from the doorway. She forgot her hunger, feeling her belly fill with butterflies instead.</p><p>Her grin muted to a tremulous smile.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said quietly, as the small army left.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t let you starve.\u201d He smiled at her, and her knees buckled.</p><p>Rollo swept to her side, his cane clattering to the floor, to ease her into a chair. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re famished, lass.\u201d</p><p>His hands were warm and strong on her arm and at her back. The butterflies in her belly moved south, became a hard ache at her core. \u201cFamished is an interesting word for it,\u201d she murmured. \u201cWhat did you bring me?\u201d</p><p>He muttered a curse under his breath as he bent to retrieve his cane. Sitting across from her, he lifted a lid and the room filled with the smell of roast meat and wine. \u201cYou have before you beef in French claret, with bacon and onions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhmygod,\u201d she whispered, actually feeling tears prick her eyes. \u201cThat smells so good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScotland has friends among the French. We learned to prepare food from the best.\u201d</p><p>She looked up, caught his eye, and his hand froze, the lid still perched over the serving dish.</p><p>Oil lamps cast a flickering, golden glow over the room. Light and shadows danced on Will\u2019s features, his sharp cheekbones, strong jaw, and those intense eyes, focused only on her.</p><p>He sat so regally across from her. It took her breath away.</p><p>\u201cLord Rollo,\u201d she mused.</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d There was a flicker of humor in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a seventeenth-century lord. Who lives in a castle. You wear your velvet coats as easily as my stupid old boyfriends wore their ratty old T-shirts.\u201d</p><p>The humor in his eyes hardened into something unreadable. \u201cYour . . . boyfriends?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d She waved a hand dismissively. \u201cNone of them did it for me. They all ended up being jerks.\u201d</p><p>His brow furrowed, as if he were trying to make sense of her words. He began to slowly dish out their dinner. \u201cThere have been men in your life, and yet you\u2019ve never married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been asked. Not that I would\u2019ve said yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever been asked? Modern men must be daft.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, startled by the sentiment. \u201cYou really do care.\u201d She thought about the food on the table and the roof over her head, and grew serious. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so great to me, but I feel like all I\u2019ve done is gripe and moan.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d done so much for her. She\u2019d doubted him, but he\u2019d only had her best interests at heart. \u201cI haven\u2019t exactly been the nicest companion these past days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve not met my friend Alasdair MacColla,\u201d he told her with a smile. \u201cTrust me when I say you\u2019ve been a delightful companion.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the rare glimpse of humor, earnestly wanting him to understand. \u201cBut I should\u2019ve trusted you more. I\u2019ll trust you, Will, from now on.\u201d</p><p>He watched her, quietly weighing her words. He cut such a dashing figure across from her. He\u2019d shaved, and bathed, and looked so elegantly handsome in the lamplight.</p><p>He was like a prince in a fairy tale. Her prince. He was a gentleman, a lord, some great and noble hero.</p><p>He\u2019d kept her safe. There was a fire in the hearth and food on the table worthy of the best French restaurant.</p><p>Of course he\u2019d be familiar with fine cuisine, and things like claret, and brandy in cut-glass snifters, not to mention an army of butlers and maids. She\u2019d lost sight of all that, on the road with him these last weeks.</p><p>She was suddenly nervous. \u201cI . . . I hope I\u2019m dressed all right. My hair\u2019s a mess . . . I\u2019ve got nothing good to tie it back with. And I aired out my gown\u201d\u2014she looked down, smoothing the lap of what was once her rose-colored confection\u2014\u201cbut I\u2019m afraid this thing could up and walk away all by itself.\u201d</p><p>She felt his hand on her arm, stilling her.</p><p>\u201cYou look lovely, Felicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh. I look like a wreck. Plus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShh.\u201d He gave her arm a squeeze. \u201cIf you tried, you would still be nothing less that the loveliest woman in all Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Something stilled in her chest. She thought it must be her heart skipping a beat.</p><p>\u201cAnd besides, I think I might just be able to send my suit of clothes off with your gown. They can take a turn about the village together, aye?\u201d</p><p>She laughed then, a tension-relieving giggle.</p><p>Will seemed so uncomfortable himself sometimes. Maybe that\u2019s how he was so deft at recognizing her discomfort and easing it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret,\u201d he added, \u201cI\u2019ll make certain you have new gowns when we get to my family\u2019s home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean when we get back to your castle, right?\u201d She gave him a sly smile. \u201cWait. Gowns?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he laughed, \u201cyou may have a gown made in every color if you like.\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand away, and her arm felt chilled in its wake.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d he said, his voice grown somber, \u201cyou can take them back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack . . . ?\u201d His meaning dawned. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t. I\u2019m staying with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd meeting Robertson wasn\u2019t enough to spur your departure? Felicity\u201d\u2014he gestured to the walls around them\u2014\u201cI\u2019m afraid to let you leave this very room.\u201d</p><p>His tone softened. \u201cI will protect you, bring you to my home. But the stones and mortar of Duncrub Castle won\u2019t be enough to save you if\u201d\u2014he scowled\u2014\u201cthe minister has you in his sights.\u201d</p><p>She crumpled back in her chair. Could he be right? Was she in danger? But how could anyone think she was a witch? If she kept her origins a secret, they wouldn\u2019t. Felicity glanced back down at her dress. She was in period clothes. If she lay low, with Will\u2019s help, wouldn\u2019t she just blend?</p><p>Looking up, she studied him, sitting so stoically across from her. The light glowed on his thick chestnut hair.</p><p>The universe had sent her there, to him. To this man who rendered her insides to mush whenever he spared her one of his rare smiles. How could the universe be wrong?</p><p>She frowned, unwilling to contemplate leaving. \u201cThe food. It\u2019s getting cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he said with a start. \u201cThat was ill-done of me. The food. Of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you show me what else you brought me?\u201d She dug deep, trying for a smile.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said, readily accepting the change in topic and mood. \u201cYou\u2019ve the beef with claret. A pot of auld reekie\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOld what? Old stinky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d He barked a laugh, and her chest swelled with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cAuld reekie, lass. Called thus because it hails from Edinburgh. \u2019Tis simply chicken soup with whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yum. My aunt made the best chicken noodle soup.\u201d She inhaled deeply. \u201cTotal comfort food. Though I doubt she laced it with whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought it best for your nerves. I had them prepare you a whisky toddy as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWine, whisky, whisky . . . I\u2019m sensing a theme here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He took the decanter of wine and poured two glasses. \u201cAnd to crown this theme, I\u2019ve unearthed a bottle of our host\u2019s finest claret.\u201d</p><p>She gave a dreamy sigh. \u201cYou have no idea how much I\u2019d love a glass of wine. Or I guess maybe you did. Wait,\u201d she said, taking the glass from his hand, \u201chow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if your intemperate condition upon arrival was any indication . . .\u201d He gave her a sly smile.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s so not like me. And it wasn\u2019t wine anyhow. That\u2019s the problem. I\u2019d been drinking sangria. Wine with sugar and fruit added,\u201d she clarified, noting his quizzical look.</p><p>\u201cOho.\u201d He raised his glass to her. \u201cAnd that is so much worse than mere wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is,\u201d she protested, leaning over to swat him on the arm. \u201cThe sugar will get you every time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at the spread between them. \u201cSpeaking of sugar . . . What is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. That, Felicity, is gingerbread. And this,\u201d he said, uncovering another treat, \u201ccherry cake with whisky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore whisky,\u201d she mused. \u201cAre you trying to get me drunk, Mister Rollo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lord Rollo,\u201d he deadpanned.</p><p>She thought that, just then, she might be lighting the room with her glow. She craved uncovering Will\u2019s sense of humor even more than she craved a hot shower.</p><p>She pulled her eyes from him, turning her focus to the bowl of beef stew he\u2019d ladled out for her. She dug her fork in and stirred, and the most heavenly aroma filled her senses. \u201cI think my mouth is actually, literally watering.\u201d She closed her eyes, moaning as she took a bite. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOhmygosh.\u201d Her eyes shot back open and she set to rifling through the bowl to spear a bit with her fork. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d She leaned over and, without thinking, held it to Rollo\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d He looked at it, uncertain.</p><p>\u201cCome on, just taste it,\u201d she said, hoping he\u2019d open his mouth soon, because she was about to feel pretty silly.</p> <p>His gaze met hers, and what she\u2019d put out there as a blithe gesture became something charged, erotic.</p><p>The flickering light caught Will\u2019s hazel eyes just so, making them seem golden. He opened his mouth slowly, leaning forward, and Felicity flashed to a thousand different fantasies. Of him leaning toward her, just like that, to taste her. Taking her hand in his, opening his mouth just that way, to kiss her palm. Her neck. Her, all over.</p><p>He wrapped his lips around the fork. She watched them, those fine, perfect lips, slowly taking the food into his mouth.</p><p>The sensation of wet heat widening her, opening her, suffused Felicity. She tensed her thighs, suddenly aware of a maddening need she had to satisfy.</p><p>His eyes pierced her with their intensity. What would he be thinking? She faltered, began to pull her hand back.</p> <p>Will touched her wrist, gently took the fork from her fingers. His touch burned her skin.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cThat was a turnip. But you\u2019re doing it all wrong.\u201d His voice was husky, ragged. \u201cThe neeps are best\u201d\u2014he carefully dug in his bowl, snagging careful proportions of stew\u2014\u201cwhen you get just enough with the onions\u201d\u2014he brought the fork to her lips\u2014\u201cand the meat.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth and tasted. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she groaned, and saw his body gird at the sound she made.</p><p>He wanted her. She saw it in his eyes, there in the lamplight, feeding her carefully.</p><p>\u201cMore,\u201d she urged him. She would show him how much he wanted her, how it was okay to want her. Just the thought of it had her body throbbing. \u201cFeed me more.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating, he fed her one more bite, then grew silent. The air was electric, as if they\u2019d crossed some invisible threshold from which there was no return.</p> <p>Rollo was quiet as he finished his meal and Felicity saw his eyes flick to the door. \u201cNo way, Viking.\u201d She\u2019d seen the sex in his eyes. They flashed back to hers, surprised. \u201cNo retreat yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d he faltered.</p><p>He wanted her, and so he also wanted to flee. Will\u2019s eyes shot to the door.</p><p>Uh-oh.</p><p>He straightened, his hands shifting to his thighs.</p><p>He was getting ready to leave. She wouldn\u2019t let him. Here goes nothing. \u201cYou\u2019re not going yet.\u201d</p><p>Felicity rose, slinked to his side of the table, and settled onto Will\u2019s lap.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you . . .\u201d Rollo\u2019s body didn\u2019t just still, it seized, every muscle hardening to stone. His hands gripped the edges of his chair, as if bracing for impact. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI want that cake,\u201d she said, her sultry tone suggesting a whole lot more than cherry cake. Felicity leaned forward to cut a slice, using the opportunity to nestle her rump more snugly in his lap. She knew she\u2019d shocked him, and there was no going back now. Because she would kiss her Viking before the night was out. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with a little cake, is there?\u201d</p><p>His eyes ran down the length of her, concealed in slightly soiled pink silk. They landed on her feet, peeking pale and delicate from beneath her hem, and he thought he wasn\u2019t so sure there was nothing wrong.</p><p>This felt so good, there had to be something wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, mistaking his silence. She waggled her feet, and her shifting weight atop his thighs was pure torture. \u201cI hope it\u2019s okay. My bare feet I mean.\u201d</p><p>He realized he\u2019d never in his life seen a woman\u2019s naked foot before Felicity\u2019s. His mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t bear to wear those tight little slippers. I never wear shoes inside.\u201d</p><p>Rollo couldn\u2019t move. He thought he might have actually tried, but he couldn\u2019t budge. It was a wonder he was able to breathe.</p><p>\u201cAnd I totally need a pedi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . . ?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pedicure.\u201d She raised a leg, wiggling her toes. Her dress shifted a few inches up her calf.</p><p>He had no idea what she was chattering about.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t imagine a more perfect foot. Surely there didn\u2019t exist toes more perfect, more adorable, than these.</p><p>He inched his hands to the sides of his thighs. He was so close to stroking her legs. He imagined sweeping his palms down to touch that sweet, pale foot.</p><p>\u201cLook at me, Will,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>There\u2014she\u2019d spoken his name again. Her voice was cloaked in sweetness and innocence, and it set his body on fire. She gave him a little smile and parted her lips.</p><p>She whispered to him, was whispering such sweet things, he thought perhaps he\u2019d died and transcended to some glorious heaven, a place of his dreams peopled only with this exquisite, lone angel.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m kissable, Will?\u201d She gently took one of his hands, studied it, then held it in hers.</p><p>God help me.</p><p>His whole body quickened.</p><p>Did he think she was kissable? God help him, did he ever. He\u2019d been fantasizing about it from the very first. Kissing her, touching her, nuzzling her . . .</p><p>Ravaging her.</p><p>But he\u2019d not thought it could ever happen.</p><p>\u201cBecause,\u201d she said in the barest whisper, \u201cI think I\u2019d really like to kiss you now.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 10</p><p>She leaned in. There it was again, that shimmer of gold in his eyes. They were hooded. Dark and hungry.</p><p>Oh yeah. He wanted her. She could see it. Her whole body thrummed, felt poised for some great change.</p><p>He moved. She panicked for a moment, thinking that he might try to leave. But then she saw he was merely shifting. Taking his hand from the side of his leg, bringing it to rest lightly around the back of her neck. His fingers wove under her hair, found her skin.</p><p>You\u2019ve got it in you, don\u2019t you, Will Rollo?</p><p>Her skin beaded tight at once, her whole body ready for him, rallying to his touch. The feel of his skin against hers was heady. It was a simple connection, yet it roused some deep-down craving, stirring her to a fever pitch.</p><p>Oh wow . . . What else could those fingers do?</p><p>\u201cPlease, Will,\u201d she whispered. She needed more.</p><p>He threaded his fingers through her hair, stroked them back out, and Felicity luxuriated in his touch.</p><p>For so many weeks, they\u2019d been in such close proximity, and yet miles apart. But now, this. Her heart hammered in her chest. More, she thought. She wanted more.</p><p>She still held his other hand in hers. She studied it. It was large and strong, with a thick ridge of callus from decades of gripping his cane. Felicity traced the lines on his hand, lightly ran her fingertips over the thickened skin at the top of his palm. How would that hand feel chafing over her nakedness, those powerful fingers gripping her flesh?</p><p>A sudden stab of desire made her flinch, and she gripped his hand, brought it to her chest. Just close enough to feel the uppermost swell of her breast.</p><p>\u201cI . . . \u201d His voice cracked. He took his hand from her and clenched it, rubbing his fingers together as if to savor the memory.</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he rasped, shaking his head. Reaching a fingertip to her face, he gently traced the slope of her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re too lovely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease . . .\u201d Please, please kiss me, touch me, grab me.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too . . .\u201d He leaned closer, his eyes devouring her every feature.</p><p>Now, Will, oh please, now . . .</p><p>\u201cOch, God help me,\u201d he uttered, his voice hoarse with need. Darkness clouded his features, and she glimpsed a lust so keen and so powerful Felicity felt it would submerge her, sweep her away.</p><p>She leaned closer still. Her body hummed, desperate for him. His perfect, perfect lips parted. She felt his breath on her mouth.</p><p>\u201cKiss me.\u201d Her voice was the barest whisper even to her own ears.</p><p>He licked his lower lip, and sparks crackled low in her belly. Too much, he was too much, too unbearably, unwittingly sexy.</p><p>Joy filled her, expanded her. She was about to kiss her Vik\u2014</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d There was a sharp rap at the door. \u201cI\u2019ve the hot water you requested, mum.\u201d</p><p>A pained sound escaped her throat. Dammit. Damn damn dammit.</p><p>\u201cMum?\u201d There was another knock, louder now. \u201cAre you all right there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Felicity cleared her throat. She pulled back, holding Will\u2019s gaze for a heartbeat. He was raw. Vulnerable, despairing. And then his eyelids slid closed, shuttering himself to her once again.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she called testily. With one last look at him, she rose from his lap. \u201cComing.\u201d</p><p>Three maids bustled in, but Rollo couldn\u2019t focus. He wasn\u2019t certain if they\u2019d just saved him, or doomed him to an eternity of anguished need.</p><p>His world swam red. He was steeped in desire. His blood boiled with it. His body, wild and hard, his every nerve, mad with it.</p><p>He\u2019d spent a lifetime with every impulse of his flesh utterly, deliberately, painfully suppressed. But a thin fissure had begun to crack along that fa\u00e7ade, and it was as if he could hear the hounds of hell baying on the other side. The needs of a man, his needs, demanding satisfaction, demanding relief, in a cacophony of raging desire.</p><p>Dark lusts, primal urges, secret desires, all focused on Felicity. Only Felicity.</p><p>\u201cApologies, mum. With all the food preparations, your bath slipped my mind.\u201d Rollo heard the women shuffling around, felt their curious gazes on him.</p><p>There was the sound of a metal washbasin clanging onto wood. \u201c \u2019Tis so late, I hope you don\u2019t mind, t\u2019won\u2019t be a full bathing. Just a wee splash. Though we can arrange a nice hip bath tomorrow, to be certain.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward. Gathered his feet under him. Took and clutched at the head of his cane.

What could he have been thinking to take it so far? He needed to get out of there. Tamp down his hardened groin with a bellyful of whisky.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d She pleaded with him now. He felt the maids\u2019 eyes on them and knew it would be the talk belowstairs.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t spare her a look. To glance back now would only twist the knife in his heart.</p> <p>He heard the heavy slosh of water in the bucket. The slap of droplets spilled on the floor.</p><p>In his mind, water rolled down her naked body. She\u2019d stand straight, hands combing through her hair. Her breasts would bead in the chill air. She\u2019d cup and wash them, her palms chafing over sensitive nipples. He pictured her delicate fingers. They\u2019d stroke between her legs, cleansing, probing.</p><p>God help him.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, he shuffled to the stairs. He\u2019d limp his cursed body down, where he\u2019d sit, and drink, alone.</p><p>Jamie Rollo walked into the pub, ready to get soused. His family\u2019s castle was but a day\u2019s ride away, and he always required a good girding with whisky before facing his brother.</p> <p>Damned William. Jamie knew the self- righteous prig would be making his way back to Duncrub.</p><p>He plopped down hard at an empty table. The rickety wood creaked as he sat, and he kicked a neighboring chair free, propping his mucky boots in front of him.</p><p>He\u2019d make his bloody younger brother pay for the fiasco back in London. Jamie couldn\u2019t believe the cripple had managed to free a prisoner out from under him.</p><p>And now his betters doubted his commitment and competence. Outwardly questioned Jamie\u2019s ability to manage the simple imprisonment of fools.</p><p>Oh, little Willie would pay. Dearly, and for everything.</p><p>\u201cWhisky,\u201d he called to a passing servingwoman. He\u2019d been riding hard north all day and was in a mood to pickle himself with drink. \u201cAnd whatever slop you\u2019re serving for supper this evening.\u201d</p> <p>He used his heel to scrape at the mud on his boots. It was late summer, and the rain had been heavy throughout Perthshire. \u201cI feel like a goddamned mushroom,\u201d he grumbled. \u201cPerth. Sweet bosom of my clan. A seething heap of shit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d the wench asked, setting the whisky in front of him.</p><p>\u201cBring me ale as well, woman. And now.\u201d He didn\u2019t spare her a glance as she bustled away.</p><p>He needed to think. Needed a plan.</p><p>He\u2019d return home to wait for his lame brother. Though their father was still alive, the old man had become an imbecile since suffering a fit two years past. And so little brother Willie had nobody to protect him now.</p><p>Chuckling, he swung his feet to the floor. Their father had adored Will, but it was Jamie their mother preferred. She claimed it was because Jamie favored her side of the family, but he\u2019d secretly known it was that Will\u2019s legs disgusted her.</p><p>Their mother knew how to love a strapping lad. But a feeble, broken one? No, it\u2019d been Jamie who\u2019d been his mother\u2019s chosen son.</p><p>Not that Will had needed any more attention. His whole life, folk attended him as if he were a bloody head of state instead of a self-righteous cripple. His series of military victories with James Graham had been the last straw. Who\u2019d have thought a cripple could fight on the battlefield?</p> <p>He scowled. Graham had been a damned popinjay who\u2019d deserved to die. Though the way the man had been lauded, one would\u2019ve thought he\u2019d been the bloody Messiah instead of a supposed war hero.</p><p>The Graham clan. He cleared his throat and spat onto the floor. Jamie had married Graham\u2019s cow of a sister, then wisely left her for a Campbell. At the time, he hadn\u2019t cared who Campbell was fighting for; Jamie only knew it was against his brother, and that had been good enough for him.</p><p>He\u2019d come to admire Campbell, though. Had come to respect the values that he and their Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, stood for.</p><p>And so he\u2019d become a key figure in Cromwell\u2019s inner circle, chasing down fools who dreamed of reinstating a Stuart to the throne. Cromwell recognized his potential, even if his own father didn\u2019t. Jamie\u2019s duty was to snare and cage Royalists like rabbits up in the Tower. Until his damned little brother had come along.</p><p>\u201cI wonder at your commitment, Rollo,\u201d Cromwell himself had mused.</p><p>Damn his brother.</p><p>Planting his elbows on the table, he scrubbed his hands through his hair. Will was a cursed bastard who continued to thwart him left and right. And no matter how exacting his planning, Jamie always ended up looking the incompetent one. Ever since they\u2019d been lads, it had been thus.</p><p>Except . . . A smile twitched at the corner of his mouth. Except for his greatest triumph, when it was Will who\u2019d been beaten. The terror on his brother\u2019s face when his prized pony charged . . . Jamie chuckled. It had been worth the beating their father had laid into him. His arse had hurt for a month.</p><p>The barmaid came back with a pint. She stood for a moment, waiting, but he ignored her, instead taking a big pull from his mug. She stormed off and he sneered, shaking his head. If the hag thought he\u2019d spare her a coin for cloudy ale the temperature of piss, she was sorely mistaken.</p><p>Threading his fingers at the back of his head, Jamie leaned back to think.</p><p>Putting a burr under that pony\u2019s saddle had been inspired. He needed something that good, that simple and far-reaching, to get back at his brother.</p><p>For the thousandth time, he imagined killing Will. But though he fantasized about it, he wouldn\u2019t murder his brother outright. Not because of any moral compunction. He\u2019d simply have the crippled prig alive, writhing in the knowledge that it was Jamie who finally triumphed.</p><p>He brought the whisky to his mouth, held it there, letting the fumes burn his sinuses. He needed to think, needed to come up with something that would torture Will for the rest of his days.</p><p>A burst of chill evening air had Jamie turning in his seat. A man stood at the door, scanning the room, letting his eyes adjust to the light.</p><p>He was taller than average, with hair that shone like a woman\u2019s. Jamie glowered. He didn\u2019t know what the world was coming to; there were popinjays all around.</p><p>He took a big swig from his mug and wiped his mouth on the back of his sleeve. He always acted instinctively boorish when faced with pretty lads like this one. Pretty men in pretty velvet coats were beneath contempt.</p><p>Belching, he sat tall in his chair. It dawned on him that he angled for a good fight. His brother was nowhere about, but bloodying up this pretty lad\u2019s face would be just the thing.</p><p>And he knew just the way.</p><p>Downing the rest of his glass in one swig, he watched as the man politely flagged down the barmaid, made his request.</p><p>Jamie interrupted them, bellowing, \u201cMore whisky.\u201d</p><p>The man turned and spotted him, and Jamie knew he\u2019d approach the table. He was the only other man there not soiled by a day of hard labor.</p><p>Jamie might not be one for lace at his cuffs, but neither did he disguise his wealth. He knew his clothes showed it. Fine materials and a simple, elegant cut. And he knew fops like this one couldn\u2019t resist the company of wealth.</p><p>\u201cA fine evening, sir,\u201d the man gushed. \u201cMay I join you?\u201d</p><p>Jamie\u2019s only response was to kick a chair in the man\u2019s direction.</p><p>He eyed it, eyed Jamie, and with the merest of shrugs, took a seat.</p><p>\u201cM\u2019lords,\u201d the servingwoman said.</p><p>Jamie looked up, surprised to see the old crow had returned. \u201cYou certainly made haste for him.\u201d He gestured to the stranger who promptly began to dig in his coin purse.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she cooed, accepting a copper. \u201cVerra generous, sir.\u201d She narrowed her eyes accusingly at Jamie, plunking a chipped bowl in front of him. A charred slab of biscuit glistened on top, the aroma questionable at best.</p><p>\u201cAh, a filthy bowl of\u201d\u2014he inhaled deeply\u2014\u201clet\u2019s see. I suppose that\u2019s food you\u2019ve brought us, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShepherd\u2019s pie.\u201d She crossed her arms over her scrawny chest. \u201cI don\u2019t make it. You dinna have to eat it.\u201d</p><p>He eyed her. The sass was unexpected.</p><p>\u201cA moment,\u201d Jamie stopped her, digging in his pocket, then flicked a coin in her direction.</p><p>Open-mouthed, she stared at him a moment, then quickly tucked the bit of silver safely at her sagging bosom. \u201cThank ye, sir,\u201d she muttered in surprise, scuffling away before Jamie could change his mind.</p><p>The stranger had been watching the proceedings with wide eyes, and Jamie\u2019s hand twitched with the irrational urge to gesture against the evil eye. The impulse made him more churlish than before.</p><p>\u201cTo the Lord Protector,\u201d Jamie announced suddenly, lifting his glass to his companion. A sly sneer dared the man to challenge the unpopular sentiment. I\u2019ll have my fight before the night is through, he thought.</p><p>A hush fell around them. To propose a toast to Cromwell in such a public spot was at best audacious. At worst, it was suicide.</p><p>He\u2019d expected the stranger to take the bait. Rise in some grand, foolish-foppish manner to stand against Jamie. The man shocked him, though, when he merely raised his own glass, chiming, \u201cTo the cause.\u201d</p><p>Perthshire straddled both Highlands and Low, and it seemed folk were accustomed to dissenting opinions, for chatter in the pub gradually resumed.</p><p>Jamie took a swig from his whisky, following it with a deep pull from his ale. This stranger piqued his curiosity, and he found he wanted to bide a time with the man.</p><p>Jamie belched into his hand. \u201cWhere are we anyway?\u201d</p><p>The dandy shot him a skeptical look.</p><p>\u201cOch, man, easy. I\u2019ve been on the road. I can\u2019t recall how many inns in how many villages I\u2019ve seen these last weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he replied, easing visibly. He smiled and sipped his ale. \u201cI too am a traveling fellow. And we two are currently enjoying the hospitality of Uachdar Ardair,\u201d the pretty man said with a flourish, using Auchterarder\u2019s Gaelic name.</p><p>\u201cThat close, eh?\u201d Jamie\u2019s eyes grew distant.</p><p>\u201cClose to\u2014?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, close to my bloody family.\u201d He took a quick gulp of ale and slammed his hands down on the table as if he were turning over a new leaf, then and there. \u201cSo tell me, man, how is it you find yourself in such a dreary wee offshoot of Perthshire?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am a minister and a seeker, wending my way through the countryside, sowing the seeds of God\u2019s word, nourishing myself on the gentle wisdom of the simpler folk.\u201d He sighed gustily. \u201cUntil I met a goddess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA goddess, eh?\u201d Jamie chuckled.</p><p>\u201cA god-dess, I say.\u201d He pronounced the word grandiosely, his eyes clouding dreamily. \u201cWith hair like the sunlight and the otherworldly mien of an uneasy angel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo where\u2019s your god-dess now?\u201d Jamie tipped the last of his whisky back.</p><p>\u201cAlas, she travels with another.

It is an honor,\u201d he said warily. \u201cThough, you are not familiar to me. You must have been away for some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d His voice grew menacingly quiet. \u201cSome time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen\u201d\u2014his eyes flashed wide\u2014\u201cyou are brother to the one who claims the hand of my Venus.\u201d</p><p>Jamie barked out a sharp laugh. \u201cSurely you\u2019re mistaken. My brother\u2019s a cripple who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d know him anywhere.\u201d It was the minister\u2019s voice that grew quiet now. \u201cHe rode with Montrose, for the King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, that\u2019s the self- righteous prig.\u201d Jamie\u2019s face flattened, his eyes grown chill. \u201cMy brother travels with . . . a woman?\u201d</p><p>The minister nodded vigorously, pleased to have met a conspirator as appalled by this turn of events as he. Jamie studied the man. He seemed a self-involved sort. The sort whose narcissism left him guileless, too utterly caught up in his own affairs to suspect the designs of another.</p><p>Skepticism turned to a sly sort of hope, as it dawned on Jamie just what sort of grief he could cause his brother. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, minister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobertson.\u201d He tipped his glass to Jamie. \u201cAlexander Robertson. Witch pricker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRobertson of Dunning,\u201d he stated, understanding dawning.</p> <p>\u201cI see you\u2019ve heard of me?\u201d The minister\u2019s affected virtuosity curdled into something considerably less high-minded.</p><p>An ego, Jamie thought with a wicked smile. \u201cOh indeed. Your good works precede you.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d strike up an alliance with this minister, he decided suddenly. One never knew when one would need the friendship of a power hungry religious lunatic. It was gravy that the man had taken a fancy to Will\u2019s woman.</p><p>He\u2019d meet this woman. See if she might not be the dagger he could stab into his brother\u2019s back.</p><p>Chapter 11</p><p>\u201cWow, it\u2019s so pretty here. Look.\u201d Felicity pointed. \u201cThere\u2019s another stream, do you see? Just over that rise.\u201d</p><p>Will gave a noncommittal grunt.</p><p>Felicity looked at him with raised brows, the smile not budging from her face. Will had almost kissed her, and nothing could get her down. Not even his grumpy mood.</p><p>Because he\u2019d said she was lovely. He almost kissed her and he thought she was lovely. Too lovely, if she recalled correctly.</p><p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s the difference between Perth and Perthshire anyway? Perthshire. It sounds like something from The Hobbit.\u201d She inhaled deeply, and her breath hung like mist in the crisp air. Will had given her a tartan shawl, and she loved the feel of the chill on her face while her body was so comfortably warm. \u201cThat\u2019s us, just riding our horses down to the shire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Perth-sure,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cNot Perthshire.\u201d</p><p>Maybe he was grumpy because he hadn\u2019t gotten to kiss her. Her grin grew wider at the prospect.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d she pressed. \u201cIs Perth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerth is the city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are your parents close to the city?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomewhat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d she exclaimed. Will was no longer by her side, and realizing it, she pulled her horse to a stop. \u201cWhere\u2019d you go?\u201d Putting a hand at the rear of her saddle, she twisted her body around to face him. \u201cIs something bothering . . .\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s reins were knotted high on his horse\u2019s neck, and he was in the process of dismounting.</p><p>\u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for a rest,\u201d he answered in a clipped voice.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Felicity\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cWe\u2019re, what, an hour away from your castle, and you\u2019re resting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Visions of baths, roaring fires, and hot buttered bread had been dancing in her head all morning. She was not going to stop now. \u201cC\u2019mon, Will. I\u2019m dying to see your place. Can\u2019t you just rest when we get there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not quite like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, not like that?\u201d Reluctantly, she turned her horse, walked back to him, and dismounted. \u201cI\u2019ve spent the past how many weeks wanting to rest, and now you finally decide to take it easy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She heard something in his voice, something tight, pained even, and she decided not to push it. She would get to the bottom of it, though, she decided. If it killed her.</p><p>She watched quietly as he took a woolen blanket from where it was rolled at the back of his saddle. He tossed it to her wordlessly, and then plopped down at the foot of a silver-barked tree.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she told him. With a shrug, she unfurled the blanket on the ground next to him, and sat on it. \u201cI\u2019m always up for a rest.\u201d</p><p>Silence.</p><p>\u201cHow long are we resting for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. A while.\u201d She stretched her legs in front of her, waggling her feet. \u201cA good, long while.\u201d</p><p>She sighed, looking around. Perthshire really was ridiculously pretty. They were riding along the base of a valley. The stretch of land was yellowed with the season and bordered by grand, old trees. Soft reddish ferns, long grasses, and renegade clumps of winter wildflowers clung to the soil like a lush and ragged patchwork.</p><p>Though she missed modern conveniences, she hadn\u2019t thought of the city once. Taking in the landscape, she marveled at what she\u2019d been missing all these years. Despite the dirt, despite the discomfort, she\u2019d felt moments of true contentment on their slow ride through the countryside. Just her and Will, with some horses, and gorgeous land all around. It made her wonder what, exactly, she\u2019d been searching for in her old life, when here joy seemed so ready for the taking.</p><p>A breeze caught the treetops, and leaves rustled overhead. \u201cWait,\u201d she blurted out, realizing what was missing. \u201cWhere are all the birds?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are geese.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any,\u201d she said, studying the sky. \u201cAnyway, where are the rest of the birds? We\u2019re out in the middle of nowhere. Shouldn\u2019t there be twittering and chirping?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI imagine they\u2019ve flown south. It is almost winter, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Of course. We don\u2019t really get winter in San Francisco. There are birds year-round.\u201d</p><p>He nodded quietly.</p><p>So much for their little nature discussion.</p><p>Was he acting so funny because of what had happened between them the night before? Either way, Will was about to arrive home. \u201cAren\u2019t you excited? When was the last time you were home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYears? You haven\u2019t been home for years?\u201d She shifted to face him where he sat, in profile, against the tree. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt war. There\u2019s been much fighting. I\u2019m weary from it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d she said, as it all became clear. \u201cIs that what the minister meant by your exploits? Are you some sort of war hero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Some sort.\u201d</p><p>Admiration swelled in her. Of course Will was a hero. The way he sat on his horse, so brave and strong, clocking all the bad guys with his cane and his knife? She should\u2019ve known it.</p><p>\u201cWell then you should be extra happy to come home.\u201d She waited for a response, but he wasn\u2019t making this easy. Squaring her shoulders, Felicity decided direct was best. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you happier?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappier?\u201d He swung his head to face her.</p><p>There was something raw in his eyes. Something deeper than pain, more complicated than anger.</p><p>She considered backing off, but plowed ahead before she lost her nerve. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away fighting at war. You haven\u2019t been home in years. We\u2019ve been on the road forever. We\u2019re finally almost there, and you decide to stop now. Here.\u201d She opened her hands to gesture to the land around them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe horses needed to graze.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t buy it for a minute. \u201cBut aren\u2019t you excited to get home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy excited, do you mean agitated?\u201d He gave a humor-less laugh. \u201cThen, aye, I am excited indeed.\u201d</p><p>She studied him. The dark look on his face spoke to something more than just whether or not they\u2019d kissed. \u201cIs it your father? Are you worried about seeing your father? You\u2019d said he was . . . sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He raised his chin, inhaling deeply. \u201cMayhap that\u2019s a part of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your mom is fine, though, right? Aren\u2019t you looking forward to seeing her?\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s sharp laugh startled her. \u201cMy mother. Looking forward to seeing my mother? No, lass, that wouldn\u2019t exactly be my choice of words.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to see your mom?\u201d Disbelief tinged her voice.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want to see her.

Do you know how lucky you are to even have a mom?\u201d</p> <p>Her mind went to her own mother, gone for how many years now? All Felicity had were pictures. A white-bordered and faded snapshot of her mom as a young girl, in a yellow dress, with blonde bangs and hair curled under. As a teenager, captured by someone\u2019s Kodak Instamatic, her hair angular and shaggy. Holding Felicity\u2019s hand for her first day of kindergarten, her mom wearing big, dangly earrings and a men\u2019s felt hat.</p><p>\u201cGod, what I wouldn\u2019t do to have a mom to disagree with,\u201d she said in a small voice. She thought about how hard it must be for women in the seventeenth century. For a woman whose husband was ill, especially. \u201cCome on, Will, how bad can she be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow bad, Felicity?\u201d His voice was cool, shutting her out. Standing, he politely reached a hand down to pull her up. \u201cCome, then. I will show you how bad.\u201d</p><p>They rode in uncomfortable silence. Will was stiff and brusque, and he acted as if he were headed for the executioner instead of on his way home.</p><p>Duncrub was much like Will had described. A grand manor house made of stone, with ivy climbing the exterior walls, and stout chimneys announcing a generous smattering of fireplaces within. There wasn\u2019t a single Disney-esque turret in sight.</p> <p>She was startled by how Will was received. The household staff clearly recognized him, but they acted as if he were the taxman instead of a long-missed son.</p><p>\u201cCan I not just go to my own rooms?\u201d Will asked a cold-eyed maid.</p><p>\u201cNo, m\u2019lord.\u201d She whisked them into a large room with a marble fireplace and paneled with dark, glossy wood. \u201cAll guests are received in the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, I am a guest.\u201d Leaning down to Felicity\u2019s ear, he grumbled, \u201cIt seems I am no longer welcome to wander at my leisure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilliam.\u201d</p><p>They spun in tandem, and Felicity saw at once what had made Will want to stop and rest by the roadside.</p> <p>His mother was lovely. Perfect. A bun coiled tightly at the nape of her neck, not a hair out of place. Though marbled by strands of gray, her hair would still be considered brown. Her skin was just beginning to thin with age, but wasn\u2019t so very lined, and Felicity sensed immediately this woman\u2019s fury for the beauty she\u2019d once been.</p><p>Eek.</p><p>Her gaze swept disdainfully over Felicity. Her eyes were darker than Will\u2019s, cold and flat, like shiny stones.</p><p>A young man appeared at the doorway, and his mother turned, her sharp chin darting like a striking snake. \u201cFetch William\u2019s father,\u201d she ordered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I doubted you,\u201d Felicity whispered quickly. She reached for Will\u2019s hand and gave his fingers a surreptitious squeeze.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched. She savored it, imagining it was as big a smile as she was going to get for some time.</p><p>His mother turned her attention back to them. \u201cWho is . . . this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is Felicity Wallace.\u201d Will\u2019s hand came to rest protectively at the small of her back. It was a small gesture, but for a moment it made Felicity feel as though she could slay dragons.</p> <p>\u201cSo pleased to make your acquaintance,\u201d she said, managing a smile. Unsure what she should say, she\u2019d chosen what she considered a very old-fashioned-movie turn of phrase.</p><p>The room was uncomfortably silent. Felicity\u2019s smile felt like a grimace on her face. C\u2019mon Will, the hand is nice, but throw me a line here.</p><p>Shouldn\u2019t the woman shake her hand, introduce herself, something? \u201cI . . . I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know what I should call you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am Lady Rollo.\u201d His mother\u2019s tone spoke to confusion and just a hint of outrage.</p><p>\u201cOh . . .\u201d Jeez, lady. Give me a break. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Felicity was saved by a bustling at the door. A small army of household staff bore Will\u2019s father into the room on an elaborately reinforced chair.</p><p>\u201cI thought you should see the thing your father has become,\u201d Lady Rollo said, turning her back to her husband. \u201cI gave up waiting for you to show up, to give me your condolences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been away.\u201d Will\u2019s hand pressed harder at Felicity\u2019s back, and she wondered if he might just need that little bit of contact too. The anguish furrowing his brow made her wish she could wrap her arms around him.</p><p>Tell her, Will. Tell her you\u2019re a war hero. Tell her you\u2019ve been fighting noble fights.</p><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d he added, eyeing his father across the room, \u201ccondolences don\u2019t exactly seem in order. The man doesn\u2019t appear to be dead yet.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze went to the old man in the chair. Though the staff had faced him toward the window, she would\u2019ve sworn Will\u2019s father canted his head their way.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say happened to your father?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cHe suffered a spell,\u201d Lady Rollo clipped out.</p><p>The man\u2019s eyes appeared to track the scene in the room.</p><p>Not a spell. A stroke.</p><p>\u201cIt was quite ghastly,\u201d his mother continued. \u201c \u2019Twould have been better if he\u2019d simply died.\u201d</p><p>Felicity\u2019s eyes shot to Will at such a hideous statement, but his gaze didn\u2019t swerve from his father.</p><p>Standing tall, she strode over to where his father sat. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, sir.\u201d She took the man\u2019s hand in hers and gave it a squeeze. \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you about, girl?\u201d Lady Rollo\u2019s words burst from her like a blizzard through an opened door.</p><p>\u201cI think . . . I think your husband\u2019s spell . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat man is not my husband. That is a driveling shell of my husband.\u201d</p><p>Felicity looked into the man\u2019s eyes, and she knew she saw a spark there. She took a deep breath.</p><p>Pissing off the future mother-in-law. Not a great start.</p><p>\u201cI bet this . . . episode,\u201d Felicity ventured, \u201cit probably just harmed his body, not his mind.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d chosen her words with care, but Lady Rollo spun on her all the same. \u201cAre you a physician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Felicity felt about two feet tall.</p><p>\u201cThen you have no notion of what\u2019s transpired here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough, Mother.\u201d Will\u2019s voice was steely. \u201cWe\u2019ve paid our regards. If you\u2019re through, I need to tend to the mounts.\u201d</p><p>Felicity shot him a desperate look. There was no way she could stay without him in the room. She was a people person, but this was way over her head. She wanted to get out of there too.</p><p>But Will\u2019s mother beat her to it. \u201cA man of your station in the stables . . . Vulgar.\u201d Lady Rollo was indignant, her tone contemptuous as she stalked to the door. \u201cThis whole situation . . . Vulgar,\u201d she hissed, storming from the room.</p><p>Will ignored his mother and looked at Felicity instead. Ambient light struck his face just so, igniting the golds and browns and greens of his eyes. They were warm on her, and Felicity thought she saw affection there. \u201cI truly must go and tend the horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I\u2014?\u201d She stood, walked toward him.</p><p>\u201cBest not.\u201d His eyes cut to his father. \u201cWe\u2019ve enough to explain as it is. I\u2019ll return soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she relented. \u201cThen I\u2019d like to stay and sit with your dad for a while, if it\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>His nod was almost imperceptible, some untold emotion lining his features.</p><p>\u201cAnd Will? Make sure to drape a blanket over Laddie\u2019s belly. I think it\u2019s good for his digestion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He pinched her chin between his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll make certain they walk the lad before stabling him for the night.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 12</p><p>The old wooden bucket sat just where it always had. Will nudged it with his foot. All the times he\u2019d eagerly dragged that bucket out, flipped it over, and clambered up onto a horse for his morning ride.</p><p>In the days before.</p><p>Before his accident. Before he\u2019d seen the flash in his brother\u2019s eyes that day. Decades had passed, but still that look haunted him. Such glee had twinkled in young Jamie\u2019s eyes, at the sight of Will\u2019s terror.</p><p>To see such malice in one\u2019s own blood was to lose one\u2019s innocence forever.</p><p>Rollo walked to the old stall. Stepping inside, he ran his cane along the floor, leaving a faint line in the hard- packed dirt.</p><p>Though raked out long ago, the whiff of hay and the faint tang of urine prickled his nostrils. The smell of the stables had once been so reassuring. It was a rich scent, of manure and leather oil, and he couldn\u2019t help but find the ghost of it reassuring now.</p><p>If only he could turn his back on everything and fill his days with serenity like this. Since arriving home, he\u2019d returned frequently to check on their horses, deciding he\u2019d give up battles, and plots, and kings to lead a life of peaceful seclusion. To have mornings spent in the stables, his greatest concerns the baling of hay and the breeding of mares.</p><p>He leaned against the stall door, remembering the child he\u2019d been. And remembering that poor, damned pony. He\u2019d been put down that very day. His father had put the bullet in the beast\u2019s head himself.</p><p>Will lifted his cane, pushing open the shutters of a small window. He\u2019d been so proud of that bloody animal, his first sight of it with its head out that window, greeting him with a chuff and a twitch of its ears. Dust motes were all that filled the space now, flashes of white floating in the dim stall.</p><p>Aside from his and Felicity\u2019s mounts grazing in a paddock out back, the stable was empty. His mother had no use for horses about. Caring for his feeble-minded father was enough for her.</p><p>He sighed deeply. What would his father have made of Will, returning with the strange and lovely Felicity in hand? Slapped him on the back, he was certain, with an about time, fool lad. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because it was his father most of all who\u2019d deluded himself about Will\u2019s injury. He never understood how so much more than his son\u2019s leg had been crushed that day. Hadn\u2019t understood why Will never chose to marry.</p><p>Their fortune would\u2019ve found him any number of brides, but it was Will\u2019s pride that kept him alone. He\u2019d not suffer the snickers of a pretty young thing when his back was turned. Or gasps of horror when they saw his crooked flesh.</p><p>Pretty young thing. Clenching his eyes shut, he slammed his head back against the warped wood. What was he doing with Felicity?</p> <p>Traveling with her had become pure torture. Renegade imaginings of the feel of her skin, or the curve of her naked body, had intensified. His fantasies darkening into pure, tor turous lust. He wanted to take her, have her. Bury himself in her.</p><p>Her teasing innuendo mocked him. She thought she wanted him. But she didn\u2019t know. She was a pretty young thing indeed, carried away on her whims, taken with the magic and the unreality of the moment.</p><p>A pretty young thing who\u2019d surely choose the next strapping Highlander to cross her path. He was sure he\u2019d been chosen by the universe, in some absurd stroke of cruelty, to find Felicity just that: some braw hero to sweep her away. Like James did Magda, or MacColla with his Haley.</p><p>But Rollo? Such was not his fate. His fate had been written in this very stall over thirty years past. He was a broken fool who\u2019d best remain alone.</p><p>The pretty young thing and The Fool, he thought, reaching for his sporran. Carefully he opened the pouch. Carefully removed the strange and colorful card. He\u2019d secured it away, and it was as clean and unbent as the day he\u2019d peeled it from Felicity\u2019s arm. The Fool.</p> <p>Him.</p><p>The universe didn\u2019t get much clearer than that.</p><p>Footsteps sounded at the door of the stable. Swiftly tucking the card away, Rollo marshaled his features into a careful mask.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d The whispered voice was furtive, hesitant.</p><p>Rollo sighed, pulled away from the wall. Peering into the shadows, he knew whom he\u2019d see. The figure was backlit, setting his red hair to a frizzy auburn halo.</p><p>\u201cOrmonde.\u201d Will shook his head. \u201cHave you ever in your life made a conventional entrance?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut conventions can get so tedious, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d He strode to Will, clapped him on the shoulder. \u201cNow tell me what has you sulking in a dank barn, friend. I\u2019ve spied your woman up at the house. Not getting along with the dearest Lady Rollo, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOho.\u201d Will gave him a small smile. \u201cIs that why you seek me out here? You\u2019re afraid to run into my mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo woman scares me.\u201d Ormonde gave a rakish cock to his brow. \u201cBut truly. Your brother has been spotted. And so I must make haste. You\u2019ll recall, Jamie and I weren\u2019t the fastest of friends. And though my room at the Tower was charming indeed, I quite prefer less, shall we say, restrictive accommodations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie\u2019s about?\u201d Will\u2019s tone grew hard. He was instantly on his guard, wondering just what would drive Ormonde to take such a risk. \u201cWhat could possibly bring you here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019d not believe me if I said it was the pleasure of your company?\u201d</p><p>Rollo\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cThought not.\u201d Ormonde plucked a bit of hay from his sleeve, gathering his thoughts. \u201cI need to ask you a favor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA favor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye. We need you to travel\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not go back to London,\u201d Will stated simply.</p><p>\u201cIt would be but a brief stop on your way to Belgium.\u201d Ormonde blunted his words with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ve found a man who\u2019ll take you across the water, to Calais. You\u2019ll need to dress as a fisher\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelgium?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur king is in exile there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know who\u2019s in Belgium,\u201d Will snapped.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been ferrying correspondence between our men in London and Charles II, in Bruges. I\u2019m afraid I can no longer make the trip. You saw firsthand what happened the last time I set foot in England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is too much, Ormonde. Spy games leave the taste of cowardice in my mouth. I\u2019m a fighting man. I face my enemies in the open. I\u2019ve battled for the King, and would go to battle again. But these intrigues? I am finished with them.\u201d</p><p>Both men froze, hearing muffled sounds outside. The low chuff of a horse, an answering whinny.</p><p>\u201cAway,\u201d Will hissed. \u201cQuick now.\u201d</p><p>He heard boots hit the ground. A man dismounting.</p><p>Ormonde scanned the row of stalls. His eyes were bright and alert.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a door,\u201d Will whispered. \u201cThrough there.\u201d Putting a hand to his friend\u2019s shoulder, Rollo pointed to an abandoned tack room at the rear of the stable. \u201cBest not come back.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Ormonde raced away, the dirt and dust of the old corridor swirling in his wake.</p><p>Chapter 13</p><p>Will walked forward, putting space between him and his friend. He wasn\u2019t surprised when Jamie\u2019s silhouette appeared in the doorway.</p><p>\u201cI knew I\u2019d find you in the barn.\u201d Scowling, Jamie used his toe to scrape a chunk of mud from his boot heel. \u201cStill haven\u2019t grown up, have you, Willie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJamie.\u201d The name echoed cold in the deserted stable.</p><p>The last time they\u2019d seen each other, he\u2019d freed Ormonde from under Jamie\u2019s nose. Will imagined his brother had come seeking revenge, though it was audacious of him to appear in broad daylight. Jamie generally preferred skulking about in the shadows.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you show your face here,\u201d Will said evenly.</p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d Jamie sauntered down the stable corridor, mindlessly running his fingers along the wall as he approached. \u201cI could say the same of you. \u2019Tis I who find a parent here, after all. Not you. Mother never could stomach your legs, now, could she?\u201d</p><p>Standing erect, Will adjusted his grip on the handle of his cane, poised to fight if necessary. \u201cIs that what you\u2019ve come to say to me? My body\u2019s destroyed and there\u2019s no beast for you to maim, so instead you bait me with taunts of our mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Brother dear. I know you better than that. I know you\u2019re happy torturing your own damn self.\u201d Laughing, he glanced over Will\u2019s shoulder to the end of the barn. \u201cI\u2019ve actually come to make peace,\u201d Jamie continued. \u201cFor Mother. Have the Rollo boys be as one once more.\u201d</p><p>Will bristled. He edged down the corridor, closer to Jamie and away from Ormonde, hoping his friend had already fled through the tack room door. \u201cNever have we been as one. What is it you really want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? I even brought your little cane with me. As a peace offering.\u201d</p><p>Rollo noticed his cane for the first time\u2014the one he\u2019d abandoned at the Tower\u2014dangling beside Jamie\u2019s sword in the scabbard at his side. He\u2019d had it specially fashioned, secreting a lethally sharp blade within a walking stick, creating a masterpiece among weapons.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. Jamie would know what it meant to him. The gesture would not be made without some hidden price.</p><p>\u201cTake it then.\u201d Jamie pulled the cane from his side, handed it to Will. \u201cAnd we can be as brothers again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrothers who keep finding themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield.\u201d</p><p>Jamie shrugged. \u201cYou wound me, Willie.\u201d He glanced around, scowling, and muttered, \u201cChrist, I don\u2019t know how you can abide this stink. You always did love the fetid confines of the stable yard.\u201d</p><p>He brushed the dust from his dun-colored britches as if all were settled. \u201cCome now, Mother awaits.\u201d Pinning Rollo with a searching look, he added, \u201cAs does that woman of yours. I saw her, you know.\u201d</p><p>Anger erupted, molten steel in his chest. Felicity was off-limits. He\u2019d not have her near his brother. Not have her be even in sight of him.</p><p>Will had to protect her, but carefully. If Jamie got even a whiff of jealousy, that would be it. His brother destroyed everything Will had ever cared about. Jamie had maimed his animal: what would he do to Felicity if he got the idea she were his woman?</p><p>Will kept his face a careful blank, and so Jamie continued, pressing, \u201cNicely done, that. She\u2019s a luscious trifle of a thing, with a sweet pair of tits.\u201d</p><p>Jamie began to walk back down the corridor, musing aloud. \u201cThough generally I prefer a little more ass on a woman. Something to hold onto.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s body grew rigid, rage flexing his every muscle. Still. Be still and betray nothing.</p><p>\u201cBut what I\u2019d like to know is why she\u2019s with you,\u201d Jamie went on. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel she\u2019s too . . . pretty for you. Where on earth did you find her, and pray tell, why is she with you?\u201d</p><p>Will stood, frozen in place. His brother walked ahead, oblivious.</p><p>\u201cIt must be asked, is the girl a wee bit daft? She\u2019s up there attempting conversation with our half-wit father.\u201d</p><p>Will was seething now, imagining all the various ways in which he could murder his brother. He bore both canes now: his favorite, the one which hid his sword, and the one he\u2019d bought as a replacement when he\u2019d thought the other lost to the Tower of London.</p><p>He lifted them both from the ground. He\u2019d had years in which to perfect the use of all manner of staves, rods, and walking sticks as weapons. Mapped into his brain were dozens of ways to maim, or to kill. A few swift motions and he could have Jamie cold on the ground.</p><p>Lash across the knee. The handle hooks the neck, reaps him down. A strike across the temple finishes it.</p><p>Jamie grew still. Enemies they may be, but first they\u2019d been brothers, and brothers knew. He\u2019d have sensed the change in Will, would be poised for his attack.</p><p>Will contemplated his brother\u2019s stiffened back, gathering himself. He\u2019d not sink to Jamie\u2019s level. The man was naught more than a swine, and Will refused to roll about in the muck.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he set the tips of his canes back in the dirt. Affecting a cavalier posture he didn\u2019t feel, Will strolled ahead. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he didn\u2019t see the malice hidden from him, a reptilian smile that curved slowly at Jamie\u2019s mouth.</p><p>The stroll back to the house had been a misery. Will hated his slow pace. Hated even more to be the object of his brother\u2019s scrutiny. Jamie walked alongside him, making idle chatter, but Will knew that his brother would\u2019ve been taking great pleasure in the plodding gait.</p><p>By the time they reached their mother\u2019s drawing room, Will\u2019s simmering anger sought release. And it took aim at the most vulnerable of targets.</p> <p>Felicity.</p><p>He\u2019d spent a lifetime taking great pains to fortify himself against his brother\u2019s attacks. That she\u2019d made him vulnerable to Jamie\u2019s scorn infuriated him.</p><p>They walked in and there she knelt, by his father at the window. They\u2019d been at Duncrub for a few days now, and he kept finding her just there. He wondered what she could possibly be thinking of, trying to engage his father.</p><p>Sunlight canted in at an angle, pricking bright white strands in her blonde hair. Her prettiness mocked him, fueling his anger.</p><p>\u201cFelicity.\u201d He bit her name out, hating the feel of his brother at his back. Hating the sight of his once strapping father, now drooling and decrepit, staring dumbly out the window.</p> <p>But then she turned, greeting him with such a look of open pleasure, he had to grip his canes to fight his knees from buckling.</p><p>\u201cWill,\u201d she said, smiling. Then he saw her eyes go cold as she looked to his brother.</p><p>And Will swelled with pride, in that moment feeling Felicity\u2019s beautiful smile to be the greatest victory of all.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you then,\u201d Jamie said with a chill in his voice, \u201cfor the family reunion. Be sure not to tip Father dear over, Mistress Felicity. He\u2019s best approached as more a decorative element than actual additional company.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJerk,\u201d Felicity said as Jamie left the room. She curled her upper lip in a little sneer.</p><p>Will fought not to beam at the darling sight of it. How often he\u2019d made his own sneers at Jamie\u2019s back. \u201cIf by that you mean my brother\u2019s a scurrilous jackass of a human being, then, aye, he\u2019s a jerk indeed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJackass?\u201d She giggled. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you say something like, I don\u2019t know, knave, or blackguard instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, and all seventeenth-century men must speak as though we\u2019re John Donne?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is, but William Rollo, I think you just made a joke.\u201d Her face stilled in amazement, and the light in her eyes cracked his heart as a chisel would stone.</p><p>Felicity stood, and she felt a pang letting go of the moment they\u2019d just shared. She didn\u2019t know what it was that had just happened, but she did know she wanted to discuss Will\u2019s dad before his jerky brother came back in the room.</p><p>She beckoned him closer, but Will had gone back to looking at her as if she had the plague.</p><p>\u201cCome on, I won\u2019t bite.\u201d She felt a little flicker in her chest, wondering what it meant that he had such a response to her. \u201cCome here. I want to show you something. With your dad,\u201d she added, getting impatient.</p><p>As he approached, Felicity tried to see Will\u2019s father as he would see him. He\u2019d clearly been an attractive man in his day. And he wasn\u2019t an old man by any means, by modern standards at least. She estimated he was in his sixties, with Will\u2019s thick, waving hair turned silver, and the same bright, hazel eyes.</p><p>And though his face was a frozen mask, it was those eyes that gave him away. They danced with light, and she was shocked that no one could see it.</p> <p>\u201cWill, your father\u2019s not senile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather not speak of\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow look,\u201d Felicity said, ignoring him. She leaned in and pointed to the right side of his father\u2019s face. \u201cSee how this side of his face looks different? Your father\u2019s . . . spell . . . or whatever it was that your mom called it, wasn\u2019t a spell at all.\u201d</p><p>She stood and, speaking directly to the older man, said, \u201cYou, sir, had a stroke.\u201d</p><p>Will only watched her. His skepticism was so frustrating. He should be jumping for joy, but all she saw was his grief, simmering just below the surface.</p><p>\u201cA stroke,\u201d she repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s like a little explosion that happens in the brain. Well, I don\u2019t know how it works, but Will, your father\u2019s still in there. He\u2019s just having trouble moving.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her knees to lean closer. \u201cHave you ever tried asking him to blink? Like, having him blink if he understands? Seriously,\u201d she said, looking up at Rollo, her frustration growing.</p><p>Will\u2019s silence had been annoying her, but now it seemed like he was ignoring her outright. \u201cAm I the only one who can see that the lights are on in there?\u201d she asked, raising her voice.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no cause to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo yell? I\u2019ll yell if I want to. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re not listening to me. The poor man has been left to just sit here. Will, your father\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur father can\u2019t help you now, Willie.\u201d</p><p>Jamie stood at the door, chuckling. \u201cLovers\u2019 quarrel?\u201d</p><p>Felicity opened her mouth to give the creep what for, but Will shot her a glare so sharp and so abrupt as to silence her at once.</p><p>\u201cI heard the commotion and simply had to bear witness. A woman who can get a rise out of my brother?\u201d Jamie made a lewd sneer. \u201cWell, I doubt you could get a rise out of him. He is a cripple, after all.\u201d</p><p>Jamie wasn\u2019t half the man his younger brother was, and she wished Will would just walk across the room and clock him one with his cane. But Will merely stood, straight as an arrow, so still he seemed to have stopped breathing.</p><p>\u201cEasy now!\u201d Jamie laughed. \u201cI jest, I jest. But I see I must guard my words.\u201d He walked to Felicity. \u201cI\u2019d have you believe the best of your future brother-in-law, dear girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot\u201d\u2014he interrupted Will at once, his eyes narrowed\u2014\u201cyour intended?\u201d</p><p>Felicity\u2019s heart fell. Weren\u2019t they supposed to be pretending a betrothal? Didn\u2019t they kind of almost have a betrothal?</p><p>Jamie turned his attention to her, his eyes roving her body in a slow and overly familiar sweep.</p><p>She crossed her arms, feeling suddenly overly exposed in the low-cut gown. Dream on, punk.</p><p>\u201cHow could it be?\u201d Jamie mused. He waited until his brother\u2019s back was turned to add in a voice pitched suggestively low, \u201cThen perhaps I\u2019ll be the one to curry your favor.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 14</p><p>Felicity loved the shush-shush sound her leather slippers made along the slate-paved floor. The long corridor was dim and empty, and wearing her new gown she felt like some distinguished and mysterious lady making her way back to her boudoir for the evening.</p><p>Or maybe like an impassioned, melancholy nun. Like one of those women in The Sound of Music.</p><p>Well, maybe not a nun. Someone very grand, though, certainly.</p><p>The door to what Will had referred to as the solar was open, and she peeked in, gasping at the sight. Light slanted in through ceiling-high windows. An elaborately carved hearth framed one end of the room, which was furnished with a few small sofas, a card table, and writing desk.</p><p>Writing desk.</p><p>She decided suddenly that she\u2019d love a little bit of paper. Just a sheet or two. Just enough to write a letter to Livvie. Even if it didn\u2019t get delivered for a few hundred years, it would be a way to communicate with her aunt.</p><p>She looked up and down the hall and darted inside. The chair gave a squeak as she sat, and she grimaced, her heart pounding. It wasn\u2019t like she was doing anything wrong, she assured herself.</p><p>Just a sheet of paper.</p><p>Then why did she feel so nervous?</p><p>Gently she pulled open the door of the slant-top desk and the hinges gave a hideous squeal.</p><p>Ooh . . . fast fast fast. Just a quick peek. Just for paper.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you?\u201d</p><p>Oh damn. She let loose an exaggerated grimace while her back was still turned. Did it have to be his mom? Felicity felt her face go twelve shades of red.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, mustering her dignity. Pasting a smile on her face, she looked over her shoulder. \u201cI was just looking for paper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d Rollo\u2019s mother glided into the room, an exquisite vision in royal blue, her hair pulled back sleek and tight at the nape of her neck. She came to stand over Felicity\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019d be wanting to write to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d You have no idea, lady. If only she could write to her aunt and get some advice on how to handle this situation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see to it that paper is sent to your room.\u201d</p><p>Felicity stammered a thank-you, then stared dumbly, waiting for conversational inspiration to strike.</p><p>Your son sure is hot, Mrs. Rollo.</p><p>Wow, you really are an ice queen, ma\u2019am.</p><p>\u201cYou have a lovely home, Lady Rollo.\u201d</p><p>That got the frost to melt a little bit.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d His mother gave an august nod, the queen humoring her subject.</p><p>Felicity smiled broadly. She shoots, she scores. The old Felicity Wallace charm could warm up the iciest of grande dames. \u201cDuncrub Castle is so much more . . . gorgeous . . . than I expected. Will had told me it was more like a manor house than a castle. And he was right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed?\u201d The Lady Rollo pursed her lips.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes.\u201d We\u2019ll be fast friends. Maybe she\u2019ll teach me to embroider. \u201cI expected turrets and flags.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Was that a flicker of humor on his mom\u2019s face? Felicity smiled hopefully. I\u2019ll get her to warm up and she\u2019ll be like the mom I never had. She gave a good- natured giggle. \u201cAnd maybe even a moat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut this isn\u2019t like some old, cold castle at all,\u201d Felicity said, imagining her and Will\u2019s children running around the grand halls. They\u2019d do things like play cricket, or whist.</p><p>Will\u2019s mother eyed her, then asked carefully, \u201cWhere did you say your family was from?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMe? Oh, from . . .\u201d She took a moment to make sure she remembered all the details. \u201cFrom outside Glasgow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>Lady Rollo seemed frosty again, and Felicity couldn\u2019t figure out what might have happened.</p> <p>\u201cHello dear.\u201d She nodded a greeting over the younger woman\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Felicity\u2019s anxiety was replaced with a little thrill of anticipation. Will? She\u2019d been dying to run into him. A whole day had passed since they\u2019d last seen each other, plus she was wearing a new dress. It was the prettiest lavender color, and she\u2019d shimmied her breasts high in the corset herself.</p><p>She was getting the hang of this period thing, for sure. If he isn\u2019t going to take charge, she thought with a quick perusal of her bodice, I\u2019ll just have to drop some serious hints myself.</p><p>Drawing her shoulders back, she tried to mimic Lady Rollo\u2019s elegance. She turned, and deflated at once.</p><p>Jamie.</p> <p>His eyes were waiting for her, an oily little smile wrinkling at the corners.</p><p>Creep creep creepy.</p><p>\u201cJamie, dearest, our guest seems quite . . . taken with our Duncrub. Perhaps you\u2019d take her for a stroll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s really not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be an honor,\u201d he said at once, striding over to help her from her seat. Jamie took her arm in his. \u201cI fear my brother has been neglecting you.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. The close proximity was unwelcome, the feel of this man\u2019s body touching hers repugnant. \u201cNot at all,\u201d she mumbled, wondering how she could possibly get out of it.</p> <p>\u201cHas he yet shown you our lovely Kincladie Wood?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe . . . no.\u201d Her eyes brightened. \u201cBut there\u2019s really no possible way I could go into woods with these shoes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Jamie used the excuse to peruse the length of her.</p><p>Creep.</p><p>\u201cThe path is dry, and you are perfectly outfitted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d really rather not. I . . . I\u2019m feeling quite tired all of a sudden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen a walk is just the thing to invigorate you. I shall show you the Roman fort. Has Willie told you about it?\u201d</p><p>Rollo was so not a Willie. And why hadn\u2019t he shown her around more? \u201cNo,\u201d she replied, trying to hide her frown.</p> <p>\u201cThen we must go. Come,\u201d he said with a little tug to her arm. \u201cI just saw Willie himself, outside. Perhaps he\u2019ll join us.\u201d</p><p>At the possibility of seeing Will, she demurred. And though they didn\u2019t run into him, the walk was surprisingly pleasant, along gentle rolls through lush pastureland, amid old trees, clumps of wildflowers, and the reddish fronds of late-season ferns.</p><p>He told her how the Roman Empire had made its way there centuries ago, and they walked among the furrows of what he claimed were an old Roman rampart and ditch.</p><p>Felicity found herself growing a little easier. Maybe Will\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t all bad.</p><p>\u201cScotland has so much texture,\u201d she said, unthinking.</p><p>Jamie was silent for a moment. This Felicity truly was a peculiar one. But so lovely, and unaffected, and he found he couldn\u2019t take his eyes from her.</p><p>The last woman he lay with was his wife, and she had the jowly, tight- lipped look of a Campbell. The woman he\u2019d married was nothing like this flower. The walk had flushed her cheeks pink, and her d\u00e9colletage glowed dewy and pale. He knew she\u2019d have dressed with his damned brother in mind, but it was Willie\u2019s own fault if he chose not to appreciate the boon he\u2019d been offered.</p><p>\u201cAye, and just there\u201d\u2014he pointed to a low shrub\u2014\u201cyou can see the brambles have ripened.\u201d</p><p>Jamie couldn\u2019t help but flick his gaze down, taking in Felicity\u2019s own ripened fruits. He licked his lips, studying her profile.</p><p>\u201cBrambles? I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve never seen . . .\u201d She roved her eyes over the sea of greenery, uncertain what he was pointing to.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be so easy, could it? Jamie chuckled low. \u201cHave you not seen brambles then?\u201d</p><p>The girl shook her head in guileless wonder, and he thought how Willie really was missing a good bet.</p><p>He walked to one of the bushes tangling the edge of their path and began to pluck a handful of small, ripe berries.</p><p>\u201cOh, blackberries!\u201d she said brightly. \u201cHow funny, you call them brambles?\u201d She looked up at him and Jamie watched as Felicity caught herself, schooling her radiant exuberance into something flatter and primmer.</p><p>Too easy.</p><p>She reached her hand out to try one, but Jamie gave a shake to his head, and brought a berry up to her mouth. Her lips parted automatically, but she blushed at once, looking away.</p><p>A small drop of juice darkened the corner of her lip, and Jamie inhaled sharply, fighting the urge to lean down and take her mouth with his.</p><p>He raised his hand instead, and, cupping her face, he dabbed his thumb along Felicity\u2019s lower lip. He\u2019d meant to pass it off as a cavalier gesture, but his groin tightened at the silk of her skin against his roughened hand, and he dragged the tip of his thumb slowly along her mouth.</p><p>She recoiled. \u201cGet your hands off me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>Hastily, she turned to walk from him. His heartbeat sped. He imagined grabbing those hips, spinning her in his arms.</p><p>She walked briskly from him, a nervous filly. \u201cI . . . You . . .\u201d She fumbled for words. What was that he heard in her voice? Excitement?</p><p>He watched the play of her fine shoulder blades under that creamy skin. Followed the line of her spine down to what he was sure was a tight little ass.</p><p>Giving a shake to his head, he adjusted the growing thickness in his britches.</p><p>She stopped before a crude stone monument\u2014a cross atop a pile of gray stones. Simple white lettering declared: MAGGIE WALL BURNT HERE 1657 AS A WITCH.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve found our monument to dear, mad Maggie.\u201d Jamie came to stand at her side, resting his hand on her lower back. \u201cShe was burnt here, only last year. Pity.\u201d</p><p>He eased his hand down. Felt the answering rustle of layers of crisp petticoat. She hopped a step to the side.</p><p>\u201cThe more zealous of our townsfolk claimed she was a witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . .\u201d Felicity swung to look at him, her face blanched the color of the whitewashed letters. \u201cA witch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to fear.\u201d He chuckled, amused by her na\u00efvet\u00e9. \u201cThey say the flames sear the soul from the body. Maggie\u2019s spirit is long gone from here.\u201d</p><p>Felicity looked frightened, her face the picture of vulnerability and innocence. Now is the moment to offer comfort, Jamie thought, and he reached for her. Wrapped his hand behind her neck to pull her close.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she shrieked, swatting his hand aside. \u201cPig.\u201d</p><p>The venom took him aback, and he felt an answering wave of hostility sweep cold through his chest.</p><p>\u201cSaving yourself for the cripple? You need a man. I don\u2019t imagine wee Willie could get his prick hard if he tried.\u201d He grabbed her hand, brought it to his crotch.</p><p>\u201cWhat the . . .\u201d Felicity screamed, pulling her hand hard from his.</p><p>Fury flushed her cheeks red, and Jamie laughed at the sight. He should\u2019ve known she\u2019d not be up for a good game. Pathetic, just like his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d She strode ahead, and Jamie had the sense of her being a small and weak thing.</p><p>\u201cAnd by the way,\u201d she ranted, \u201cyou are such an unbelievable jerk to be hitting on your brother\u2019s woman.\u201d</p><p>His lust soured into loathing. \u201cYou\u2019re a fool if you think our Willie will marry a girl like you.\u201d He watched as she marched ahead, fighting the impulse to catch up to her and shove her faster along the path.</p><p>Until he looked over his shoulder, glimpsing once more the stone grave marker.</p><p>MAGGIE WALL BURNT HERE 1657 AS A WITCH.</p><p>And Jamie\u2019s glower eased, chilling into a slow, calculated smile.</p><p>Chapter 15</p><p>Will opened his bedroom door to find Felicity in the hallway, panting, and with her fist poised to knock.</p><p>\u201cFinally,\u201d she exclaimed, bursting into his room. She was breathless and agitated, but it only made her look all the more radiant.</p><p>She was wearing her new gown, and the bodice molded to her body like a second skin. The light purple color set off the blonde in her hair, and the effect was like lavender flowers and sunshine.</p><p>Will scrubbed a hand over his face. What madness had him waxing so rhapsodic?</p><p>Fool. You\u2019re naught but a fool.</p><p>\u201cWhere have you been all day?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cJust here,\u201d he replied cautiously. Looking from her to the door, he added, \u201cWhere you should not be. It\u2019s entirely inappropriate for you to be in my rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that.\u201d She stormed back, pushing the door to. \u201cYour brother just made a pass at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA . . .\u201d He furrowed his brows, a cold knot settling in his belly. \u201cWhat did Jamie do to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left me alone all day, and he, you know, he tried to touch me.\u201d</p><p>The chill in his gut froze into white fury. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, startling him. \u201cI\u2019ll kill him. Jerk. He\u2019s a total jerk.\u201d She stormed to the window, staring out.</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he bit out. \u201cFelicity.\u201d It was all he could say. He wanted to go to her. Comfort her. And then murder Jamie.</p><p>Instead, he fisted his hands at his sides. He needed to get her out of there. His brother and mother were poison. The latter had spent the better part of the afternoon interrogating him about their guest\u2019s origins.</p><p>Will would have Felicity safe and away from prying eyes. And from roving hands especially.</p><p>\u201cI hate how he keeps calling you Willie,\u201d she grumbled.</p><p>Rollo\u2019s eyes shot to her. The woman had a knack for seeing things as he saw them.</p><p>\u201cAnd I am sorry.\u201d She rounded on him. \u201cYour mom isn\u2019t going to win any hospitality awards either. Your poor dad. Sitting down there all by himself all the time. Jamie and your mom treat him like he\u2019s part of the furniture.\u201d</p><p>The chill in his heart warmed at her words. \u201cAre you quite finished?\u201d he asked patiently. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She gave him a rueful smile, then inhaling deeply, looked back out the window. \u201cI had to get it off my chest. I feel better now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad of it, lass, but I don\u2019t.\u201d He stepped closer to her. She didn\u2019t see as he reached his hand to hover just above her shoulder. And then, hesitating, pulled it back. \u201cJust stay away from my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will.\u201d She turned, and they both tensed to realize how close he\u2019d stepped to her. \u201cJust don\u2019t leave me again, all right?\u201d Her voice was small, sweetly vulnerable.</p> <p>And all Will wanted to do was take her in his arms. Nestle her close. Protect her from his bastard of a brother. From any who\u2019d dare to even look at her wrong.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you doing all day, anyway?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cToday?\u201d It took Rollo a second to get back in the moment. \u201cI spent the day trying to sort the best way to get you home. We must be away to Lochaber, I\u2019ve decided. To Cameron lands. There is one there who can help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go.\u201d She put her hands on her hips. \u201cYou can\u2019t make me go.\u201d</p><p>She stepped even closer to him, and he edged aside, bumping into the windowsill.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re really not getting it, are you?\u201d</p><p>He glanced away. It was too painful to look at her, and he gazed sightlessly out the window instead.</p><p>\u201cWill.\u201d She put her hand on his arm. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>His body grew rigid, instantly hard at her touch. At the sound of her gentle, sweet murmurings. The muscles of his bad leg began to tremble, so focused was he on keeping himself in check.</p><p>\u201cI want to be with you, Will. I don\u2019t know how much more plainly I can put it. Don\u2019t you get it? I was sent back for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d His voice was a tight rasp.</p> <p>This is it, she thought. This was her moment. He wanted to send her away, and she had to show him she needed to stay.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me . . .\u201d Her touch on his arm curled into a steady grip. She waited. Willed him to look at her.</p><p>And finally, he did.</p><p>His eyes sought hers, and they were tender, and pained, and needful, and the sight plucked a twinge in her heart. The light from the window set his hair to a thousand shades of brown, and she wondered how it was Will didn\u2019t realize he was the handsomest, the most desirable, the best of all men.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me,\u201d she said again, \u201cI\u2019ll just have to show you.\u201d</p><p>She reached her hand up to his cheek. He was tall, she thought distantly, taller than she\u2019d realized. The barest scruff of whiskers rasped against her palm. It was such a masculine thing, his nascent beard, and the sensation pushed her over the edge.</p><p>\u201cKiss me,\u201d she told him in the barest whisper.</p><p>And, finally, this time he did.</p> <p>His mouth came to hers. For the merest moment he was tentative, but with a moan in his throat, he quickly deepened the kiss. He grew demanding, claiming her, opening her to him.</p><p>He was more than she\u2019d even imagined he could be. Hard with just the right moments of gentle, tender but sure.</p><p>Finally. Finally, she was kissing her Viking. The thought thrilled through her. She felt herself open to him at once, was flooded with the need for him. Ached to have him near her, in her.</p><p>Though one hand twined in her hair, his other remained clenched at his side. As if the moment might somehow shatter, him barely holding on, bracing for some inevitable fall.</p><p>Urging him to touch her, Felicity wrapped her arms around him. Pulling him close, raking her fingers through his hair, along his back, under his waistcoat.</p><p>Touch me. She was frantic for him to let himself go. There was such passion in his kiss, but still she felt the wall he was struggling to keep between them.</p><p>Touch me touch me touch me.</p><p>Finally, she simply ran her hand down his arm. She realized he held tight to the handle of his cane. Felicity grasped his hand in hers, stroked her thumb along his wrist, and the cane clattered to the floor.</p><p>She pulled his hand up, brought it to her breast. And the groan he sounded came from deep in his soul as William Rollo finally let himself free.</p><p>His hands roved her, kneading her breasts, rubbing along her collarbone, her throat, the nape of her neck, and back down to her breast. He pinched her, rubbed the flat of his palm against her, and she thought it impossible to want a man more.</p><p>She pulled her mouth from his. \u201cKiss me,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Rollo put his forehead to hers. His eyes were dark and unfocused.</p><p>\u201cOch, woman.\u201d The husky burr in his voice brought a fresh surge of damp between her thighs. \u201cI am kissing you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Will.\u201d She arched her back. \u201cI mean . . .\u201d How much more could she put her breasts in his face, she wondered distantly. \u201cKiss me.\u201d</p><p>He growled then, an animal sound, tight with lust and need and other dark things. Slipping his hand beneath her neckline, he freed a breast from her bodice. She felt his moan on her sensitive skin as he sucked her into his mouth.</p><p>Her nipples beaded tight, her want for him excruciating. She arched nearer to him. Threaded her fingers into his hair, pulling him tighter, closer.</p><p>There was a distant sound, and she felt him grow still. Her breast slipped from his mouth, bobbing to rest on the shelf of her loosened bodice.</p><p>Will moved his head up slowly. Reluctantly. \u201cThis is not the place for . . . us.\u201d He gave her a chaste kiss on the forehead. Tucked her back in her dress, silently, reverently.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be the death of me, woman.\u201d He gently wiped the glisten of moisture from her lips, wet and swollen from his kiss. \u201cBut I die for you a happy man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Will.\u201d She tenderly cupped his cheek.</p><p>\u201cNo, Felicity. Hear me. You are a gift. A wonder. And if I die tomorrow, I die complete.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said, making a breathy sound that was barely a laugh. \u201cDon\u2019t die tomorrow, now that you\u2019ve finally kissed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, love . . .\u201d</p><p>Love. They caught it at the same time. The word had come lightly from his lips, but the sound of it locked their gazes, and intensity held their eyes connected. A thrill crackled through her chest, warming Felicity through.</p><p>And Rollo gave her a smile then. A full, open smile, and it was as though he\u2019d never truly smiled before that moment.</p><p>Jamie stepped away from the door in disgust. To deny him, and then offer herself to the cripple?</p><p>It was unimaginable.</p><p>Willie may have won the battle, but it\u2019d be Jamie who\u2019d win the war.</p><p>And he knew just the battlefield.</p><p>Chapter 16</p><p>Witchcraft was a foolish notion. But quite efficient when it came to dispatching unruly women.</p><p>The memory of his brother suckling at Felicity like some ravenous calf made Jamie\u2019s chest tight with rage. Unruly indeed.</p><p>He\u2019d taken a brief detour, wanting to pass the grave marker before he got to Saint Serf\u2019s. Jamie contemplated the stone cross, the crudely painted words. Maggie Wall burnt here.</p><p>Always his brother got what he wanted. Always ever. And it would stop. Willie would pay, once and for all.</p><p>And Jamie would let the fine minister of Dunning do the dirty work for him.</p><p>The church struck him as a crumbling old thing, but he knew this minister would have naught but pride, and so Jamie mustered an enthusiasm he didn\u2019t feel.</p><p>He found the pathetic man strolling the gardens like some king surveying his holdings.</p><p>\u201cRobertson.\u201d Jamie forced a genial smile. \u201cAnd so I find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my friend!\u201d Alexander Robertson strolled over, greeting him with a gratified smile. \u201cSo happy you\u2019ve come. \u2019Tis an enlightened man indeed, who chooses to acquaint himself with the pearls of his community.\u201d</p><p>Vain, self-regarding ass. \u201cAye, \u2019twould be a grave error to visit Dunning and miss the sight of your glorious parish.\u201d Or of you in action, witch-hunter.</p><p>\u201cTruer words, my friend.\u201d Robertson nodded somberly. \u201cTruer words.\u201d</p><p>The minister brightened, spreading his hands wide to gesture to the church behind him. \u201cBut I am being remiss. Would you like a tour? Our steeple tower is impressively ancient. Norman, in fact, and quite the commanding presence in our humble valley. Though\u201d\u2014R obertson put his hand to his forehead in exaggerated dismay\u2014\u201c you are from a fine tradition of Lords Rollo, you would know this already, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course.\u201d Jamie wrenched his smirk into something approximating glowing admiration. \u201cFrom our mother\u2019s breast, we heard of the glory of your fine place of worship, and of the men who minister here.\u201d</p><p>His smile grew genuine as he realized he was enjoying himself. He only wished he weren\u2019t so impatient . . . he imagined he\u2019d find great pleasure in toying with this man over the long term.</p><p>\u201cSadly, church business is not what\u2019s brought me here today,\u201d Jamie said, shaking his head in affected distress. \u201cOr, rather, what I have to share is of the utmost concern for your fine parish.\u201d</p><p>Robertson stilled, and Jamie felt the early flushes of triumph. He\u2019d known the man would crave drama like a fishwife her husband\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cPray,\u201d Robertson said gravely. \u201cPray tell of the news you bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met the woman you claim to love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou . . .\u201d The minister canted his head, the strange turn to the conversation throwing him. \u201cYou\u2019ve met her? My goddess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Her indeed. One Felicity Wallace. And, my friend\u201d\u2014he rested his hand amiably on Robertson\u2019s shoulder\u2014\u201cI think you dodged a grim fate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTruly? But why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s . . .\u201d Jamie mimed hesitation. He needed to hide his smile now. This was becoming quite the lark.</p><p>Be somber.</p><p>Till the soil.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain it\u2019s nothing really. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s something . . . peculiar about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Robertson\u2019s voice was a tight whisper.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d The seeds of doubt. \u201cI saw her plucking strange herbs from the woods around Duncrub. She moved with such purpose. As if . . .\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAs if?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs if . . . well, it was as if she were concocting a brew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! A brew?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAye.\u201d I sow. \u201cAnd then there was her talisman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord protect us,\u201d Robertson hissed, raising and kissing the cross that hung from his pocket. \u201cA talisman, you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Jamie struggled not to laugh. The talisman was quite the stroke of last-minute brilliance.</p><p>\u201cIs it\u201d\u2014Robertson lowered his voice to a frantic whisper\u2014\u201cwitchcraft?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Jamie replied quickly. \u201cCertainly not in your fine and God-fearing parish.

You are quite right, my lord. She was not at vespers. I know I would have seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps we should be on our guard, Minister Robertson. Well pleased I am to have such a vigilant leader of the church among us. Well pleased indeed.\u201d</p> <p>And then I shall reap.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re sure you\u2019re not cold?\u201d Felicity leaned down, looking in the eyes of Will\u2019s father. A small flock of servants had helped her carry the man\u2019s chair, with him in it, outside into the formal gardens.</p><p>Perfectly squared-off hedges were softened by shaggy clumps of wildflowers and an extensive rose garden. But, at the moment, it was the privacy Felicity appreciated best of all. She wanted to try to connect with his dad without having to worry about prying, judgmental eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, it\u2019s blink once for yes, and twice for no.\u201d</p><p>He gave a slow, owlish blink.</p><p>\u201cWait. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said with an exaggerated shrug. \u201cI forgot my question. Are you cold, yes or no?\u201d</p><p>He blinked twice, and she would\u2019ve sworn the man was trying to smile.</p><p>\u201cGood. Well . . . just blink a bunch of times or something if you change your mind.\u201d She began to neatly fold up the woolen blanket she\u2019d brought outside. \u201cI volunteered at a hospital for a while. I helped rehabilitate people just like you. I\u2019d thought for a while that I wanted to be an OT . . . that\u2019s occupational therapist. But . . . I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Sighing, she sat down on the bench across from him. \u201cI just never took to it. I always ended up getting too emotionally involved. All these people whose lives had been so profoundly changed . . .\u201d She frowned. \u201cI used to get so depressed.\u201d</p> <p>Felicity adjusted her skirts on the cold stone. \u201cI guess I\u2019ve tried everything at one point or another. At least it seems that way. I really thought I wanted to help people, but I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m the one who needs help!\u201d she joked, leaning in as if sharing a conspiratorial laugh.</p><p>\u201cHold on,\u201d she said, suddenly serious. \u201cAm I talking too much? I think I have a habit of\u2014\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s father quickly blinked twice.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cGood. Because I was going to say, I\u2019m a lemons from lemonade kinda gal. Wait\u201d\u2014she gave a little shake to her head\u2014\u201cI mean lemonade from lemons . Anyway, you get the point. My aunt\u2014Livvie\u2014I told you about her earlier?\u201d</p><p>She waited for his blink and then continued, \u201cWell my Aunt Livvie taught me to make the best of things.\u201d</p><p>She grew quiet, thinking of her aunt. What would she make of all this? Making a wish on that candle and ending up in the past? Knowing Liv, she\u2019d probably high five her.</p><p>Felicity shook her head. \u201cGoodness knows, my life hasn\u2019t always gone the way I expected.\u201d</p><p>She paused, looking at the garden around them. Her life sure had hit some unexpected curves. And yet, Felicity couldn\u2019t help but think it\u2019d been all those painful twists and turns that had brought her to Will.</p><p>\u201cAnd now I\u2019ve met my hero, and gee, talk about mixed signals.\u201d She gave Will\u2019s father a pointed look. \u201cI wish you could answer me. I sure would love some wisdom about your son.\u201d</p><p>She tilted her head back, looking to the sky on a lengthy exhale. \u201cHe . . . wow . . . where do I begin? He drives me crazy. And boy do I mean crazy in all meanings of the word.\u201d She looked at him through slanted eyes. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t go there. But suffice it to say, I adore the guy. And I think he likes me. But he seems determined to get me the heck out of here. I tell you, your boy Will is breakin\u2019 my heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t answer you, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Felicity turned to see Rollo approaching across the lawn, and a giddy flush of anticipation made her stomach flutter. \u201cWill. Hi.\u201d</p><p>She whispered to his father, \u201cSpeak of the devil. You don\u2019t think he heard, do you?\u201d she asked, biting her lip.</p><p>The man blinked twice, and she squeezed his hand. She didn\u2019t have many memories of her own father, and it delighted her to feel like she had a friend in Will\u2019s.</p><p>Rollo set a tray of food beside her on the bench. \u201cI saw you out here and thought I\u2019d bring my father\u2019s meal myself. I\u2019ve just now summoned a maid to feed him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Felicity pulled the tray toward her. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a maid. Jeez, I\u2019ll feed your father.\u201d She lifted a square of linen to reveal a yellowish broth. \u201cGross. What is this? Is this what they feed you every day?\u201d</p><p>He blinked once, holding his eyes shut for a beat, as if to express his misery.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s horrible! You poor man.\u201d She rounded on Will. \u201cThe poor man, he only gets this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beg your pardon, but don\u2019t tell me you truly think you just communicated with the man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly did.\u201d She scooted to the edge of the bench, ready to spoon the broth into his father\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mister Rollo,\u201d she told him, \u201cI\u2019ll see to it you get something better to eat. If I have to mush it up myself. Yuck,\u201d she added with a shudder. \u201cYou must be sick of this slop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the man shuts his eyes for a moment, and you think you\u2019re having a heartfelt chat? If so, you\u2019d best be informed that \u2018Mister\u2019 is definitely not the chosen form of address for my father.\u201d Will chuckled, and Felicity was torn as to whether she was more annoyed by him, or charmed by that sexy little laugh.</p><p>Deciding to ignore him altogether, Felicity squared her shoulders. \u201cYour son doesn\u2019t think we\u2019re communicating. That means he won\u2019t mind if we talk about him. So tell me, Mister Rollo . . . you don\u2019t mind if I call you Mister Rollo, do you?\u201d</p><p>He blinked twice in quick succession, and Felicity shot Rollo a victorious look.</p><p>\u201cTell me, did Will ever have a girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Rollo made a choking sound, and his father gave two short blinks.</p><p>\u201cI find that shocking,\u201d she said innocently. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>One blink.</p><p>\u201cHe is, after all, a fairly decent-looking man, objectively speaking.\u201d</p><p>A long pause followed finally by a brief blink.</p><p>Felicity snickered. \u201cI mean, you\u2019d think the guy would provide you with some grandkids.\u201d</p><p>Another blink.</p><p>\u201cI know he\u2019s all hung up about his legs, but methinks the loins are still operational\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, woman,\u201d Will exclaimed.</p><p>His father\u2019s eyes grew very round.</p><p>And then Rollo laughed, from deep in his belly, and she flushed warm with the sound of it.</p><p>\u201cThat is quite . . .\u201d He shook his head in awe. \u201cNay, Felicity, you. You are quite something. I dare say, you\u2019ve proved your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said primly, and resumed spooning the broth into the man\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Will.\u201d She sat back, watching as his father swallowed. \u201cIf he has enough muscle control to swallow, he can probably speak again.\u201d</p><p>Will didn\u2019t respond, and so she turned to catch him staring at her in silence.</p><p>\u201cTruly?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah. I think so.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI make no promises. But from what little I know . . . I think that\u2019s how it works.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be given back my father . . .\u201d Will locked eyes with him. Tears hovered in the older man\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan you truly understand?\u201d he asked him.</p><p>His father blinked once, and moisture spilled down his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOch, man.\u201d He stood, gripping his father firmly on the shoulder. He stayed there, hand clasped tight. \u201cAll this time . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so lucky,\u201d Felicity mused gently. \u201cI lost my father. I\u2019m glad for you, Will. So glad you\u2019re getting a second chance with yours.\u201d</p><p>Rollo pinned her with a searing glance, and she wondered if he weren\u2019t seeing her, truly seeing the real her, for the first time.</p><p>\u201cAye. I have my father returned to me.\u201d He leaned over, brushing a kiss on the top of her head. \u201cAnd it\u2019s all because of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d She raised her brows impishly. \u201cThat was a thank-you, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d Her mischievous ways startled him, delighted him. Stretching out his hand, he had the strange compulsion to play along. \u201cNow, come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then! Excuse us, please, Mister Rollo,\u201d she said smiling and taking Will\u2019s hand. With a tilt of her head, she asked, \u201cAre you taking me somewhere to show me your appreciation?\u201d</p><p>He paled, sparing a quick glance at his father. \u201cNo, I\u2019m taking you for a turn around the garden.\u201d Pitching his voice lower, he added, \u201cBelieving as I do that my father has heard quite enough for one afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He led them toward one of the garden\u2019s many flower-beds.</p><p>\u201cWill you be regaling me with praise as we go? Like, how wrong you were not to believe me. How talented, how brilliant\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOch, woman. Enough.\u201d He chuckled, adding his own silent litany. How beautiful, how adorable, how luscious . . . He leaned down and, pulling the sgian dubh from where it was tucked at his calf, cut a small handful of blooms that had taken root amidst the decorative paving stones.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think you can change the subject with that sexy James Bond sock knife of yours,\u201d she told him.</p><p>\u201cWould you still that tongue for but one moment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that about my tongue, William Rollo?\u201d she countered with a purr in her voice.</p><p>His unruly cock stirred in response.</p><p>\u201cIst,\u201d he whispered, standing and stepping toward her. He moved slowly, and in the four paces to her side, he felt his heart drift from lighthearted, to focused, to somber.</p><p>Her face stilled to see the handful of humble flowers he\u2019d plucked for her. Bright blue blooms atop long, thin stems. He felt suddenly nervous.</p><p>\u201cHarebells,\u201d he told her, placing the posy in her hand. \u201cMy favorite. Always so sunny and upright.\u201d He tucked a loose bit of hair behind her ear, thinking he could as easily be describing Felicity as those flowers. \u201cA tenacious wee blossom, just like you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Will. They\u2019re lovely.\u201d She brought them to her nose, even though he knew they held not much scent beyond the freshness of green and sky. \u201cJust perfect.\u201d</p><p>She seemed at a loss for words, and the thought that he might have caught her off guard was surprisingly, deeply gratifying.</p><p>\u201cThey suit you.\u201d He wondered at the ease he\u2019d found with her, this newfound comfort that had loosened his tongue, giving him words enough to quiet one like Felicity. Cupping her cheek, he lay a chaste kiss on her forehead. \u201cMy wildest wee blossom of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo bad my eyes aren\u2019t blue to match,\u201d she said with an awkward laugh.</p><p>\u201cYour eyes . . .\u201d He took her chin, tilted her face to his. \u201cNever have I seen such expressive eyes. Lush and brown. Rich like the earth, like the trees. Beautiful beside your hair, yellow as the sun. Nay, Felicity, your eyes are just right.\u201d</p><p>He saw tears shimmering in those eyes, and the sight stabbed him. \u201cBut whatever is the matter?\u201d He gave her a gentle smile. \u201cShould I have picked you some fine roses instead?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no. I\u2019m definitely not a roses girl. I . . .\u201d She was quiet for a moment, studying the posy in her hand, and he was pleased to have moved her so. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>She gave him a shy smile. \u201cSee, you say you\u2019re not the chivalrous knight in shining armor, but I knew you would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, lass, I said I wasn\u2019t a Viking.\u201d He tenderly kissed the moisture from the corner of each eye. \u201cI am, however, most pleased to settle for knight.\u201d</p><p>A bright, loud laugh burst from her, such a joyful feminine sound, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh with her. And the feel of it filled him, expanded him. So many years without joy, to laugh with this woman was intoxicating. A revelation, a rapture.</p><p>A gift without price.</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Robertson whispered. They watched from afar, through a break in the hedgerow. The minister trembled with some heightened emotion. \u201cTo speak so with your imbecilic father . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Jamie said. His father, communicating? He couldn\u2019t believe it. But still . . . he fought off a peculiar, discomfiting feeling.</p><p>\u201cThe physicians claim it was a spell,\u201d Jamie continued with a stiffened mouth. \u201cBut I believe it was evil spirits that overran my father\u2019s body. Dark demons, which rendered him mute. His eyes waver madly now, from the visions they sow in his head. Only a witch would converse with such a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo I see,\u201d the minister said again.</p><p>And Jamie watched as Robertson\u2019s face froze into a mask. Of alarm. Of shock. And a flicker of elation.</p><p>Chapter 17</p><p>Rollo\u2019s gaze clung to the sight of Felicity on the path ahead of him. They walked among the precisely manicured hedges and stone statuary of his family\u2019s formal gardens, and he couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>More specifically, he couldn\u2019t tear his gaze from the sight of her hips, swaying back and forth beneath all the godforsaken layers of fabric that hid her curves from him.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know what he was doing. He needed to be paying mind to Jamie, trying to figure out what, exactly, the knave was about.</p><p>Or tending to his father, trying to connect with the man. Will had dozens of questions for him. To discover that he\u2019d been in there, cognizant, all this time? It gave him a chill.</p><p>And then there was Ormonde. Will hoped the man was safe. His flame red hair didn\u2019t offer much of a disguise if Jamie\u2019s spies were about, and it\u2019d be straight back to the Tower for him. Hopefully his message to Ormonde had been clear: Will wanted naught more to do with the Sealed Knot men.</p><p>No, there were many things Rollo needed to consider, and to do, and yet he couldn\u2019t bring himself to tear his eyes from this woman. And so, here he was, strolling. The only thing commanding his attention, trying to imagine the curve of what would surely be a pale, sweet backside.</p><p>Thinking on it now, he realized he\u2019d only given mind to how beautiful Felicity was. Lovely, with unguarded ways, always with her innocent chatter. She was like a light shining straight into the dark chambers of his heart.</p><p>But now he\u2019d seen another, different facet. She was so much more than merely pretty. Watching her communicate with his father, Rollo realized just how special, just how extraordinary a woman she truly was.</p><p>Did all who met Felicity feel her light blaze straight into their hearts? He marveled at the thought.</p><p>She\u2019d stopped on the path, and Will let himself walk right up along her back. He didn\u2019t touch her. Such indiscretion would be too reckless so close to his family\u2019s home.</p><p>But still, Rollo allowed himself to hover, just against her. Near enough to feel the heat of her through her gown. He pressed closer. Felt the give of fabric against his hardened groin.</p><p>She was sweet torture, this woman.</p><p>\u201cAre you even listening, Will?\u201d</p><p>No indeed. He took a deep breath in and exhaled through his teeth. \u201cApologies. You were saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThese gardens . . .\u201d She canted her head, studying a particularly extravagant topiary hedge. \u201cThis is nuts. Who takes care of all this stuff anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother has people,\u201d he replied, distractedly examining the hedge before him. \u201cI\u2019ve never given it thought. How peculiar,\u201d he muttered suddenly. \u201cHer tastes in topiary do seem to run to the . . . Byzantine.\u201d</p><p>She giggled, bumping her hips back to nudge him. The brief jostling pressure had dark thoughts furrowing his brow. She was frisky as a kitten, and here he was, about to explode right on the spot.</p><p>He closed his eyes, breathing deeply to gather himself. But all that did was bring her scent more clearly to him. She\u2019d washed her hair with something smelling of roses.</p><p>\u201cI mean, you already live in the most spectacular garden in the world.\u201d She waved her hand, gesturing toward the hills lining the horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s just weird to me, this whole formal garden concept.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt . . . I . . .\u201d What to say? What was she talking about? He needed to gather himself. His arm stretched stiffly toward the ground, gripping the cane at his side. His eyes went to her hair, the source of this scent that was suddenly driving him mad. \u201cI see you finally sorted out the issue of your hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d She tilted her head to look up at him, and he thought the sight of those bright eyes trained only on him would surely be his undoing. \u201cWhat on earth are you talking about, Will?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cYour hair. You kept saying it was driving you mad. You seem to have sorted it out,\u201d he added, his voice finally steady.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She seemed to visibly deflate. \u201cNo, it\u2019s still making me batty.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her hands to feel the mass of it at the nape of her neck. \u201cI thought having it always in my eyes drove me crazy enough. But then some girl helped me this morning, and\u201d\u2014she ran her fingers along the tight looping bun\u2014\u201cow!\u201d</p><p>She shot him a dramatic pout. \u201cShe put pins in my hair. She kept sticking me, over and over. I swear she was using straight pins. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I were bleeding under here. All I want,\u201d she muttered on, \u201cis a barrette, or a rubber band, or a scrunchie, or a head band, or a butterfly clip, or\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Will whispered with a small smile on his face. \u201cThis is my home,\u201d he said, letting his cane drop to the ground. \u201cAnd when you are in my care\u201d\u2014he slowly ran his fingers along the sweep of her bun, carefully removing each pin, one by one, dropping them with exaggerated disdain to the grass\u2014\u201cyou may wear your hair however you like.\u201d</p><p>As he pulled the last pin free, her hair spilled down her back. Felicity shuddered in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOhmygosh. That feels so . . .\u201d</p><p>The feel of her hair loose. The feel of Will at her back. The feel of his fingers on her.</p><p>The sensations overwhelmed her. The man drove her crazy. Didn\u2019t he see? Didn\u2019t he see how good they were together? He was so caring, and gentle, and thoughtful, and he had no idea how great he was.</p><p>He was utterly silent, lacing his fingers in her hair, pulling them gently through. He rubbed her head. Massaged the nape of her neck. Traced his thumbs lightly around the curve of her ears. Brought his hands back up to scrape his fingertips lightly along her scalp.</p><p>\u201cOh that feels so good.\u201d Felicity didn\u2019t understand why it was that every woman in Perthshire, or wherever it was he\u2019d said they were, wasn\u2019t all over Lord William Rollo like white on rice. \u201cWill, you have no idea, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got no idea,\u201d she whispered, turning to face him. She pressed the front of her body against his. Feeling his arousal, her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cOhh,\u201d she said with a wicked smile. \u201cMaybe you have some idea then.\u201d</p><p>Felicity reached around to graze her hands lightly down his back, along his ass, stroked back up. He wore only his shirt and plaid, and the rough wool clung to her palms. The fabric slid over his body, and she felt each curve of muscle and flesh. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you have anything on under here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis . . . this is unseemly.\u201d Breath shuddered from his body. \u201cWe must\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your sporran, Lord Rollo, or are you just happy to see me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOch, Christ, woman . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d She nipped her teeth at his shirt. \u201cCan\u2019t we duck into a . . . whatchamacallit . . . a hedgerow or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Will brought his hands tentatively to her shoulders. \u201cBut the others . . .\u201d</p><p>She glanced around quickly. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any others. Come on.\u201d She began to step back, away from the house, to the fringe of trees in the distance. \u201cTake me into the woods, Will. Your stupid brother took me into the woods,\u201d she added, a dare in her voice.</p><p>\u201cI fear my own base impulses far more than I fear my brother,\u201d he muttered darkly.</p> <p>She\u2019d love to get a load of Will\u2019s base impulses. \u201cThen please, by all means. Trees. Now.\u201d</p><p>She reached around his shoulders and slowly stroked down, all the way to the backs of his thighs. \u201cLet me just get your cane.\u201d Ever so gradually, she began to squat to the ground, drawing her hands lightly down his legs.</p><p>He was erect, his kilt tented out before him, his flesh extended long and solid, just for her. It gave her a ripple of pleasure.</p><p>She let her cheek graze his cock as she lowered herself to kneel. Will groaned at her touch, and the ripple in her belly swelled into hot, wet need.</p><p>She continued to move down, slowly.</p><p>He flinched as she reached the gnarled curve of his right leg, but she flinched back, a brief, hard grip that stilled him.</p> <p>Her knee reached the ground. She took his cane from the grass. Pulled back up to standing, skimming even closer to his body as she rose.</p><p>The hard length of his erection settled between her breasts. She rubbed herself along it as she stood.</p><p>Their eyes met. He was coiled, grim, every aspect of him tight and dark with desire.</p><p>\u201cCome,\u201d he told her, his voice a low rasp. He pulled her around the corner of a boxed- off hedge into a tight cul-de sac of shrubbery. The green walls reached overhead, punctuated by statue after statue of mythic figures, their blank marble eyes staring sightlessly ahead.</p><p>She pulled from him, turning to tug at his kilt. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get this off.\u201d Her fingers fumbled with his brown leather belt. \u201cYou can\u2019t just show me this\u201d\u2014she paused to stroke his thick bulge\u2014\u201cand expect me to ignore it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe plaid stays on,\u201d he gritted, spinning her back around to face one of the statues. It was some wide-shouldered god dess, her hand raised in a gesture of triumph, or judgment.</p><p>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we . . .\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his arm tight around her belly, grinding himself into the back of her skirts.</p> <p>She shivered, slumped into him.</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we . . . ?\u201d he mimicked her, his voice pitched wickedly low. His accent, husky and warm in her ear, shot every nerve in her body to attention. Nestling his face in her hair, his mouth found her earlobe and he gave her a light nip.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She shuddered in a breath. \u201cNevermind.\u201d</p><p>He wound his hand in a swath of her hair and exposed her neck. The air was cool on her skin, and her nipples pulled tight.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not be taking you in the woods like some savage.\u201d His body still cradling hers from behind, he trailed slow kisses up her neck. \u201cBut there\u2019ll be none the wiser if we are two merely admiring the statuary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are full of surprises,\u201d she said breathlessly.</p><p>He raked his hand through her hair. Cupping the back of her head, he tilted her face to him and took her in a hard kiss.</p><p>God she wanted him. Craved his hands on her, all over. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t wait a moment longer, Will eased his other hand down the belly of her gown, pulling her closer. She moaned into his mouth.</p><p>She felt him hard and urgent at her back. His hand grazed even lower, cupping firmly between her legs.</p><p>A gasp tore her mouth from his. \u201cYes, Will.\u201d</p><p>Holding her more tightly, he began to knead his fingers steadily, rubbing her through the layers of fabric.</p><p>\u201cSomeday\u201d\u2014his voice was hoarse and hot in her ear\u2014\u201csomeday I will see you torn from this gown.\u201d</p><p>The mere suggestion of Will, standing behind her naked instead of covered in all these clothes, made her muscles quiver. She sagged even more against the hard length of his body. \u201cYes. Please.\u201d</p><p>Will held her securely to him. \u201cHush, woman. And listen.\u201d</p><p>His hand worked faster, and the chafe of linen over her bare flesh had her body shrieking for release.</p><p>And for once, Felicity was rendered speechless.</p><p>\u201cI will have my hands on your bare body.\u201d His palm ground against her in a steady rhythm.</p><p>Muscles deep in her core began to clench.</p><p>\u201cI will touch you,\u201d he threatened through gritted teeth. \u201cAnd I will take you.\u201d</p><p>Her knees buckled. Rollo\u2019s strong arm held fast, his hand cradling her even tighter. Need and pleasure thrummed through her, suffused her.</p><p>\u201cAnd I will have you.\u201d He stroked more firmly, through all that fabric, and her pelvis rocked against his palm, urging him on.</p><p>\u201cYes Will,\u201d she breathed. Her whole body trembled. She felt flushed, hot, weak. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery inch of you will be mine.\u201d</p><p>And Felicity felt his growl of release resonate through her, as he pulled her close, pumping hard into her back, riding her climax with his own.</p><p>Chapter 18</p><p>\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve only dreamt of.\u201d Will tenderly straightened Felicity\u2019s skirts and smoothed her hair, and the look of pleasure on her face had him prolonging his touches long after she\u2019d been put to rights. \u201cYou are something I could only have dreamt of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes this mean I can stay?\u201d</p><p>Stay.</p><p>No, he thought.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Impossible for her to stay. Impossible, too, to say good-bye.</p><p>\u201cIt means . . .\u201d he faltered. Would he really push such joy from his life? He didn\u2019t remember anymore why he\u2019d once tried.</p><p>\u201cIt means we can discuss it, maybe?\u201d she asked in no cently.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He smiled and watched her bend down to shake dust from her hem. His gaze dragged over that fine, firm der riere. The feel of it through her skirts had been just as sweet as he\u2019d imagined it could be.</p><p>And some day he\u2019d see it bare. Grip her bare hips in his hands, and ride her completely, utterly naked.</p><p>She stood, catching him, and gave him a quizzical look. Realization lit in her eyes. \u201cYou were checking me out!\u201d</p><p>He felt the blood rise to his cheeks.</p><p>\u201cAdmit it, you were checking me out and . . .\u201d Pointing a finger at him, she gave him a satisfied smile. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing again. And now I know what it means.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging, he gave her a smile, feeling a rush at such a trivial exchange.</p><p>\u201cMm-hm. Don\u2019t play innocent with me.\u201d She lifted her arms, gathering her hair and smoothing it from her neck. Her breasts strained against her bodice with the gesture, and Will felt his body stir, again, already.</p><p>\u201cYou gotta take it easy on a girl,\u201d she told him, blithely chattering away, oblivious to the turn his thoughts had taken. \u201cYou men are lucky. For you, it\u2019s a onetime deal. You do it, you\u2019re done, and in my experience, you roll over and sack out.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, perplexed. Was she discussing what he thought she was discussing?</p><p>\u201cA woman, though. You touch me like that.\u201d Nodding toward the sculpture garden, she made a delicious little moan that shot life straight between his legs. \u201cThat just gets me going.\u201d</p><p>Again already indeed, he thought, sliding his sporran to his hip.</p><p>\u201cSo don\u2019t be checking me out if you have no intention of touching the goods.\u201d</p><p>Rollo\u2019s eyes narrowed, her meaning now crystal clear. \u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d he told her in a low voice. He, in fact, had every intention of handling her goods. Furtive groping in the sculpture garden had him decidedly unsatisfied.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m not nearly done with you,\u201d he warned. \u201cYou once told me that I had no idea,\u201d he continued, stalking toward her.</p><p>He\u2019d thought climaxing would release the pressure he\u2019d been feeling. And he\u2019d been wrong. This hard knot between his legs that was his cock remained a constant ache. \u201c \u2019Tis you who have no idea, Felicity. No idea what I\u2019ve been living with.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flicked to his plaid and back up again. The prettiest little flush suffused her cheeks, and such pleasure, such lust raged through him, his cock jumped in response.</p><p>\u201cI am far from satisfied,\u201d he gritted out, and there was no need for him to feign desire rekindled. The conspicuous stiffness under his plaid said it all.</p><p>A wicked smile curved the corners of his mouth. \u201cAnd now see who is the one blushing.\u201d</p><p>Rollo let his eyes rove her openly now. His stolen glimpses had only whet his appetite, and he let himself linger on those breasts, those hips.</p><p>\u201cTrees,\u201d he growled, mimicking her earlier words. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>This is the moment, she thought, her heart racing. She\u2019d been harboring this wet ache for this man for so long now, and finally, finally, she\u2019d find release.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know how they made it from the garden, to the edge of the trees, to this small clearing. It might\u2019ve taken them five minutes or fifty, she had no idea.</p><p>All she knew was she was about to be with Will. To see him, to feel him. He\u2019d fill her. Fill this terrible, aching lack that had throbbed inside her for weeks. Her body trembled from the thought.</p><p>The woods were cool. An idyll, where green leaves glowed yellow from dappled sunlight, and dewy grass glittered, tranquil in the shadows.</p><p>The woods were cool, and still, her blood ran hot.</p><p>He stopped short. She sensed his cane clatter to the dirt, but didn\u2019t give it a thought. Her only thoughts, for him, standing before her, so intense. She stared into those hazel eyes, wondering what he might be thinking. She knew he wanted her. But would he be feeling this other thing too, this stabbing in her heart she felt when she looked at him? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He leaned down. Brought his mouth gently to hers. Kissed her, slowly, tenderly. She savored the taste of him, breathing him in. Kissing him back, slowly, until she thought her chest would burst from the need to let go. To pull him down, to take him. Be taken.</p><p>A stream trickled somewhere in the distance. A happy sound, so carefree and light, and in such counterpoint to her galloping heart.</p><p>He pulled away. His body was tense, and she thought maybe he felt it too. This raging need. But still, he kept himself in check.</p> <p>Will was from such a different world, and she thought how, right then, he\u2019d probably be concerned for her. He\u2019d be mindful of her fears, her anxieties.</p><p>If only he knew how much she wanted him. Her only fear, the thought that he might not love her. Desire consumed her. It was a palpable thing, like a constant drone in her head, or a filter that colored her world.</p><p>If he didn\u2019t know, she would show him.</p><p>\u201cLie down,\u201d she whispered. She urged him lower. Seated herself next to him in the dirt, guided Will\u2019s shoulders down til he was lying on his back. She stretched her body along his, on her side.</p><p>He watched her, his eyes now gold in the light, now green in the shadow, so intent on her.</p> <p>She climbed onto him, straddled him. She felt him through all that wool, big and hard, and feminine satisfaction swelled through her to know she was the cause. Felicity rocked her hips, settling him in her cleft, and heat and want suffused her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve thought about this for some time,\u201d she told him, her voice husky with desire. She took his hand, raised it to her breast.</p><p>He cupped her carefully at first. She ground her hips more snugly to him, and something dark and hungry clouded his eyes. He gripped her more surely then, kneading her breast, thumbing her nipple, a faint bump through the thick fabric of her gown.</p><p>\u201cAye? And what did you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wondered if you\u2019d be gentle.\u201d She leaned over him and watched, gratified, as he ogled her nearly spilling from the low-cut gown. She rubbed her thumb along his lower lip. \u201cOr if you\u2019d be rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, aye?\u201d His voice was hoarse, tight with lust. \u201cAnd what did you decide?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI decided you\u2019d be a little of both. A little gentle.\u201d She leaned down further, taking his mouth in a tender kiss. \u201cAnd\u201d\u2014Felicity pulled away and then dipped back in, nipping at his lower lip\u2014\u201ca little rough. Because, Will Rollo, I want you way too much not to get a little rough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, woman.\u201d He breathed deeply, tried to master himself. Despite what she said about gentleness, he wanted to tear the clothes from her body. Free his cock from the aggravation of all this wool that had been chafing him for so many weeks now, the coarse fabric abrading his flesh til it felt raw. His every nerve, strained and ready.</p><p>He sat up just enough to wrap his arms around her back. The movement burrowed him more snugly into her cleft, the drag of wool on his skin maddening. He needed to feel her, flesh on flesh.</p><p>He wanted to rip, but instead he carefully untied each lace. Many hours had he spent studying those intricate closures, imagining all the ways in which he could tear them from her.</p><p>The gown loosened and her breasts shifted lower, fuller. He needed to feel them, would finally feel them, against his skin.</p><p>His hands found her ankles. Stroking upward, he smoothed his palms up her calves, her thighs, dragging her gown up and over her head. Felicity, naked.</p><p>His heart stopped in his chest at the sight of her. This lovely, unexpected gift. She was so pale and perfect. The dappled sunlight fell on her yellow hair, stippling shadows across the delicate curve of her mouth, her cheekbones, her brows. He forced himself to breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he told her quietly, simply. The smile she gave him in response was so soft, so dear, he thought that to feel this woman\u2019s adoration was to know true joy.</p> <p>\u201cFelicity,\u201d he said, savoring her name in his mouth, thinking how truly she\u2019d been named. \u201cSuch a joy you are. Such a treasure.\u201d He traced a tentative finger down her cheek, her throat. Brought his eyes once more to her breasts, and something stabbed at his heart. Surely he didn\u2019t deserve this. Surely it would end. \u201cAre you certain you want a man like me?\u201d</p><p>Mesmerized he watched those expressive brown eyes, one moment raw with desire, the next serene and sure.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been more certain.\u201d</p><p>And then something happened to those eyes. They darkened, raking over his body, avidly, hungrily.</p><p>She brought her hands to his plaid. Pushed it from his shoulder. Pulled his shirt over his head. Unbuckled his belt. Loosened the plaid at his waist.</p><p>Felicity shifted one hip up, and then the other, tugging the wool from his lap, freeing him, finally. \u201cOh, aye,\u201d he heard himself groan.</p><p>Still on his lap, she scooted back, devouring him with her eyes. The vision of this beautiful, perfect woman ogling his erection made his cock twitch, and Rollo thought he\u2019d never been so hard. The need to be in her was a torture now, urgent, consuming.</p><p>She brought her hand to him. Her grip was cool, and yet it didn\u2019t soothe him. His body raged, hot and hungry for her. She brought her thumb to the tip of him, rubbed the thick bead of moisture there, his head slick and ready for her. \u201cOch, Felicity, love,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>Easing her weight onto one knee, she tried to tug the wool from where it was still draped over his thighs.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he rasped, stilling her hand with his. \u201cThe plaid stays.\u201d He\u2019d not ruin this moment by exposing his detested flaws to her.</p><p>She froze, pinning him with an unreadable gaze. \u201cWilliam Rollo,\u201d Felicity said in a calm monotone. \u201cYou think too much.\u201d Pushing at his shoulders, she guided him back onto the ground and straddled him once more. \u201cI\u2019m not doing my job very well,\u201d she purred, crawling back down the length of him, \u201cif you\u2019re able to do all this thinking.\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes. He wanted to keep his legs hidden from her, and yet he was paralyzed, desperate to know what this strange and miraculous woman would do next.</p><p>He felt her hand on him again. Felt her stroke down, then up, the head of him tacky and slick with his want for her.</p><p>And then he felt her tongue, and the world as he knew it collapsed on itself. \u201cOh . . .\u201d was all he could manage.</p><p>She sucked him slowly into her mouth, deeper and deeper. \u201cOhh,\u201d he rasped again. He\u2019d not have guessed such a thing could ever happen to him. \u201cWhat are you . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Felicity pulled back up and he felt a wet pop as he slid from between her lips. She stroked with both hands, all over and around him, and then spoke, her breath hot on his damp and sensitized skin. \u201cYou are still thinking too much,\u201d she scolded in a whisper.</p><p>She took him into her mouth again, eagerly now. And this time, when she finally pulled away and he felt her pulling the plaid from over his legs, he couldn\u2019t muster concern. Self-consciousness had been dissolved, relegated to some distant memory.</p><p>\u201cYou silly man,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t until he felt her kisses trail up and down each leg that he knew what she referred to. He stilled, waiting. Holding himself frozen, wondering what she would think, what she would say. He felt her tongue graze his right knee.</p><p>His cursed knee. The last time he\u2019d been able to stretch it, to straighten or bend it, had been the morning of his seventh birthday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you before,\u201d she scolded. \u201cYou\u2019re hot.\u201d She nibbled down the side of his leg. \u201cScars . . . are hot.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t fully trust what he thought he was hearing.</p><p>Until she crawled back up the length of him. The way she stalked low along his body, desire smoking her eyes, stoked his body to a fever pitch. He thought he might climax from the feel of her skin on his alone.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t bear it. Could wait no longer.</p><p>She\u2019d reached just level to him when Rollo tangled his fingers in her hair, and took her mouth in a punishing kiss. He flipped Felicity onto her back, his mouth ravaging hers, her neck, her breasts.</p><p>He twined his fingers with hers, pinning her hands over her head, staring at her, his heart pounding. Her lips were reddened from his kisses, slightly parted, waiting for more. \u201cI love you, Felicity. What may come, know that I love you.\u201d</p><p>He dared not wait for her response. Couldn\u2019t bear to know whether she loved him in return, and so stole the words from her mouth with a kiss.</p><p>And then, with a shift of his hips, he stole the breath from her lungs.</p><p>Will plunged into her, sinking slowly down to the root of him. She was so wet and so ready, the feel of her body gripping him shook him to the core.</p><p>He stilled, holding himself over her, in her, catching his breath. Their gazes caught. She was panting, her eyes half lidded, muzzy from desire.</p><p>He never knew it would be like this. Had never imagined.</p><p>They lost themselves then, bodies tangling on the forest floor. Hands, mouths, hips, frenzied and consuming each other until someone\u2019s shout, someone\u2019s moan, resounded through the trees.</p><p>And Will and Felicity lay entwined, their hard breathing the only human sound amidst the peaceful rustle and burble of the woods.</p><p>Chapter 19</p><p>Felicity grinned at the roses littering her bed. Their scent had greeted her first, the moment she\u2019d walked into the room.</p><p>She took one of the voluptuous pink blooms and pressed it to her nose. The fragrance was lush, heady. A flower for lovers, Will had written in his note. He knew she didn\u2019t consider herself a roses girl. Yet she was his, he wrote, his lover, like it or no.</p><p>And she was liking it. Very, very much.</p><p>Felicity sat on the edge of the bed, nose still nestled in the thick, velvety petals, looking around at this strange, new life of hers.</p><p>Her room was airy, with yellow wainscoting and quaint furniture like something from a doll\u2019s house. Her favorite lavender dress rustled along the silk of the navy blue duvet.</p><p>She\u2019d thought nothing could be more life- changing than getting transported into the past. But that was before she\u2019d been with Will, rolling on the forest floor like some wild thing. Hearing his words of love. Giving herself, utterly. This losing herself in him, this was the real life-altering event, profound, unexpected. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The man, quite simply, rocked her world.</p><p>Aunt Livia would\u2019ve been thrilled. Now there\u2019s a roses girl, Felicity thought with a smile. She would\u2019ve adored these thick, pink blooms, so obscene in their heavily scented beauty. Livvie always did say love may conquer all, but nothing conquers a woman\u2019s heart like a nice bunch of roses.</p><p>Felicity missed her, and allowed the sharp pangs of emotion to roll through her. She missed Livvie, but was more sure than ever that this was where she was meant to be. Positive now that she was meant to be by Will\u2019s side.</p> <p>Still, she\u2019d like to find some way to get word to her. Would find some way. Because Felicity had no doubt, if she could travel back in time, surely there was some way to communicate with her aunt.</p><p>She gave a little resolved nod, and thought, First things first. And first, the roses.</p><p>She carefully arranged them on the bed, separating tangled leaves, unsnagging thorns. Their pink so vivid atop the blue bedcovers.</p><p>She ran her fingers over the petals. So like suede, their touch was irresistible. A fresh burst of fragrance pervaded the room.</p><p>She\u2019d find a small vase, she decided suddenly. She had pressed the blue blossoms Will had given her in a book. But these roses smelled just too heavenly to tuck away.</p> <p>She frowned, hesitating. She didn\u2019t want to be a bother to anyone, but she dreaded going by herself to what Will called belowstairs, the realm of butlers and cooks and maids.</p><p>All those people scared her. She could never understand what they said, was certain they couldn\u2019t understand her, and she didn\u2019t know what to make of their curious, sidelong glances.</p><p>The roses, though. The outer petals were already beginning to look limp. Surely she could find a pitcher in the kitchen. She\u2019d go down the stairs and follow the smell of food. She\u2019d identify the nicest- looking cook, mimic pouring water, and hopefully they\u2019d get the picture.</p><p>She sprang from the bed, striding from her room before she could change her mind.</p><p>She made her way downstairs, and then for the first time ever, headed lower, down the other set of steps, to belowstairs. The stairway was dimly lit, and Felicity descended slowly, rehearsing what she\u2019d say if she ran into one of the Rollo household\u2019s many servants.</p><p>She froze, hearing shouts. Some sort of argument drifted up to her. She definitely didn\u2019t want to walk in on a fight. Faltering, she thought she could turn back, ask Will to find her a vase instead. He\u2019d love to find a vase for her.</p> <p>But this was her place now. If she was going to be with him, to make this place and time her own, she needed to just deal with herself\u2014and these ridiculous anxieties.</p><p>Lady of the house, she chanted to herself. I am lady of the house. And, setting her shoulders, she made her way to the bottom of the staircase.</p><p>\u201cBadly done!\u201d Rollo\u2019s mother\u2019s voice echoed down the corridor.</p><p>Oh crap. Felicity froze, her foot hovering on the last step. Why did it have to be Rollo\u2019s mom? That\u2019s the last argument she wanted to walk in on.</p><p>But she really wanted that vase.</p><p>You can do this. Punishing servants was standard operating procedure for seventeenth-century ladies, right? I can do this.</p><p>\u201cThat . . . was . . . ill . . . done.\u201d</p><p>She heard a distant smack. Good Lord, was the woman beating someone? Felicity made a mental note never to let her alone with the grandkids.</p> <p>She stepped out into the hallway. The floorboards creaked, and she stopped, her heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cNaughty!\u201d</p><p>Felicity bit her knuckle. What was his mother\u2019s deal, anyway? Sheesh.</p><p>If the woman was beating a servant, maybe she should do something to intervene. His mom, though\u2014total ice queen, and Felicity was terrified to cross her.</p><p>But . . . if she was going to be with Will, she\u2019d need to make herself at home. Be a part of the household.</p><p>Maybe she could bring some twenty- first-century sensibilities to the ways in which Lady Rollo treated her staff. She could enlighten the woman. Maybe it\u2019d even bring them closer together.</p><p>The thought girded her. Giving herself a determined nod, Felicity walked down the hallway, in the direction of the shouting.</p><p>A knocking began to sound. A hollow thump-thump-thump . She hurried up.</p><p>\u201cBad, bad boy!\u201d</p><p>That was it. She walked faster. Reprimanding an adult was one thing, but if Rollo\u2019s mom were beating some poor boy, she\u2019d have to put a stop to it.</p><p>She paused just outside a darkened room. It was where the shouting had come from.</p><p>What on earth . . . ? Why would Lady Rollo be in a dark room? Felicity stood there, letting her eyes adjust.</p><p>His mom was there, facing the wall, just in front of a low shelf. There were lots of jars. A servant stood behind her. Not a boy, Felicity saw. He was tall, like a man.</p><p>How weird. Did he do something wrong to the preserves?</p><p>\u201cYouuu . . .\u201d his mother growled.</p><p>Felicity squinted, desperately curious now, waiting to see what jam- or sauce-related transgression the man/boy had perpetrated.</p><p>He moved, and the abruptness of it was violent, startling. Grabbing Lady Rollo\u2019s shoulders, the servant swung her to the side.</p><p>Felicity gasped. Was she being attacked?</p><p>It was when Lady Rollo landed on her elbows, leaning over a wine barrel, that Felicity realized in horror what was happening.</p><p>Lady Rollo was getting it on with one of the hot, young servant guys.</p><p>Ohhhhh shit.</p><p>The older woman\u2019s head rose in slow motion, an eagle sighting its prey. Felicity, mortified, met her gaze.</p><p>And backed out of the room, fleeing back up the stairs, all thoughts of flowers and vases shocked right out of her head.</p><p>\u201cWhen will you do something about this Felicity person?\u201d Lady Rollo clinked her spoon impatiently on the rim of her teacup.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, Mother dear.\u201d Jamie kicked his legs in front of him, taking a slow sip of tea. He loved when his mother got nervous. Rare were the times she let that perfect ivory fa\u00e7ade crack, and he found it eminently amusing. He watched her, stirring her tea with such menace. Biting the inside of his cheek, he told her, \u201cThe situation is well in hand.\u201d</p><p>She pinned her son with a cold stare. \u201cDon\u2019t condescend to me, Jamie. You forget. I remain in control of the purse strings. And don\u2019t think that wealthy wife of yours can help you. The wars have gutted the Campbells, and their family coffers run low. That woman, pining away for you on Campbell land,\u201d she mused. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful what you did marrying her.\u201d</p><p>He bristled, and then cursed inwardly, knowing his mother had seen it. She knew him too well.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d she said, narrowing her eyes. \u201cUntil your father dies, I am the only one able and willing to forgive your perpetual gambling debts.\u201d</p><p>He had to look away. Studied the cup in his hand instead. It was precisely those debts that kept him under her thumb. She knew it, and always Jamie tasted a son\u2019s love curdling into resentment whenever she chose to lord it over him.</p><p>He\u2019d thought before, in his drunken moments, that he could cut her loose. Claim that his father was as good as dead. Jamie would inherit. But he\u2019d find himself in debtor\u2019s prison, with the Rollo fortune as forfeit.</p><p>His mother was harping on. \u201cI am the one who looks the other way when you bring home your unsavory . . . friends. Or should I call them accomplices? No, Jamie, if you weren\u2019t so weak\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWeak?\u201d He finally snapped. Weak he was not. He\u2019d leave weak to his pathetically crippled baby brother. \u201cSpeak not to me of weak, Mother, when you seem to raise your petticoats for the nearest strapping cottar to hand.\u201d</p><p>He let the accusation hang, enjoying the flush of outrage suffusing her cheeks. His mother was indeed an attractive one, but the thought of her bedding blacksmiths and stable hands disgusted him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems we are a pair. If word got out that you\u2019re not a wife in truth to my father? Think you on what might happen to that precious fortune you keep harping about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough.\u201d She raised her hand to silence him. Despite her furrowed brow, she bore a smile for her favorite son.</p><p>He knew she enjoyed their sparring. He did too; he\u2019d learned it from the best.</p><p>Shaking her head, she told him quietly, \u201c \u2019Tis a sad day when a woman finds the only man able to stand up to her is her own son.\u201d</p><p>He spared her a smile and raised his teacup to her as if in a toast.</p><p>\u201cJust promise me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything, Mother.\u201d Jamie tossed back the last sip of his tea and stood to go.</p><p>\u201cJust promise you will deal with the woman.\u201d</p><p>He gave her a nod. He\u2019d take care of Felicity. And convenient it would be too, seeing as it also took care of his brother.</p><p>Jamie took his mother\u2019s hand, pressing her knuckles to his lips in a formal kiss. \u201cAs you will it, Mother dear.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 20</p><p>Feeling Felicity writhe and moan her pleasure in the sculpture garden had Rollo musing she was no less than a gift from those very marble gods.</p><p>And the notion had given him just the idea.</p><p>He\u2019d left before dawn for the journey to Perth, arriving during peak market hours, making it back to Duncrub in time for a late supper.</p><p>He wanted to give her a gift, somehow show her how much she\u2019d come to mean to him. Though no gift on earth would be adequate to the task, Will found he wanted to buy her something all the same.</p><p>He hurried from the stables, patting the flap of his sporran over and again, making sure he\u2019d not somehow lost the bundle he\u2019d tucked in there. He hoped she\u2019d like it. Rollo smiled, thinking she might.</p><p>He hesitated in Duncrub\u2019s entryway. Should he find Felicity first, or eat first? He\u2019d not eaten since before noon\u2014and that while horseback\u2014and he found he was fair starved.</p><p>But he wanted to see her. Needed to see her. He\u2019d spent the better part of the day fantasizing about the give of her flesh under his grip and the feel of his mouth on hers.</p><p>Debating the needs of his loins versus the needs of his belly, he heard his mother approach. He\u2019d grown up hearing the telltale elegant skim of fabric over stone and the unwelcome sound never failed to identify her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Rollo realized he was not overly fond of that sound. He girded himself.</p><p>\u201cYou dare bring such filth into my home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d he said, facing her. \u201cI\u2019d expected your usual frost, but this . . . venom, this is a surprise.\u201d He forced a casual smile. \u201cTo what do I owe such an uncharacteristic display of emotion?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she sputtered, staring trembling at her son. \u201cWho do you think you are to speak to me so? If your father were here, you\u2019d never dare to speak thus\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFather is here, Mother.\u201d He\u2019d spent his life avoiding his mother. His brother. But if Felicity had taught him anything in the past weeks, it was that life was too precious not to speak one\u2019s mind and one\u2019s heart with the same single voice.</p><p>\u201cMostly, Mother, I speak so, because it\u2019s high time somebody addressed you truthfully. My brother has spent his life tiptoeing around you. But I never have, and there\u2019s the rub, aye? It wasn\u2019t that you couldn\u2019t stomach a broken son, it\u2019s that you couldn\u2019t abide a willful one. It\u2019s no secret you harbor few affections\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAffection?\u201d Her voice was a strained hiss. \u201cYou speak to me of affection? What do you know of it, when all you\u2019ve done lately is bring your . . . your witch whore into my home?\u201d</p><p>Fury crackled through him, ice crystallizing his veins in a single, rapid wave. Rollo stepped to his mother, stopped, checked himself. He\u2019d not threaten her. Never could he stoop to that.</p> <p>Despite the vitriol, despite the twisted charade that was their family, Will would never raise a hand to one of his parents.</p><p>His free hand balled into a tight fist at his side. The feel of his nails digging into the meat of his palm gave him focus. \u201cYou will not speak of Felicity\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNobody will speak of Felicity,\u201d she interrupted, her tone a carefully modulated chill. \u201cAnd if you hope to call even a single farthing of the Rollo fortune your own some day, you will keep her presence a secret. The fact that she spent even a single hour here, a secret. You will take it to your grave, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicity is where she belongs now.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice came from the doorway, where he\u2019d been standing, hovering in silence.</p><p>\u201cSkulking about in the shadows again?\u201d Will sneered at his brother. He should\u2019ve known. Jamie would\u2019ve seen Will\u2019s attachment to Felicity, and now he\u2019d worry it like a dog his bone.</p><p>\u201cYou may get as testy as you like,\u201d Jamie said. \u201cIt won\u2019t save your pretty little witch.\u201d</p> <p>Will grew utterly still. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is where she belongs,\u201d his mother chirped.</p><p>But Will\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t swerve from his brother. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d White noise buzzed in his head. \u201cWhat have you done with Felicity?\u201d</p><p>Jamie only shrugged. \u201cShe was a peculiar bird, your woman. It was only a matter of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA matter of time before what?\u201d Will faced his brother, strode to him, but his fury seized his muscles, made him awkward, and his approach was labored, wooden.</p><p>Jamie eyed his younger brother with disdain. \u201cBefore she was imprisoned, cripple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImprisoned?\u201d Will\u2019s world went red. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve not done a thing.\u201d Jamie casually rested his head back on the doorjamb.</p> <p>\u201cThe minister and his men came for her,\u201d his mother said. \u201cFor witchcraft. Never have I felt such shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlexander Robertson?\u201d The thought of the man touching Felicity, of any man touching her . . . Horror swept him, turned his belly to ice.</p><p>Foreboding followed quick on its heels. Robertson was a madman with a taste for the smell of burnt flesh, his favorite pursuit throwing women on a witch\u2019s pyre. Dozens of them. \u201cAnd none of you tried to stop him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Jamie chuckled, \u201cyour woman tried. A wee spit-fire that one. She\u2019d scald any man.\u201d He raised his brow in a lewd smirk. \u201cOr have you already discovered that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did they take her?\u201d Will\u2019s voice sounded like the edge of a knife blade.</p><p>Jamie only shrugged.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t bear to see me happy, can you? Or is it you can\u2019t bear that she chose me over you?\u201d Love for Felicity had stoked something to life in his soul. And this time, rather than weathering his brother in bitter silence, Will raged. Plainspoken words his seven-year-old self would\u2019ve cheered to hear. \u201cHorses, women . . . they all seem to prefer me, don\u2019t they, Jamie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bloody bastard,\u201d Jamie hissed, and in three great strides, he had his sword unsheathed.</p><p>But Will was ready for him. He whipped his cane, slashing at Jamie\u2019s sword, sending it clattering across the foyer.</p><p>\u201cBoys,\u201d their mother shrieked. \u201cYou will not shed blood in my home.\u201d</p><p>Will cast a cold eye on his mother. \u201cYou\u2019d not look ill on it spilt elsewhere, though, would you?\u201d</p><p>He turned on his heel, away from his detested family, grateful for once that purpose gave ease to his gait.</p><p>He\u2019d leave Duncrub, at once. He\u2019d not have time to gather his things. Who knew what more mischief Jamie might rain down.</p><p>He\u2019d see his father, one last time. Then leave. Forever, if need be. Fortune be damned. His family be damned.</p><p>But first he needed to find paper, pen a letter.</p><p>Rollo needed help, and he knew just the place to find it.</p><p>Alexander Robertson was a creep. Felicity couldn\u2019t believe she\u2019d actually thought he was cute at first.</p><p>She eyed that blond hair, pulled back in a little ponytail. She hated little ponytails on men.</p><p>At least she wasn\u2019t tied up. The guards had wanted to tie her up, but apparently the minister fancied himself quite the gentleman. Creep.</p><p>\u201cYou could marry me,\u201d he told her.</p><p>\u201cSo . . . let me get this straight. My options are to be burned for witchcraft or . . . get down and dirty with you?\u201d Felicity looked around at the barren walls. Cold stone smelling of dank and urine. \u201cI hate to break it to you, but your little pad isn\u2019t exactly a date-getter.\u201d</p><p>Aboveground it hadn\u2019t looked so bad. In fact, Keltie Castle seemed quite the spread, with tapestries on the walls and a blazing fire in the hearth. But Robertson\u2019s lackeys had whisked her, screaming, down a ladder into an underground chamber where torchlight flickered on walls too shallow for her to stand upright.</p><p>She was terrified he might leave her alone. It was so still down there, with the black shadows threatening. She was frightened to death of that darkness, that utter silence, and of the memories it stirred.</p><p>Cold, black silence was too like the inside of her parents\u2019 car, right after the accident. She\u2019d shoved the memories away long ago, burying them down deep. But just two minutes alone in a place devoid of light or movement, and she was slammed back into the past, a terrified kid again.</p><p>And so she kept talking, because the sound of her voice was better than being left alone in this dungeon, quiet like a grave.</p><p>Robertson, unfortunately, seemed to be finding all her talk charming.</p><p>It had struck her that maybe this could be the thing that could save her: chattering on, using her feminine wiles to convince the minister to change his mind. Except she\u2019d changed his mind too much, because now he seemed smitten.</p><p>She studied his features in the dim light. What she\u2019d first thought was benign charm now seemed oily, smarmy, and just plain gross.</p><p>She just had to hold on. Will would come and save her. She knew he would come.</p><p>He was her Viking, after all. This whole escapade was writ in stone somewhere, on some grand tablet, kept by the fates, marking the ways of the universe.</p><p>Robertson reached for her, tried to stroke his fingers down her cheek. His touch disgusted her. Sneaky and ticklish, it reminded her of a spider.</p><p>Gross. She shuddered, flinching away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d be careful if I were you. Will is coming for me, and he won\u2019t take very kindly to this. You sure wouldn\u2019t want him to use that cane of his to open up a can of whoop- ass on your sorry minister hide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a strange wee creature you are,\u201d he murmured, obviously not understanding half of what she\u2019d said. \u201cLike an exotic bird in a cage.\u201d He edged closer on the narrow bench. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid only I can save you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan, you are such a total creep.\u201d She scooted away, her bottom half hanging off the cold stone now. \u201cYou and that Jamie both. Total creeps. I gotta ask, does this kidnapping thing work for you guys? I mean, generally speaking?\u201d</p><p>She had to keep his attention, keep chattering. Keep that torch lit until Will came for her.</p><p>\u201cIs that what this whole witch thing is about?\u201d she continued. \u201cWomen who you think are, I don\u2019t know, too cute, or too independent, or strong-willed, they won\u2019t date you, so you call them witches instead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou silly chit. I\u2019d watch your tongue were I you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re not me,\u201d she snapped, thinking she\u2019d found his Achilles\u2019 heel. Seems the guy probably didn\u2019t have the best track record with the ladies. \u201cBecause then you\u2019d be sitting in a dungeon getting hit on by a nasty loser. An unattractive, unappealing, stinky dog of a man.\u201d</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and Felicity worried that she\u2019d gone too far. She was sure he couldn\u2019t have understood all of what she said, but she imagined a phrase like stinky dog must resonate on some level.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask once more,\u201d Robertson said in a menacingly tight voice, \u201cwhere are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. Glasgow.\u201d Too bad she\u2019d never been there in her life. Hadn\u2019t the faintest idea what the place was like at all.</p><p>\u201cI cannot believe it.\u201d He peered at her, as if her features held some clue. \u201cFrom which part? Who is your father?\u201d</p><p>Uhhh . . . She and Will hadn\u2019t planned that far. She decided to wing it with the truth. \u201cMy father\u2019s dead, you jerk.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDead.

Listen well, girl. Royalists find no ally in my parish. Though I am more . . . discreet than others. Your death, should it come, won\u2019t be some tedious political commentary.\u201d His gaze grew fever bright. \u201cMy dear, your destiny will be a spectacle greeted by a cheering crowd.\u201d</p> <p>He stroked her cheek with his thumb once more, and this time the grip of his hand held her in place. \u201cI will not tell you twice. One way or another, Felicity Wallace, you shall submit to me. Or you shall perish in flames.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 21</p><p>Will stooped over the desk, weighing his words. He\u2019d found both paper and his father in the library.</p><p>He needed to make haste now. He would turn to the Sealed Knot, that secret society of men dedicated to the restoration of the King. Though he\u2019d sworn never again to get pulled into their intrigues, never before had he something so precious to lose.</p><p>He would leave a letter, in the usual spot. And he\u2019d wait.</p> <p>He folded his note, tucked it in his sporran. His eyes lingered briefly over the velvet-wrapped bundle tucked there. Felicity\u2019s gift. He\u2019d see it in her hands if it killed him.</p><p>And kill him it might.</p><p>He looked to his father, and found the man had been watching him. A chill shivered over his skin. The thought that his father was trapped in his body was too much to bear.</p><p>\u201cDa,\u201d he rasped. \u201cWould that you had some words of wisdom for your youngest son. I\u2019d give the use of my good leg to hear your voice once more.\u201d</p><p>Shuffling closer, Rollo pulled a chair before his father and sat.</p><p>\u201cI must go.\u201d He looked deeply into the man\u2019s eyes. They were the hazel color of Will\u2019s own, yet rheumy. The eyes of an old man. And Will too felt like an old man. Had become an old man on his seventh birthday, so many years past.</p> <p>\u201cI hate . . .\u201d Rollo\u2019s voice cracked. Would these be the last words he spoke to his father? He needed to weigh them carefully. \u201cI hate to leave you. But I must go. They took her. Jamie had men come and take Felicity. Would that you could\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the older man croaked, and Will startled at the sound.</p><p>\u201cOch, Da, you speak to me.\u201d A pang struck his heart, happiness and grief both.</p><p>The man blinked rapidly.</p><p>\u201cHave you more to say?\u201d Will sat on the edge of his chair, his heart hammering in his chest. His father\u2014speaking.</p><p>The older man shut his eyes once, slowly and deliberately.</p><p>\u201cTell it,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cDo you know something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cK . . .\u201d Trying desperately to make a sound, the man\u2019s tongue flexed grotesquely, and spittle flew from his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Rollo gripped his hand. \u201cWhere? Do you know where they\u2019ve taken her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKkkk . . .\u201d The sound scudded along the back of his tongue.</p><p>\u201cTo the kirk?\u201d Will asked eagerly. \u201cBack to the church at Saint Serf\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm . . .\u201d A despairing sound echoed in the man\u2019s throat. He shut his eyes. Opened them, trying again, his face red with the effort. \u201cKkkk . . . Kelt . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cKelt. Keltie?\u201d Will asked suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken her to Keltie Castle?\u201d</p><p>His father blinked once, saw his son had understood, then shut his eyes from exertion.</p><p>\u201cThank you, Da,\u201d he said quietly. He hesitated a moment, then clapped a hand on his father\u2019s shoulder. Never had he shown his father affection. At least, not since the accident, which in some ways was the only measurable span of Will\u2019s life. He leaned down now, kissed the older man on the head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to see.\u201d</p><p>He straightened, overwhelmed by gratitude, love, and some other, indistinct feeling. Will thought perhaps it might be grief. For his own self.</p><p>\u201cKeltie Castle,\u201d he muttered, picturing at once the granite specter and its famed dungeon with walls nine feet thick.</p><p>He patted his sporran one last time, hoping Ormonde was out there somewhere. His friend was the only one Rollo trusted to help Felicity find her way home.</p><p>For Will would be of no help. Because, he vowed, he\u2019d be giving his own life to save hers.</p><p>Ormonde came, finally, as Will knew he would. To place a note under a stone at Dupplin Cross was as good as putting correspondence directly into the Sealed Knot\u2019s hands.</p><p>He\u2019d had too much time to think, though, while he waited among the Forteviot castle ruins. Rollo had decided it only fitting that it was some ancient Pictish landmark that bore witness to his despair.</p><p>Resting his back against the cold stone, he fingered his gift to Felicity, marveling at what a wretch he\u2019d become in so short a time.</p><p>For he knew what he must do. He would save her. He prayed he\u2019d have the chance to give her this one gift.</p><p>And then Rollo would say good-bye.</p><p>For, even if he survived\u2014and he doubted he would\u2014she needed to return to her own home, her own time. It was far too dangerous for her to stay.</p><p>Fool. That strange and colorful card had been right. He\u2019d been a fool. A fool to let himself get close to her. A fool to feel the warm flicker of hope in his chest. A fool to love her.</p><p>And now he was a wretched fool.</p><p>\u201cOch, man,\u201d Ormonde scolded. \u201cPut that thing back in your sporran.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will tucked the velvet pouch away, then scrubbed his face with his hands. \u201cWe need a plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA plan. Yes.\u201d Ormonde sat cross- legged across from Will in the grass and placed his hands on his knees in an exaggerated gesture of focus. \u201cLet us assess. We are a cripple and a redheaded fugitive, come to secret a helpless waif from a castle full of religious zealots.\u201d He gave a sage nod. \u201cNo, Will, I can\u2019t see how storming this wee castle will pose a problem at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need solutions, not sarcasm.\u201d Even so, Rollo felt a glimmer of humor pierce his melancholy, and he welcomed it. He wondered if that weren\u2019t the real reason he\u2019d called on Ormonde above all others. The man had a way of cracking Will\u2019s grim shell. \u201cDon\u2019t forget it was this cripple who pulled your arse from the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Ormonde said, and instead of laughing at Rollo\u2019s momentary humor, he grew serious. \u201cBut you know what this means, Will.\u201d</p><p>He gave a tight nod. He\u2019d seen it coming. \u201cYour letter. I\u2019ll deliver it to the King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the risk you take,\u201d Ormonde said quietly. \u201cCromwell\u2019s spies troll the English Channel. Many of our men have already been captured. Hanged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will\u2019s voice was tight, his face hardened to planes of steel. \u201cMy life matters not. It\u2019s Felicity we must save now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe shall try. But you need to be realistic. We are grossly outnumbered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere must be something we can use against them,\u201d Rollo said. \u201cSome way to outmaneuver them.\u201d</p><p>His friend snapped his fingers in mock excitement. \u201cI know,\u201d he said sarcastically, \u201chow about we set off a flurry of fireworks . . . Chinese fireworks! A display so grand as to convince our God-fearing witch-hunters that the wrath of the Almighty is upon them. Apocalypse is nigh, etcetera.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Will said sharply. He paused a moment, then, \u201cWell . . . maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOff to the Orient, are we?\u201d Ormonde rolled his eyes.</p><p>\u201cQuit your jesting,\u201d Will told him. \u201cListen. We won\u2019t storm the castle. We\u2019ll bring the guardsmen to us. Blast our way in, perhaps, with black powder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible,\u201d Ormonde replied at once.</p><p>\u201cAnd that is precisely why they won\u2019t expect it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, Will. They won\u2019t expect it because it\u2019s impossible. You\u2019ll bring the whole damned building down right atop your Felicity\u2019s bonny head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right then,\u201d Rollo said. \u201cSmoke. We smoke them out, like rabbits from a hole. Create some sort of device that releases smoke, not fire.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde stared blankly, then asked, \u201cWhere, pray tell, do you plan to find these grand stores of . . . what would we even use for that . . . saltpeter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let your Sealed Knot men handle that. They owe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Will.\u201d His friend grew somber. \u201cAs you will owe them, and tenfold.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 22</p><p>It was the musket loops that finally convinced Ormonde. Keltie Castle was small, more a grand home than any traditional notion of a castle. Small holes called musket loops lined the front of the building, along the base, located in what would be the guardroom, from which guardsmen could point their muskets, shooting any who dared to attempt forced entry.</p><p>Will hoped Ormonde would provide enough of a distraction so that there\u2019d be no gun barrels pointing through those loops, waiting to greet Rollo when the time came for him to toss his wee candles through.</p><p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll not blow ourselves up,\u201d Ormonde whispered, watching Rollo pour a measure of saltpeter into one of the makeshift vessels they\u2019d fashioned from paraffin.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t explode.\u201d Will tucked a strip of touchpaper in the powder, like a wick resting in lantern oil. The paper had been soaked in saltpeter and would burn slowly enough to allow Rollo to get away before his creation could quite literally backfire. \u201cThough I\u2019d not look askance at a good, rousing boom. Perfect,\u201d he muttered, smoothing softened paraffin over the top to finish. \u201cA perfect wee candle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you certain this will be enough?\u201d Ormonde asked him. \u201cThese will make enough smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not of your concern. You know what you have to do,\u201d Rollo added, referring to Ormonde\u2019s preposterous disguise, and the men\u2019s low laughter broke the tension.</p><p>There had been much discussion over who would be forced to dress up and create a distraction. Will claimed it was his friend\u2019s histrionic nature that awarded him the hon ors, but really it was that he\u2019d not put Ormonde in any danger above and beyond what he was already being exposed to. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Saltpeter did have the irksome tendency to explode when kept in large quantities.</p><p>\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Ormonde said. \u201cI create a distraction. You plant your wee smoke candles. So, tell me how is it we avoid alerting every guardsman this side of the Tay? The smoke will be silent, but your pistol shots won\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pistols. You leave the guards to me. I can be as silent as death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo dire, he is.\u201d Ormonde chuckled.</p><p>Ignoring him, Rollo studied the moon in the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s closing in on dawn. We act now, or not at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, aye.\u201d Ormonde heaved himself up to standing. He brushed the leaves and dirt from the rough brown cassock that was his disguise.</p><p>\u201cLeave yourself be,\u201d Will ordered. \u201cIt\u2019s more realistic that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease tell me, why is it I have to portray the religious lunatic, when you get to be dressed as . . . let\u2019s see . . . a high-born lord?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI promise\u201d\u2014Will stood and clapped his friend on the shoulder\u2014\u201cyou can play the lordling next time. And Ormonde?\u201d he asked, growing serious. He opened his sporran to retrieve the velvet-wrapped bundle. \u201cI\u2019d have you give this to Felicity, in case I\u2019m . . . unable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, lad.\u201d Ormonde put his hand up to stop him. \u201cPut your wee pouch away already. Give it to the woman yourself. You survived how many campaigns riding by Graham\u2019s side in the wars? I think we can handle a few provincials.\u201d</p><p>A brief nod and a tense quarter hour later, Will heard the beginnings of his friend\u2019s \u201cdistraction.\u201d</p><p>It began with a distant howl. And then, in an absurd turn that only Ormonde would think of, the redheaded man crowed like a rooster.</p><p>Shaking his head, Will gathered his makeshift smoke candles. The cock\u2019s crow was a nice touch. He was certain the guardsmen would leave their post once Ormonde unleashed his mad babble of scripture.</p><p>There was a door in the rear of the building. Not wanting to leave the safety of Keltie, the guards would surely at least peer through it. Rollo hoped they\u2019d keep it unlatched, for it would serve as Ormonde\u2019s route back in. He\u2019d not have his friend tangled in the inevitable scuffle that\u2019d be occupying Rollo by the front entrance.</p> <p>\u201cI come to see the witch!\u201d his friend screeched.</p><p>Will began to light each strand of touchpaper, thinking the tattered brown mendicant\u2019s cassock had been just the thing to accent Ormonde\u2019s simulated madness. Any moment now, he thought, urging the guardsmen to move. The impromptu wicks smoldered already, giving him a lungful of smoke.</p><p>\u201cDeath to the witch! \u2018Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live!\u2019 \u201d Ormonde\u2019s voice grew louder as he approached the rear of the castle. \u201cBurn her! Maggie Wall was a witch who haunts me still! Burn this evil woman as you burned Maggie Wall!\u201d</p><p>Enough, Will thought, glowering. Enough with the damned burning.</p><p>Apparently his friend decided the same, for he altered his approach. \u201cDeuteronomy saith . . .\u201d Ormonde paused, and Rollo tensed, hoping that his friend hadn\u2019t already exhausted his battery of scripture.</p><p>\u201cDeuteronomy saith!\u201d he shouted again suddenly, and Will braced for what might be in store.</p><p>His friend was close now, and his dramatically lowered voice resounded through the trees. \u201cHe that is wounded in the testicles, or hath his privy member cut off, shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord. Deuteronomy saith it is so!\u201d</p><p>Trust his friend to devote the finite resources of his mind to quotes pertaining to the male member.</p> <p>\u201cWoe betide him and his stones who turn a deaf ear!\u201d</p><p>Will fought a smile, thinking that should get the guardsmen to move. And indeed he saw the first musket shift. A flash of moonlight on the barrel. And then it slid from the loop. And then another.</p><p>Rollo stood, pounding life into his legs. The gesture brought the image of Felicity to his mind, like a sudden blinding flare of light, so acute he flinched from it. Flinched from the memory of her scolding him about that very movement. In the carriage so long ago, when she\u2019d first touched him, truly touched him, and changed his life forever.</p><p>With a shake to his head, he made his way to the front of Keltie Castle. For once it was the need for silence that slowed his pace, and he cursed every second that kept Felicity in that dungeon.</p><p>He stood by the first musket loop, waited a moment. Though the stone was thick, Rollo didn\u2019t sense another body on the other side, and so he leaned down. Looked in.</p><p>The glimpse through such a small hole was piecemeal, but he could see a torch sputtering on the wall. Two abandoned stools. The room, empty. Does that mean there were two guards? he wondered distantly, certain he\u2019d not be so lucky.</p><p>No matter their number, the guardsmen had all gone to investigate, and Will had but a moment to deposit his wee ruse into the empty guardroom. The paraffin was hot to the touch, and he\u2019d have it out of his hands before the saltpeter began to smoke in earnest.</p><p>He tossed one through, listening intently to the soft splat the softened wax made on the stone floor. Oxygen hit the saltpeter, and a tentative wisp of dark smoke coiled into the room.</p><p>Will smiled. I\u2019m coming, Felicity.</p><p>He tossed the rest of the makeshift candles through, hearing the approaching voices of the guardsmen echo on the stone.</p><p>That meant Ormonde would be racing back into the woods by now. Safely, he hoped. For his friend needed to double back and whisk Felicity from the dungeon while Rollo occupied the guards.</p><p>He heard shouting and looked to see smoke drifting from the musket loops. Gray fingers turning a ghostly white before disappearing on the night\u2019s gentle breeze.</p><p>The guardsmen began to curse. To cough.</p><p>How many are there?</p><p>Will sidled up to the front entrance, just out of view.</p><p>The first guard burst through and was caught at once by Rollo\u2019s cane, waiting leveled at his neck. The man gagged, a hideously ragged sound, as if he choked on a bone. He stumbled forward and fell writhing, hands clutching at his throat.</p><p>The second guard was an even easier mark, for he paused just beyond the doorway, watching his fellow with a mixture of confusion and fear. Will gave a grim smile, wondering if the men might actually believe some avenging force had come to smite them.</p><p>The guard stood, and Rollo slid his cane through his lightly flexed fist, knocking the man\u2019s temple as he would a billiard ball. The man fell hard and at once.</p><p>Will didn\u2019t wait for the third and, he now knew, final man. He couldn\u2019t chance the guard\u2019s sounding an alarm. And so Rollo pivoted to face the doorway, swinging his cane as he moved, plowing up into the man\u2019s groin. The guard doubled over, and Will batted down, catching him neatly on the back of the head.</p><p>Rollo stood, panting. Waiting to hear footfalls that didn\u2019t come. Safe.</p><p>Ormonde should be appearing, bringing Felicity out safe at any moment. Where are you? Rollo allowed a few hard pounds of his heart.</p><p>And that was when he heard her scream.</p><p>Chapter 23</p><p>The feel of the minister\u2019s hands repulsed her. Where was Will? Felicity knew he\u2019d come, she just didn\u2019t understand what was taking him so long.</p><p>Robertson had scooted closer and closer, until she found herself hanging off the edge of the bench. One more inch and she\u2019d be on the floor, so instead she was forced to suffer the feel of his thigh along hers.</p><p>The man had gotten braver. The touch on her chin had migrated to her shoulder. Then to lingering strokes along her back.</p><p>His hand slinked lower.</p><p>\u201cWhy,\u201d she blurted suddenly, feeling his fingertips graze the curve of her bottom, \u201cdon\u2019t you take me upstairs?\u201d She looked around at the dank dungeon. A rickety ladder led down to where she was being held. The room was claustrophobic, with low stone walls and a curved ceiling.</p><p>\u201cI will take you upstairs when you give your word you\u2019ll come to your senses.\u201d He chucked her chin as if she were a wayward child.</p><p>She studied that ladder. Her only way out. She knew without hesitation that her Viking would find a way to manage it. He\u2019d swoop down and save her like some seventeenth-century superhero.</p><p>\u201cHm?\u201d Robertson tweaked her cheek. \u201cI\u2019d have your answer, sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh . . .\u201d Felicity didn\u2019t tell him no, nor would she ever tell him yes, hoping that her feigned indecision bought her more time. \u201cI need to hear more about you. Your good works.\u201d You narcissistic wacko.</p><p>She prayed her chatter distracted him from a fact that, to her, seemed chillingly clear: Alexander Robertson could simply take what he wanted at any time.</p><p>\u201cOh no, this is familiar ground, and I\u2019m ready to\u201d\u2014he traced a single finger down her spine\u2014\u201cexplore new territory.\u201d He cocked a brow, looking self-satisfied.</p><p>\u201cTerritory . . . yeah . . .\u201d She fumbled, struggling to think of new material. \u201cSpeaking of territory, what is this place? It\u2019s gross. And cold. I\u2019m really cold, you know.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cAnd it stinks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve said. Now it\u2019s time to stop your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, sniffing again. \u201cI mean, it really stinks. Like smoke. Do you smell smoke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Robertson snapped. \u201cI\u2019m finished with your prattling. You merely postpone the inevitable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, really,\u201d she said, panicked now. She actually did smell smoke, and the primitive animal instinct tucked away in the back of her brain began to sound alarm bells in response.</p><p>A man dropped to the floor, and she yelped in surprise. Relief swept her. Her Rollo had come.</p><p>And then she registered the soiled cloak and dark hood. The man approached, walking smoothly, with no limp, and she screamed. He pulled a long dagger from one of his loose sleeves.</p><p>She toppled from the bench in her terror, still screaming. Robertson had been taken off guard, and she skittered backward along the floor watching as the intruder overtook him, stabbing him in the neck.

Did she really want to live in a world where crazy, dirty, wild people ran around, going at each other with swords and knives?</p><p>One more shrill shriek burst from her.</p> <p>\u201cHaud your wheesht, woman.\u201d He pushed back his cowl, and Felicity suffered a surreal moment, wondering who, and how, and why this man seemed so familiar. She cried out again, unable to stop herself.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell, would you please . . . Och, hush! It\u2019s Ormonde. Will\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><p>Her breath continued to shudder in gasps, even though she now recognized the redheaded man from when she\u2019d first arrived.</p><p>Crazy, dirty, wild. And that, apparently, was her friend.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Will?\u201d She\u2019d tried to gather herself, but hysteria made her question come out as a wail.</p> <p>\u201cWill is\u2014\u201d</p><p>The slam of a body dropping to the ground behind them announced the arrival of a guard. A big bear of a man, with ragged brown teeth.</p><p>\u201cOch, hell, woman.\u201d Guarding her body with his, Ormonde spun to face the man.</p><p>The guard stepped forward and another man dropped into the dungeon. This one had a goatee, his long sword already out and drawn.</p><p>She was terrified. Maybe Rollo had been right. Maybe she didn\u2019t belong there. I can\u2019t do this. I really, really can\u2019t do this.</p><p>\u201cDid you have to caterwaul so?\u201d Ormonde grumbled, raising his dagger and bracing himself as the bearded one went for him.</p> <p>In her hysteria, Felicity focused on the second man\u2019s ugly scrap of facial hair, so pointy, so absurd, like one of the Musketeers.</p><p>I have to do this. I doubted Will before. He proved me wrong. I told him I\u2019d never doubt him again. He\u2019ll come for me.</p><p>The other, beefier guard bolted, and her gaze shifted, watching in slow-motion horror as he headed straight for her. The guard scooped her up from the ground like a rag doll, forcing the breath from her body in a high-pitched wheeze. Wrapping his arm around her belly, he swept around behind her in a mockery of an embrace. He smelled sour, his breath panting out of his open mouth, foul like rotten meat.</p><p>His knife was at her throat.</p><p>Oh God. I just want to go home.</p><p>\u201cDrop it,\u201d she heard the other guard say, and her attention was drawn back to Ormonde. The bearded guard was nodding at Ormonde\u2019s dagger, his blade pointed at Ormonde\u2019s chest, poised to run him through. \u201cDrop your dirk. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we discuss this?\u201d Ormonde\u2019s feigned nonchalance astounded her.</p><p>I can do this. Will is coming. He\u2019ll come save me.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s naught to discuss. You drop your blade, or she gets it in the throat.\u201d Ormonde followed the man\u2019s gaze, coming to rest on the sight of the dagger at Felicity\u2019s neck.</p><p>Desperate to shut out the nightmare unfolding around her, she shut her eyes tight. Tears spilled in a hot flood down her cheeks.</p><p>Hold on. He won\u2019t let me die.</p><p>She heard Ormonde\u2019s knife clatter to the ground. Did that mean all was lost? Was he dead already? She opened her eyes, terrified of what she might find.</p><p>But the sight that greeted Felicity sent relief swelling through her. Legs were emerging slowly into the chamber from above, as a man lowered himself down the ladder, stealthily, rung by rung, using only his arms.</p><p>Will. He was there. He\u2019d come. Crazy, dirty, wild men with swords didn\u2019t matter. Not when she had Will.</p><p>My Viking will protect me. We\u2019re meant to be.</p><p>She quickly looked back to Ormonde. She couldn\u2019t spoil it by giving Will away, and fought to keep her eyes on his friend instead. If he\u2019d also spotted Rollo, she didn\u2019t know. The redheaded man seemed only to have eyes for the blade pointed at his chest.</p><p>What could she do? She wished there were some way she could help them. Her eyes swept down, scanned Robertson\u2019s body, lying in a bloody heap. She shuddered.</p><p>She felt the man behind her stiffen. Had he seen Rollo? Should she scream? Create a distraction? Stomp on his foot? She was helpless. Powerless. The feeling chilled her.</p><p>Events slowed, her perception the sluggish click of a camera shutter.</p><p>The guard behind her was beginning to shout a warning.</p><p>Her eyes went back to the bearded man. Would he run his blade through Ormonde? She watched him, watched in dreadful slow motion, focused, absurdly, on that beard. A curled moustache atop a pointed, brown goatee. Ridiculous.</p><p>But then the man made the strangest face. A look of surprise. Then an eerie, blank sort of expression suffused his features. His eyes, deadened. His mouth, and that facial hair, all gone slack.</p><p>He crumpled to the ground. Ormonde jumped aside just in time to avoid the man\u2019s blade as it thrust awkwardly forward before dropping to the dirt.</p><p>And there stood Rollo. Tall, with eyes that were shadowed and lethally intent in the flickering torchlight. He was utter calm. Utter stillness.</p><p>His arm extended as if he\u2019d just thrown a ball, or a dart. Or a knife.</p><p>Felicity\u2019s eyes went to his sgian dubh, quivering deep in the man\u2019s back.</p><p>She looked back up to find Rollo\u2019s gaze devouring her. The flex of his jaw and the hard cast to his eyes were all that marred his outward calm.</p><p>Her heart soared. She knew what the set of that strong jaw meant. He\u2019d come for her. He\u2019d make this all go away.</p><p>My Viking will always come for me.</p><p>The surreal slow-motion unfolding of events exploded into rapid-fire action.</p><p>Ormonde squatting to retrieve his blade.</p><p>The cold press of steel on her throat, grown urgent.</p><p>Will, a shuffled step and a quick leap toward her. He led with his hands. Hands that grabbed the guardsman\u2019s face. It was a savage gesture, without thought, like an animal pouncing, mauling his prey.</p><p>She pulled away, out from the path of Rollo\u2019s feral leap. Away from her attacker\u2019s knife.</p><p>The guardsman\u2019s neck sounded a morbid crack, a hollow echo in the dank stone chamber. His fall, a dull thud.</p><p>Rollo went to Felicity at once. Wrapped her in his arms. His hands were all over her. He felt her face, her throat. The feel of him, solid against her, was like a homecoming.</p><p>Will, her home now.</p><p>Stroking her hair, he pulled her close, and then pushed back again, to ensure with his eyes what his hands had discerned. That she was unharmed.</p><p>\u201cYou came,\u201d she cried. \u201cI knew you\u2019d come. I told him to watch out\u2014that you\u2019d come.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not?\u201d His hands stilled, cupped her cheeks. Rollo leaned in to kiss her tenderly. One chaste and lingering kiss on her mouth, still damp from her tears.</p><p>\u201cI hate to interrupt you lovers, but I\u2019d rather we make haste from here, before Robertson\u2019s wee army of God discovers we\u2019ve regained possession of his pretty prize witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Are you fine to travel?\u201d Will asked her gently.</p><p>At her nod, he tucked her close. Her eyes widened.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your cane?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t very well climb down the ladder with it, could I?\u201d He gave her a small smile.</p><p>\u201cYou came down to save me with nothing but that little knife in your sock?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man has his hands too, aye?\u201d He squeezed her waist, emphasizing his point.</p><p>She gave a startled laugh, and spied a flicker of joy on his face in response, as if only now it was hitting him that she was safe. That Robertson was dead.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re right,\u201d Rollo said, turning to his friend. \u201cWe need to be away, and at once, before my brother comes sniffing about.\u201d Lifting his arm, he said to Ormonde, \u201cFor once I\u2019ll ask for your assistance, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God be praised,\u201d Ormonde said, rolling his eyes. He stepped to Rollo, offering his shoulder for the short walk across the chamber floor. \u201cFinally. The man accepts help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t gloat,\u201d Will told him, with a rare twinkle in his eye. \u201cThis will be the last thing I ask of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Ormonde said, growing serious. \u201cFrom this moment on, you are the one who\u2019ll be called upon. The Sealed Knot men don\u2019t forget a debt.\u201d He looked at the bodies littering the floor behind them, some complicated internal calculation knitting his brow. \u201cAnd so it is here I must say good-bye to you. For now.\u201d</p><p>They climbed back up the ladder, the red-haired man\u2019s ominous words hanging in the air.</p><p>Chapter 24</p><p>\u201cSo . . . cool,\u201d Felicity said, kicking at the edges of the dirt pathway. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me the Romans marched right here? Like, along this very track?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, along this very one.\u201d Rollo stopped and turned, studying the path they\u2019d just traversed. Some stretches were a deep and well-defined track, when all that was left of others was an eroded scar in the earth.</p><p>The Roman road was concealed by a dense thicket, which rose like a canopy around them, its mossy branches gnarled with age, dark and smelling of lush, rotted undergrowth, like some forest primeval. He\u2019d had to slash their way in, edging carefully through and into the heart of what felt to Felicity like some long-slumbering dryad, vaguely malevolent and poised at any moment to creak into life, wrapping its woody claws around to seal them in forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat you see is the ghost of the Roman Empire\u2019s north ernmost border.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have to say ghost?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t fret, you.\u201d Chucking her chin, Rollo gave a low laugh. \u201cThough many know of the Roman fort in Kincladie Wood, few know this ancient road exists as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat just means they\u2019ll never find us,\u201d she said with dramatic gloom, chafing her arms and walking on.</p><p>\u201cAfraid we\u2019ll rouse the big Green Man from his slumber and he\u2019ll come and eat us?\u201d</p><p>She nodded nervously, an exaggerated frown of fear crinkling her features. \u201cThat\u2019s almost exactly what I was thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear not.\u201d He wrapped his arm around her, hugging her close. \u201cI shall protect you. I\u2019m a valiant knight, remember?\u201d Rollo kissed the top of her head. \u201cAnd besides,\u201d he added, patting his sporran, \u201cthere\u2019s a reward for you at the end.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA reward?\u201d she cooed, giving him a saucy wink.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak, and then shut it again, growing somber.</p><p>It seemed to Felicity she\u2019d just witnessed some inner light flickering, then winking out.</p> <p>\u201cWait.\u201d She stopped. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s naught that\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you naught me, William Rollo. You just thought something. Something not good, and I want to know what it was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly?\u201d she demanded.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only that we cannot . . . We should not lie together again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She rounded on him. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy talk. Why the hell not? You didn\u2019t just save me from some deranged kidnapper only to . . . Wait.\u201d She thought she knew what this was about. Her good, old-fashioned, noble Viking. \u201cIs it that you think we should get married first, because\u2014\u201d</p><p>At the mention of marriage, she saw something in him die. She saw the despair, and she knew.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to send me back, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she asked him quietly.</p><p>He gave her a silent, grim nod.</p><p>\u201cYou bastard.\u201d She shoved him in the chest, and his eyes widened in surprise. \u201cYou are not going to send me back. I belong with you,\u201d she said, stabbing a finger in his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have compromised you so,\u201d he said, his words so formal, she felt like she was being shut out. \u201cI\u2019d rather have you safe than\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThan have sex with me?\u201d Felicity blurted. She grew still. \u201cAre you saying we shouldn\u2019t have done it the first time?\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, but didn\u2019t speak. Why wasn\u2019t he saying anything?</p><p>Tears threatened, her voice reed-thin. \u201cAre you saying you think this was a mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, love. Never.\u201d He canted his head, studying her as if for the last time. Such openness, such raw emotion was in his gaze, Felicity thought her heart would break from it. \u201cI\u2019ll never regret it. Never regret you. But . . . it\u2019s too dangerous. I was a fool. You had me believing that you were sent back to me. For me. To be by my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I was,\u201d she said simply. \u201cAnd now mister preacher man is dead. I\u2019m safe. We\u2019re getting away. Happily ever after, and all that jazz.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour . . . happily ever after . . . can only come when you are safe. Here you are not, will never be, safe.\u201d He took her shoulders. His hands were so gentle and strong, his eyes on her so intent, so earnest. And it was as though he\u2019d begun to pull away already. \u201cAye, Robertson is dead, but his followers are not. These men . . . they\u2019re like a great, ravenous beast that\u2019s scented blood. They enjoy what they do, Felicity. Some of them truly believe you are a witch. They want to see you burn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, love, let me finish.\u201d The shadow of some distant pain pinched his features. \u201cIf that weren\u2019t enough, there\u2019s my brother to contend with. Robertson wasn\u2019t in this alone. I see Jamie\u2019s hand at work. My brother will not rest until he sees you ripped from my arms.\u201d</p><p>They stared at each other in silence. Felicity\u2019s mind refused to process what was happening.</p><p>\u201cIt would be too selfish of me,\u201d he said finally. \u201cToo great a risk. I\u2019ll not see you in danger ever again. And so I must see you gone.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung her eyes. Her throat clenched, from misery, from frustration, from desperation. She had to convince him she needed to stay. He was her hero, her Viking. He could protect her. She would show him she needed to stay.</p><p>\u201cScrew that, William Rollo.\u201d Her voice was a fierce growl.</p><p>She leapt for him, and Rollo stumbled backwards. His cane clattered to the dirt as he caught her, supported her. She wrapped her legs around him, kissing him, tangling her fingers wildly in his thick, soft, chestnut hair.</p><p>It took him only a moment to start kissing her back, and she knew a brief flicker of triumph. She felt his moans hum through her, but whether they were sounds of pleasure or anguish, Felicity wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She craved him, completely. Wanted to take him in, feel his breath in her lungs. To feel him inside her, to feel Rollo spill himself, inside her.</p><p>Then, surely, he\u2019d realize.</p><p>She pulled from him, cradled his face in her hands. Her voice was the barest whisper. \u201cPlease, Will. I want you. Just one more time.\u201d</p><p>She felt him between her legs, hard and wanting her in return, and she knew she had him. She\u2019d convince him she could handle the past, and he\u2019d want one more, and one more, and one more again.</p><p>\u201cLay me down, Will.\u201d Felicity trailed slow kisses along his face, his neck. \u201cLay down with me.\u201d</p><p>She unhooked her legs from around his waist. Nestling the hard length of him between her thighs, she did a slow slide down the front of his body to the ground.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t . . .\u201d he said raggedly. \u201cI must remain alert. I vowed I\u2019d see you back safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat better way to keep me safe than to lay right on top of me?\u201d She tugged at his arms, beckoning him down to the ground.</p><p>The forest floor was cool and soft, a rich, mossy loam that gave with their weight. Light filtered in through the knotted thicket overhead, and what had seemed a malignant wood spirit now felt natural, some primitive homecoming, dirt and sex and trees.</p><p>He lay on his side facing her, his face a map of pain and longing.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think,\u201d she whispered to him. \u201cJust be. Let go, Will. You\u2019ll most regret the thing you don\u2019t do, not the thing you do.\u201d</p><p>She traced her fingertip lightly along his features. The strong edges of jaw and cheekbone, his aristocratic brow and nose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want me?\u201d Her soft voice mingled with the rustles and sighs of the forest around them.</p><p>\u201cHow could you even think I\u2019d not want you?\u201d he asked hoarsely. Will put his hand on hers, stilling it. He turned his head to kiss her palm. \u201cWanting you is all I\u2019ve been doing since the first day I laid eyes on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd so you have me.\u201d Putting her hands on his shoulders, she guided him onto his back and swung a leg over to straddle him. He nestled between her legs, hard already, and the feel of it flashed her back to their first time.</p><p>Him, familiar, a body already known by her own, as readily recognized as his heart. Her chest crackled with the joy of it.</p><p>He watched her, watched this glorious creature climb onto him for the second time in his life, not knowing how it could be that he was worthy of such a thing. Elation and grief collided in his heart with an ache rivaled only by the one between his legs.</p><p>Will reached up to unlace her. She stopped him, giving him a single slow, mute shake of her head.</p><p>With a seductive arch of her back, Felicity reached behind to undo her own laces. She was careful and silent, her eyes not shifting from his. Her hair slipped through her gown as she raised it over her head, falling in a heavy spill over her shoulders and breasts.</p><p>Compelled to touch it, to touch her, he brushed his knuckle lightly over a swath of that hair, thick yellow silk over her hardened nipple.</p><p>She inhaled sharply, and his eyes shot back to hers. They both remained silent, this moment a fragile thing, charged already with the pain of good-bye.</p><p>She was naked now, and Will clothed, and looking up at her, the watery sunlight illuminating her from above, he could almost believe she was the fairy princess he\u2019d mused about when he\u2019d had his first sight of her.</p><p>Felicity reached down, began to carefully undress him, and this time he let her. Her concentration, those graceful and precise movements, stabbed him with an anguish that stole the breath from his chest.</p><p>Finally he felt her skin on his, and he shut his eyes, overwhelmed by it all. His desire, his pain, both drowning him.</p><p>He felt her shift, lean closer. Felt her face hover over his, but still he kept his eyes closed. Perhaps he\u2019d never wake from this dream. Perhaps they\u2019d always been here, could always remain here, in this magical, dark place, alone together.</p><p>He felt her kiss him tenderly. On his cheeks, his brow, her soft mouth tasting him all over, as if he were a sweet. The notion of it unmanned him.</p><p>How had he come to feel so deeply for her? Such a delight, such a treasure, she\u2019d changed his life. Him, a man changed.</p><p>How would he ever live without her?</p><p>The thought made his lust grow desperate, his cock straining with the need to be in her, to claim her and keep her close.</p><p>He opened his eyes, and his first sight was her lovely face still held near, lips parted and waiting for him. He kissed her, dragged his hands along her naked back, and her hair fell around them like a curtain, burying him in the smell of her, a scent like flowers and musk.</p><p>He could wait no longer. Grabbing her hips, he lifted her up and onto him. The feel of her tight, wet heat enveloping him, bringing him home, made him shudder with pleasure. It felt too good, she felt too good.</p><p>The urge to plow into her consumed him, and he fought it, holding himself still until he could master his breath. Felicity moved first, with a moan and a rocking of her hips, and his lust exploded in response, subsuming him, blinding him, like a battle rage.</p><p>Will shifted, braced her body to flip her onto her back, but Felicity tensed her thighs, stopping him.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, finally breaking the silence. \u201cI want to stay on top this time.\u201d</p><p>He brought his hands, his mouth, to her breasts. Gripped her ass, her legs, clutching her closer, tighter. He couldn\u2019t consume enough of her.</p><p>She moved slowly at first, writhing over him, whispering his name, and then faster, and faster still, until he thought he might die from it. Might lose himself forever, if only he\u2019d let go one last final bit.</p><p>And then he felt it\u2014her movements slowing, strengthening, Felicity sat hard on him, gradually stilling.</p><p>Her hands, her thighs, and God help him, her muscles down deep, the whole of her body seized, clutching him. His cock, gripped deep inside her. He watched and felt the waves of her climax crash over her. Watched as her skin flushed pink, watched her eyes close and mouth open. Watched as she was lost to him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Will lost himself then too. Shutting his eyes, he let go, let himself spin into blackness, the touch and taste and smell of her the only gravity holding him to this earth.</p><p>Later, she dozed, but Will did not. He needed to savor every last moment with this woman. Stroking the hair from her damp brow, he wondered how he could ever let her go.</p><p>But how could he let her stay?</p> <p>Felicity had been right on one count. He would have no regrets. He\u2019d let himself love her.</p><p>Then he\u2019d say good-bye.</p><p>Felicity would leave him, and he knew he would die inside. His life would be forfeit. He\u2019d throw himself into his cause, help the Sealed Knot men, deliver their messages to the King.</p><p>Only now it wouldn\u2019t matter to him if he lived or died doing it.</p><p>Chapter 25</p> <p>She woke sprawled over Will, the faint bristle of hair on a muscular chest tickling between her fingers. He\u2019d finally fallen asleep. It was as if she\u2019d given him a dare when she\u2019d said men sack out right after sex. She\u2019d dozed off right away, but every time she roused, he was there to soothe her at once, his hand caressing through her hair.</p><p>Night had fallen, and though her body was warm where it touched his, her back felt chilled and exposed. Carefully, she disentangled herself, found his plaid, and pulled it up over them both.</p><p>The thing was huge. Such a long stretch of wool, the same blue, green, and yellow of those funny, sexy pants he was wearing when she first met him. She much preferred him in the kilt.</p><p>She was wide awake, and occupied her mind with random thoughts. Like wondering how he wrapped all this wool around himself. And thinking about those troops of marching Romans. About witches, and ministers, and magic.</p><p>She filled her head with thoughts, and yet a numbing sadness persisted, looming somewhere at the edges, threatening to overtake her. He thought she was in danger, that she needed to go back.</p><p>And she knew he was right about the danger. She\u2019d gotten a taste of Robertson\u2019s men. A demon light had blazed in their eyes, longing to tie her up and toss her in the dungeon. To burn her.</p> <p>But Will thought he couldn\u2019t protect her, and there she knew he was wrong. He was her brave hero; she didn\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t see it himself. He was strong and valiant, and would save her from any threat. And she had a limited time in which to convince him.</p><p>Knowing there was only one thing that would calm her mind, she slid her hand down Will\u2019s chest. He stirred, sighed deeply in and out, then his breathing grew rhythmic once more.</p><p>She felt suddenly wicked and free there, lying naked in the woods, the flicker of starlight making its way into their burrow, a faint patchwork shimmering through the dense thicket overhead.</p><p>Felicity traced her hand lower. Found the light line of hair at the base of that flat belly, leading from navel to groin. A little shiver of pleasure rippled through her, tracing her fingers through it. Happy trails, she thought with a naughty smile.</p><p>She wondered what time it was. Feeling that chest and those abs had made her eager for the sun to rise. Will\u2019s upper body was strong, compensating for his damaged legs, and she wanted to see him move in the daylight. Watch how his muscles would shift and flex. She wanted to memorize every detail.</p><p>Her hand moved lower. Brushed along his cock. It began to rouse at once. She didn\u2019t want to wake Will, but she couldn\u2019t keep her hands off of him. He was so vulnerable in sleep, all hers, there for the taking.</p><p>She touched him again. He continued to stir, stiffen. She couldn\u2019t not touch him. He swelled to life, that thin skin, fine like silk.</p><p>\u201cI thought you said just the once.\u201d His voice was a husky rasp.</p> <p>\u201cWell . . .\u201d She looked up and smiled at him in the dark. She\u2019d loved watching him sleep, but she much preferred having him awake, by her and with her.</p><p>She could\u2019ve fooled herself, thinking her goal was simply to really really convince him she needed to stay, but Felicity knew she simply just wanted Will inside her again. To connect with him, feel his love filling her.</p><p>\u201cAs long as we\u2019re here . . .\u201d She began to stroke him, just in case he needed her to draw a picture.</p><p>He didn\u2019t.</p><p>Will pulled her closer, careful with her body along the moss and leaves of the ancient path. He kissed her, and deepened the kiss at once. His body ready for her, at once.</p><p>He turned her away from him, onto her side, and giving his arm for a pillow, settled himself behind her. Her back had been so chilled, but the feel of that solid chest and belly on her skin warmed her, finally, thoroughly. Heated her.</p><p>She was turned on already, thought she\u2019d probably woken that way, and she nestled her rump back to find him, urge him on.</p><p>He stroked his hand down her side, along her leg, and back up again, cupping her breast and pulling her more tightly to him. He slid into her and this time was only tender, only slow, nibbling lightly along her shoulder, nuzzling kisses and words of love into her neck.</p><p>And as they came, Felicity embraced the calm that finally smoothed the chatter from her mind.</p><p>\u201cHow do you work this thing?\u201d She stood before him in only her petticoat, his plaid draped over and around her, trying to get a handle on all that wool.</p><p>Part of her wanted to make him get up and stalk his naked way over to her. Another part simply wanted to try the darned thing on.</p><p>\u201cPlanning to don my plaid, is it?\u201d He grinned.</p><p>\u201cNo. Maybe.\u201d Shrugging, she smiled back at him. \u201cI just want to see how you do it.\u201d She bobbed the fabric up and down. \u201cMan, this is heavy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe Scotsmen are a strapping lot.\u201d He sat extra straight, giving a slight flex to his muscles.</p><p>\u201cSure you are,\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>\u201cOch, you devil me.\u201d Chuckling, he gestured to the fabric. \u201cJust lay out my plaid, love. You can help me put it on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s about time you asked. The only thing sexier than your kilt is the thought of helping you into it.\u201d She billowed the wool out like a sheet, letting it fall heavily to the ground. \u201cStrike that, actually. Nothing beats taking it off,\u201d she said, mustering her best saucy wink.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas, woman.\u201d He furrowed his brows in an attempt to look menacing. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much a man can take.\u201d</p><p>He moved opposite her, straightening the fabric\u2019s edges along the ground. Felicity guessed it was no less than five feet wide and over twelve feet long.</p><p>\u201cThis is kooky!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure what that word is, love, but if you mean to say this is not always the most convenient procedure, then aye, it isn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t correct him; Will was just too cute. He looked up and caught her staring at him with what she was certain was a dopey, adoring look.</p><p>\u201cIf I\u2019d known the sight of my plaid would put you in such a sweet dither, I\u2019d have enlisted your help long ago.\u201d</p><p>He sat down and began to gather the wool into folds. \u201cCome, kneel just here. We need to pleat it. Aye,\u201d he said, seeing her pick up his belt, \u201cwe need that too, tucked so.\u201d He slipped his belt under the plaid, roughly bisecting the wool across the center.</p><p>He lay down on it, with the upper edge of the plaid beneath his head and the bottom resting just under his knees. \u201cThen you roll right into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOoh,\u201d she purred. \u201cCan I roll right in there with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d he promised with exaggerated solemnity. \u201cI swear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed suddenly, watching as he wrapped the wool around his legs. \u201cSo you get on top, belt it, and the bottom half is the kilt\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the other\u201d\u2014he sat up, pulling the two top ends over his shoulder, one from the front, one from behind\u2014\u201cgoes like so.\u201d</p><p>She retrieved his leather cord from the dirt and tied it off at his shoulder for him. \u201cAnd next the sporran, right?\u201d she asked, crawling to grab it.</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d He gave her a broad smile. \u201cAnd inside that sporran is a wee token for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToken? I love tokens!\u201d She plucked his sporran from the ground to hand to him. Hesitating, she pulled it back, tucking it to her chest. \u201cCan I see what\u2019s in your little murse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy . . . eh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, man-purse. Murse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, woman.\u201d He snagged it from her hands, swatting her on the behind just as she was sitting back down. \u201cMock me, and I\u2019ll be forced to punish you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Waggling her fingers toward his sporran, she said, \u201cHand it over, big boy.\u201d</p><p>He relented, and she snatched the whole thing back.</p><p>She experienced a moment of total contentment. It felt like such an intimate thing, such a personal thing, holding his sporran. Her and Will, just sitting there looking through his stuff. She smiled.</p><p>\u201cYou still didn\u2019t answer my question,\u201d she said, stroking the sporran\u2019s flap. It was covered by something gray, furry, and somewhat matted, the provenance of which she dare not question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes you didn\u2019t answer my question, or yes I can look in your murse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall it that one more time and I\u2019ll withhold your wee gift.\u201d</p><p>She feigned outrage, and he barked out a laugh in response. \u201cCareful,\u201d he warned, \u201cor I\u2019ll kiss that scowl from your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh I wish you would.\u201d She leaned in, offering herself to be kissed.</p><p>Her offer had been playful, but Rollo grew serious. His suddenly hooded eyes prompted an instant response from her body, warm and flushed.</p><p>\u201cYou will be the death of me,\u201d he muttered, cradling the back of her head for a slow, deep kiss. Her breath caught in her chest, and she wondered if she\u2019d ever get over this. Ever get over the complete craving she felt when it came to Will. He pulled from her, leaving Felicity dazed.</p><p>His eyes held hers for a moment, and she thought he must have felt it too. He smudged her lower lip with his thumb. \u201cOpen it, then,\u201d he told her huskily. \u201cAs you must.\u201d</p><p>The prospect of rifling through his sporran spread a tickled little grin on her face, and she watched as it caught his too. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, I must,\u201d she said, digging in. \u201cLet\u2019s see . . .

A handkerchief, and, oh\u201d\u2014giggling, she pulled out a leather coin purse\u2014\u201clook, another murse, how cute!\u201d</p> <p>He glowered at her.</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she said, stifling her laughter, and pulled out a small metal box. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tinderbox.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tinder,\u201d he said hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but what\u2019s tinder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord above, woman. Jamie is surely scouring the countryside for us, and you\u2019re asking what\u2019s tinder. I use it to light a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOhhhh.\u201d She peeked back in the bag, muttering, \u201cYou can light my fire any day of the week, William Rollo.\u201d</p><p>She froze. There was a card stuck along the inside of the bag. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d It had wedged into a seam, and she plucked it out.</p><p>A Tarot card, just like Livvie\u2019s deck. A man walked blithely along, not seeing the cliff he was about to step from. The Fool.</p><p>\u201cThis is a Tarot card.\u201d A jumble of emotions rattled her. Such a small and specific memory of her aunt shot her through with grief. But she was also confused. \u201cWhere did you get this?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI found it. On a pretty girl.\u201d He smiled, cupped her cheek, and Felicity thought she might float away.</p><p>She must\u2019ve brought one of the Tarot cards with her. And Will had kept it. She marveled. Why would he keep such a trifling thing?</p><p>She smiled back, savoring the connection of his eyes locked with hers. Beaming, she dipped back into the sporran.</p><p>\u201cA-ha! Here\u2019s a little somethin-somethin,\u201d she said, pulling out the blue velvet bag. \u201cWhat might this be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat might be something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Though you\u2019ve been exceptionally naughty. I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ve earned it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just watch me earn it,\u201d she said in her best seductress voice. \u201cMaybe I haven\u2019t been naughty enough . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOho!\u201d He laughed, wrapping her hands around the gift. \u201cIf I have any hopes of walking out of here no more lame than I already am, you\u2019ll need to staunch your naughtiness for another hour at least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWell what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell can I open it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re suggesting I could stop you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh goodie,\u201d she said, assessing the pouch in her hand. There was something thick inside. Larger than a ring, smaller than a bracelet, though with the heft of one. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He merely shrugged, and she leaned in, planting an enthusiastic kiss on his cheek. \u201cI love presents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, so I see.\u201d</p><p>She beamed at him. She could listen to that accent for the rest of her life and she\u2019d never tire of all Will\u2019s ayes.</p><p>Felicity carefully unknotted the drawstring, and made a little anticipatory gasp to see the twinkle of polished metal.</p><p>She pulled out a piece of jewelry made of hammered gold. It was shaped like a torc, an unclosed circle that bore the head of a Celtic creature at each end, with brownish gems for eyes. A thick, blunt pin was secured along the back.</p><p>\u201cOh, Will.\u201d Tucking it close to her heart, she told him, \u201cI love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA Viking design,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cI thought it only fitting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cViking jewelry from my Viking.\u201d She shook her head, momentarily speechless, tilting the piece to glint in the weak sunlight.</p><p>\u201cThe stones are garnet,\u201d he told her, watching her avidly. \u201cThey put me in mind of your eyes, when they\u2019re caught by the sun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs . . . is it a brooch?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo . . .\u201d He turned her head gently and, gathering two thick swaths of her hair, secured it at the crown of her head. \u201cFor your bothersome hair. Don\u2019t you know? My wish is to free you of even the smallest of your troubles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy silly hair.\u201d Tears stung her eyes as she turned to look at him. Her Will. He was gorgeous to her, sitting there looking so uncharacteristically rumpled, with a day-old beard and disheveled brown hair. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, Felicity. You are a hard woman to forget.\u201d</p><p>They walked along the road, and Will was more certain than ever that Felicity must go.</p><p>Time alone with her was heaven. If he thought it were possible to disappear together, to run away and hide on some distant island as James had with Magda, he\u2019d leap at the chance. But he could not let himself forget, for even a moment, the grave danger she was in.</p><p>Every minute she spent in the past, the danger only grew. Jamie was relentless; he wouldn\u2019t stop until everything Will loved was destroyed. Even now, he\u2019d be combing the countryside for them. Even now, he\u2019d have Robertson\u2019s followers whipped into a bloodthirsty frenzy.</p><p>He had to keep her safe. They had to say good-bye. And Will knew their parting would forever extinguish this strange new vitality, this joy, he\u2019d discovered deep within.</p><p>She\u2019d leave, returning to her strange and foreign world. But Will would stay. He\u2019d pledged his help to the Sealed Knot men, to the King. He\u2019d keep his word, and it would likely cost him his life.</p><p>But parting from Felicity? The cost of that would be his very soul.</p><p>She kept biting her lip in concentration, touching the back of her head, tracing her finger over her wee hair ornament. Will wondered if there wasn\u2019t an invisible string tied from that mouth to his heart, because every time she nibbled at it with that look of happiness on her face, he felt a tug in his chest. It was deeply gratifying to have pleased her so.</p><p>She was such a delight, always so ready to embrace pleasure, to be with her was a revelation. When he was by her side, he forgot his inclination to sink ever downward. He\u2019d lived his life driven by disquiet, despondency. But Felicity was so easy, so light, with an inner fire that illuminated a side of himself he\u2019d never known existed.</p><p>It was agony to think on their coming good-bye. He was leading them to Lochaber, to Cameron lands. He\u2019d heard tell of a witch there, one who could help his Felicity.</p><p>The thought was too painful. An instant misery, like those nettles that had stung her what felt like so long ago. And so he pushed it from his mind, choosing instead to cling to this brief flare of joy in his life.</p><p>This joy that he would allow himself to feel, before he had to bid it farewell forever.</p><p>Chapter 26</p><p>\u201cYou will deliver Ormonde and your brother William to me.\u201d Richard Cromwell flicked the ends of his hair over his shoulders, a habit that Jamie was finding particularly irritating. \u201cTheir heads will suffice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you to order me?\u201d Jamie paused before the grave of Maggie Wall. Once such an inspiration, it now served as a bitter reminder of how Will had thwarted his plans yet again.</p><p>Oliver Cromwell\u2019s half-wit son had shown up on the doorstep of Duncrub Castle, bold as day. Jamie promptly whisked him to someplace more discreet. Robertson\u2019s untimely death had riled the minister\u2019s followers and set village tongues to wagging, and he dared not bring undue attention onto the Rollo household. \u201cIs that an order from your father?\u201d Jamie asked.</p><p>\u201cMy father is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Oliver Cromwell, dead? The news silenced Jamie, his mind barraged by a thousand different thoughts. Would Cromwell\u2019s death mean the restoration of the King? Would Parliamentarians like him find their fates on the gallows?</p><p>\u201cAnd who takes over in his stead?\u201d Jamie finally asked.</p><p>\u201cI,\u201d Richard said simply. He removed a large handkerchief from his pocket and fastidiously spread it over a large rock. He sat, crossing his legs primly at the ankles. \u201cRichard Cromwell, Lord Protector of England, Scotland, and Ireland. I quite like the sound.\u201d</p><p>Could it be true? Could Oliver Cromwell truly have designated his underachieving third son as his successor? And should this half-wit fail? They\u2019d all be hanged as traitors.</p><p>\u201cI shall mourn your father,\u201d Jamie told him carefully. Richard gave a mute nod and another flick over his shoulders, and Jamie thought his pale hair and weak features gave the impression of a diluted version of the elder Cromwell. \u201cOliver Cromwell was one of the last, great men. His death must have been a shock to your family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed. Thankfully it didn\u2019t happen before he had the opportunity to name me his successor.\u201d Dusting a leaf from his trousers, he scanned his eyes slowly over Jamie. \u201cMy father spoke of you. I was curious to meet you. The infamous eldest Rollo.\u201d</p><p>Jamie bristled. When would he be seen as his own person? He was always lumped with the Rollo men. Tiresome and self-righteous, the lot of them.</p><p>\u201cHow is it to have a crippled war hero for a brother?\u201d Richard asked suddenly. \u201cIt must\u2019ve stung when he bested you at the Tower.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was grateful his face was turned. Tread with care. He schooled his emotions, smoothing the loathing from his face. \u201cI would\u2019ve traveled to you, in London,\u201d he said, ignoring the jibe. \u201cUpon hearing the news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I find it illuminating to meet men in their own province,\u201d Richard said, taking in the woods around them. \u201cThere is no better way to take the measure of a man than unguarded and among his family. And your Perthshire has a peculiar . . . charm. Maggie Wall. Peculiar indeed,\u201d he added with distaste, studying the crudely painted grave marker. \u201cThough I would\u2019ve liked to see the actual inside of your home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo much danger has crossed my mother\u2019s doorstep already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dutiful son.\u201d Richard nodded. \u201cIf only we could see the same sense of duty applied to the Parliamentary cause.\u201d</p><p>Jamie was struck speechless, and Cromwell took advantage. \u201cI too am a dutiful son,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd carry on I must. It appears our Royalist enemies have found ways to communicate. Correspondence has been making its way to the King.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBeg pardon,\u201d Jamie said in mock innocence. Though he knew he should proceed with caution, this little meeting had him feeling decidedly testy. \u201cBut we no longer call Charles II king, correct?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpare me the academics.\u201d Richard\u2019s lip twitched in a petulant grimace. The man was silent for a moment, presumably deliberate, the intention for Jamie to feel his wrath. But Jamie found it had quite the opposite effect, almost comic.</p><p>Weak-chinned buffoon.</p> <p>All had heard of Oliver\u2019s attempts to discipline Richard, to train him, hammer a backbone into the man. But Oliver could lay in his deathbed and call his son a leader, and still it wouldn\u2019t make him one.</p><p>\u201cAs I was saying, the death of my father gives these Royalists fresh hope. The people have gotten the idea they need\u201d\u2014he scowled\u2014\u201crepresentation in the Parliament. More and more rally each day to restore the King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnglishmen do love their monarchs,\u201d Jamie muttered. I could always flee to France. Escape the wrath of a restored king, should this half-wit fail.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019d have the people love me.\u201d</p><p>Or I could find myself an exotic whore and wait this out in the Indies. Jamie could barely conceal his disdain. \u201cIt\u2019s not the people whose love you require. As I understand it, you\u2019re finding few friends among the military.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s where you come in, Rollo.\u201d Cromwell\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Jamie wondered where in hell this could be going. \u201cIf I were to bring down this secret Sealed Knot group, it would do much to earn confidence. Ormonde is a member, and it seems your own brother must be too. Both men were in our hands, and both you lost.\u201d</p><p>My damned brother. Always it comes back to damned Willie. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t my brother who was imprisoned. It was his woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeside the point. I don\u2019t understand why my father put up with you.\u201d Richard shook his head as if disappointed in a willful child. \u201cYou were asked to keep a handle on Ormonde. He escaped on your watch, and now he ferries back and forth, easy as you please, carrying letters to and from Charles as if he were a goddamned pigeon.\u201d</p><p>Jamie had to look away. He refused to suffer such scolding. Richard had been ineffectual when he was merely Cromwell\u2019s third son, and Jamie couldn\u2019t imagine he\u2019d be any more capable now.</p><p>He glimpsed Richard\u2019s lizard smile out of the corner of his eyes. The man thought he\u2019d scored a victory, and it made Jamie\u2019s blood boil.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s important to you?\u201d Richard pressed. \u201cBecause if it\u2019s advancement, I suggest you do what you can to squash these Royalists. Retrieve your brother, retrieve Ormonde, get a handle on these things which have spun out of your control.\u201d</p> <p>Out of my control?</p><p>Jamie wondered about true leaders and what special quality it was that sparked fear in the hearts of their men. For though Richard was giving him a talking-to, Jamie couldn\u2019t muster enough respect even to look the man directly in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYour father doubted neither my commitment nor my abilities,\u201d Jamie said coldly. No man, not even this fool, will doubt my abilities ever again. \u201cI will do these things for you. I will bring you my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you will.\u201d Richard flicked his hair. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, his head will suffice.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 27</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong.\u201d Felicity adjusted herself on the thick blanket they were using in lieu of a saddle. When the Roman road ended and they\u2019d emerged from the woods, Will left her to rest, and he returned having somehow procured a horse.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy to be off my feet.\u201d She wriggled those feet, stretching her sore calves. \u201cAnd,\u201d she added, nestling her rump back along his belly, \u201cI\u2019m totally loving this riding with you thing.\u201d And boy, was she. Being safely encased in the hard muscle of Will\u2019s arms and legs was pure, delicious heaven. \u201cBut it seems to me you can\u2019t just take someone\u2019s horse.\u201d</p><p>\u201c \u2019Twas borrowed from a Campbell. Believe me, love, the Campbells have coin enough for an entire herd of horses, straight from Arabia if they wished it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah . . .\u201d she said hesitantly. She didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever really get all the various clans and the seemingly irrational hatred some of them bore each other. \u201cBut it\u2019s still stealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen would that I could have stolen two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t that just be twice as bad?\u201d</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>\u201cWhat did that mean?\u201d She reached back and nudged him with her elbow.</p><p>\u201cIt means you have much to learn about the ways of the Highlands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying I\u2019ll be staying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I\u2019m not.\u201d He hugged his arms snugly around her belly in an effort to take the sting from his words.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll see. You\u2019ll decide to let me stay.\u201d She took one of his hands from her belly and brought it to her breast. \u201cHow\u2019s about we take a little break so I can try to convince you again?\u201d She wriggled her hips, grinding back in an attempt to rouse him.</p><p>\u201cOch, woman.\u201d Will nuzzled her from behind, trailing lingering kisses and nibbles along her neck. He gave her breast a gentle squeeze. \u201cWould that we had time. But there\u2019s no rest for us now.\u201d</p><p>Her neck was cool as he pulled from her to take in the wide-open glen around them. The riding was slow going now, headed uphill.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll be after us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot risk getting caught. I imagine we\u2019ll have riled my brother,\u201d Will added with a low chuckle.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told you. To Cameron country, to return you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill we be safe there?\u201d She still hadn\u2019t gotten over the shock of being kidnapped, or of witnessing men go at each other so savagely. Though she wanted to remain with Will, her strong preference would be to stay clear of men with swords.</p><p>And ministers too, now that she thought about it.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the point of this exercise, love. I\u2019d not have you anywhere that\u2019s not safe.\u201d</p><p>She leaned her head back, flush with the feeling of being loved, of being so cared for and protected, and in such a very literal way.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to know,\u201d she heard herself ask. \u201cHave you ever been in love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I also must know,\u201d he replied quickly, \u201chas anyone ever told you, you ask too many questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mark of an intelligent woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh indeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Come on, just tell me. You know I won\u2019t let you rest until you answer me.\u201d</p><p>If Felicity had thought about it beforehand, she probably would\u2019ve been too nervous to ask such a thing. But now that the question was out there, she had to know the answer. Reaching her hand back to tousle his head, she tried to lighten the moment by telling him in a seductive snarl, \u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d</p><p>He was silent. Completely silent and still at her back. Just when Felicity thought she\u2019d asked a question she maybe didn\u2019t want the answer to, Will spoke.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he told her quietly. \u201cYou are the first. And the last.\u201d</p><p>A part of her had known. And though something deep down had sensed how new, how novel, Will\u2019s feelings were to him, his words resonated through her. She let them hang, stabbing her, leaving her unexpectedly gutted, and sad.</p><p>It felt like such a tremendous loss. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to understand it. How could she have made such an extraordinary journey, come all this way to find love with this one man, only to have to say good-bye? She couldn\u2019t accept that it was happening, that she would be leaving him.</p><p>They rode to the top of the slow- rising hill. Will pulled their horse to a halt and loosened the reins, letting him lower his head to graze. The animal\u2019s coat was lightly damp from exertion, and it gave a twitch and shiver from the gentle breeze that swept the hilltop.</p><p>The Highlands rolled out before them. Uneven, tangled greens here, but rock there, gray and lifeless and ragged. Water like indigo glass stretched toward the horizon. There was the distant honking of geese, but an utter quiet also overwhelmed them, like the sound of stone and still water.</p><p>The view took her breath away. And it put a picture to all the emotions roiling in her. The not quite desolation, not quite loneliness that clutched at the edges of her heart.</p><p>She needed to hear his voice, and so with a nod to a far hill asked, \u201cIs that where we\u2019re going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, love.\u201d He gathered the reins, and the horse tossed his head in protest. Will felt Felicity\u2019s sudden melancholy like a winter rain. Though it was something he\u2019d known was on the horizon, still it chilled him, stole something from his heart. \u201cWe\u2019ve a long journey yet.\u201d</p><p>Will needed only to think about moving to push his horse into a walk. He\u2019d always felt at home on horseback. He was a cavalryman; he believed he\u2019d been born thus.</p><p>Then the accident had happened, and great beasts like this one had become for him the strong legs he lacked. Many horses, just like this one, saving him in battle.</p><p>He let his mind drift, thinking on all those moments in his life when he\u2019d cheated death. As a seven-year-old crushed by a pony. As a man lying broken and bleeding on the battlefield.</p><p>It had been Ormonde who\u2019d helped him that day, when he\u2019d been shot on the field at Philiphaugh. Ormonde had pulled him from a puddle of his own blood. Taken him to safety.</p><p>He\u2019d been fighting by James Graham\u2019s side. Will\u2019s mind touched on his beloved friend and comrade. Graham was out there somewhere, with his Magda and a cottage full of daughters.</p><p>And now Will found himself again owing Ormonde. Will was indebted to him and Ormonde\u2019s Sealed Knot men, and never did he turn his back on his friends. Never did Will forget an obligation.</p><p>Soon he would let Felicity go and would let his life be forfeit for the restoration of a king.</p><p>But first they needed to ride. Rough, hilly riding, until they reached Lochaber. He felt exposed on these open Highland passes and would feel this nagging danger at their backs until they found themselves safe on Cameron land. Until Felicity was safely returned home. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The thought sickened him. Will felt as though he was dying from the inside, and he\u2019d not be surprised if, in the moment of their farewell, he were to breathe his last.</p><p>Fighting his misery, he wrapped his arms more tightly around her. Pulled her as snugly to him as he could, savoring the fit of her back against his belly, her ass pressed against his groin.</p><p>He supposed he could\u2019ve found them a second horse, but he\u2019d wanted to feel her close like this. Having her astride before him felt such a wickedly improper thing, with her skirts hiked up to afford illicit glimpses of calf and knee. He savored the shift of her shoulders on his chest and the soft give of her breasts against his arms. He fantasized that he was her second skin.</p> <p>They headed downhill now, and Will leaned back to balance them. Pulled her back with him. They reached the bottom of the hill and he straightened, leaning forward into her, holding her even tighter, closer.</p><p>She made a small, pleased noise, and his hands gripped, pressed under her breasts.</p><p>\u201cWill . . .\u201d The breathlessness in her voice had him instantly rigid. \u201cYou know,\u201d she began, shifting against him, \u201cWill, this is giving me ideas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh aye.\u201d He was well acquainted with ideas. He\u2019d been having them since the moment they\u2019d first met. Waking dreams that plagued him, day after day. He felt like a damned schoolboy, stealing renegade glimpses of breast and hip. And now here she was, flesh and blood, pressed against him for the taking.</p><p>He cupped her breast, kneaded it, and felt a rush of blood in his head, the desire for her dizzying. The knowledge that he could just take her, have her, unmoored him.</p> <p>\u201cLower,\u201d she said, and he recognized that husky timbre in her voice. It was the sound of Felicity\u2019s want, and his already hard body quickened even more in response. \u201cLower, Will.\u201d</p><p>Could she really mean . . . ?</p><p>\u201cI know you said we can\u2019t stop.\u201d Felicity took his hand, nudged it down. \u201cBut we don\u2019t need to. Just touch me,\u201d she told him softly.</p><p>There was a moan, and Will realized it must\u2019ve been his own. He didn\u2019t require any more urging from her, and brought his hand down. Nestling it between her legs, he damned her thick skirts that once again stood between him and her sweet flesh.</p><p>He was fully erect now, and the rub and tangle of his plaid irritated him. Yet again he\u2019d be forced to ride his climax through the maddening chafe of wool.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, and he froze, stopping at once. He cursed himself for being a boor. Had she not wanted him to touch her so? Had he somehow misunderstood?</p> <p>She took the reins, clumsily pulled the horse to a stop.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014?\u201d he began.</p><p>But Felicity swung her leg over, settling herself sidesaddle, and the words froze in his throat. She twisted her body, anchoring herself on one of his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cWhat,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cwhat in God\u2019s name are you\u2014?\u201d</p><p>She muttered curses under her breath, struggling and hiking at her skirts. With a violent tug, Felicity flipped her gown up. With a naughty giggle, she was clambering around to face him atop the horse.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, woman, I . . .\u201d</p><p>She shoved his plaid up, and cool air hit him, a shock on his burning flesh. And then, God help him, she mounted him. Took him into her, and her wetness drew him deep, and God help him, it felt like where he belonged.</p><p>\u201cFelicity, love.\u201d Stroking up her back, his hands spanned the width of her, and he savored the feel of this strange, delicate creature in his arms. He caressed the silk of her hair, and kissed her cheeks and brow and lips. He couldn\u2019t see enough of her, couldn\u2019t taste enough of her. \u201cYou are too much.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrot,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrot, Will. Make the horse trot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, no,\u201d he managed. \u201cYou\u2019ll kill us both.\u201d</p><p>And he continued to kiss her instead, and though his body raged, he set aside a small sliver of his mind, concentrating on keeping her balanced over him, on keeping the horse calm below.</p><p>She laughed a husky little laugh he recognized, and Will knew he was in trouble. And then, as he suspected she might, Felicity kicked the horse herself. Her legs, these soft, smooth, pale legs of a woman, began kicking away, slamming her heels at the horse\u2019s belly.</p><p>Will was their only connection to the horse now, and he held Felicity firmly, bearing her weight, his arms bracing her to him. His legs holding his seat steady.</p><p>Their horse was a docile creature, and he stepped into a reluctant walk. Still, Felicity\u2019s heels slammed away, and Will grew even harder despite himself, the feel of her tight body writhing over him more than he could bear. She slammed her heels and the horse broke into a sluggish trot.</p><p>Will groaned, fighting to keep ahold of himself. His fingers gripped her soft flesh, and a distant part of himself worried he clung too hard. But she gasped her pleasure, tangling her fingers hard in his hair.</p><p>He was losing control. Needed to keep control. This was implausible, unimaginable.</p><p>\u201cWe must . . .\u201d he began, and then realized he\u2019d forgotten what he was going to say. It was as if a madness was overtaking him. He was deep in her, so deep.</p><p>She grew still, and he watched. Fascinated, reverent, he watched as her face grew flushed. Her eyelids flickered shut and her breathing hitched, halted. And then she shouted her climax.</p><p>\u201cWill!\u201d she cried, and it echoed through the valley. Somewhere in the back of his mind he knew they needed to be careful.</p><p>\u201cWe must,\u201d he began again, but was unable to speak, so instead put his fingers over her mouth to quiet her. He slowed the horse to a walk, and began to move in and out of her, in time to the gait of the horse.</p><p>Felicity bit his fingertip. She opened her eyes, catching and holding his gaze as she sucked his finger in and out of her mouth. Her tongue was rough, her cheek smooth, and Will fought his own climax as memories of his cock in her mouth jerked his body.</p><p>She was going to be the death of him. This gorgeous, shocking, unexpected gift would be the death of him, and he\u2019d go a happy man.</p><p>Felicity sagged in his arms, her hips rocking in an exaggerated sway. Inhaling sharply, she ground against him, and he could tell she was winding up once more. He felt a rush of her wetness. Her body stilled, and he knew she was close.</p><p>He pulled his finger from her lips. He could wait no longer. Clamping his mouth over hers, he took her breath with a kiss as he shot himself into her, riding Felicity as she came in waves over him.</p><p>Chapter 28</p><p>They\u2019d arrived at the Cameron clan\u2019s Tor Castle. Laird Ewen Cameron was huge, with black hair and blue eyes and the chiseled look of a romance novel cover model. But it was the ginormous sword poking up from between his shoulders that currently held her attention.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to try and use that on Will, is he?\u201d Felicity\u2019s eyes shifted from the laird, to his wife, and back again.</p><p>\u201cMy husband likes to carry a big stick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d Felicity eyed Lily Cameron, noting the toddler\u2019s pudgy hand held in hers, the baby on her hip, and poor thing, the belly ready to burst with her third. \u201cI\u2019ll say he does,\u201d she blurted without thinking.</p><p>But instead of laughing, Lily narrowed her eyes thoughtfully. Even after Felicity turned away, she sensed the woman assessing her, could see her poufy white- blonde hair out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d Will gave a good-natured growl, \u201cI\u2019ve known Ewen since he was a stripling. If he tries to move on me, he knows I\u2019ll give him a sound thrashing.\u201d</p><p>Ewen\u2019s deep voice exploded into laughter. \u201cHave a care, Rollo, or I\u2019ll use your wee staff to skewer you and eat you for supper. Now come. We\u2019ve much to discuss. Lily can show your woman around.\u201d</p><p>His woman? A Neanderthal and his baby- machine wife. Great. Where the hell had Will taken her?</p><p>She gave Rollo her best please-don\u2019t-abandon me look, but he just smiled in return, traipsing off with Ewen, and leaving her with the blonde and the two kids.</p><p>Felicity realized Lily was still watching her, light dancing in her eyes. What\u2019s her deal?</p><p>The laird\u2019s wife giggled and said, \u201cMy husband can be an acquired taste.\u201d</p><p>Felicity could only stare dumbly. American accent? Recovering, she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re not from around here, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lily smiled at her. \u201cAnd I could tell from the get-go that you\u2019re definitely not either.\u201d She hiked the baby higher up on her hip. The kid seemed huge already. If the size of the laird was any indication, the woman was going to need some serious chiropractics when all this baby making was done. \u201cNow come on,\u201d Lily said. \u201cI\u2019ll have one of the maids show you your room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUhh . . .\u201d Oh goody, she thought. More household staff for her to be nervous around. More impenetrable accents and strange looks.</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Lily gave her a quick nod. \u201cGot it. Let me just drop the rug rats with Kat, and I\u2019ll show you around myself.\u201d</p><p>It was when Lily took extra time to carefully explain the finer points of castle plumbing that Felicity finally began to relax. Who\u2019d have thought a castle would have such a cool little stone toilet? Once you got used to the freezing air blowing on your bum, that is.</p><p>By the time Lily dug up an old gown for her to borrow, the two of them were chatting as if they were old friends. \u201cSeriously,\u201d Lily said, pushing the gown into Felicity\u2019s hands. She rubbed her belly, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be fitting into any real clothes anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, seriously,\u201d Felicity mimicked the other woman\u2019s word with a smile, \u201cI don\u2019t see how I\u2019m going to fit into this either.\u201d Smoothing the dress out on the bed, Felicity tucked at the bosom, creating imaginary darts. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t noticed, you\u2019ve got a lot more going on upstairs than I do.\u201d</p><p>Lily giggled, then asked, \u201cEast Coast or West?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Felicity spun, staring at the woman. Will had alluded to other women traveling back in time. Could this be one of them? \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill didn\u2019t know about me, did he? No, he wouldn\u2019t have,\u201d Lily mused, answering her own question. \u201cI think it\u2019s been years since he and Ewen have seen each other. Well, if Will didn\u2019t already know where I\u2019m from, my husband\u2019s probably telling him right now. Over a whisky, if I know my Ewen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Felicity said tentatively, sitting down on the bed. She\u2019d felt an instant connection with this woman, almost like she recognized Lily. But actually meeting another woman from her place, her time, would be too much to ask. \u201cAre you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lily smiled. Supporting the small of her back, she eased herself onto the bed next to Felicity. \u201cI\u2019m getting way ahead of myself. Where exactly are you from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI . . .\u201d Felicity faltered, unsure of how to respond. \u201cI\u2019m from Glasgow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re from Glasgow, then my name\u2019s Britney Spears.\u201d</p><p>An incredulous laugh burst from Felicity. She never would\u2019ve guessed it\u2019d ever feel so fantastic to hear the name Britney Spears.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think I could pass?\u201d Lily picked up a swath of her hair, studying it. \u201cI guess my hair is a little too curly. And I\u2019d never be able to do the\u2014what is it\u2014a Louisiana accent? I\u2019m a Cali girl after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, California!\u201d Felicity exclaimed, her eyes wide. \u201cReally? Me too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYep,\u201d Lily said, her voice growing wistful. \u201cSan Fran, baby. Late nineties. And what I wouldn\u2019t do for an avocado right about now. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this is happening. I live . . . I lived there too. In the Mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy . . .\u201d Lily shook her head, marveling. \u201cI always wondered when we\u2019d meet someone else. There was another, Robert, Ewen\u2019s foster brother.\u201d Lily\u2019s smile faded, and her voice grew subdued. \u201cHe died. Though lately we\u2019ve been talking about the whole time travel thing. It seems like there must be some way to . . . Well, that\u2019s a whole other story.\u201d Lily brightened her features. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me, when are you from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little later than you. But not by much.\u201d Felicity\u2019s initial surprise was waning, replaced by an absurd pang of jealousy. She wanted to be the only one whose love was so great and so perfect the universe sent her back in time for it. \u201cDid you make a wish to get here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWish?\u201d Lily tilted her head, confused. \u201cNo way. I . . . sort of . . . fell here. Through the labyrinth. Wait, did you come through the maze too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaze?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLong story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d A maze. Felicity hadn\u2019t needed a gimmick. She\u2019d made a wish, and the universe had delivered Felicity directly to her One True Love. The thought perked her back up. \u201cYou could say I wished for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wished to come here?\u201d Lily laughed. \u201cThen I guess you weren\u2019t as freaked out as I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really, actually. Tell me,\u201d Felicity said, pinning the laird\u2019s wife with a serious look. \u201cWhat did you do to get Ewen to let you stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you convince him? To let you stay in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe reached a point where . . .\u201d Lily blushed crimson. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d have let me leave if I tried.\u201d She gave a little grinning shrug that was like a dagger in Felicity\u2019s chest.</p><p>Ewen loved Lily. Wouldn\u2019t let her go.</p> <p>Sadness and desolation swamped her. Why wouldn\u2019t Will want her to stay too?</p><p>\u201cBut . . .\u201d Felicity hesitated. \u201cIt seems so dangerous here. Aren\u2019t you scared? Like, aren\u2019t you afraid to be pregnant in the past?\u201d</p><p>She could tell she hit a nerve somewhere. She saw the flicker of it in Lily\u2019s eye, and it made her feel a little guilty. But all the laird\u2019s wife said was, \u201cWhen you love someone, I guess it conquers all fear.\u201d</p><p>Lily studied Felicity, as if seeing her anew. \u201cWhy?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you scared to be here?\u201d</p><p>Felicity was grateful they were interrupted by a knock on the door and a teenage boy bursting into the room. A handsome kid with the devil in his eye. The spitting image of Ewen.</p><p>\u201cDa\u2019s looking for you.\u201d Though he was speaking to Lily, the boy\u2019s gaze didn\u2019t budge from Felicity.</p><p>\u201cIs he now? It\u2019s not simply that you wanted to meet our new guest?\u201d Lily winked at him. He screwed up his face, looking as though he were trying to summon lasers from his eyes with which to melt her. She grew very formal, and said, \u201cFelicity, this is our son John.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPleased, mum.\u201d He gave a curt bow, then turned back to Lily. \u201cBut Da is looking for you,\u201d he said, before racing from the room, cheeks blazing red.</p><p>Lily giggled. \u201cWe don\u2019t get much new blood around here. You\u2019ve stirred up quite a lot of buzz. Though I\u2019m sure Will tells you all the time how pretty you are.\u201d</p><p>Felicity promptly ran through her memories, cataloguing what Will had told her when, and decided she might just have to cast bait for a pretty compliment. She could use one of those at the moment.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of pretty,\u201d Felicity said, \u201cyou look way too young to have a son John\u2019s age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not his biological mom. Ewen was a widower when I met him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Odd. Did that mean Ewen really was Lily\u2019s One True Love, or really wasn\u2019t? \u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell me the whole story while we go find the guys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe guys,\u201d Lily muttered, taking her arm. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice having someone to talk to like this.\u201d</p><p>Felicity felt another stab of guilt over her competitive thoughts. Lily was a total sweetheart, and Ewen was clearly hot in a brooding sort of way.</p><p>But no man was as great as her Will. They were meant for each other. In her mind, no other relationship could compete with theirs.</p><p>Felicity frowned. She had only a matter of time now in which to convince him of that fact.</p><p>Chapter 29</p><p>Felicity walked down the empty corridor, headed back to her room. Lily had promised to arrange her a bath, and she was desperately looking forward to the prospect.</p><p>The other rooms were empty and the doors were all open, but for one, pulled to, and she heard the low rumble of Ewen\u2019s voice from behind it. His tone was easy and relaxed, interspersed with a decidedly more feminine voice. The laird and his wife, talking in the library.</p><p>She was about to pass right by, when mention of her name stopped Felicity in her tracks.</p><p>\u201cFelicity, yes,\u201d Lily said in answer to an indistinct question. With a quick glance up and down the hallway, Felicity edged along the wall to listen. \u201cI got the impression Rollo doesn\u2019t want her to stay,\u201d the laird\u2019s wife added.</p><p>\u201cDid the woman say as much?\u201d The voice was clearly Ewen\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Lily\u2019s voice was subdued, and Felicity leaned her ear closer to the cracked door. \u201cBut a woman can tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh can she?\u201d Ewen chuckled. \u201cWell, as it happens, I ken Rollo\u2019s mind, and you speak truly.\u201d</p><p>Felicity\u2019s mouth went dry. The men had discussed her?</p><p>\u201cYou mean he\u2019s making her leave?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye?\u201d Lily asked incredulously. \u201cCome on, Ewen. You know I need more details than aye. Didn\u2019t you see how googly-eyed Will is for her? He\u2019s obviously totally in love with her.\u201d</p><p>Felicity gave a little nod. Yeah, she thought. Totally in love.</p><p>She heard another low chuckle. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the man\u2019s eyes, but aye, you have the right of it. Will is clearly besotted. But it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><p>A chill swept Felicity, turning her blood to ice.</p><p>\u201cHow can being in love not matter?\u201d Lily sounded crestfallen.</p><p>\u201cRollo speaks of a debt he owes, and nothing comes between Will and his duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA debt . . . like he owes money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, lass, no. He\u2019s . . .\u201d Ewen paused, considering his words. \u201cThe man is a staunch Royalist. Simply because the battles have subsided does not mean the Royalists aren\u2019t fighting on, behind the scenes. Rollo owes his fellows a debt, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned about the man, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t go back on his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . that\u2019s horrible. You have to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. And I plan on helping him.\u201d</p><p>Anger tightened Felicity\u2019s chest. The fates conspired against her, and now this man too? What had she ever done to Ewen?</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Lily\u2019s voice was a low hiss.</p><p>\u201cAye. I\u2019ll show him the maze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . but that\u2019s for Robert. We\u2019re building it to try and save Robbie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not for the woman too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwen, have a heart,\u201d she said in a lowered voice. Felicity heard rustling. It seemed Lily was about to bust out the feminine wiles on her husband. \u201cCome on, honey, why can\u2019t she just stay with us? She\u2019ll be safe here.\u201d</p><p>Go, Lily! Her new best friend.</p><p>\u201cIt has naught to do with my heart, lass. Rollo\u2019s brother is out for blood, and by now most of Perthshire will think her a witch. Soon, Rollo himself will be called to help men who rally in secret for the King. He finds himself in a dangerous business . . .\u201d Ewen let the words\u2014and their obvious implication\u2014hang.</p><p>Dread stole the breath from her lungs. She had to leave to save her own life. Will\u2019s honor made him stay, even though he\u2019d likely be killed. The laird was saying as much.</p><p>\u201cIf she were to stay and something came to pass,\u201d he went on, \u201cFelicity would be left alone. And all the stone in Tor Castle wouldn\u2019t be able to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut,\u201d Lily protested, \u201cyou know how life is here. Once they part, they\u2019ll probably never see each other again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Mayhap.\u201d There was another rustling, then Ewen\u2019s voice again, soft and low. \u201cOch, Lil\u2019. Such emotion on your bonny face. I\u2019ll never understand the quick tears of a woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Lily\u2019s voice was a barely audible murmur now. \u201cIt\u2019s the damned hormones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI ken what\u2019ll smooth the sadness from your brow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean . . .\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh aye. I can mean. And I do. I\u2019ve told you before,\u201d he said. \u201cA laird\u2019s wife has duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Ewen, I\u2019m about to burst.\u201d Lily\u2019s giggle was an arrow straight to Felicity\u2019s heart.</p><p>Felicity began to back away. Though she didn\u2019t know Ewen, it didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to hear the masculine intent in his voice. She spun, taking the cold slate stones at a jog.</p><p>Ewen\u2019s voice resounded at her back. \u201cAye,\u201d he was telling his wife. \u201cThey say \u2019twill make the babe come faster.\u201d</p><p>But those weren\u2019t the words Felicity heard. It was Ewen\u2019s pronouncement about Will, about his dedication to duty, which echoed in her mind.</p> <p>Because Felicity had also learned well. William Rollo would never go back on his word. Will would stay where he was, forsaking all else, forfeiting his life to keep a promise to a friend.</p><p>Felicity slipped below the surface of the bathwater, letting the hollow nothingness of underwater fill her ears. But not even the sound of oblivion could erase the chatter in her head. She exhaled slowly, and tiny bubbles blipped to the surface.</p><p>The room was dark, candles and firelight chasing away only the most meager of shadows. She kept her eyes shut in the blackness, focusing her other senses outward. The water was soft on her mouth and soothing on eyes that still ached from recent tears.</p><p>Her hands traced along her bent knees, to her belly. She felt full there, and contemplated the firm swell between the jut of her hipbones.</p><p>Drifting up her chest, she let her fingers pause idly on her breasts, the flesh cool and lightly pebbled where they emerged from the water.</p><p>Felicity reached to her hair, floating in the tub like fronds of algae, silken and weightless. Her scalp was tight, aggressively cleaned from a brick of soap that had smelled faintly of pine.</p> <p>Pushing her feet against the foot of the metal tub, she slid back up. Inhaled deeply. Her room smelled of lavender and mustiness, and her lungs clenched briefly in protest.</p><p>The maids had startled her when they\u2019d knocked on her door, bearing the huge copper basin and buckets of hot water. She didn\u2019t know why she should be surprised. Lily seemed on top of everything, and Felicity didn\u2019t see why her bath would be the thing to fall by the wayside.</p><p>She was grateful for the tub, but though it soothed her body, it wasn\u2019t doing much to lift her melancholy spirits.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been able to wrap her mind around it, but hearing someone else speak the words had brought the truth home. Will had work to do. Dangerous work involving kings and intrigues.</p><p>There was no place for her.</p><p>Not because Will didn\u2019t want her, but because Will might not return alive.</p><p>She refused to think on it. Tried instead to be a purely sensory being, all thought pushed from her mind.</p><p>Slowly, she traced back down her chest, back over her abdomen, and tucked a finger between her legs.</p> <p>The tender flesh there, though wet, wasn\u2019t slick, and water rocked over her breastbone as she adjusted, canting her knees, gingerly nestling within the delicate folds of skin.</p><p>She touched and explored, lazily waiting for nerves to awaken, wanting to feel some inner fire crackling to life. Patiently, she touched and waited, but her body wouldn\u2019t rouse.</p><p>Already she belonged to Will, her whole body his and his alone. And she thought the loneliness of it would drown her more surely that any water could.</p><p>\u201cMay I help you with that?\u201d</p><p>She gasped in surprise, sending water sloshing onto the floor with a dull slap. It was Rollo, she sensed him now behind her. Saw his shadow flickering low along the wall.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d you get in?\u201d</p><p>His laugh was low. \u201cI\u2019m a man driven.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t turn to face him. Somehow she felt too nervous, and so Felicity stared forward, listening to him walk slowly to her.</p><p>The familiar click and shuffle of his gait kindled something deep within her that none of her own touches had been able to stir. \u201cDeprivation makes a man clever.\u201d</p><p>A little thrill rippled through her. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling deprived?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will pulled a stool close to the tub. His movements were unhurried, deliberate. \u201cAnd a man with needs knows no obstacles.\u201d He sat facing her. Laid his cane at his feet. His eyes roved shamelessly over her naked body. \u201cAnd I need you, Felicity.\u201d</p><p>Her skin shivered tight at the sound of desire, husky in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWash yourself,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>A wicked look creased the corners of his eyes. \u201cI want to see you wash yourself.\u201d</p><p>The smile she gave him was low-key. She was sad, but she\u2019d never turn Will away. \u201cYou think I\u2019m dirty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, woman, not dirty enough.\u201d Raising his brows, he gestured to the soap. \u201cBut for now, I\u2019d watch you in your bath.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed and turned the soap between her palms. The scent of pine drifted to her, fresh and vaguely citric. Her melancholy muted into something more poignant, more languorous.</p><p>His stare was steady on her, brow furrowed with intensity. Felicity let the soap slip from her fingers and began to lather up each arm, holding Will\u2019s gaze all the while.</p><p>She rubbed lazy circles along her collarbones, between her breasts, over her abdomen, and back up again. The suds were thick in her palms now, and her hands glided easily over her skin.</p><p>Will tensed, a barely perceptible movement recognizable only by a lover. She knew she was driving him mad, and her own desire speared her through. An aching swamped her, at her chest, between her legs. He was sending her back. The knowledge charged the moment.</p><p>Her eyes flicked to his kilt. She saw he was aroused and it gratified her.</p><p>Slowly, she brought her hands to her breasts. Cupping them, she circled her thumbs over her nipples. They were beaded tight. Her whole body, tight. Poised and open for him.</p><p>Her lips parted. Watching him watch her stoked Felicity\u2019s desire. Will\u2019s eyes were hooded, his expression veiled in the shadows. He was so tall and handsome, like a fallen angel come to take her, to bear her off to some dark paradise.</p><p>Her heart beat shallowly, the heat of her want, the heat of the water, making her light- headed. She felt suddenly desperate for him to hold her, to anchor her. But he just watched, still as granite, his eyes smoldering and dark in the candlelight.</p><p>She slipped her hands from her breasts. Skimmed her palms along her belly to her legs. Spreading her bent knees, she stroked her hands down the inside of her thighs. An inadvertent moan escaped her, so hungry was she for the touch of his skin on hers.</p><p>Will moved then. Sudden like a panther, he leapt for her. His mouth claimed hers. He tasted of whisky, and the ghost of a beard was rough on her chin. His hands were hot on her shoulders, her body chilled where the damp skin had been exposed to air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so bloody gorgeous,\u201d he rasped between kisses. \u201cIt\u2019s unbearable.\u201d His mouth moved to her neck, nibbled and kissed. \u201cI can\u2019t bear it.\u201d His kisses trailed higher, and he whispered in her ear. \u201cMy body can\u2019t bear to watch you. I have to touch you. So lovely, Felicity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo . . .\u201d she began tentatively, lifting her chin to urge his kisses lower. Will\u2019s words awed and pleased her, and she recalled her conversation with Lily. \u201cSo, you really think I\u2019m pretty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he growled, pulling his face from hers. Bathwater rocked and spilled from the tub. \u201cYou speak of pretty?\u201d His shirt had gotten soaked, and water dripped steadily from his arms back into the tub.</p><p>Cupping her cheeks in his hands, he said fiercely, \u201cAye, you\u2019re pretty, and more than pretty. You\u2019re exquisite. The fairest creature ever who lived. Pretty indeed, my Felicity,\u201d he said, raining light kisses along her face. \u201cMy bonny, sweet love.\u201d</p><p>He released her. Reached for the large linen square that was her towel.</p><p>\u201cCome then,\u201d he said. Will pulled her easily from the bath and situated her on his lap, tenderly drying and wrapping her in the towel as they sat on the stool.</p><p>How many more moments like this would they share? She couldn\u2019t bear it, couldn\u2019t bear the sadness. She placed her hands over his where they tenderly cupped her cheeks. \u201cI love you, you know. The fates sent me here, to you. I know you don\u2019t believe that. But I\u2019m here now, and I love you. And in the end, that\u2019s all that matters. Being together is what\u2019s right. We\u2019re right. Back in my own time, I was so lost. But you\u2019ve shown me so much. Like . . . like being with the horses. I\u2019m actually good at that. For the first time, I\u2019m good at something that also gives me such joy. My life is so much richer here. So much richer with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, love. As mine is, with you.\u201d His voice was hoarse with pain, with want. \u201cWould that we\u2019d both been born in some other time, some other place. Sometimes I think I\u2019ll not survive your leaving. That the moment we part will be the moment I breathe my last.\u201d</p><p>She shivered.</p><p>\u201cOch, love, you\u2019re cold.\u201d He kissed her gently on each cheek, on her mouth, and then swept his hands along the thin towel to dry her.</p><p>She sensed an infinitesimal change in his breathing. Gradually his movements slowed, became more focused. A hand that had patted her dry, chafed now, rubbing teasing circles over the points of her breasts under the coarse fabric.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019m dry,\u201d she whispered weakly, standing and letting the towel fall to the ground. \u201cAnd this is way too scratchy,\u201d she added, tugging at the thick layers of wool he wore. Unknotting the thong at his shoulder, she pulled his plaid from him. Peeled off his wet shirt.</p><p>\u201cCome back.\u201d His words sounded pained, giving voice to something more far-reaching than what they were sharing in that moment. He pulled her down to straddle his legs. Will didn\u2019t enter her, and she felt the heavy weight of him brush against her leg. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t go to the King,\u201d she whispered, stroking her palm over his broad, smooth chest. \u201cStay with me. We can run away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I would.\u201d He shut his eyes, breathing in deep. \u201cBut you know I cannot.\u201d</p><p>They were together now. He was by her side, right then, and she\u2019d regret wasting a minute of their remaining time together.</p><p>Felicity hitched her hips closer, seeking him out. \u201cBe with me, Will. I want you.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed slowly along her neck, traced his finger and his tongue along her collarbone as if he\u2019d memorize her.</p><p>\u201cI want you, Felicity. I\u2019ve always wanted you.\u201d He kissed his way down her throat, took a breast in his mouth, sucked and teased with teeth and tongue. She felt empty and needful, wanting only for him to fill her.</p><p>Tracing his hands along her thighs, Will brought his fingers to her, stroking where water still dampened the hair between her legs.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI need you. Now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d he said between gritted teeth. He lifted Felicity onto him and glided into her. \u201cNow.\u201d</p> <p>She planted her feet on the ground and began to move, tilting and rocking, bringing him in and out. But Will stopped her. Gripping her hips, he drove himself into her and held Felicity tight to him.</p><p>Holding her hips immobile, Will ground her pelvis against his. A pleasure so acute swamped her, she dropped her head to his shoulder, letting him rub and grind her against his body.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. Felicity trembled, barely holding on. He kept her there, in a place just beyond fulfillment, shifting inside, yet not moving from her.</p><p>Will raked a hand through her hair and cupped her head, tilting it to face him. He brought his mouth to hers for a fierce kiss.</p><p>And then neither could hold on, and he kept her clutched hard and close through their climax.</p><p>Felicity, rooted to her Will.</p> <p>Chapter 30</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re certain this woman is trustworthy?\u201d Will asked, leaning on his cane as if it were a stake he\u2019d planted defiantly in the ground. They stood outside the low cave, and Felicity was finding the stare-off between him and Ewen fascinating.</p><p>Will\u2019s face was furrowed, and it made her love him all the more. She knew it was partly wariness she saw mapped there. But physical pain was there too. She recognized it, bracketing his mouth. They\u2019d had to tie off their ponies, and the tightly winding path they\u2019d taken the rest of the way couldn\u2019t have been easy for him.</p><p>\u201cOch, Rollo.\u201d Ewen raked a hand through his hair. \u201cTrust me when I tell you, the witch Gormshuil is the only way. Though, as long as I live, I\u2019ll find the whole business difficult to fathom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and me both,\u201d Felicity chimed in. That other women had traveled back in time? So strange\u2014and kind of annoying. She\u2019d wanted to think she was special.</p><p>Her eyes went to Will. He was watching her, an unreadable look on his face. Her Viking. She\u2019d wished for her one and only love, and she\u2019d been sent straight to this man.</p><p>No, she decided. She was special. What they shared was special. It was a relationship decreed by the fates.</p><p>She thought of those other women and frowned. They all got to stay in the past, regardless of the dangers. Why not her?</p> <p>\u201cHow can we be certain Felicity will be safe?\u201d Will asked, not taking his eyes from her.</p><p>\u201cIt seems like you\u2019re unsure,\u201d she said, realizing her opportunity. \u201cSo we\u2019d best just head back. Who knows who this witch might be?\u201d she mused dramatically. \u201cBetter to be safe than sorry. And,\u201d she added, turning her attention to Ewen, \u201cwe should probably go soon. Lily is looking pretty far along. You must hate to leave her when the baby could come, like, any minute now.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cNice try, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Ewen added. \u201cAnd to answer your question, I know who this woman might be. Gormshuil is trustworthy, and she will help.\u201d</p><p>The Cameron laird led them into the cave. It took a minute for Felicity\u2019s eyes to adjust to the darkness and to the cloud of pipe smoke that drifted languidly through the air like incense.</p><p>\u201cCome, come,\u201d someone called from the shadows. The voice cracked, the timbre that of an old woman, yet something stronger ran through the sound, something tensile, as if girded by fiber or tendon.</p><p>Felicity stepped closer and the woman came into view. Gormshuil was smaller than the sound of her voice. She was wizened, with paper-thin skin and a watery gaze, and yet Felicity saw at once the ghost of the young woman she\u2019d been. Petite, with wide, round eyes. She somehow knew at once that a man had loved this woman.</p><p>Gormshuil cackled. \u201cI see you too, girl.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran up her spine.</p><p>Felicity felt her legs moving, drawn to her. She walked to Gormshuil, sat by her side. Patting Felicity\u2019s leg, the witch tittered again, and for a moment she sounded almost youthful.</p><p>Some deep-rooted tension unclenched, and Felicity sighed. The woman\u2019s touch made her feel tingly and at ease. She inhaled deeply, and the sensation spread. She wondered distantly just what it might be the woman was smoking.</p><p>\u201cYou know,\u201d Felicity blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m kind of like a witch too.\u201d She felt warm, and a little buzzed.</p><p>\u201cAre you now?\u201d she heard someone ask. It was Ewen, chuckling.</p><p>\u201cYou have such a deep voice,\u201d Felicity marveled, turning to the laird.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no witch.\u201d There was steel in Will\u2019s tone, and it stung her. She\u2019d only ever heard him use that voice with other people. \u201cDo not share such thoughts again,\u201d he commanded. \u201cEver, with anyone.\u201d</p><p>His words were like a gust of cold air in her muzzy brain. \u201cDon\u2019t get testy,\u201d she said. She felt more alert, wakened from her haze.</p><p>\u201cYou make a mistake,\u201d the witch warned.</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Felicity scowled in Will\u2019s direction. \u201cTell him, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll regret leaving your man. And,\u201d Gormshuil said with a nod to Will, \u201cyou\u2019ll regret letting her go. Mark me. \u2019Tis a grave error you make.\u201d Her eyes flashed to Felicity\u2019s belly. \u201cEspecially with the child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew it!\u201d Felicity exclaimed. She\u2019d noticed her belly had grown thicker. Pregnant, she thought, beaming. A baby. Of course. They had been doing it like a couple of bunnies, after all.</p><p>\u201cNow I can\u2019t leave,\u201d she told him triumphantly.</p><p>\u201cNow more than ever you must,\u201d he replied quietly.</p><p>\u201cThis is\u201d\u2014Ewen hesitated\u2014\u201cbetter discussed later, I think.\u201d He turned to Gormshuil. \u201cWill requires not your judgment, but your instruction. You helped me once, saw fit to let me make my own decision. I ask that you do no less for my friend.\u201d</p><p>Gormshuil sucked on her pipe. The stem clacked dully between her teeth, sending up a fresh plume of gray smoke. \u201cSo it shall be,\u201d the old woman said in a voice suddenly thin with age. \u201cI shall help your friend.\u201d</p><p>She tugged a small pouch from her belt. A leather thong tied it shut, and Gormshuil bit the strip between her teeth, pulling it open. A small mound of dried, crumbled leaves spilled into her palm.</p><p>A low droning began to reverberate off the cave walls. Felicity realized it was Gormshuil. She\u2019d begun to chant. Foreign words, sounding strange and thick, as if from the back of her tongue.</p><p>Felicity looked to Will. His eyes cut to her, as if he\u2019d felt her gaze on him. She wanted a smile, a nod, but he simply sat stiff and erect, the look on his face unreadable.</p><p>There was a rapid movement on the edge of her vision. The witch had thrown something on the fire. The flames bloomed, swelling to life like a cresting wave, crackling angrily and spewing gray smoke through the cavern.</p><p>She felt ill from the stench of it. Pregnant, she thought. She was pregnant and nauseous. She swallowed hard.</p><p>Her mind grew muddled. She tried to focus on the woman\u2019s ceremony, but her mind spun away, thoughts slipping like sand through her fingers.</p><p>She clung to the sight of Will. They were having a baby. He was going to be a father. He couldn\u2019t let her go now. The thought transfixed her, a lone spotlight as her conscious mind meandered through the fog, Gormshuil\u2019s chanting drifting over her like so much pipe smoke.</p><p>The witch clapped her hands. Felicity\u2019s eyes snapped to her, finding Gormshuil staring. Smoke hung in the air, reddening the woman\u2019s pale eyes, making them seem rheumy and ancient. \u201cI see the way, girl.\u201d</p><p>The witch turned her attention to Will. Her voice was stern as she intoned, \u201cHeed me, William Rollo. If this woman leaves, she will never return. She shall be lost to this time forever. Cho fad\u2019s a bhios muir a\u2019bualadh ri lic. As long as sea beats on stone. Lost, to us, forever.\u201d</p><p>Tears stung Felicity\u2019s eyes, anguish and fear stealing the breath from her lungs. She looked at Will. Surely he\u2019d fight this. He\u2019d change his mind. She peered at him through the smoke, but all she saw was the face of a war hero. Grim and still as he\u2019d ever been.</p><p>The woman\u2019s voice keened from the shadows. \u201cS\u00ecth do d\u2019annam, is Clach air do Ch\u00e0rn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA proverb, lass. For you.\u201d It was the Cameron chief, his voice low and kind. \u201cThe witch bids peace to thy soul, and a stone to thy cairn.\u201d</p><p>They journeyed back to Tor Castle in tense silence, Ewen having made it clear he\u2019d tolerate no lovers\u2019 quarrels in his presence.</p><p>The thought that he might be embroiled in something so banal as a lovers\u2019 quarrel thrilled and gutted Will in equal measure.</p><p>The enforced silence was just as well. He needed to think. That Felicity carried his child rocked him.</p><p>It was a miracle. How strange and wondrous to think on what they\u2019d created. Would the child have hair dark like his, and her brightly chattering ways? Would he or she be good with horses; be tall like him, or petite like her?</p><p>He fought the impulse to see it as a sign that she\u2019d been right all along, that they were destined to be together. Was sending Felicity back still the right course? That his seed had quickened so soon in her belly sowed doubt in his mind. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He knew now they were meant to be together. It was the staying together that seemed impossible. Danger was all around. From Roundheads and witch-hunters. From his own family, God spare him.</p><p>He owed the Sealed Knot men a favor. It would surely be a dangerous errand, a fool\u2019s errand, him likely paying his debt to them with his life. If something happened to him, how would Felicity manage alone, with a child?</p><p>And yet.</p> <p>A baby. His baby. He\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d have a family of his own. He thought of his father, of all they\u2019d shared. Of how great an impact he\u2019d had on Will\u2019s life. How much the man had formed him, taught him.</p><p>If he said good-bye to Felicity, he\u2019d never know the other side of that relationship, would never be a parent to a child. He\u2019d never teach his son or daughter to ride, never share that great gift his father had given him.</p><p>How could he survive with his child out there, somewhere, growing up without him? He couldn\u2019t bear not being with Felicity, not seeing her become a mother.</p><p>Not seeing her become his wife.</p><p>For that\u2019s what a child meant. Will was already her husband in his heart. A child was simply proof of that love.</p> <p>He watched her, riding on the road back to Tor Castle. Watched as she stroked her belly, regularly reaching down to rub circles where their baby grew, some new inner radiance brightening her already too lovely face.</p><p>She thought this news would mean she\u2019d be able to stay. And though his heart protested, he knew that, now more than ever, she needed to leave.</p><p>His brother had made it his lifelong goal to destroy anything Will had ever loved. If a young Jamie would maim a boy and his pony, what would he do to Will\u2019s child now that he\u2019d grown into a man desperate and bent on revenge?</p><p>Will\u2019s own father hadn\u2019t been able to protect him, and from his very own son. How could Will be assured that he\u2019d be able to protect his own child?</p><p>Will had no choice. He\u2019d have Felicity and their baby safe.</p><p>And he knew now it would kill him to do so.</p> <p>That he\u2019d never lay eyes on his child was a crushing loss. It would be the single greatest tragedy of his life. Second only to saying good-bye to Felicity.</p><p>The ride was a blur, silent and anguished. Seeing Felicity\u2019s newfound joy, his pain redoubled. His love for her would grow on, in this child she carried. And sending them away would destroy him.</p><p>They arrived, and a letter awaited him. Ewen left them, going straight to check on Lily. But Will opened the envelope immediately, standing there in the entryway.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d Felicity shrugged off her cloak, handed it to a maid. \u201cWho even knows we\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>She felt light and giddy, and in the way of all great moods, she had the sense that everything was now going to go her way. She was sure the letter would bear some additional bit of amazing news. Like Jamie was apologizing, or maybe the whole king thing was settled.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s it say, Will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks to be two letters, actually,\u201d Will muttered.</p><p>\u201cAre they both to you?\u201d She craned her neck to get a better look. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you open the other one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean it\u2019s not to you? Who\u2019s it to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch, woman,\u201d he snapped. \u201cPlease give me a moment.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been riding so high, his brusque tone came as a shock. \u201cOuch,\u201d she mumbled, feeling herself deflate.</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he growled again. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, love.\u201d He looked at her, and his expression startled her. There was a blankness there, a deadness in his eyes. \u201c \u2019Tis only . . . this is happening sooner than I\u2019d expected.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He sighed. \u201cThe letter. It\u2019s from Ormonde. A summons from the Sealed Knot men,\u201d he said, showing her the opened letter. \u201cAnd\u201d\u2014he gestured to the elaborately sealed envelope\u2014\u201ca message for the King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe King?\u201d she asked, taken aback. \u201cWhat do they need to write to the King about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCromwell.\u201d Will was remote, his mind seeming to whir on other things. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow . . . well . . . that\u2019s a good thing, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis son Richard has been named his successor. Be it one Cromwell or another,\u201d Will mused distractedly, \u201ctime will tell what that means for Charles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what does this all have to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see?\u201d He pinned her with his gaze, his attention clicking back to the moment. \u201cThe Sealed Knot asks that I be the one to deliver word to the King.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m still not getting it. Where is he? I thought the King was\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn Belgium? Aye.\u201d Will crumpled his letter in his fist. \u201cHe\u2019s in exile, in Bruges. And I\u2019m to deliver this message to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d It finally hit home. Will had to leave, to see the King. In Belgium. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just go too. I\u2019ve never been there before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only place you\u2019re going is back to your own time.\u201d He stared at the King\u2019s letter in his hand, his face a hard mask. \u201cThis has become far too dangerous. My brother, witch-hunters . . . they are nothing compared to this. Cromwell\u2019s spies hope to intercept just this sort of correspondence. To capture and kill those who carry it.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been feeling so joyful, and the intensity of her emotions took a pendulum swing to anger. \u201cSo you\u2019re still going to send me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why we came,\u201d he told her, subdued. \u201cTo get instructions from Cameron\u2019s witch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we just found out I\u2019m pregnant. You\u2019re going to let me go even though I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d He simply nodded, and so she pressed, \u201cSo you\u2019re just going to say good-bye. Even though I\u2019m carrying your baby. How can you do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do it to save you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d she snapped. \u201cI don\u2019t get how all these other women are allowed to stay here. Lily, Maggie, whatever the hell their names are. Why can\u2019t I stay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwen let Lily stay! She\u2019s even had babies, and she\u2019s still fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwen is chief of his clan,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cWho am I? I\u2019m not even an eldest son. Jamie won\u2019t rest until he sees you dead. And a child of mine? Even worse. He\u2019ll rally religious zealots, Parliamentarians, my old Covenanter enemies, he\u2019ll use all at his disposal to see me . . . to see us destroyed. I cannot see you and a baby . . .\u201d</p><p>He shut his eyes as if to gather himself. When he opened them, the man she knew had retreated, and before her stood the stoic William Rollo once more. It made her unutterably sad. \u201cI cannot see you and our baby in danger. I love you, Felicity, and this is the only way I know to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could come with me then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The foyer was dim, and torchlight flickered on the edges of his features. A handsome face, through some strange alchemy turned to steel. \u201cI can\u2019t. I have obligations. I made a promise. I must see the King restored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously, Will.\u201d She was grasping at straws. \u201cListen, England had a queen when I left. They\u2019ve got princes coming out of their ears over there. The monarchy was alive and well. Your work is as good as done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would,\u201d he began, looking pained. \u201cI would go with you. But I made a promise, and I am a man of my word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019d they even know how to find you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Sealed Knot men can\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell they sure found you mighty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I\u2019d mentioned to Ormonde that we were traveling to Lochaber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d mentioned it,\u201d she said testily. She put a hand up to silence whatever excuse he was about to give her. \u201cWhatever. I get it. There\u2019s no convincing you. It\u2019s bye-bye Felicity. The noble hero is gallivanting off into the sunset and certain death.\u201d</p><p>Her voice cracked on those last words. Anger and confusion and grief clawed at her, paralyzing her thoughts, freezing her tongue in her mouth.</p><p>And, for the first time in a very long time, Felicity was silenced.</p><p>Chapter 31</p><p>Will came for her in the night. Though they\u2019d been given separate rooms, he\u2019d come for her every night as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>But this night was different. This night she knew would be their last.</p><p>She lay there, silently, wondering if he\u2019d know she was really awake. She feigned sleep, but her anger she didn\u2019t have to pretend.</p><p>But she needed him. She loved Will, more desperately than ever. She needed him near, and so she lay still, listening as he unlatched the door, slowly pushed it open, walked to her bed.</p><p>She heard the shuffle and light tap of his cane, and the sounds seared her. Ran her through. He was gorgeous and noble. Thoughtful, brilliant, kind, and brave. But it was Will\u2019s vulnerability that she loved most of all.</p><p>She heard him pause. He stood by her bed, not making a sound. She was terrified he\u2019d leave. Terrified Will might turn and go, forever.</p><p>Felicity considered saying something, but stayed mute. She\u2019d already said it all. There was nothing left to say.</p><p>There was the heavy sound of wool falling to the floor. His plaid. Relief burst through her, a tingling cascade across her chest. She realized she\u2019d been holding her breath.</p><p>She felt the skim of bed linens against her skin, and moved just the slightest fraction over, making room.</p><p>Felicity lay on her side, her back to him. Still she pretended sleep, but wondered who she was kidding. She was naked. Waiting.</p><p>She felt the mattress give with his weight. It was stuffed with dried heather and made a light crunching sound as he lay next to her.</p><p>Did he think she was asleep? Surely he could tell from her breathing that she wasn\u2019t. She wondered what he would do. Would he wake her? How much did he want her? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSpeak to me, love,\u201d he whispered into the darkness.</p><p>She lay still, listening to the rasp of his breathing. Though he wasn\u2019t touching her, his body radiated warmth along her back.</p><p>He pulled the bed linens up, sliding them carefully over her shoulder. Tucking his finger under her hair, he slid the mass of it from where it had tangled at her neck. There was another rustle, a hit of chill air, and warmth again as she sensed his arm under the covers.</p> <p>\u201cWe part tomorrow.\u201d He reached for her, and his fingers scorched her like a burn. \u201cIt will be the end of my world.\u201d His hand stroked along her side, tracking a slow curve from hip, sloping to waist, up along her ribs, and back again. \u201cI will be as a dead man, Felicity. A man without his heart.\u201d</p><p>Her breath hitched and she struggled not to speak. Bottled-up emotion clutched at her throat, aching with her unshed tears.</p><p>\u201cI want you.\u201d The husky tremble in his voice made her shiver.</p><p>She wanted him too. Had never stopped wanting him.</p><p>He stroked up and down the side of her body.</p> <p>Is this it?</p><p>Would this be the last time they\u2019d ever be together? Felicity thought maybe she should turn around. Grab him, and shout, and make it memorable. But she could only lie there, stricken by her pain.</p><p>\u201cSay something,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>But there was too much to say. Nothing more she could say.</p><p>She thought for a moment, maybe if she didn\u2019t have sex with him . . . Maybe it wouldn\u2019t be good-bye until they did.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t play those games. She had to be with him, one more time. Will was so perfect, it was impossible for her to resist when offered.</p> <p>\u201cI feel as though you\u2019ve left me already.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop herself. Her breath hiccupped, and she curled in more tightly on herself. It was unbearable. Leaving him.</p><p>\u201cOch, love.\u201d His whisper was unsteady, unbearably tender. \u201cDo you cry?\u201d</p><p>His body melded to hers. Hot flesh along her back. Muscle, the light bristle of hair, his hardness. \u201cPlease.\u201d She felt his mouth at her shoulder. \u201cSay something.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s touch was tentative, reaching around to cup her breast. She nudged her hips back, letting him know it was all right.</p><p>His hand stroked to her thigh. She shifted her leg, resting it over his.</p><p>He slipped into her from behind.</p><p>The last time.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t move at first. She wasn\u2019t sure when he\u2019d started to move. He went so slowly. Every motion, quiet tenderness. Every moment to be savored.</p><p>The last time I\u2019ll feel him.</p><p>She\u2019d truly believed she was his. Til this very last moment, she\u2019d held out hope. But hope had faded to despair. She\u2019d thought Will was the one, and yet Gormshuil had told her, if she left, she\u2019d never return.</p><p>Looking back now, she wondered, had they always been saying good-bye? Somehow, from the start, their time together had never fully been their own. Always anchored in place and time, they\u2019d never been free to be lovers, carefree and easy.</p><p>\u201cMy love,\u201d he murmured simply.</p><p>She felt her body coiling. Building. She wouldn\u2019t cry out.</p><p>My last time.</p><p>Felicity gasped as her climax slammed into her. She wanted to scream, to moan and shout. To shout at Will, at the fates conspiring against them. But she stayed silent, biting her lips to swallow her cries.</p><p>Will held her tight. She felt a tear in the corner of her eye. It spilled to her nose, hovered there, and then drifted down. She shut her eyes tight, willing sleep to take her.</p><p>This last sleep by Will\u2019s side.</p><p>Chapter 32</p><p>Though they traveled now on separate horses, the memory of their ride together, on a single mount with her body pressed close, crushed him.</p><p>Such memories pierced Will, buffeting him in the silence. Each was a tiny flame that had sputtered to life in his heart, lit by Felicity. And now he would feel them wink out, one by one, until slowly he\u2019d be extinguished.</p><p>They traversed Cameron lands, across emerald green glens and over tangled Highland hills, toward the spot where they\u2019d mark out the labyrinth.</p><p>Will adjusted himself on the saddle, adjusted his sporran. The crude map folded inside weighed on him more than the heaviest physical burden.</p><p>\u201cFrom what Ewen told me, it isn\u2019t far now,\u201d he said, trying for the thousandth time to talk to Felicity.</p><p>Please say something.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll not need to build the maze, of course,\u201d Rollo continued. Felicity had fallen behind a few paces, and he slowed his horse to let her catch up. \u201cThis Gormshuil claims the power lies in the star map itself, which Ewen has already begun to etch into a stone that will someday be the heart of the labyrinth. He and Lily dream of saving one whom he called brother. A man named Robert who took a bullet for the laird.\u201d</p><p>Please speak to me.</p><p>\u201cThis paper I carry bears the pattern in its entirety. The witch claims you need only place it over the stone and trace it with your finger.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even nod her acknowledgment. Her silence gutted him.</p><p>Past conversations poured through his mind. Why had he not treasured every single one? He regretted any times he might have dismissed her, hushed her. All he wanted now was to hear Felicity\u2019s every thought.</p><p>\u201cThe witch promises, if you trace the lines just so, you will go to the correct place in time. I wish there were some way to return you to your exact location, but Gormshuil knows only the magic of the maze, and unfortunately the maze is in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>Why won\u2019t she speak? The total absence of Felicity\u2019s easy chatter was a shock to his system. Like being deprived of air he hadn\u2019t realized he was relying on to survive.</p><p>\u201cThat is a concern to me, though she does assure me of your safety otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Felicity pulled her horse to an abrupt halt, the reins wound tight around her fists, and swung her head to look at him. Her eyes were swollen and red, and such explicit evidence of her pain stung like an accusation.</p><p>\u201cSafe?\u201d she croaked. \u201cYeah, my heart feels real safe in your care, Will.\u201d She turned away, scrubbing at her face.</p><p>Her words lashed him, and Will reminded himself he was doing the right thing. Felicity was better off sad and alone, than dead.</p><p>\u201cLove\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t love me,\u201d she snapped, and he thought himself a pathetic sot, for even angry words from her were better than none at all. \u201cI don\u2019t think you know what love is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wrong,\u201d he said, his voice a tight rasp. Felicity, who felt so quickly and lightly, who blithely moved her way through the world, she had no idea what depths he plumbed. How powerful love became when forged by darkness and loss. \u201cI am desperately in love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019d only be desperate if I didn\u2019t love you back.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered an inhale. Would that he could stay with her for always. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. My world doesn\u2019t allow for feelings. Has never allowed for them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen come to my world, with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould I, I would go with you. In a moment, I would go with you, follow you to the ends of the earth. God help me, Felicity, I dream of going with you. But what kind of man would I be if I abandoned my responsibilities here?\u201d</p><p>Sensing his angst, Will\u2019s horse skittered, fighting to trot. He eased his seat, slowing the animal. \u201cFelicity, don\u2019t you see? You\u2019ve made me a better man. But there is a debt I owe here. You\u2019ve made me a better man, and I can\u2019t dishonor that gift by going back on my word.\u201d</p><p>He let the words hang, then added quietly, \u201cI am a man of my word. And I keep my promises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen promise to find me.\u201d Her voice was small, so timid and small and unlike Felicity it shattered him.</p><p>\u201cI cannot,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>Because I\u2019ll likely be dead. \u201cBecause it would be a vow I don\u2019t know that I could keep.\u201d</p><p>She looked away, staring sightlessly into space. Will sat, the silence torturing him. He couldn\u2019t think what more to say, and so let the horses resume walking.</p><p>Their journey had grown gradually more difficult. Low braes had risen into steeper hills, the smooth, green glens replaced by land more tangled and ragged.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Will said, seeing their destination. Looming like a scar in the earth, in the greens and reds of gorse and bracken, stood a wall of cold, gray granite.</p><p>\u201cThe path forks and narrows,\u201d he recited, \u201cin the shadow of a granite crag. That\u2019s the spot Cameron described.\u201d</p><p>Pulling his horse to a stop, he pounded life back into his legs, preparing to dismount.</p><p>Trembling, Felicity forced air in and out of her lungs. It was time.</p><p>She watched Will punching at his legs, just the way she\u2019d told him not to do. But now she was too tired to say anything, and instead just watched, sadly remembering their first carriage ride so long ago, when their time together had still been ahead of them. She wondered if there was something she should\u2019ve done differently.</p><p>He was off his horse, making his way to her. The land fought him, thick and tangled with life, ferns and bulrush challenging his every step. But he came to her, raised his hands up to her, and she let him ease her from the saddle.</p><p>The feel of his strong grip on her waist stung fresh tears in her eyes. He brought his thumb to smudge them from her cheeks, and she flinched away. These tears were only the beginning, and she\u2019d let them flow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll place the pattern over the rock,\u201d he said, opening his sporran. He unfolded the paper tucked there. It bore a crude map of lines and dots.</p><p>How odd, she thought. The secrets of the universe etched just there, on some old scrap of paper. There was no going back now, and it made her feel dead inside.</p><p>\u201cThe labyrinth itself matters not.\u201d His eyes went from the paper to her. \u201cThey build the maze merely to obscure the map, which will someday lie hidden at its center. This\u201d\u2014his hand tightened on the sheet\u2014\u201cis what holds the power.\u201d</p><p>They walked to the rock face. Though the sun still had a couple hours left in the sky, the high granite wall obscured it, casting them in cool shadow. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She saw the spot. A curve in the wall. A niche in the rock, and a stone tablet within.</p><p>This is it. And then, a sudden shrill at the edges of thought: Is it safe? She pushed the thought away, letting fear and grief blank her mind.</p><p>Her surliness seemed a stupid thing now, a ridiculous, tragic waste of their time together, and Felicity grabbed him tight.</p> <p>He responded at once to her touch, wrapping a strong arm around her. \u201cOch, love,\u201d he whispered in her hair as he leaned to kiss the top of her head. \u201cMy heart and soul go through that rock with you. You leave only the shell of me behind.\u201d</p><p>They approached, and she saw where the laird had begun to chisel lines in the stone tablet. They would place the map over the stone, as if it were tracing paper.</p><p>She stopped in her tracks. Afraid now, and uncertain.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s the map that\u2019s so important . . .\u201d she hesitated, cleared her throat. She stared at the paper in his hand. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just draw that anywhere and disappear through time? I don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so sure this will work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is some magic held by this very rock.\u201d He stared at it, brow furrowed. \u201cSome magic spoken, some talisman cast. The witch claims you must leave from just here.\u201d</p> <p>She trembled fiercely now, and he supported her as they walked the final steps to the stone. Icy perspiration prickled along her body. Her breathing and heartbeat felt shallow, and she thought that maybe if she passed out, she might prolong their time together just a little bit more.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t pass out. Events marched forward.</p><p>She stood before the rock and Will put his hands on hers. Together they smoothed the sheet over the stone.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Felicity said. Will stood behind her, and she craned her neck to look at him.</p><p>She memorized his features. Would she see them someday on the child she carried? Thick brown hair. Hazel eyes that looked brown in the shadows. Those sharp, strong lines of his cheek and jaw.</p><p>Could she grab his hands, grab Will tight and pull him through with her? Wouldn\u2019t Livvie just die to meet him?</p> <p>Livvie. She\u2019d see her aunt soon. And yet the thought just made Felicity sad. She wasn\u2019t ready.</p><p>\u201cIs this it?\u201d she asked, realizing that a part of her had been waiting for something else to happen. Some intervening force that would keep her by Will\u2019s side. The fates had sent her here, where were they now?</p><p>A cascade of small rocks spilled from overhead. Slivers of shale bit into her exposed skin, and Will pulled Felicity to him, covering her head with his own.</p><p>They both looked up. A rider stood on the rise above.</p><p>Cold dread crushed her.</p><p>Jamie.</p><p>Will shaded his eyes, glued to his brother overhead. Finally, he asked, \u201cHow did you find me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s easier than you\u2019d think, getting folk to talk. Be it bribe or blade, there\u2019s always a way to loosen tongues.\u201d Jamie\u2019s horse pranced nervously, and a shower of gravel rained from the high ridge. \u201c \u2019Twas a crofter who sold you out just now.\u201d Jamie shrugged. \u201cThese Camerons are a stubborn lot. This one was forced to pay in blood.\u201d</p> <p>Will\u2019s brother was lit from behind, and when his lips peeled into a smile, the dramatic shadows transformed his face into a sinister mask. \u201cPaid in blood,\u201d Jamie added, \u201cas your woman will also pay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy woman has done nothing,\u201d Will snarled, stepping in front of Felicity to guard her at his back.</p><p>\u201cTo the contrary. Any woman who lies with you is soiled. That is crime enough.\u201d Jamie\u2019s hand went to the broadsword at his side. \u201cAnd now she will pay, and I will enjoy having you watch.\u201d</p><p>There was shuffling, and Felicity saw the heads of two other horses, tossing just in view. Jamie had brought friends.</p><p>Will must have spotted them too. He turned to face her. His attention only on her.</p><p>She saw the intensity in his eyes and she knew. The fates weren\u2019t intervening to save her. Jamie\u2019s appearance was a shove further down this path of no return. She whimpered simply, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Felicity.\u201d Will\u2019s voice was hoarse with emotion as he turned her to face the stone once again.</p><p>She stood limply, yet between Will at her back and her legs locked under her, somehow Felicity remained propped upright.</p><p>No. The thought was tiny. The events unfolding around her were too big, too inexorable to stop. There was no fighting it now.</p><p>But she\u2019d been so positive she was his. She couldn\u2019t go through. The witch said she\u2019d never come back.</p><p>He took her arm in his hand.</p><p>No.</p><p>Distantly she heard the scuffle of horses along the ridge overhead.</p><p>Will began to draw her finger over the marks.</p><p>Her hand was cold and limp in his. She couldn\u2019t accept this. The blood drained from her head, and she felt clammy and woozy.</p><p>There was the dull patter of gravel falling at their feet. A hollow laugh from above.</p><p>Her arm started to buzz.</p><p>This was it. It was happening.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live without you.\u201d Her voice hitched, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>\u201cGo around,\u201d came a shout from above. More rock rained down. \u201cThis way, you fools.\u201d Jamie\u2019s voice, moving along the ridge.</p><p>Will worked faster. Her finger grew hot.</p><p>She was suddenly so heavy. Gravity pulled at her, making it hard to stand. She tried to lean back into Will, but he held her hard and apart.</p><p>Her free hand flailed behind her. She could grab him, take him with her. But she was weak now, and her hand met only air.</p><p>\u201cGood-bye to you, love.\u201d Will\u2019s voice cracked. She felt his rough kiss on the back of her head. \u201cGood-bye to my heart.\u201d</p><p>She tried to speak, but her body was numb, immobile. She wondered if she traveled already. Was this what it would feel like?</p><p>The sound of horses came from behind.</p><p>Vertigo whirred in her head as she sank out of control. She wanted to cry for help, but couldn\u2019t. Her body was deadened. Not right.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe now, and panic spiked through her. Tried to inhale, tried to move. Frozen. She was terrified now, terrified of the cold that was pulling her down.</p><p>Strange, disjointed laughter came from behind, so surreal.</p><p>Felicity felt Will\u2019s hands on her shoulders. Such sweet relief flooded her. She was dying and he would pull her back, would save her from this darkness.</p><p>But then he pushed. Will shoved her down and through, and in that moment, it was a betrayal, shattering her heart.</p><p>Finally sound came from her throat, as if she surfaced from the paralysis of a nightmare. Felicity screamed, and the noise was engulfed by the whirl of stars around her.</p><p>Chapter 33</p><p>The growl ripped from Will\u2019s throat. It was a feral noise, rabid and fierce. The sound of his soul being ripped from his body, as he watched his Felicity, so terrified and vulnerable, torn from him forever.</p><p>He spun from that accursed star chart, turning to face Jamie\u2019s men. He\u2019d heard their approach, worried they\u2019d reach him before he could push Felicity through to safety.</p><p>Will despised them, hated Jamie with everything he had. They\u2019d forced his hand, forced him to push Felicity so violently away. He\u2019d seen the shock of it on her face, the heart-break and the betrayal.</p><p>They didn\u2019t get a proper good-bye. His final sight of her, simply the last of her beautiful blonde hair getting sucked into a terrifying maw of black nothingness.</p><p>The image would haunt him the rest of his days.</p><p>He sized them up in a heartbeat. Two men charging on foot. His cowardly brother still watching from the ridge overhead.</p><p>Will didn\u2019t even deign to pull his sword from where it was hidden in the length of his cane.</p><p>The first man rushed at him like an ass, but Will stood still as a rock. He held his cane steady, tilting his wrist up at the last moment, extending it straight out from his body. The man leapt for him with dagger and targe, but Rollo simply jabbed him in the gut, followed by a strike to the groin.</p><p>His opponent fell to the ground retching, and Will tossed the cane up, catching and swinging it back down in a single fluid movement. He struck the handle against the man\u2019s temple, stilling Jamie\u2019s hired half-wit forever.</p><p>The second one came fast on his heels, charging Rollo with his broadsword extended. Will scowled to see the elaborate gilded basket hilt that guarded the man\u2019s hand. The blood of Royalists had paid for that gilt.</p><p>He tossed his cane up, grabbing high along the length of it. Just as the swordsman lunged, Will pivoted sideways, hooking the cane\u2019s handle on the man\u2019s bicep, and reaping his arm down.</p><p>The man stumbled and Will struck him in the small of the back, hammered once on the back of his neck, and then on the kidneys. The man fell down, but Will swung up, striking him in the throat.</p><p>It felt good, this savagery. But it wasn\u2019t enough. Nothing would ever be enough to atone for his and Felicity\u2019s final farewell.</p><p>His opponent choked his last, a grotesque wheezing at Will\u2019s back. But the man was already forgotten as Rollo looked up at his brother, waiting on horseback along the top of the ridge.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fight your own battles?\u201d Will shouted up. Loathing seethed from his voice.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t fight like a normal man?\u201d Jamie countered, with a scornful nod to Will\u2019s cane.</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes scanned quickly, searching out the mounts of the hired men. Two stout ponies grazed idly, at the base of the hill.</p><p>He made a soft whickering noise. One of the ponies twitched an ear, and then lifted his head to look at him. Will clicked his tongue again. The beast seemed to think on it, then heaved his body into a slow walk.</p><p>Will met the animal halfway. Grabbing the reins, he hauled himself easily onto the saddle. Leaning high on the pony\u2019s neck, he kicked into an abrupt canter.</p><p>Jamie waited for him at the top of the rise. \u201cOh, Willie,\u201d he hooted, greeting him with laughter. \u201cThis is too rich! You on a pony once more.\u201d Jamie\u2019s horse, a big bay, skittered beneath him. \u201cHow about we take care of your other leg, little brother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d get ahold of your mount, Jamie,\u201d he said nonchalantly. \u201cThe beast seems too much for you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jamie merely hissed in response. He drew his sword and, swatting it on his horse\u2019s rump, charged.</p><p>\u201cYou always did charge too soon,\u201d Will muttered, coolly sizing up his brother. Jamie swung his sword wildly, keeping his other hand fisted tight in his reins.</p><p>His eyes narrowed, watching Jamie flail so. Will was a trained cavalryman. A lifetime of riding and decades of pain had forged his muscles. Misshapen they might be, but Will\u2019s legs were steel. He calmly knotted his reins, settling them high on the pony\u2019s neck. Unlike his brother, Will would have two hands with which to fight.</p> <p>His brother raced along the ridge, but Rollo kept a quiet seat on his own mount, keeping the creature placid despite the warhorse headed straight for them.</p><p>\u201cAlways with the same error,\u201d Will shouted. He slid his cane through his fist to grip it at the base.</p><p>Jamie was on him in seconds, charging wildly.</p><p>Will ducked back, but not enough to completely dodge the shallow slice of his brother\u2019s blade. He withstood the attack, had braced for it, knowing it would come. The price of his own strike.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the mistake you made at the Tower.\u201d Will flexed, and with a nudge of his left leg, the pony spun in a tight circle to face Jamie. \u201cAnd you make it now,\u201d he gritted, extending from his saddle despite the bloody track blooming along his chest. Leaning out, Will charged, hooking his brother\u2019s arm with the handle of his cane.</p> <p>Though Will didn\u2019t tear Jamie from the saddle as he\u2019d intended, his brother slid halfway off.</p><p>\u201cThe same errors,\u201d Will said, unsheathing his blade.</p><p>Jamie scrambled wildly, and the sight was disturbingly satisfying. Will wouldn\u2019t kill his brother, but it didn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t want to see the devil suffer.</p><p>\u201cIn battle as in life, eh, Jamie?\u201d He tucked the shell of his cane under his thigh. \u201cImpatient,\u201d he snarled, leaning once more from the pony. He slapped Jamie with the flat of his blade, his intention to pummel, not kill. \u201cFoolhardy.\u201d Another slap, to the shoulder. \u201cImpulsive.\u201d Again, the flat of the blade, this time to Jamie\u2019s face.</p><p>Will would never recover from his broken heart, but the smack of steel on his brother\u2019s flesh did much to appease. A red haze overtook him, his rage wiping out all thought. He continued to strike at him, beating him down and down again.</p><p>The big bay reared, and Jamie slipped from his saddle.</p> <p>\u201cWeak,\u201d Will spat. It felt good to see Jamie helpless on the ground, as he\u2019d lain helpless so many decades past. But the satisfaction tasted bitter on his tongue, like raw spirits that turned belly to bile. \u201cYou\u2019re weak. Rolling in the dirt like a coward.\u201d</p><p>Jamie scrambled to his knees. Though close to the ledge, his eyes were only on the tremendous warhorse looming over him. \u201cDamn you,\u201d he hissed, not taking his gaze from the spooked horse. \u201cYou\u2019re the weak one. Feeble Willie.\u201d</p><p>Will stared as the horse reared again, nearly trampling Jamie. Detached, he wondered at the morbid and poetic justice of it.</p><p>The animal bucked and started, and Jamie scrambled backwards.</p><p>Rollo heard the shocked shout at the same moment he saw Jamie\u2019s body lurch. His legs had slipped over the edge and he clung to the lip of the ridge, feet kicking wildly in the air.</p><p>Will stared, for a moment dumbfounded. And then there was a moment of total clarity. He could let his brother fall to his death.</p><p>This man who\u2019d maimed him, who\u2019d spent a lifetime fighting against all Will believed in. Jamie had destroyed everything he\u2019d ever loved, had forced Felicity from his life.</p><p>But even as he had the thought, Will knew. He was incapable of letting his brother die.</p> <p>Will dropped from the pony. Using his sword for a walking stick, he went to Jamie, looked over the ledge at the valley below. There was a drop to a sharp slope. A man could survive the fall, but it wouldn\u2019t be pleasant.</p><p>Jamie frantically clawed at dirt and rocks, trying to find purchase along the ridge.</p><p>Will knelt, awkward for a moment, then sat, grabbing for his brother\u2019s hand. \u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Jamie swatted at the proffered hand, lunging instead for an unearthed root. \u201cI\u2019d rather die than take your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may despise you,\u201d Will said evenly, \u201cbut I\u2019ll not let you die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll not see you win.\u201d Jamie looked down, estimating the drop. A narrow ledge seven feet down, then a rocky slope to the bottom. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the last of it,\u201d he snarled. And then he let go.</p><p>Fascinated, horrified, Will watched his brother drop hard, scramble vainly for purchase, then slide down. Scree and gravel sped his descent, sounding a hollow noise that echoed in the valley. He careened faster and faster.</p><p>\u201cBloody fool,\u201d Will muttered, shaking his head with loathing. \u201cBloody bastard.\u201d He remounted, driving his pony along the ridge then back down the slope.</p><p>Though Jamie lay limp at the base of the hill, Rollo\u2019s approach was tentative. Leave it to his brother to feign injury, then spring at the last moment to attempt a deathblow.</p><p>But as he got closer, Will knew. He knew before he dismounted, before he reached the body, knew even before he saw the blood matting his brother\u2019s hair and the dark crimson shimmering on the stones.</p><p>Jamie was dead.</p><p>He inhaled. Waited for emotions to come. He braced for some feeling to slam into him, filling him with relief, or rage, or regret. But nothing came.</p><p>Will simply stood and stared at the body of James Rollo.</p><p>He had a job still to do. And all he felt was empty.</p><p>Chapter 34</p><p>She landed hard, rocks digging into her hands and knees.</p><p>It took Felicity a moment to realize what had happened. Was she still traveling? She stared at her hands. Her hair spilled over them, fingers clawing at dirt and moss-covered stone, her nails dirty half-moons.</p><p>She was breathing now, and it was a relief. She swallowed, shook her head. Where was she?</p><p>Felicity looked up and cried out a short, sharp shriek. Gone was the green and shadowed serenity of the Highland woods. Walls of dark, spiky leaves rose high all around. Purple flowers reached for her, drooping from their vines. Berries dangled there too, their ripeness an obscene, dull black.</p><p>She fell to her bottom and scrambled backwards. Her back struck a dense wall of foliage and she screamed again.</p><p>The maze, she told herself, trying to calm her pounding heart. This would be the maze.</p><p>Felicity looked up. The stone tablet was there.</p><p>Will.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Bounding to her feet, she slammed her hands on the stone. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she cried.</p><p>The star chart was fully etched in the granite now. The stone was dull, aged. It had been there for hundreds of years. Ewen had finished his maze, and he\u2019d be long dead.</p><p>She was pierced by anguish. Her Will. Dead now, for hundreds of years.</p><p>Staccato sobs shrieked from her. She rubbed and traced the fine lines and points, over and over, until her fingertips were raw. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d she cried again.</p><p>She wanted Will. She wanted to go back. She didn\u2019t care if it killed her. Jamie and those men had come for them, and she belonged near him. She\u2019d die by his side.</p><p>She slapped and drew along the stone tablet, but it was dead under her hands. Dead and cold and lifeless, and Felicity stumbled back, falling to the ground in tears.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t said good-bye. She\u2019d never see him again. Would never touch him, or hear him, or see Will again.</p><p>A breeze rustled along the top of the hedge. She shivered. The labyrinth was like a live thing that she needed to flee. It felt ancient. Moss grew thick underfoot, untouched for how many years?</p><p>She was back in modern time now. Her Viking, centuries away.</p><p>At least she hoped she was in modern time. Panic dumped adrenaline through her veins. What if she\u2019d traveled to the wrong time? What if she couldn\u2019t find Livvie?</p><p>She needed to find her aunt. She needed to get out of the maze. She needed to call Livvie. All Felicity wanted to do was hear her voice.</p><p>She stood, got her bearings. She was in a small cul-de sac, at the head of which was a single opening. Trying not to touch any of those hideous leaves or berries, she peeked through. Though Felicity knew what she\u2019d see, knew she\u2019d find herself in a labyrinth, the sight still startled her.</p><p>Dark green walls pressed in, curving and opening onto shadows. Her heart gave a sharp kick in her chest. She needed to get the hell out of there.</p><p>Livvie. She was so numb, that lone thought was like a lifeline. She\u2019d get out of there and find a phone to call Livvie.</p><p>Pure animal panic emptied her mind, and Felicity let her feet take her where they would. Blindly, she turned corner after corner, trying not to think about those purple flowers reaching for her, brushing against her skin like a touch from beyond. She hunched through each doorway, relying on some instinctual part of her to lead her to the light.</p><p>The leaves grew a brighter green as she went, the maze gradually opening to allow the sun\u2019s fingers to wend their way in. Fresh air was sweet in her lungs, and Felicity realized the maze was at her back.</p><p>She stumbled forward, looking for landmarks to place herself. Fresh tears stung. Will. They\u2019d stood together just here. How many minutes ago, how many centuries?</p><p>Had he died here? Her throat closed, her grief a constant ache lodged just there.</p><p>Phone. I need a phone, she thought, as she began to jog. Hiking her long skirts high, she jogged away from the maze, welcoming the stitch in her side and the burn in her chest.</p><p>She galloped down a hill she remembered climbing with Will, and it pushed her harder. Her leather slippers were soaked through, and they made a dull slapping as she raced across a damp, green glen, desperate now to hear Livia\u2019s voice.</p><p>Felicity didn\u2019t know how far or how long she\u2019d been going when signs of life began to pierce her consciousness. A distant lowing. The bleat of a sheep.</p><p>A car horn.</p><p>She broke into a run.</p><p>A narrow street wound at the base of a valley, and she ran to it, hypnotized by the sight of small, boxy cars winding in the distance. A dingy, squared-off truck. Some white, compact Eurocar.</p><p>She slowed, mesmerized. The sight of modern amenities wasn\u2019t the relief she\u2019d thought it might be, and the notion rocked her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She just wanted Will.</p><p>She scrubbed her arm along her face, wiping the damp from her cheeks and eyes, and made her way onto the road. Felicity stood in the middle, ready to flag down a car. Someone might hit her and, at that moment, she didn\u2019t really care.</p><p>It was a blue minivan that stopped. A startling number of people stared at her from inside. Car exhaust filled her lungs, and it was a smell both familiar and yet so jarringly foreign and wrong.</p> <p>Idling, the driver rolled down his window. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>A rear window rolled down. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s room,\u201d came from somewhere in the car. \u201cShe can fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have an accident?\u201d the driver asked.</p><p>\u201cShe looks sick or something,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice said.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, like from one of those zombie movies.\u201d Laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to eat us, are you?\u201d</p><p>She was pummeled by questions, all of them surreal and meaningless after what she\u2019d just been through. It took a moment to register that they spoke with American accents. The sound was so recognizable on such a deep-seated level, Felicity didn\u2019t immediately recognize the anomaly.</p><p>They grew quiet, watching her. A window rolled back up. They must think I\u2019m crazy. She didn\u2019t want them to drive away, and so she ventured a weak smile.</p><p>The driver was quick to smile in return, and tried one more time to connect. \u201cDid you just come from some sort of Renaissance Faire or something?\u201d</p><p>She struggled to make meaning without context. A woman in the backseat was eyeing Felicity\u2019s dress, and it finally clicked. The period clothing.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She took a deep breath. \u201cI did. But . . . but my car broke down and I need a phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a phone down the road a ways,\u201d the driver said.</p><p>A door opened to the backseat. \u201cHop in,\u201d a woman told her.</p><p>And Felicity got in the car, every moment, every mile taking her further from her Viking.</p><p>Chapter 35</p><p>Will had arrived well past midnight. And though he lay, weary and warm, in the bed of his childhood, he found no comfort there.</p><p>He thought about Felicity. Always it was Felicity. Falling asleep at night, upon waking, in his dreams. She was ever in his thoughts.</p><p>Dawn crept through cracks in the thick draperies. He needed to rise. He must tell his parents of the death of their son.</p><p>But the thought of rolling from his bed, placing his feet on the floor, and hauling the weight of his body onto sore legs overwhelmed him.</p> <p>He reached down, rubbing life into his knee. Winter\u2019s chill reached his bones with an acute ache, his joints like shards of broken glass that barely fit together.</p><p>Felicity would have rubbed his legs. She\u2019d have stolen thoughts of pain from his mind.</p><p>Felicity. He hoped desperately she\u2019d survived the journey. That she\u2019d been able to find her way home and was safely reunited with her aunt. But he couldn\u2019t think on that. He needed to push such thoughts from his mind, save them for the wee, cold hours of the night.</p><p>He had a job to do. He\u2019d tell his parents about their eldest son, and then tell them their youngest traveled off in duty to his king, perhaps never to return alive.</p><p>Despondent, Will stood. The stone floor was bitter cold, and pain crackled up his calves like the sharp fracturing of ice on a thawing loch. He embraced the sensation, willed it to steal the conscious thought from his mind, if only for a moment.</p><p>He unfurled his plaid, stabbed by the inevitable memories of Felicity. Of her playful and curious ways.</p><p>As he dressed, he pictured her, draping the heavy swath of wool over herself. How many times had her pale, tender hands pushed this plaid from his body? Not enough.</p><p>He grabbed his sporran. He remembered her teasing. Was there anything in his life untouched by her?</p><p>Buckling it on, he thought of the Fool card, still tucked away. He now understood the message sent to him from the universe. He was that fool.</p><p>Will cursed himself. He needed to seek out his father before he grew any more piteous and self-abasing.</p><p>He found the man in his favorite spot in the garden, settled in a chair beneath a great, towering birch. \u201cOch,\u201d Will muttered, seeing that nobody had thought to cover the man\u2019s legs despite the merciless chill in the air. \u201cDo all here think only of themselves?\u201d</p><p>He retrieved a blanket from a garden bench. It had been left out, forgotten, and Will shook the damp and leaves from it. \u201cDamp wool\u2019s better than none at all, eh, Da?\u201d he said, draping it over his father\u2019s legs.</p><p>The old man looked up, greeting his son with a wavering smile. His father seemed stronger somehow, his eyes clearer, his expression more sure.</p><p>\u201cYou look fine,\u201d Will said. He smiled back at his father, thinking it was his first since he\u2019d said good-bye to Felicity.</p><p>His father\u2019s eyes darted around, brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cLooking for Felicity, are you?\u201d Will didn\u2019t wait for a response. He knew how she\u2019d touched his father, and so broke the first of much news. \u201cAye, she\u2019s left me. It was too dangerous for her here.\u201d</p><p>Will faltered. He wandered to the old birch and began to pick idly at the silvery bark. \u201cDid she tell you everything? About where she was from?\u201d</p><p>He turned to face his father, who watched intently. The lines at his brow and the confusion in his eyes gave Will the answer.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Will said. \u201cShe\u2019d not have.\u201d Sighing, he brushed the dirt from his hands. \u201cFelicity was from very far away, Da. I\u2019ll not be seeing her again.\u201d</p><p>His father opened his mouth as if to speak, but Will couldn\u2019t bear a moment more on the topic, and so said abruptly, \u201cI\u2019ve news. Of Jamie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you speak to your father?\u201d His mother\u2019s voice was shrill in counterpoint to the tranquility of the garden.</p><p>\u201cWhy would I not speak to my father?\u201d Will countered. He knew full well his mother\u2019s meaning, but still, he\u2019d make the shrew speak the words.</p><p>She merely glowered.</p><p>\u201cMy father is as aware as you or I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo indeed,\u201d she snapped pertly. \u201cYour father is dead to us.\u201d She pointed to her husband. \u201cThat man is not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIst,\u201d his father hissed. It was a word commanding silence, and yet it came thick on his tongue, easily mistaken for the sibilance of a senile man.</p><p>\u201cHe speaks,\u201d Rollo told her.</p><p>\u201cHe spits. He spits and sputters like a dotard, and it disgusts me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, you prefer your men younger, don\u2019t you, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you even here?\u201d Her skirts crinkled as she whirled on him. \u201cTrouble follows you. You\u2019re cursed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m here to deliver word of your favorite son.\u201d</p><p>Startled, she looked at him blankly. His mother had made her preference clear when he\u2019d been but a child. Jamie\u2019s death would crush her.</p><p>His heart had closed to his mother years ago, and yet he\u2019d not relish delivering the news.</p><p>\u201cJamie is dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou killed him,\u201d she shrieked.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Will said simply. \u201cJamie killed himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son would do no such thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your son\u2019s choices that killed him.\u201d</p><p>His mother stalked to him. Her face was an icy mask, her obsidian eyes tightened into slits. She\u2019d been a rare beauty in her day. Tall and dark, and the odd thought struck him how beautiful she\u2019d remained through the years.</p><p>Beautiful and elegant, a queen carved of ice. And he wanted naught to do with her.</p><p>\u201cGet out,\u201d she hissed, pointing a long, thin finger accusingly at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the inheritance, isn\u2019t it? You just want to be the eldest. You never could accept Jamie\u2019s precedence. He was always the stronger boy, he outranked you, outmanned you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTil the very end, my brother acted less than a man,\u201d Will said, his tone dangerously quiet.</p><p>\u201cHe married, at least.\u201d The disgust that flickered in her eyes startled him. \u201cUnlike you. So stubbornly aberrant you were. And when you finally bring a woman home, it\u2019s some . . . some deviant, with her strange\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnnn . . . nough.\u201d</p><p>Father.</p><p>Lady Rollo\u2019s head spun to gape at her husband, and his eyes snared her as if she were a pinned butterfly.</p><p>There was a curious absence of emotion on his father\u2019s face. His eyes bore the blank look of a disciplining parent grown weary of an unruly child. \u201cI know . . .\u201d He gathered himself, swallowed, then continued, \u201cWhat . . . goes . . . on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped. \u201cIt can\u2019t be.\u201d</p><p>Will walked to put a hand on his father\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI imagine there will be changes, Mother.\u201d</p><p>His mother screamed, as if she\u2019d seen a ghost. She turned and ran, shrieking for her maid.</p><p>\u201cI imagine she\u2019ll have a bag packed and in the carriage before we\u2019re even back inside.\u201d Will watched his mother sweep up the stairs, disappearing into the shadows of Duncrub. The sight made him sad. Such waste, all around.</p><p>He felt his father\u2019s eyes on him. \u201cShe\u2019ll . . . not want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, I imagine she\u2019ll be away to my aunt\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>His father closed his eyes in agreement.</p><p>\u201cAnd if I know you, she\u2019ll have an allowance and will have her fill of gowns and callers as before.\u201d</p><p>The older man gave a slight shrug.</p><p>It stung to see his father cuckolded so. \u201cHow can you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d his father interrupted. \u201cPity not. Her money,\u201d he said, and Will knew he referred to the fortune that his mother had brought to their union. \u201cMy choice.\u201d</p><p>The older man shut his eyes for a moment, suddenly looking so tired. Just when Will thought he\u2019d drifted off, his father spoke again, his message clear. \u201cThe lass. Go to her.\u201d</p><p>Even though he knew it impossible, the thought thrilled him. Will let the prospect shiver along his spine before he crushed it from his mind. \u201cI cannot. It\u2019s impossible. And besides, to go to Felicity would mean good-bye forever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGo.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was as clear and steady as it had been when Will was a child.</p><p>\u201cThere is something I must do,\u201d he explained. \u201cFor the King. It\u2019s . . . dangerous business.\u201d</p><p>His father gave an uneven nod. \u201cSend word. After.\u201d He\u2019d worry for his son, but as he\u2019d done Will\u2019s entire life, he\u2019d delude himself about the true nature of the situation. Will knew he might not return, but his father would never entertain such a notion. \u201cThen, Felicity,\u201d the man added. He stumbled on her name, a jumble of sounds on his tongue.</p> <p>Will caught the dart of his father\u2019s eyes across the garden. And the unsettling truth of things came into focus.</p><p>\u201cYou speak well, Da. You\u2019ve been practicing. With her, I\u2019ll wager,\u201d Will said, nodding to a woman watching and waiting patiently at the edge of the lawn. She\u2019d been his father\u2019s maid for as long as he could remember.</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes narrowed. Was there no honor to be had? Who had strayed first, his father or his mother? He looked away from the woman, dispelling what was a distasteful thought. He\u2019d rather not sully his mind contemplating the deceits of bored nobility. Even if they were his own parents.</p><p>He\u2019d remember his father as the man he\u2019d been to him. Thoughtful, loving. \u201cThis is good-bye then,\u201d Will said.</p><p>\u201cA parent\u2019s lot.\u201d The older man inhaled sharply. Grief etched the corners of his eyes. \u201cTo part.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thank you, Father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe safe,\u201d he said with a nod. \u201cAnd go to her.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 36</p><p>It was a weird experience, driving with Americans. Recognizing her accent, they peppered her with questions, which she answered in as few words as possible.</p><p>It was nice to feel recognized, to be immersed once more in such benign familiarity, and she realized she\u2019d missed modern people, her people.</p><p>And yet, she also hadn\u2019t. Not really. Her mind kept going to Will. Her place, with Will.</p> <p>It was a short drive to the tourist shop. Tour buses skewed at odd angles along the edges of a sprawling, unevenly paved parking lot. Scotland\u2019s Pride Woolen Mill was huge, and Felicity fought off a vague sense of alarm at the sight.</p><p>Tourists milled in front of the store, drinking coffee in white paper cups and pulling disposable treasures from their bags to show their friends.</p><p>Felicity stared in awed silence, and then sensed the quiet hum of expectation in the car. She was supposed to get out.</p><p>\u201cJust there,\u201d the driver urged her, pointing to a bright red phone booth on the far edge of the lot.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to be okay?\u201d the woman next to her asked.</p><p>Felicity managed a nod and scooted out the door. She made herself place one foot in front of the other.</p><p>Livvie. Livvie. Livvie.</p><p>Strangely, her legs were juiced with adrenaline, and by the time she reached the booth, they were weak and quivery. She grabbed the receiver, fingers poised over the dial. Her hands were shaking, and it took her a moment to remember what to do.</p> <p>Operator.</p><p>She pressed Zero. Nothing. She jiggled the hook, pressed random buttons, a spurt of panic making her movements abrupt.</p><p>Weird, she thought distantly, as the foreign dial tone hummed to life.</p><p>The rest came to her by rote. Collect to Los Angeles, to her aunt\u2019s house.</p><p>Voice mail.</p><p>Her heart sank. Something niggled at the back of her mind, and on a hunch, Felicity tried again. Collect to her apartment in San Francisco.</p><p>Livvie picked up on the second ring.</p><p>\u201cBaby!\u201d her aunt exclaimed. And then, in a conspiratorial tone, she asked, \u201cWhere did you get off to last night? You little minx, I see you did the Tarot. Did my candle work for you? Are you calling from Mister Right\u2019s apartment?\u201d</p><p>Last night?</p><p>It took a moment for Felicity to make sense of Livvie\u2019s words. Had it only been last night?</p><p>\u201cI . . . Yes, Liv.\u201d Felicity rested her head against the glass wall of the phone booth. She\u2019d hoped her aunt\u2019s voice would be a balm, but she felt more overwhelmed than ever.</p><p>Last night. Did that mean Will was out there, trapped in some excruciatingly slow unfurling of time?</p><p>\u201cI did meet someone.\u201d Her voice hitched, and she braced herself. There would be no hiding her anguish from her aunt.</p><p>\u201cAre you crying? Did he hurt you? The bastard. What did he do to you? Did you go out to a bar? You know I hate those types you meet in bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She numbly repeated the events of the past months. \u201cI went back in time. I was in the past. In old Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Liv\u2019s voice was instantly grave. \u201cThis guy didn\u2019t give you anything, did he? I\u2019ve heard about the drugs some men slip into girls\u2019 drinks\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Livvie,\u201d she said, tears pricking through her daze. \u201cI was back in time. The man I met was wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you have . . . a dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I really was there.\u201d She scrubbed at her face, willing Livvie to just believe her. Felicity didn\u2019t have the energy to try and convince anybody of anything. \u201cIt was your candle. I made a wish on it. I asked the universe to send me a Viking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou met a Viking? How far back did you travel?\u201d Livia was silent for a moment. \u201cI told you that\u2019s a good candle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t a real Viking.\u201d Felicity wiped her eyes through a breathy, grateful laugh. Leave it to Aunt Liv to believe her immediately. \u201cI just called him that. It was the 1600s.\u201d</p><p>Fresh anguish choked her. Will. Where are you, Will Rollo? \u201cHis name is . . . was Norse.\u201d</p><p>Of all things to share, why was she telling her aunt that? Suddenly it was the little details that seemed the most profound, and the biggest ones the most inconsequential.</p><p>Livia was blessedly silent on the other end of the line. She would let Felicity tell her story in whatever order and however slowly she needed.</p><p>Breathing deeply, Felicity gathered herself, her emotions alternating between anguished and anesthetized. \u201cI was there for ages. His name is Will.\u201d She paused, fighting not to break down. \u201cWilliam Rollo. I love him. He\u2019s the only man for me. The universe sent me to him. And Livvie, he loved me too. We\u2019re . . .\u201d She swallowed hard. Breathe. \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Livia screamed. \u201cNo shit, honey! That is fantastic!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe me?\u201d Felicity asked hesitantly.</p><p>\u201cOf course I believe you. What a silly question. Now when can I meet Mister Viking Hottie?\u201d The glee in Livia\u2019s voice was torture.</p><p>\u201cI left him in the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. Just thinking about it brought a fresh stab of pain. \u201cI met a witch. She helped me get back to this time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou silly, silly girl.\u201d Liv\u2019s voice was low, and it sent goose bumps rippling across Felicity\u2019s skin. \u201cYou make a wish, get sent to your true love. You get this gift, this huge, amazing, wonderful gift from the universe, and you throw it away?\u201d</p><p>Livvie grew quiet. Only the sound of her breathing echoed over the phone. \u201cYou have to go back,\u201d she stated with finality.</p><p>Felicity was taken aback. It was the harshest her aunt had ever spoken to her. The shock of it got her tears to stop.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ll never be able to go back.\u201d She couldn\u2019t process it all, and so repeated Will\u2019s reasoning by rote. \u201cIt\u2019s a dangerous time. I was kidnapped. People thought I was a witch. His brother tried to kill us. Staying wasn\u2019t sensible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew sensible.\u201d Livia was outraged. \u201cWhen have I ever taught you to be sensible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was in danger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut not from your Viking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, no,\u201d Felicity murmured. She sighed, sad to her bones. \u201cNot my Viking. He protects me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then he\u2019ll protect you when you go back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t though. The witch said I\u2019d never be able to go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t . . . never . . . What did I teach you?\u201d Livvie\u2019s tone gentled. \u201cHoney, you need to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a maze,\u201d Felicity said hesitantly. \u201cI could try that again. But . . . it\u2019s so dangerous there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can put people on the moon, surely you can find a little modern ingenuity to protect you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t miss me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019ll miss you, you silly chit.\u201d Livia paused on the word, as if waiting for some reaction. \u201cIsn\u2019t that how they speak back then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, kind of.\u201d Felicity laughed, a giddy, tension-relieving giggle. \u201cWhat I can understand anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we have to get you back. I\u2019ll come help you. Where are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in Scotland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood heavens, of course you are.\u201d Her aunt gave a sharp sniffle, and Felicity thought how hard it would be for Liv to say good-bye to her only niece forever, and by telephone, of all things. \u201cThen you\u2019ll just need to hang up this phone, and go back to that maze, and figure out a way to get back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Liv.\u201d She shut her eyes, wishing she could give her aunt just one more hug. But Felicity knew, if she could choose only one person to have near for the rest of her life, it was Will whom she\u2019d hold close. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, dear? Now,\u201d Livvie added quickly, \u201cjust hang up the phone and figure out a way to go be with your Viking. And, Felicity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you too, dear.\u201d</p><p>Felicity was no longer trembling when she hung up the phone. The numbness had cleared, and she forced herself to hold onto hope, willing her resolve to push the sadness away.</p><p>She knew they were meant to be together. She\u2019d find a way. Figure out how to protect herself and them if it meant tromping into that silly tourist shop and getting her hands on the best reproduction claymore Scotland\u2019s Pride Woolen Mill had to offer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Because, Felicity decided, she\u2019d stay by Will\u2019s side.

His voice was hushed, even though they sat in what was the primary Royalist outpost in Croydon.</p><p>Though in the shadows, Will saw the intent clear in his friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cI see where this leads. But I fulfilled my promise. I delivered your letter. I bore tidings of Cromwell\u2019s death, returned the King\u2019s own correspondence back to you. My debt is paid, to you, to the Sealed Knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a fine job you did,\u201d Ormonde replied smoothly. \u201cI hear the King is fond of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Will was too jaded to take the bait.</p><p>\u201cIt seems Charles took a liking to you from the very first,\u201d Ormonde continued. \u201cYou met years ago, when he was first crowned at Scone Palace.\u201d</p> <p>Will gave a cynical shake of his head, remembering. \u201cHe says he\u2019s fond of Perthshire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Ormonde laughed and poured himself a finger more whisky. \u201cAnd an honor it will be for you to attend Charles when he returns once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI care naught for court. I\u2019ll not be there.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde leaned back in his chair. Crossing his arms, he studied his friend. \u201cSo morbid you are, William.\u201d Realization narrowed his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Will replied, a challenge in his voice.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a strange bird.\u201d</p> <p>He swung his cane, quick as a musket flash, touching it to Ormonde\u2019s throat. \u201cI am not in the mood, friend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy.\u201d The redheaded man leaned away from the tip of Rollo\u2019s cane. \u201cI meant nothing by it. Such a puzzle you are.\u201d Ormonde raised his glass to his lips, took a thoughtful sip. \u201cSo just summon her. You can both come to court. Lord knows it\u2019s well past time for you to take a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone . . . to a place from which she cannot return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow terribly gloomy.\u201d Ormonde leaned onto the table, steepling his fingers. \u201cFine, then. I\u2019ll bite. Why not simply go to her?\u201d</p><p>Will was silent for a moment. He decided there was no harm in telling the truth, a partial truth at least. \u201cShe\u2019s too far away. In America.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde spat the whisky from his mouth. \u201cYou jest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have you known me to jest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen have I known you to brood over a blonde?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d Will saw what his friend was about. Ormonde was trying to take his mind from the issue at hand. But he wouldn\u2019t be diverted. \u201cI\u2019ll speak no more about Felicity this night.\u201d</p><p>His friend pretended to nose his drink, but Will saw the machinations at work. \u201cSay it, Ormonde. Tell me your real purpose. Why am I sitting here with a belly full of whisky?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMassey,\u201d Ormonde conceded. \u201cHe was captured in Gloucester, by the militia. It seems he planned a wee uprising that didn\u2019t sit well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes how many arrests for the man?\u201d Will asked dismissively. \u201cHe\u2019s been taken more times than a South Bank whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is serious, Will. They plan to bring him to the Tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve pulled my last man from the Tower,\u201d Will snapped. When Ormonde didn\u2019t reply, Rollo shook his head, in disbelief of what he saw coming. \u201cSurely you have men closer to Gloucester than we are here. What of Oxford? Doesn\u2019t the Sealed Knot have men in Oxford who could rescue him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone as good as you, Will. And Massey\u2019s not in the Tower yet. He\u2019s still held in Gloucester. Child\u2019s play for a man of your talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour flattery may amuse, but it does naught to convince.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde remained deathly silent, clearly thinking his uncharacteristic gravity would be the thing to convince Will.</p><p>\u201cMassey will be fine,\u201d Rollo said. \u201cI\u2019ve not enough fingers to count the times that man has escaped imprisonment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is different.\u201d Ormonde raised his glass to drink, then put it down, thinking better of it. \u201cOur enemies have become aware of his value. Massey joined Charles in exile. Became his pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought the King preferred spaniels,\u201d Will replied dryly, referring to Charles\u2019s famous hounds.</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Ormonde laughed, unable to maintain his somber mask for long. \u201cA nasty wee rat of a creature.\u201d</p><p>Rollo ignored the jest. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the man just stay with Charles in exile?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all have work to do here. We\u2019re close, Will. So close.\u201d Shoving glasses aside, Ormonde leaned in, elbows on the table. \u201cEngland is in chaos. The army despises Richard Cromwell, they rally against him, call him Tumbledown Dick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard it was Queen Dick,\u201d Will muttered. \u201cSo, if you foment enough unrest . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe people will see the need to reinstate their king,\u201d Ormonde finished for him. \u201cTumbledown Dick\u201d\u2014Ormonde gave a sly smile\u2014\u201cis close to resigning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the army won\u2019t follow him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. And while Parliament and the army argue . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe King shall make his glorious return,\u201d Will concluded. He spun his glass around and around on the table. \u201cAnd Massey is key to this unrest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye. Massey is a key player. We have momentum, Will. There are few men I\u2019d entrust with such a mission. We need you. Just once more.\u201d</p><p>Rollo nodded somberly, thinking he\u2019d heard that line before. He studied his friend across the table. Wild red hair and the bright eyes of a boy. His friend needed him.</p><p>Will had nothing but his friends now. Felicity was never coming back. His love, gone from him forever. Without her, he had nothing left to live for.</p><p>\u201cWe need you, Will. Please, help us this one last time. And then you can go to her. Go to America.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpossible for you?\u201d Ormonde raised his brows, confounded. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Why indeed? Will tried to formulate an answer.</p><p>His father\u2019s words came to him. Go to her.</p><p>And why not try? He\u2019d likely not make it. He could die in the attempt. But death would be preferable to this grieving that choked him day and night.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as though you\u2019d be the first Scotsman to cross an ocean. Or . . .\u201d Ormonde\u2019s eyes lit. \u201cIs it that you\u2019re afraid of the sailing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not afraid of sailing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood then.\u201d The redheaded man smiled. \u201cThen you\u2019ll not be minding our plan.\u201d</p><p>Will\u2019s eyes narrowed.</p><p>\u201cTo save Massey,\u201d Ormonde clarified.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve a plan already?\u201d He canted his head in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019ve been taken.\u201d</p><p>His friend chuckled. \u201cWe sail around. To the mouth of the Severn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo boats,\u201d Will snapped. \u201cI will help you, but there will be no boats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe ease along the passage,\u201d Ormonde continued, ignoring him, \u201clike the Viking ships of old. Come, now.\u201d He shot Rollo a broad and challenging grin. \u201cYour woman did call you a Viking, did she not?\u201d</p><p>Chapter 38</p><p>The small fishing boat was cold, wet, and dark, and Will regretted that nobody was there to witness the scowl he wore openly on his face.</p><p>He despised boats.</p><p>\u201cFar cry from a Viking,\u201d he muttered. He sat on the floor of the hull, his back against the hard bench. The position did much to conceal him from view, but it did naught to soothe the ache from his bones.</p><p>The militia held Massey on a modest, twelve-oar birlinn. They\u2019d boarded and would surely launch soon, and Will wondered just what was taking Ormonde so long.</p><p>The wait was interminable, and unfortunately it was giving him way too much time to think. Already his mind drifted to the future. Will kept reminding himself that anything less than total focus on the task at hand was dangerous, but thoughts of Felicity were irresistible.</p><p>Because he was going to find her.</p><p>Now that the notion had taken root, he was a man determined. As unlikely as it seemed, he would see her again. He adjusted his sporran in the darkness, thinking of the tattered star chart he still carried there. He\u2019d return to the maze, go through himself, and he didn\u2019t care if it killed him in the effort. Because if he couldn\u2019t be with Felicity, he\u2019d rather be dead.</p><p>Will had once thought it\u2019d be the errand he ran for the Sealed Knot men that would kill him. But his father\u2019s words resonated. Go to her. And the possibility would have to keep him alive, through just one more intrigue.</p><p>He wondered where she was. Wondered if he\u2019d be successful, and where, or when, he would land. Would she have had their baby? Would he come upon her moments after she\u2019d traveled back, or would he discover Felicity as an old woman?</p><p>He cared not. He simply wanted her.</p><p>Which meant he needed to survive the night.</p><p>And, curse it, Ormonde had convinced him of the damned boat. The Gloucester militia was shorthanded, and so transported their captive to the Parliamentary soldiers by water. A rescue by boat only made sense.</p><p>Which is why he found himself bobbing like some dour, godforsaken seabird in the waters just beyond Sharpness Dock.</p><p>Ormonde was ashore, where Rollo wished he were. The plan, for his friend to create a diversion, drawing the militiamen from the water. Will would\u2019ve liked to join him on land, but the choice of roles was clear.</p><p>If they chase me, I can run. Ormonde\u2019s words echoed in his head. His friend was fleet of foot, and without the aid of a horse, Will wasn\u2019t fleet of anything.</p><p>His friend had spoken the words, then sensing the gaffe, had played it off. Said he\u2019d taken the part of a crazed monk in their last outing, and now it was Will\u2019s turn to have the more distasteful of jobs.</p><p>But Will knew. Though he could create a diversion, he was a cripple. The militia would run him to ground as surely as hounds did a fox. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And it redoubled his purpose. Although he reminded himself he needed to stay safe, as ever before he felt the need, like a primal urge in the recesses of his psyche, to prove himself.</p><p>A shot fired. He was roused and ready, a kick of nervous energy making his body hot despite the brisk breeze off the river.</p><p>It was time.</p> <p>Another loud crack sounded, followed by flashes of signal fire in the distance. Ormonde had set numerous flares, each using a variation of the delayed saltpeter and paper fuse that had worked for them before. The effect was that a dozen men approached, instead of Ormonde\u2019s one.</p><p>Men shouted from the deck of the militia birlinn. Will heard distant splashes as they left their boat to investigate. The night was clear and cold, and the sound was vivid, carrying to him over the water.</p><p>There were more shouts, this time from the dock.</p><p>The diversion was working. They were abandoning their prisoner, for the moment. Will hoped they hadn\u2019t left more than one man to guard him.</p><p>Will pulled himself up onto the bench. The chill had locked his muscles, and the movement sent shards of glass shattering from his calves up his spine. Grimacing, he flexed, inhaled deeply, and exhaled, trying to breathe out the shock of pain.</p> <p>He eased his oars into the water and began to row. Boats. He glowered. Despise them.</p><p>He pulled ashore not ten yards from the birlinn. Holding onto the side of his boat, Will clambered over, using his arms to ease into water up to his thighs. He had to let go for the final drop, and stumbled when his feet hit the soft silt of the river bottom.</p><p>A spike of rage hit him, more visceral than any icy water. He gathered himself, grateful none were there to witness the clownish lack of dignity.</p><p>He heard a distant gunshot. Ormonde, doing his job. Time for Will to do his.</p><p>Bracing himself, he waded to the birlinn. He carried an old cane, carved of oak, the strongest of Scottish wood. It was more a staff than a mere cane, with a hefty crook for a handle. It would be his ticket onboard.</p><p>He stood in the shadow of the birlinn. The smooth, low hull blocked the night\u2019s chill wind, but it also blocked the moon from his line of sight. Will waited, letting his eyes adjust, opening his ears to the activity on deck.</p> <p>It was silent, but for the sounds men made. A clearing throat, a low cough. One guard then, he estimated. Two wouldn\u2019t be able to resist talking.</p><p>He had to act fast. Until he was onboard, he\u2019d be unacceptably vulnerable to attack from above. Reaching his cane up, Will hooked the thick crook over the lip of the vessel. He dried his palms one last time on the shoulders of his coat, and climbed fist-over-fist up the length of oak.</p><p>As silently as he could, he gripped one hand then another on the lip of the birlinn. The guard caught sight of Will just as he was shimmying over.</p><p>By the time he fell hard onto the floor of the hull, the guard was on him, pistol cocked.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Will muttered. He hadn\u2019t bargained on a loaded gun. He rolled to the side. Gunpowder might trump steel, but no aim compared to a dagger\u2019s. Rollo had his sgian dubh pulled from his sock in an instant, and he lashed, slicing just above the man\u2019s heel.</p><p>Will felt as much as heard the hideous pop as the tendon snapped in two, and the man shrieked, crumpling to the ground.</p><p>It was quick work from there, Will driven to haste by the need to silence the man\u2019s hysterical cries.</p><p>\u201cVery impressive.\u201d It was Massey\u2019s voice, speaking in a hush from the rear of the vessel. There was a rustling, then he added, \u201cIf you\u2019d be so kind, I have been trussed and tethered like a sheep for the shearing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA moment,\u201d Will gritted out, pulling himself to standing. He unhooked the cane from the boat, grateful that, even after all the commotion, the thing still hung there.</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Massey exclaimed, his voice a bright little pop of sound. \u201cYou\u2019re the cripple.\u201d</p><p>Will hissed a response, cleaning his blade on the dead man\u2019s sleeve.</p><p>\u201cRollo, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou seem quite deft with that stave of yours. I\u2019ve heard of your exploits.\u201d He squinted, trying to study Will\u2019s legs in the darkness. \u201cGood on you, to make the best of your infirmities.\u201d</p><p>He shuffled toward Massey, his legs unsteady on the gently pitching deck. Boats. Will glowered. Loathe them.</p><p>\u201cThey say you\u2019ve got quite the knack for cavalry fighting,\u201d Massey continued, shaking his head in awe. \u201cBut how you manage to seat your horse. It\u2019s a marvel.\u201d</p><p>Will grunted, slicing through the man\u2019s bonds, and decided to let tense silence be his response. He needed to listen for the militiamen\u2019s return. But mostly he was finding Massey irksome.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Massey said, rubbing his freed wrists. \u201cI thank you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIst,\u201d Will hushed him with an iron grip on his shoulder. He\u2019d heard a faraway shot. \u201cThey return. We must make haste now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut of course,\u201d Massey replied in a stage whisper. \u201cIt puts me in mind of the time I escaped from the Tower. Wriggled my way up the fireplace like a damned chimney boy.\u201d Chuckling, he followed Will up and over the side of the boat.</p><p>\u201cOh Lord help us,\u201d Massey exclaimed, \u201cthis is bitter cold.\u201d He waded behind Will in an ungainly return to the fishing boat. \u201cThe only flaw in a tidy plan, I say. I hear you\u2019ve also helped a man escape from the Tower. Our Ormonde, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur Ormonde is out there\u201d\u2014Rollo nodded into the night\u2014\u201crisking his hide for you. So I\u2019ll ask again that you hold . . . your . . . tongue.\u201d His tone brooked no response.</p><p>The men clambered into the small boat. It bobbed and rocked with the weight. Finally it settled, the only sound the dull slap of water against the hull.</p><p>The coast was ragged, and the plan was to shelter in a nearby cove, keeping out of the moonlight, waiting for Ormonde to return overland. Will rowed in silence, with Massey watching him all the while, a tidy, peevish smile curving his lips.</p><p>Just when Will began to wonder where Ormonde was, there was the crack of multiple gunshots. They exploded in rapid succession\u2014too rapid to all be his friend.</p><p>Massey studied the spit of land edging the cove. \u201cWe should\u2014\u201d he began, then flicked his eyes to Will\u2019s legs. It was the briefest of glances, but it didn\u2019t go unnoticed. \u201cI should investigate,\u201d he amended. \u201cSomething\u2019s amiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Will told him through clenched teeth. If Massey thought he was incapable of saving Ormonde, let him. Will would beat him to it, doubling back by boat.</p><p>His oars were in the water before Massey had even gotten his footing on land. Will pulled hard, putting his back and aching legs into it, his face grimacing with the effort.</p><p>Jamie was dead, and yet still he felt this maddening need to prove something.</p><p>With only one man\u2019s weight on board, it was a quick return to the other side of the river. He opened his ears to the night, trying to hear beyond the heavy slap of water on the hull and the rhythmic splish of his rowing. Sensing activity on the riverbank, Will dragged his oars, slowing his boat to a stop.</p><p>A shout rose from near the dock. Then Ormonde\u2019s voice pealed above the din, theatrically loud. \u201cYou three vagabonds, you\u2019ll not stop me, even though I\u2019m bound.\u201d</p><p>Will laughed low to himself. It seemed the more perilous the situation, the more humor his friend brought to bear. But still, Ormonde\u2019s message was clear. He was trussed, captured by three men.</p><p>Will rowed closer, pulling along the far side of the militia boat. He\u2019d need to intervene before they got back onboard their birlinn. Somehow disable the three men and save Ormonde.</p><p>With naught but his cane and a dagger.</p><p>His eyes creased in thought. There wouldn\u2019t be much time. He just needed to plunge in and hope a strategy made itself clear.</p><p>Will slid back into the icy water, and it was oddly warming on his cold, wet clothing. Scowling, he trudged the shallow river, casting his mind open for a plan. The silt was thick, and it fought his every step like a bog. So damnably slow, he thought. And then the idea struck.</p><p>All men move slowly in the water.</p><p>Will had been cursing it, but really, this hateful river was the great equalizer. It mattered not that he was crippled. Every man who tried to move in shallow water would be rendered a lumbering fool.</p><p>Ducking out of sight, he waited, assessing their location. Birlinns were low and light\u2014it was what enabled them to move easily through shallow water\u2014and this one hugged close to shore. The militiamen would need to push it back into the water, with a man at the rear to guide it.</p><p>He waited, knowing what would come, and finally he heard it. Someone approached from the rear of the boat. The man cursed low to himself, about the cold and the muck, completely unaware of what lurked for him in the water.</p><p>Will sank to his knees. Though he canted his chin up, the river swayed and splashed lazily, tasting soft and muddy at his mouth. Water seeped under his collar and sucked the heat from his chest, but focus made him immune to the cold.</p><p>He eased his cane underwater, stretching it out along the river bottom.</p><p>There was splashing, another curse, and the man came into view. Will\u2019s sight was accustomed, but this man moved from moonlight to shadows, and it took him a moment to adjust.</p><p>Holding tight to the base of his cane, Will sucked in a breath and slipped beneath the surface. Blackness and silence engulfed him. Steadying himself, he dug one hand into the slime of the river bottom and extended the cane before him with the other. The water fought his every movement, and he flexed his wrist, fighting to keep the handle from skimming into the silt.</p><p>He swung, pushing the cane in a sluggish arc through the water. The crook struck the man\u2019s ankle, and Will gave a quick, sharp tug.</p><p>The man fell into the water with a shout and a splash. Will came up for air, distantly aware of the change in the other men\u2019s voices. He had but a moment to silence this one before he let out a call of alarm.</p><p>He went under again, dragging the man\u2019s foot to him. Will grabbed the man\u2019s thigh, pinned flailing hands beneath his feet. And then Rollo drowned him.</p><p>It seemed to take forever for him to thrash his last. The two of them struck an obscenely intimate pose, this stranger\u2019s body writhing beneath him, the water\u2019s resistance cho reographing a languorous dance. Will\u2019s hand tangled in the man\u2019s hair, holding him under while he tilted his own chin up for precious sips of air. Until finally, blessedly, the man flinched, and grew still. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He didn\u2019t have a moment to savor his victory. Hearing the commotion, the other men called to their fellow.</p><p>Someone was making a clumsy approach from around the back, and Will kept his eyes trained on the rear of the birlinn. Which meant he didn\u2019t sense the man behind him until he felt the knife on his throat.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we got here?\u201d a voice hissed in his ear.</p> <p>Anger, clear and lightning bright, was his only response. Felicity. He needed to live for Felicity.</p><p>Will grabbed the man\u2019s knife hand, securing it. With a growl, he slammed his elbow back, catching the man in the gut. His attacker stumbled back. Will stood, pivoted, watching in slow motion as his attacker arced his blade arm back up.</p><p>Forget the blade. Fight the man.</p><p>Will made a fist, his every ounce of desire to see Felicity a tidal wave driving his punch. His right fist slammed into the man\u2019s jaw. Immediately, Will torqued his torso, catching the man\u2019s cheek with his left. He swung up, his right fist connecting with the man\u2019s chin.</p><p>The militiaman wavered, gave an uneven shake to his head, and then collapsed into the river.</p> <p>The third and last man approached fast at Will\u2019s back, and he spun to face him, just in time to see Ormond hobbling behind, arms still trussed at his back. His friend dove for the militiaman, slamming awkwardly into him, both falling with a splash into the river.</p><p>Ormonde struggled to stand but his feet kept sliding on the viscous muck of the river bottom. His trussed hands made his body awkward, and his head slipped below the surface of the freezing water. He bobbed up, inhaled sharply, and disappeared again.</p><p>The militiaman had recovered from his fall and stalked toward Will, Ormonde ready to drown if he didn\u2019t act fast.</p><p>Rollo reached down, his frozen fingers fumbling along his calf. His dagger. He gripped it, careful to keep ahold of the wet hilt. Standing tall, he took the blade of the sgian dubh between his thumb and fingers, and threw.</p><p>The man teetered, clawing at the knife stuck in his throat, and then disappeared into the black water.</p><p>Will stumbled, leaping for his friend. Hooking his hand under Ormonde\u2019s arm, he pulled him to standing.</p> <p>\u201cThat was quite a pretty throw,\u201d Ormonde said, steadying himself. He feigned nonchalance, but Will heard the relief in his voice.</p><p>\u201cMacColla\u2019s woman showed me the trick.\u201d Will stood behind him, studying his wrists. The knots were tight, the bonds cloth, not rope.</p><p>\u201cGood Lord,\u201d Ormonde exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2019re better men than I with these . . . uncommon women of yours.\u201d</p><p>Will laughed low, picking at the knots. The water had made them tenacious, and he leaned down to tear the fabric with his teeth. \u201cI seem to always be saving your hide,\u201d he grumbled, then spat a thread from his tongue.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the hair, Will.\u201d Ormonde shook out his arms, and gestured to his bright red curls, dusky brown in the moonlight. \u201cI stand out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen how did you manage not to get shot?\u201d Rollo asked, eyeing his friend for injuries. \u201cSuch fireworks. The Gloucester militia must\u2019ve expelled their munitions stores for the next month.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStand out I may,\u201d Ormonde assured him, \u201cbut I am also quite wily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Will chuckled. \u201cOr the militiamen are blind in the dark, more like.\u201d</p> <p>There was a light splashing along the bank, and, locking eyes, both men froze. Turning in unison, they poised for attack. But it was only Massey, chest heaving with exertion, peering into the darkness of the river. \u201cOh,\u201d he said simply, seeing Ormonde standing shoulder to shoulder with Will.</p><p>Will smiled. Massey\u2019s single \u201coh\u201d spoke volumes. He turned his attention to the water, scudding his feet along the riverbed.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Ormonde slipped under to dig in the silt, coming back up with Will\u2019s muddied staff. \u201cYou took a great risk, helping us,\u201d he said, dashing the water from his face. \u201cYou have my gratitude. And it seems it is I who owe you now.\u201d</p><p>Will raised his hands in protest. \u201cOch, please man, let\u2019s just call the tally even.\u201d</p><p>The two men laughed low. \u201cNow go, friend,\u201d Ormonde said, handing Rollo his cane. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough. Go to your woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow you\u2019d have me leave?\u201d Tugging his wet collar from where it clung at his neck, Will shook his head. \u201cSoaked, cold, and disarmed? Thank you, no.\u201d He shivered, looking downriver to where the fishing boat bobbed near the dock. \u201cWe\u2019ll take that tub down to Bristol and part ways there. I might hate sailing, but it\u2019ll be the fastest way between here and Lochaber.\u201d</p><p>Ormonde laughed, clapped Will on the back, then shuddered as a sudden chill seized him. \u201cGood Lord, man,\u201d he said, a smile still on his face. \u201cLochaber? You must really love this woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d Will said simply. \u201cLove her I do.\u201d</p><p>Chapter 39</p><p>Will stood before the stone tablet, cane forgotten at his feet. He turned the star chart in his hands, careful not to tear the tattered paper. It had gotten a thorough soaking in the river, and some of the lines and dots had bled into formless clouds of gray ink.</p><p>He placed it over the stone. Rotated it, studying the map from a different angle.</p><p>He needed to be certain. He\u2019d have only one chance to go to Felicity, and he hoped he knew what he was doing.</p><p>\u201cThe hubris of youth!\u201d a voice cackled, and even before he spun to see, he knew he\u2019d find the old witch Gormshuil there.</p><p>\u201cTook you longer than I\u2019d thought,\u201d she said. She walked toward him, her approach along the path almost leisurely. The morning sun cut through the trees at a sharp angle, turning her gray braid into a white rope hanging over her shoulder. Though long, the wiry wisps didn\u2019t do much to conceal her pale scalp.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a stubborn one, William Rollo.\u201d Gormshuil stopped, standing in front of him, sucking thoughtfully at her teeth. She smelled of earth and cherry-sweet smoke. \u201cWho knows where you\u2019d end up without my help?\u201d she scolded, snatching the chart from his hands.</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done?\u201d She muttered and shook her head, studying the chart. Her features danced a medley of expressions: grunted annoyance, to anxious confusion, to squawks of impish humor.</p><p>\u201cI kept it as safely as I could,\u201d Will said, his tone uncharacteristically hesitant.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s pray you\u2019re able to mind your own self better than you did this wee scrap.\u201d Gormshuil\u2019s eyes were the white blue of a hazy sky, and they hardened on him. \u201cDo you know what it is you attempt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye, of course\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIst, boy, and listen. Do you know where it is you go? Your woman\u2019s world is not your world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFelicity is my world,\u201d he answered quickly and surely.</p><p>\u201cI pray you\u2019re correct.\u201d Gormshuil chewed thoughtfully at her lip. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll ever be able to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to return,\u201d he said, and he meant it.</p><p>He thought on his family. Jamie was dead, and his mother might as well be. Will would mourn his father, but if the attentions of one attractive, older maid were any indication, the man was recovering just fine.</p><p>And though Will would miss his friends, he\u2019d not miss how their obsessions had a way of drawing him in. He\u2019d given his all to help MacColla, to help Graham. He loved those men like brothers, and would do it all again, but they lived on, with their own concerns and loves. While Will was left always alone, in the wake of the lives of others.</p><p>And then there was Ormonde. Will gave a fond and knowing chuckle. God love him, but the man was like the tides, pulling all under and down, to the neglect of anyone else\u2019s desires but his own.</p><p>He considered his country. Oliver Cromwell was dead, and his son Richard ousted from power. Charles II was well on his way to being restored as king.</p><p>No, he thought. He knew exactly what world he was leaving. \u201cI know what I do,\u201d he told the woman. \u201cAnd I ask that you help me.\u201d</p><p>She studied him silently, then with a sly smile and a brisk nod, Gormshuil returned the star chart to the granite tablet.</p><p>She licked her thumb, smudging at some of the lines on the page. \u201cYou\u2019ll do like so,\u201d she told him. Her finger was wrinkled and thin, the pad of her fingertip flattened with age, but it moved fluidly over the paper, gracefully outlining shapes on the chart. \u201cTrace thus.\u201d</p><p>Goose bumps pebbled his skin with the sensation that he glimpsed some deeper geometry, some overreaching structure to the universe.</p><p>\u201cClear your mind,\u201d she snapped, and Will wondered if the witch had read his thoughts. \u201cReason not, Will Rollo. Keep your thoughts a tranquil pool. Felicity the only ripple on its surface.\u201d</p><p>Dozens of questions gnawed at the edges of his brain, and he fought them all. Inner calm had always been, for him, hard-won. He wanted to ask just one more thing, but before he had a moment to seize on a single question, Gormshuil gave a sharp sniff and rolled her eyes back in her head.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she hissed. \u201cOff with you, now.\u201d She wheezed a long exhale. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>The witch\u2019s hands gripped his upper arms, turning him to face the tablet. Though an old woman, her grip was strong, and those long, bony fingers cut into him like talons.</p><p>\u201cFor her, time has slowed,\u201d she intoned. \u201cBut it\u2019s not stopped. She, a lone candle among millions. If you want to find the woman you seek, you must go. Now.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t considered he might travel forward in time, only to not find her. Panic seized him. He gripped the stone, anchoring the paper to the tablet with one hand.</p><p>The other flitted over the chart in rapid movements that felt almost automatic, remembered somehow. His arms were numb where Gormshuil gripped him, and he wondered distantly if she weren\u2019t transmitting some secret magic through her touch.</p><p>The buzzing began at his feet, a warmth at the soles, as if he were being permanently rift from the earth. It intensified, crackled up his legs, molten heat locking his limbs.</p><p>Is this what Felicity had felt? God, no. Had he made her do this, made her feel such pain? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>His legs, they were on fire now, and blooming into a pain beyond comprehension. Such pain, as if he were dissolving, a man carved of wax, melting to the ground.</p><p>Always, it came down to his accursed legs. With that thought, an alarm sounded. The witch said he must be a calm pool, and he tried desperately to blank his mind. But his thoughts kept returning to his legs.</p><p>His damned cane. He\u2019d need his cane. But Will was already being sucked under. Immobilized now, but for a finger still moving over the paper, pure instinct driving his gestures.</p> <p>Black seeped in at the edges of his vision, the world closing and tunneling until there was only the paper before him.</p><p>Light and sound screeched in his head. Blinding, numbing, deafening sensation. His head whirling, his body a raw nerve, unable to break free.</p><p>And then Will\u2019s body slammed to the earth.</p><p>It took him a moment to realize the cool moss beneath his hands. To realize the stone cutting into his cheek.</p><p>Felicity. Where was she?</p> <p>Had he traveled? Was she there?</p><p>Will raised his head, darting his eyes, making sense of his dim surroundings. Ghastly walls of leaves and berries rose all around. It was belladonna, bearing deadly Devil\u2019s Cherries, their color the rich and repugnant purple of a vicious bruise.</p><p>The labyrinth. He was in the maze. It closed around him, like some malignant prison hemming him in. Keeping him from Felicity.</p><p>Felicity.</p><p>He must find her. One among millions, the witch had said. His mind blanked, all thought dumping from his brain but for the single image of Felicity. She was the only thing that existed, the only thing that mattered.</p><p>Frantic, Will scrambled forward. He scrambled on hands and knees, scrambled into a lope, and then into a run. He raced through the maze, his body careering off the soft and obscene give of the labyrinth walls. He moved like a drunken man, a possessed man. Frantic only to find Felicity.</p> <p>He vaulted from the opening of the maze, and ran. Breath filled his lungs, the air suddenly fresher, clearer. His legs pulsed and his chest swelled, and he wondered at the strange sensations.</p><p>Will skidded to a halt. His legs.</p><p>He doubled over, hands on thighs, panting for breath.</p><p>His legs, they were straight and strong.</p><p>The maze had transformed him. A man whole once more. And all because of Felicity.</p><p>There was a strange sound from faraway, rising over the hill as surely as pipes on the eve of battle.</p><p>He sprang back into a run. Felicity had been right. They were destined to be together. Steely determination drove him hard, his arms and legs pumping.</p><p>He crested the hill to see a street winding at the base of the valley. And there were vehicles there, moving so fast along, so foreign and so unfathomable. He realized they must be the car that Felicity had told him about\u2014a carriage of steel requiring no horse.</p> <p>He grinned broadly, and a laugh erupted from deep in his soul. What a place of miracles this was.</p><p>Will bounded down the hill and stopped on the side of the road, panting and marveling. He thought he must look a crazed man.</p><p>A car slowed, then stopped beside him. Will knew he should be wary, but the open smile of its driver put him at his ease.</p><p>\u201cAre you from the Renaissance Faire too?\u201d the man asked.</p><p>Will leaned closer, trying to make sense of his accent. He shrugged his confusion.</p><p>A glass pane at the rear of the car rolled down. \u201cHey,\u201d a woman said, leaning out. \u201cWhere\u2019d you guys find those clothes? They\u2019re awesome. So realistic.\u201d</p><p>Will looked blankly. What to say? His Felicity, a lone candle among millions. He wondered if these people might be able to help. \u201cHave you seen\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe woman in lavender?\u201d she finished for him.</p><p>\u201cThe blonde,\u201d the driver stated. \u201cAre you missing a pretty blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Will tried to temper his sudden joy in front of these strangers. \u201cI\u2019m looking for that woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHop in, dude.\u201d</p><p>The door was barely closed behind him when the driver took off. Will barked out a laugh despite himself, to feel his body jolt so in space. It was exhilarating, this speeding carriage.</p><p>\u201cMan, your friend was in some rough shape.\u201d It was the person seated next to the driver who spoke.</p><p>\u201cIs Felicity safe?\u201d Will asked quickly, fear hardening his voice to steel.</p><p>\u201cEasy, cowboy.\u201d The driver chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little on the emotional side, though,\u201d the woman said. Will had settled himself next to her, crushing himself as much as possible along the door so as not to press up against her so intimately. \u201cDid you have a fight or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it,\u201d the driver said.</p><p>\u201cOhhhh,\u201d another said, \u201cnow I get it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seemed pretty bummed out,\u201d the woman added.</p><p>\u201cMan,\u201d the other chimed in, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere she is.\u201d The driver pointed to a figure walking along the side of the road. It was a woman, in a lavender gown, scrubbing at her face. \u201cThat\u2019s your friend, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood Lord, is she carrying a sword?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out, dude, looks like she bought a claymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut,\u201d Will gritted. He jiggled the door handle. \u201cI must get out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhoa.\u201d The driver screeched to a halt. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta wait til I stop.\u201d</p><p>Will spilled from the car. He shouted for her, ran to her. His Felicity. He couldn\u2019t reach her soon enough.</p><p>She saw him, and momentary bewilderment flickered into joy.</p><p>He pumped his legs harder, elation swelling in his chest. His body slammed into hers, and he swept her up at once into an embrace. Will swung her around and around, laughing and kissing her all over.</p><p>\u201cHow . . . ?\u201d She studied him, tears marking thin paths down her dirty cheeks. \u201cAnd your legs,\u201d she shouted, realizing suddenly.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t be without you,\u201d he told her. His eyes consumed her, so lovely, so right, in her soiled and tattered dress. For the first time in his life, Will knew perfect joy. \u201cAnd so I came to be with you. If you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yes, Will.\u201d She stood on her toes, whispering her words on his lips. \u201cI\u2019ll have you.\u201d</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>The dew was cool on Felicity\u2019s bare feet. The grass sounded a tiny squeak every time Will spun her before him. His hand was strong and sure at her waist, the other warm and enveloping hers.</p><p>Her heart filled to watch him, to watch his smile. These days, a smile lit Will\u2019s features more often than not. He was so handsome in the moonlight, laughing low, twirling her, lifting her.</p><p>Her Viking loved to dance.</p><p>And they danced now under the stars. Their favorite thing, stealing this time alone together. The children asleep, their only music the rustle and squeak of dewy grass and the faraway bleat of their neighbor\u2019s sheep.</p><p>They\u2019d chosen to stay in Scotland, in Perthshire, in a country cottage on land that rolled gently to the banks of the River Tay. Duncrub Castle was only a memory now, but they still loved to sneak away when they could, for a quick tumble along their Roman road.</p><p>Felicity loved Scotland, where never before had she felt so truly, deeply at home. At first, she\u2019d worried what Livia would think.</p><p>But that was before she\u2019d realized her aunt had long harbored fantasies of finding herself some brawny, gray-bearded blacksmith. And though Livvie had yet to encounter just the right candidate, she seemed to be enjoying the hunt, making her way from isle to isle in the Hebrides.</p><p>She thought she heard something. Putting her hand on Will\u2019s shoulder, she stilled him. They locked eyes. Speaking wasn\u2019t necessary; he\u2019d know what she was doing.</p><p>Their youngest was just shy of a year old, and Felicity was still getting used to the fact that she no longer needed to be on call all night, through the night.</p><p>They paused, and while she listened, Will kissed her. His mouth was warm and soft on her neck, her jaw, her ear. \u201cBaby Olivia sleeps yet, love,\u201d he whispered to her. He unbuttoned her sweater, roving his hand under her shirt. His skin was hot on her cool breast. \u201cBut I find myself feeling very awake at present,\u201d Will murmured, nipping at her ear.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019m so nervous.\u201d She tangled her fingers in his hair, and it was the only invitation he needed.</p><p>\u201cNot too nervous,\u201d Will told her, and he reached a hand around her back. Clutching her bottom, he pulled her closer to him.</p><p>He was hard for her, and she giggled, flush with pleasure. He seemed always ready for her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect with them,\u201d he said, referring to their three sleeping kids. \u201cThe greatest mother I could imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom didn\u2019t exactly set a stellar example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo indeed,\u201d he said with a low laugh. His kisses stilled. He pulled from her, tracing her hair from her cheek, tucking it behind her ear. \u201cI wonder what came of them.\u201d</p><p>Felicity knew he referred to his parents. Though folk like the Campbells and MacDonalds lit the pages of history books like major constellations, there was not so much about Clan Rollo. They\u2019d tried researching, but hadn\u2019t been able to find much beyond dates of birth and death, and some of Will\u2019s own exploits on the battlefield.</p><p>They\u2019d found all kinds of stuff about Ewen Cameron, though. Some of the poems written for him had made Felicity roll her eyes. But mostly they made her smile with the memory of him. She was happy he\u2019d lived a good, long life.</p><p>\u201cDo you think Ewen did it?\u201d she asked abruptly. \u201cWent back and saved Robert, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d he mused, \u201cthe labyrinth is certainly there, as we both well know.\u201d Resting his elbows on her shoulders, he stretched his arms around her, hands clasped thoughtfully. \u201cAye, lass. If I know the laird Cameron, I think he\u2019d have found a way to save his foster brother. The man did live til the age of ninety, so whatever he did, he managed to survive it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd with well over a dozen kids too.\u201d Felicity shook her head, exaggerated dismay on her face. \u201cGod, Lily . . . That poor woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They shared a laugh, and she watched her husband, watched as those chiseled features softened, his hazel eyes looking to someplace faraway.</p><p>\u201cDo you miss it?\u201d she asked quietly. \u201cOld Scotland, I mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOch,\u201d he smiled. His eyes scanned around them, taking in the world they\u2019d built together. A cottage, land, trees. She traveled twice a week into Perth, where she was studying to be a veterinarian. They had a paddock full of horses, and Will had a rich life as a horse breeder, and, she believed, the best kids\u2019 riding instructor in the Highlands. \u201cI love our life,\u201d he told her.</p> <p>Cupping her chin, he added, \u201cYou forget what gifts your modern age gives. Here, where the water runs, but the blood does not. So, no, lass.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t miss it one wee bit.\u201d</p><p>He spun her suddenly, and she yelped in surprise. Will reeled her to him, dipped her, and stole a quick kiss.</p><p>He pulled Felicity back up, keeping her tucked close. \u201cMy life is where you are. You, my delight. And besides, love,\u201d he said, giving Felicity a loving little swat to her rump. \u201cI find you to be a very bonny dancer.\u201d</p><p>They laughed, and kissed, and Will and Felicity walked arm in arm back inside, to peek at the kids one last time for the night. </p> </body></html>"]
