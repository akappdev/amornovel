The ringmaster seldom came to sit around the bonfire with his carnivalleros at the end of a long day\u2019s setup, and it had been ages since there had been any eligible fellow worth glancing at across the flames. Ever since Marco Taresque had stalked out of the moors, he\u2019d been the topic of many a whispered conversation. And many a feverish dream in the secret cocoon of a caravan wagon.</p><p>Marco sprawled against a velvet settee that was one broken leg away from firewood. The knife thrower took up more space than most men, and the other carnivalleros naturally shifted away to accommodate the dangerous aura that surrounded him. The fire lit his dark hair; the ever-present shadow of a beard highlighted exotically high cheekbones. He used kohl as the Bludmen did, which only served to make his violet eyes smolder more ferociously, reflecting the smoke and the cherry-hot flames.</p><p>Directly opposite him, contortionist Demi Ward leaned back against a barrel and sighed with longing. She was half in love with Marco after only a few days, but she resented the hell out of those violet eyes. The romance books she\u2019d read at home on Earth before an accident brought her to Sang had always featured supernaturally beautiful heroines with eyes in unbelievable shades that real life failed to produce. She\u2019d resented the characters then, and now she resented the devilishly hot guy who refused to acknowledge her, or any of the carnival girls. As Demi pretended not to watch, Emerlie edged closer and closer to Marco, trying to draw him into her chatter. He merely rolled his eyes and pulled deeper on his hot cider, ignoring the tightrope walker and resident busybody\u2014which was no mean task.</p> <p>In her fantasies, Demi stood and tossed her dark hair, which was much longer and straighter and silkier than it was in real life. She walked directly through the fire like some half-daimon sorceress instead of just another Bludwoman, and one who looked deceptively young enough to be the daggerman\u2019s daughter. In the dream, Marco\u2019s eyes finally settled on her face, his breath catching. He stopped turning the dagger over and over in his gloved hands and stood, facing her. The world stopped. The fire ceased to dance. The other carnivalleros disappeared. It was just them, Demi and Marco, drawn to each other like bludbunnies to a scream. He held out his arms, and she walked into them, and he kissed her until her knees melted and the world dissolved in starlight. And then he threw her onto the back of a bludmare and galloped away into the night, on to bigger adventures.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d Demi\u2019s best friend and contortionist partner, Cherie, elbowed her in the ribs, and the fantasy blurred into smoke. \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the wagon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to stay.\u201d</p><p>Cherie leaned close. \u201cStop mooning over him. Marco\u2019s too old for you. And he\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>Demi groaned and leaned her head back on Cherie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know. But he\u2019s so undeniably hot.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re just infatuated with the new shiny.\u201d Cherie stood, shaking out curly blond hair peppered with straw, bits of silk, and dust from a day spent sinking posts, shining automatons, and raising the patchwork tent under which they now sat, protected by the circled wagons of Criminy\u2019s Clockwork Caravan. \u201cHe\u2019ll still be here tomorrow, you know.\u201d</p><p>Demi squinted through the smoke. Marco\u2019s face was lost in the flame. His expression was unreadable and far away, and his mouth turned down, just a little. It only made her want to kiss him more and taste a passion she hadn\u2019t known in her world or in Sang, where the only guys in the caravan were freaks, loners, or boring. She\u2019d had her eye on one of the new daimon boys, the older son of the dancing mistress, Mademoiselle Caprice. He was tall and Franchian and had an air of savoir faire that appealed to her. But once Marco arrived, Demi developed a one-track mind.</p><p>When Cherie rose and held out her hand, Demi took it and stood as gracefully as she could. Despite a day of drudgery and manual labor, she\u2019d been careful to dress in clothes that showed off her lithe figure and accentuated the parts that boys liked to ogle. Every day, she was thankful that Criminy Stain had found her, bleeding on the moor, and brought her to the least boring life in Sang\u2014and the one with the least frumpy clothes. Her artfully ripped lace leggings, high boots, short skirt, and corset did a good job of bringing in the customers on show nights, and now she felt the flicker of pride as male eyes snapped up around the fire to watch her stretch. Just because she wasn\u2019t interested in the caravan guys didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t attracted to her\u2014or that she didn\u2019t like the attention. Even the lizard boy perked up, just a little, as she drew in a deep breath and pushed out her chest with a yawn.</p><p>Cherie swatted her and snorted. \u201cStop showing off. He\u2019s not even looking. Come on, before I fall over.\u201d</p><p>With a last, resigned look at the daydreaming knife thrower who didn\u2019t know she existed, Demi followed Cherie to the clockwork bird guarding the carnivalleros\u2019 tent from the outside world. It was colder beyond the gap, and they slipped past and hurried to their wagon, already shivering.</p><p>\u201cWait. What\u2019s that?\u201d</p> <p>Cherie had stopped, staring out onto the moon-dappled moor, and Demi was so deep in daydreams that she nearly ran into her smaller friend. Forced to look up, she saw something on the hill above where absolutely nothing but a rogue bludbunny should have been.</p><p>\u201cA conveyance? Out here? But we\u2019re miles from Scarborough.\u201d</p><p>A shadow fell over them, and Demi spun, hands automatically curling into claws. When she saw the stark figure standing guard behind them, focused on the mysterious vehicle, she relaxed.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, Crim?\u201d</p><p>The ringmaster\u2019s gray eyes went as black as the night sky, his nostrils flared to scent the intruder. He bared his teeth and turned it into a reassuring smile.</p><p>\u201cHop into your wagon, my dears. I\u2019ll have it sorted out in a jiff.\u201d</p><p>Demi enjoyed a closer relationship with Criminy Stain than anyone in the caravan other than Tish, considering he had saved Demi\u2019s life and all but adopted her. Still, she knew as well as anyone that when he was in this mood, half animal and half devil, it was best to nod and lock the door. The ringmaster would do anything to protect his caravan, and in the heat of the moment, details over who was dying weren\u2019t always sorted out comfortably.</p><p>Inside the stuffy wagon, she put a hand against the solid wood wall and wondered what Criminy would find after he\u2019d stalked across the moor to the curious vehicle waiting in the moonlight.</p> <p>\u201cI wish these frigging boxes had windows,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cAll the fun stuff happens outside.\u201d</p><p>.2.</p><p>When the clockwork dog took up its mechanical barking, Jacinda Harville snapped her pocket watch closed and smiled to herself. She\u2019d heard Criminy Stain was keen as a blade, that between his magic and his madness, nothing got past the wily Bludman. She\u2019d also heard he hated journalists above all else. Time to see which other rumors were true about the famous ringmaster.</p><p>\u201cHush, Brutus.\u201d</p><p>The metal beast quieted immediately. Jacinda slipped on her favorite bracelet and adjusted her hat in the mirror firmly affixed to the wall of her conveyance. The live-in vehicle was modeled on a bus-tank but only large enough to support a Murphy bed, a small desk, and her traveling trunk. Her leather pith helmet sat smartly on red hair the color of a bludfox\u2019s pelt, and the matching leather corset below had been made by the same artisan to straddle the line between protection and beauty. She had worn both on purpose, knowing that it would be well in character for Master Stain to send his two-headed Bludman, a wolf man, or even a venomous lizard boy to frighten her away.</p><p>The knock was sharp, and she counted to ten before walking to the door. In spite of the cool, confident nerves she\u2019d cultivated over a series of death-defying adventures, when she saw who glared at her from the other side of the peephole, she was slightly intimidated.</p><p>So he\u2019d come himself. Interesting.</p><p>She opened the door and looked down. \u201cGood evening, Master Stain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho the devil are you?\u201d He breathed in deeply, and his lip lifted in a snarl. \u201cBesides a dead reporter.\u201d</p><p>She tipped her helmet and forced a smile. \u201cJacinda Harville, adventuress and journalist, at your service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you wish to serve me, pet, best turn this monstrosity around and rumble back to town. I don\u2019t allow the press through the turnstiles.\u201d He looked up at her, his top hat slipping back to show wicked eyes and a smirk. \u201cAnd if they do slip through, they don\u2019t make it back out again. I mount typewriters on the wall instead of hunting trophies.\u201d</p><p>Good thing she kept her beloved Underwood tucked away in a trunk. Infamous ringmaster Criminy Stain loomed over me like a dark angel, she thought, fingers twitching for cold metal keys, like an incubus drawn in ink on stark white paper. She\u2019d type it up later. The Bludman was a force of nature, she\u2019d give him that. Her late husband had been a rather dashing and leonine blond, but she\u2019d gotten a taste for the dusky and exotic since his tragic passing in Egypt. Criminy Stain was wickedly handsome, but he made her edgy, and she tapped her hip in a distinct pattern, relaxing just a bit when Brutus settled on smoothly oiled haunches, its sensitive nose pressed against her leg.</p><p>\u201cI think we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement, Mr. Stain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs do I, Miss Harville. You turn around and leave, and I won\u2019t kill you. It works out rather nicely for both of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. I\u2019m a widow, and you\u2019ll find I don\u2019t give up that easily.\u201d She knocked a leather-gloved fist against her helmet. \u201cHardheaded does not begin to cover it.\u201d</p><p>The corner of Criminy\u2019s mouth twitched, and he looked past Jacinda\u2019s unusual outfit of canvas, leather, and fur and into the small space beyond her. Masks of wood and bone covered the walls, along with bits of scroll and tablet and a few crumbling relics on ledges. A great striped bludzebra pelt covered much of the wood floor, and the fierce but startled face of a bludgazelle glared from above the steering wheel. Her bed was folded into the wall to reveal her worktable, and just to the side was a desk crammed with papers and . . . </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBooks. Why am I constantly afflicted with uppity women and their blasted books?\u201d The look he gave her was weary but just the tiniest bit curious, and she struggled not to crow in triumph. \u201cWhat is it you want, Mrs. Harville?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething only you can give me, Master Stain.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled darkly. \u201cBad news, pet. I\u2019ve a wife. And she\u2019s a fortune-teller. And as she hasn\u2019t killed me in my sleep, that means it\u2019s not in the cards for us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBit full of yourself, aren\u2019t you? But I expected nothing less.\u201d She looked him up and down with no attempt to hide her appreciation. \u201cFortunately, that\u2019s not what I want.\u201d His eyebrows rose in lieu of repeating his question. \u201cI\u2019m here for a story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless the headline is \u2018Famous Reporter\u2019s Bones Found Near Scarborough,\u2019 I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but you can. I\u2019ve built my career writing about the most hidden, exciting, mysterious places in Sang. And now I want to write about something the city folk can\u2019t begin to fathom: life in a caravan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re funny, I\u2019ll give you that. Good night.\u201d</p><p>Criminy tipped his hat and turned to go, shaking his head in amusement. As a younger woman, Jacinda would have panicked. Instead, she said, \u201cBrutus, record.\u201d Clearing her throat, she spoke loudly and carefully. \u201cWorld-renowned caravan ringmaster Criminy Stain was the most handsome man I\u2019d ever met, and also the most dangerous. Luckily, he underestimated me, and that\u2019s how I came to be pointing a salt-dipped arrow at his back.\u201d</p> <p>Criminy froze, and she struggled not to laugh.</p><p>\u201cI understand that you lie for a living, love, but you tread on dangerous ground,\u201d he said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cTurn around and call me a liar again.\u201d</p><p>Criminy\u2019s hands made fists at his sides, and he spun smoothly to face her, his eyes shining in the night like an animal\u2019s. She waggled the little crossbow just a little, letting the warm light of the conveyance twinkle against the salt clinging to the arrow\u2019s barbed tip.</p><p>\u201cHow the hell did you manage that?\u201d He seemed more amused than angry, which was what she\u2019d banked on.</p><p>\u201cI keep it hanging beside the door in case unsavory characters come knocking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd have they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey have. And I have the scars to prove it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet here you are, on my caravan\u2019s doorstep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how dedicated I am to my calling, Master Stain. I intend to write a book about your caravan. I wish to interview your carnivalleros, provided they\u2019re willing to share their stories with me. Tales, illustrations, and a very fine engraving of the dashing gent in charge. Do I have your attention?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cDepends on what my cut of the profits would be.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even have to think. \u201cSeventy/thirty, and you pay for printing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixty/forty, but you must be terribly flattering toward the rakish gent who runs the show. I get full editorial privilege. And I expect color illustrations. And gilt on the cover, which will be red.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d already decided as such, so I\u2019m agreeable.\u201d</p> <p>She stuck out her ungloved hand, which he shook firmly.</p><p>\u201cTo an exciting partnership,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd to my rules, which you\u2019ll follow to the letter.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda withdrew her hand and cocked the crossbow. \u201cI\u2019m not overly fond of rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider them nonnegotiable. First, you submit to being glanced upon by my wife, Lady Letitia, and agree to leave immediately if she demands it. No one gains access to the internal workings of the caravan until she\u2019s touched them and determined they mean us no harm.\u201d She nodded, and he stepped up into the doorway of her wagon. Despite the crossbow between them, it felt far too close. \u201cI protect my own, Mrs. Harville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecond, the carnivalleros participate of their own free will; I won\u2019t order them or even ask them. Under no circumstances may you badger them. Several of my folk have reason to hide, and I have offered them refuge and anonymity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m deadly serious. I can see that you\u2019re a woman accustomed to getting her way, but if they refuse to talk to you, it\u2019s over. You turn this conveyance around and get back to buggering mummies, or whatever you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may be persistent, Master Stain, but I\u2019m not cruel. We all have our secrets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we do. And three, you pay admission every night and don\u2019t cause me a bit of trouble.\u201d His eyes went a shade darker. \u201cOr else.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t hide her grin at that. \u201cVery generous. I agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat quickly? Blast. My reputation\u2019s going to go to hell.\u201d</p><p>She finally lowered her crossbow. \u201cI promise to write you up as a fearsome, bloodthirsty scoundrel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the pointy teeth, lass.\u201d</p><p>When he grinned like that, it didn\u2019t seem like a difficult task at all.</p><p>.3.</p><p>The next morning, Jacinda stepped down from the ringmaster\u2019s wagon, pulling her glove back on and feeling very peculiar indeed. Her notebook and pen were under her arm, the large metal dog waiting for her at the bottom of the stairs. After Lady Letitia\u2019s strange behavior, she was more intrigued than ever to finally walk among the carnivalleros.</p><p>The fortune-teller\u2019s manners and accent had been strange, and touching the bare skin of someone who wasn\u2019t a lover had been a puzzling experience.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d was all the glancer had said at first.</p><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>Letitia\u2019s other hand clasped warmly around Jacinda\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. About your husband.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda straightened her shoulders and struggled to hold in that one damnable tear that threatened to wiggle out every time she talked about Liam. \u201cI am, too.\u201d</p><p>Letitia leaned in closer, patting Jacinda\u2019s hand excitedly. \u201cIt\u2019s going to get better\u2014I promise you. You\u2019re going to have some amazing adventures.\u201d An impish smile told Jacinda that the glancer was keeping secrets, but knowing her future made her queasy, so she didn\u2019t use her uncanny ability to winkle things out of loose lips. She\u2019d never placed much faith in fortune-tellers, but if Letitia\u2019s blessing was necessary for her admission to the caravan, she was willing to undergo the glancer\u2019s scrutiny. And pity.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean I can write the book?\u201d</p><p>Letitia grinned. \u201cOf course. Don\u2019t worry about Criminy and his threats. He\u2019s just a puppy, really.\u201d</p><p>One eyebrow shot up as Jacinda thought about the ringmaster\u2019s fangs. \u201cA puppy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wolf puppy, maybe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I owe you my thanks, Lady Letitia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, honey. Call me Tish. And promise me you\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</p><p>The older woman\u2019s nervous concern made Jacinda really study her. Fine lines webbed Tish\u2019s eyes, and strands of white threaded her dark hair. The woman\u2019s energy, strangely accented voice, and entire mien were of a younger woman, and yet she had to be at least ten years older than Jacinda. The outside did not match the inside. Something odd was going on here.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s your story, Tish?\u201d</p><p>A coy smile told Jacinda she was about to get the brush-off. \u201cLet\u2019s just say my story didn\u2019t really start until I got to the caravan. Besides, fortune-tellers are always more intriguing when they\u2019re mysterious. Now, forget about little old me and go talk to the carnivalleros.\u201d</p><p>With the glancer\u2019s blessing, Jacinda was free to explore the caravan, yet she didn\u2019t know where to start. Each lacquered wagon was painted a different color, most of them with beautifully calligraphed words proclaiming the talents of the denizens within. But no one was walking around or practicing in the weak morning sunlight, so Jacinda tapped her hip and began to explore the perimeter of the circle of boxcars with the mechanical dog clicking at her heels. It didn\u2019t take long before she realized where all the action was: inside the circle, beyond the large clockwork animals that stood in the spaces between cars. A soaring patchwork tent, ragged but beautiful and open on the sides, was the source of the laughter and burbling voices that carried over the wind. It reminded her of the desert caravans she\u2019d once traveled with at Liam\u2019s side. She froze, seeing beyond the clockwork kangaroo to a past she couldn\u2019t forget and couldn\u2019t escape, to words shouted in anger and a heavy thump and the sudden silence, after.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t find your way in, eh?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda turned to the aggressively dressed girl who had materialized by her side. Black-rimmed eyes hooded with glittering blue shadow glared back at her. In her younger days, the journalist would have felt the sting of otherness, of knowing that she didn\u2019t belong among the brightly painted circus folk. Now the difference between her own serviceable adventuring costume and the girl\u2019s lurid pink and green getup only made Jacinda feel more powerful. She didn\u2019t need paint and gimmicks to get what she needed.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m quite new to all this.\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s smile curled like a cat\u2019s mouth barely containing feathers. \u201cAlways glad to help the new girls. I\u2019m Emerlie, by the by. Tightrope walker. I\u2019ll show you the way, shall I?\u201d She took off, and Jacinda had no choice but to follow, her eyes dancing with spots from the vibrant acid green of Emerlie\u2019s tutu.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re the tightrope girl?\u201d</p><p>The tiny hat bobbed. \u201cTightrope, unicycle, juggling, bit of this and that. Been with the caravan forever. What\u2019s your act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, nothing so impressive. I\u2019m a writer. A journalist, to be exact.\u201d</p><p>Emerlie dropped back, her expression avid. \u201cYou here to talk to Marco, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco?\u201d</p><p>The girl\u2019s shoulders shivered in excitement. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? The new knife thrower\u2014Marco Taresque? He\u2019s a murderer.\u201d But she didn\u2019t look disappointed by the fact. Far from it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA murderer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what they say down south. Story goes, him and his lovely young assistant disappeared one night, and all they found the next morning was a wagon splattered in blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d Jacinda opened her notebook and began scribbling. \u201cDo you know Mr. Taresque personally?\u201d</p> <p>Emerlie gave a sly wink over her shoulder. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk much. But he knows how to stick a dagger, I\u2019ll give him that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that supposed to be a euphemism?\u201d</p><p>The girl spun around. \u201cA what, now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that you\u2019ve bedded this murderous knife thrower?\u201d Jacinda held her pen poised over the page expectantly.</p><p>Emerlie sneered. \u201cYou calling me a liar?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not calling you anything. But I have a reputation for printing the truth, not wishful thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not wishful!\u201d</p><p>Jacinda sighed and closed her notebook. \u201cThe only thing the knife thrower\u2019s ever stuck you with was a mouthful of disappointment.\u201d The look of outrage on Emerlie\u2019s face was enough to make Jacinda giggle behind her glove.</p><p>\u201cFind him yourself, then, cow!\u201d</p><p>The girl flounced away, her tiny top hat bobbing over pin-curled blond hair, leaving Jacinda alone before a clockwork bird in the space between two wagons. Jacinda coughed down the rest of her giggles. Even if Emerlie was the reticule of gossip in the caravan, gently flattering half-truths out of the little ninny would have been immensely annoying, compared with going directly to the source. And now she had a lead on the sort of juicy story every journalist dreamed of nailing.</p><p>Jacinda glanced up at the awkwardly dancing bird. As she ducked to move past it and into the tented space beyond, the machine\u2019s head shot around, blocking her way. Shoving it did nothing to discourage it, and no matter which way she moved, it wouldn\u2019t let her pass. When a small syringe appeared in its beak, she decided she\u2019d had enough and removed a small metal device from the bag at her belt.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough out of you.\u201d</p><p>Holding the gadget as close to the bird as she dared, she pushed a red button, and a blue spark arced to the bird\u2019s copper body and raced over its surface like a wave devouring sand. The thing went still, a slender curl of smoke rising from its eye. Tucking the disruptor back into her bag and rucking up her skirt, she slid under the bird\u2019s now-still neck and entered the circle beyond the wagons. Useful things, disruptors.</p><p>Laughter, murmurs, and the occasional thunk carried from under the patchwork tent. Not wanting to encroach on what was clearly a personal space, Jacinda sent Brutus back to her wagon and kept to the circle of weak sunlight just beyond the tent\u2019s shadow, skirting the wagons as she navigated around the spaces set up for practice or work. The strong man nodded to her warily, a two-headed Bludman leered at her, and the lizard boy raised an appreciative eye from where he snoozed in a lone sunbeam that fell through a rip in the tent. She nodded politely but didn\u2019t stop to begin her interviews. She was too avid to reach the source of the repetitive thunking noise. All she knew about this Marco Taresque was that he was a knife thrower, a possible murderer, and someone with whom Emerlie desperately wanted to be physically linked, and that combination intrigued her in more ways than one.</p><p>When she walked up, the subject of her inquiry was pulling a bouquet of knives from a scarred wooden target painted in rings of red and white. She had a moment to study him before he noticed her, and she realized immediately why Emerlie had been so very keen. Marco Taresque was a damn fine specimen of a man, dark and angular and as sharp as his knives, with thick, wavy hair that trailed down his back like brambles, making him seem half wild. She couldn\u2019t help staring, willing him to face her while still enjoying the elegant but powerful movement of his shoulders and arms as he unconsciously went through his routine.</p><p>Like most men, he wore a white shirt that had seen better days, but the sleeves were more fitted, while the collar was uncharacteristically loose, especially when so many Bludmen were near to hand. He wasn\u2019t wearing a coat, which was expected for such an unusually warm day. But his midnight-blue waistcoat was of a cut she\u2019d never seen before, thick and tight, with boning similar to that of a lady\u2019s corset and lacing up the back. It sharpened the lines of an already sharp man, setting off the wideness of his shoulders and the way his shirt stretched across well-muscled arms. As he pulled the knives from the wood, he slid them one by one into invisible slots in his vest, where their black handles disappeared against the velvety fabric. She counted twelve, six on each side, before the target was cleared. The daggerman spun around, saw her watching, and froze.</p><p>Feeling the full strength of his violet eyes, she froze, too. For a moment, they stood that way, and Jacinda was wildly aware that he could have reached down and stuck her with every knife in his vest before she could spin and run away. She felt like the target, like a solid thing, painted and waiting to be pierced. Despite a leather corset designed to repel attacks, she had never felt so vulnerable, not in seven years of traveling the most removed, dangerous cities of Sang. She imagined a black dagger flipping end over end, as quick as a bird, to strike her directly in the heart with a wooden thunk.</p><p>And then he smiled, a quick, wry thing that was gone instantly, replaced by a dark scowl.</p><p>\u201cI should have known you\u2019d find me.\u201d</p> <p>His voice was gravelly but musical, with an accent at once unfamiliar and enticing, and his eyes settled on the notebook and pen held, limp, in her hands. She dipped her head in acknowledgment but not acquiescence.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve heard of me, then, Mr. Taresque?\u201d</p><p>Looking down, he ran a hand through his hair. He walked toward her, every step deliberate, boots crunching on dead grass already trampled. As he passed close enough for her to feel the air stir from his sleeve, he said, \u201cNo. But I know your type. You\u2019re not the first. You\u2019ll not be the last.\u201d</p><p>He kept walking, and as she\u2019d promised to obey Criminy\u2019s rules, she had no choice but to watch him go. His snug-fitting trousers had fine pinstripes that disappeared into high black boots. The man bristled with so many knives she wasn\u2019t sure how he sat without cutting himself to ribbons.</p><p>In her years first as a student, then as a journalist\u2019s assistant, then, most recently, as a solitary adventurer, she\u2019d met thousands of men. Heroes, villains, brigands, jackals, shamans, monsters, soldiers, weak-chinned milksops, and even uncivilized madmen. But the strange push and pull of Marco Taresque was a first for her. Aloof but magnetic. Wild but carefully contained. Dangerous to a fault but in no way overtly threatening. Dark but oh so appealing. As soon as her feet caught up with her heart, she was following at his heels, pen and notebook in hand, hoping Criminy didn\u2019t have spies lurking about.</p><p>\u201cMr. Taresque, would you be willing to tell me your story?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn. Didn\u2019t break stride. Said nothing.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just you, of course. I didn\u2019t come here to find you personally. I\u2019m writing a book on the caravan. With Criminy Stain\u2019s blessing.\u201d</p><p>Again, no response. Just steady, confident, angry steps, faster and faster so that she was almost jogging to keep up. She was starting to feel desperate and resorted to a journalist\u2019s last resort: accusation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re dangerous. That there was blood everywhere.\u201d</p><p>He had reached the clockwork bird she\u2019d recently deactivated. A begoggled artificer and a woman in a frumpy coat were fussing with the wires in an open compartment, arguing over the cause of the automaton\u2019s malfunction as he held a screwdriver and she held a book. Without a word, Marco took two fast steps, planted a boot on the man\u2019s back, and catapulted himself over the bird.</p><p>\u201cDammit, man! These are fragile instruments,\u201d the artificer growled, but Marco ignored him and kept walking.</p><p>\u201cOh, Henry. That\u2019s your best vest,\u201d the woman said, fussing at the bootprint.</p><p>Jacinda tried to get around the pair and the collection of tools, books, and wires arrayed on the ground, but there was no clear path, unless she went over, which even she wouldn\u2019t risk in such voluminous skirts.</p><p>\u201cAre you hiding something, Marco Taresque?\u201d she shouted at his rapidly disappearing back.</p><p>He stopped and turned, hands on hips bristling with knives. Did she imagine the smile tugging at his lips?</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d he shouted back.</p><p>And then he was gone.</p><p>.4.</p><p>\u201cSo what do you know about Marco Taresque?\u201d</p><p>The three girls around the table giggled behind their hands, telling Jacinda exactly what she wanted to know: he\u2019d had absolutely nothing to do with any of them.</p><p>\u201cHe just showed up one night,\u201d the bearded girl breathed, woolly cheeks in her gloved hands. \u201cMaterialized out of the smoke like he was part of the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything was smoky that night, Abi. He just happened to walk out at exactly the right moment.\u201d Demi rolled her eyes. \u201cAnd honestly, he showed up that afternoon. Marched across the moor like anyone else who\u2019s vaguely suicidal. You just didn\u2019t see him because you were asleep in your wagon. It was far less dramatic then.\u201d But the girl\u2019s eyes went misty anyway, betraying her feelings about the mysterious stranger.</p><p>\u201cMaster Crim said he\u2019s dangerous, and that\u2019s good enough for me.\u201d Cherie shook her blond curls, her mouth in a prim line. \u201cHonestly, he looks like a wastrel. Like he did what the papers say he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he was in the papers?\u201d Jacinda asked.</p><p>Abi leaned close, her beard wagging excitedly and dipping into her oatmeal. \u201cMaster Stain don\u2019t like us to read about the cities, but the audience drops a paper every now and then. There was a drawing, and there\u2019s a price on his head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDown south, they call him the Deadly Daggerman,\u201d Cherie whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see that story. Do you have it still?\u201d</p><p>Demi blushed. \u201cCrim found us with it and took it away. Said it was just another case of a money-grubbing journalist making a sensation out of hearsay and ruining a man\u2019s life in the process.\u201d She raised her eyebrows and stared at Jacinda as if daring her to continue the line of questioning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacinda knew when an interview was headed downhill. She would find a better time to talk to the girls about their own stories when they weren\u2019t on the offensive\u2014or packed together in a giggling gaggle.</p><p>With a warm, professional smile, she stood, tucking her notebook under her arm without a single word written on the page. This interview had been doomed from the start, but she had learned more than she anticipated. Now she knew why Marco wouldn\u2019t talk to her. And she also knew that he hadn\u2019t been breaking hearts among the young and easily breakable. He went up a notch in her estimation, considering how very easily he could have preyed upon these moon-eyed girls. It shouldn\u2019t have mattered, as she was simply a journalist gathering facts. And yet . . . it mattered.</p><p>\u201cThank you all so very much for your time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut what do you know about Marco?\u201d Demi asked, her eyes almost pleading. \u201cDid he really do it?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda reached out to pat the contortionist on the shoulder, forgetting for a moment that the girl was bludded and seeing only a tender young soul filled with longing, as she herself had once been. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m going to find out, dear,\u201d she said.</p><p>She moved across the dining wagon to a booth shared by the bookish couple she recognized from her earlier encounter with the clockwork bird. They sat hip-to-hip on the same side, their heads together as they shared a joke. She cleared her throat, and they both looked up, suddenly going silent.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I asked you a few questions?\u201d She held out her notebook and pen with an inviting smile. Without a word, the man slid out of the booth, tipped his hat farther over his eyes, and disappeared.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive Mr. Murdoch,\u201d the lady said, moving over as if trying to absorb whatever warmth he\u2019d left behind. \u201cHe\u2019s very shy of strangers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m as strange as they come.\u201d Jacinda picked the woman\u2019s looks apart with professional interest, noting her pretty face, owlish costume, shabby gloves, and guarded copper-colored eyes. \u201cAre you part of the circus?\u201d</p><p>The woman chuckled softly to herself. \u201cI don\u2019t look much like a caravan act, do I? Not at all bright and flashy. I run the butterfly circus, you see. And Mr. Murdoch is the caravan\u2019s artificer, who invented my equipment and all the clockworks. I\u2019m Imogen, by the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJacinda Harville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re a reporter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA journalist, yes. I\u2019m here to write a book about the caravan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that sounds fascinating. The city folk will just gobble it up, won\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>Jacinda grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping. Are you from the city, then?\u201d</p><p>Imogen blushed and looked down. \u201cYes. London. And it was just as dreary as the penny dreadfuls make it sound. I\u2019d be glad to show you the clever intricacies of my butterfly circus sometime, if that will help your story.\u201d</p><p>A flutter of color caught Jacinda\u2019s eye, and she noticed a small orange butterfly slowly flapping dotted wings from its perch on Imogen\u2019s hat. Her breath caught.</p><p>\u201cIs that . . . real?\u201d</p><p>Imogen chuckled. \u201cOf course not. Everyone knows butterflies are extinct. Mr. Murdoch is very talented, you know, with his machines.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, as she knew how to mask her emotions\u2014unlike Imogen, who couldn\u2019t lie worth a damn. The keen-eyed journalist would have bet everything in her conveyance that the butterfly on her companion\u2019s head was indeed real, but judging by the way Imogen was wringing her hands and glancing nervously at Jacinda\u2019s notebook, she would have to change course soon or lose the meek woman\u2019s trust forever.</p><p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m really curious about is the new knife thrower. Do you know anything about him?\u201d</p><p>Imogen sucked air through her teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of an enigma, that one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave you seen the papers?\u201d</p><p>With a nod, Imogen reached to the bench beside her skirt and produced a stack of ragged newspapers, carefully folded. She shuffled through them before sliding yellowed paper across the table. \u201cI get the one from London, although it arrives terribly late. I believe the Wanted poster is in this edition, although there\u2019s very little actual fact. Marco and his assistant apparently disappeared on the same night, leaving behind only a blood-spattered wagon. He surfaced here, in the caravan. But no one has seen her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you spoken to him?\u201d Jacinda\u2019s pen tapped against the paper.</p><p>Across the booth, Imogen ducked her head and shrugged into herself. \u201cI spend most of my time with Mr. Murdoch. Or reading. I\u2019ve seen Marco throw his knives. But I know almost nothing of the man himself.\u201d She looked around the wagon, taking in two dozen people of all shapes, sizes, and species. \u201cI suppose I should be more concerned about having a suspected murderer among us. But in my short time here, I\u2019ve come to understand that Criminy and Letitia wouldn\u2019t let anyone in who would bring us to harm.\u201d She looked closer at Jacinda, perking up with curiosity. \u201cHas she glanced on you, perchance?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda\u2019s skin prickled, remembering the warm, dry feel of Letitia\u2019s palm against hers, the fingers gripping tightly as a little ripple of something passed between them.</p><p>Before she could speak, Imogen chuckled softly and said, \u201cOf course she has, or else they\u2019d never have allowed you in to question us. I\u2019m sorry we can\u2019t be of more help, Hen\u2014I mean, Mr. Murdoch and me. Good luck.\u201d</p><p>As Imogen swept her dishes off the table and left, Jacinda looked down at the creased old paper and unfolded it. It was the London Gazette, one of her favorites. She\u2019d made a habit of picking it up in major cities around the world during her travels. Skimming went against her nature, but she would save her in-depth reading for another time. Instead, she flipped through until she found the Wanted poster, only a quarter of a page and clearly done by a sensationalist hack. The image looked nothing like Marco Taresque as she\u2019d seen him.</p><p>The drawing showed a devil of a man with a cleaver in his hand, dripping black blood.</p><p>WANTED: THE DEADLY DAGGERMAN</p><p>In conjunction with the underhanded disappearance of one Petra Incanta on 22 February 1906, being a petite woman with dark hair and the knife thrower\u2019s ill-fated assistant. Deliver to London Coppers dead or alive. Reward ten silvers.</p><p>And that was all. It didn\u2019t even mention his name, which explained how he could perform here without being dragged off by a lynch mob. She pored over the periodical, but there was no reporting, no quotes from family, friends, or Coppers. Just the poster, sure to induce fear in the easily frightened children of London. Jacinda folded the paper and snorted. Idiots, all of them, and sloppy reporting to boot.</p><p>Journalism was more than work to her\u2014it was a passion, a calling, one that her husband had died pursuing by her side. Although she was outgoing and accustomed to learning quickly the customs of a given society, she missed having someone insightful with whom to discuss the day\u2019s findings over a cup of tea. All the people she had met so far at Criminy Stain\u2019s caravan had been kind and welcoming, if not actually helpful. But she missed Liam more than ever, the way they had worked so intuitively as a team to unearth secrets and treasures and stories. He would have loved the caravan.</p><p>Try as she might, there were some things that men would only tell other men, and her late husband had been adept at sidling in with a cigar or a bottle of brandy. But he was gone now, and she was alone, and she wasn\u2019t giving up, even if this was one story that was going to have to come straight from the bludmare\u2019s mouth, as they said.</p><p>Standing, she took a last look around the dining car. Marco wasn\u2019t here, which meant the story wasn\u2019t here. Stuffing an apple into her pocket, she nodded to herself and made for the door and the weak sunshine beyond. These days, the next story was the only thing that kept her going.</p><p>This time, when she approached the clockwork bird, she found Mr. Murdoch blocking her path. She could barely see his eyes through the thick goggles that hid the rest of his face.</p><p>He cocked his head at her as if she\u2019d forgotten her shirt. \u201cLose your mutt?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYour clockworks appear to be the only ones that don\u2019t require recharging. Brutus sleeps more than I do.\u201d She pulled out her disruptor, and he held up a hand covered in a thick leather glove.</p><p>\u201cPut that device back where it goes, madam. I can\u2019t have you mucking about, destroying my work.\u201d</p><p>She waved the disruptor under his nose, her finger hovering over the red button. \u201cHow do I get by, then?\u201d</p><p>He harrumphed. \u201cI suppose we\u2019re stuck with you for a while, at least until you finish your blasted tell-all book. Look, they\u2019re guards. You see? Keep the rabble out of our private space. You want in, you walk up to this clockwork\u2014this bird only\u2014and say, \u2018posthumous orangutan grotesque.\u2019 He\u2019ll freeze for a minute, and you can squeeze through. Do you understand, or has your career choice corrupted and shriveled your brain?\u201d</p><p>At his three peculiar words, the bird stopped its strange dance, freezing in place. Jacinda leaned closer, listening for the telltale ticking of machinery. It was faint, and Mr. Murdoch smirked at her, waiting for the questions she was sure to ask and he was sure to dodge. Instead, she struggled to hold her tongue until the bird began to gyrate again.</p><p>\u201cPosthumous orangutan grotesque,\u201d she said clearly, and it froze. She nodded and ducked around its tail. \u201cThank you, Mr. Murdoch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to interrogate me?\u201d he asked. \u201cI was fully prepared to evade you.\u201d</p><p>She looked him up and down from behind the mechanical bird, taking in the hat, the goggles, the layers of clothes, the leather mask that hid much of his face. \u201cI know a closed book when I see one.\u201d</p><p>Leaving Mr. Murdoch chuckling in her wake, she trod the same path she\u2019d taken yesterday toward the heavy thunking of blades in wood. There was a steady, powerful laziness to the sound. Not rushed. Not unsure. Perfectly measured, every time. Along the way, she greeted the carnivalleros she\u2019d met by name, introduced herself to others. She shook hands, laughed at jokes, and avowed she couldn\u2019t wait to learn everyone\u2019s story. And it was true, which made them like her even more. She\u2019d begun her career as Liam\u2019s assistant on a desert caravan and was proud of her knack for fitting in with new cultures and people, no matter how bizarre they might at first appear. It seemed the clockwork caravan would also soon be under her spell. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As a little girl, she\u2019d been a voracious reader and daydreamer. But she\u2019d never guessed what would happen at age eighteen when she enrolled in a cultural anthropology course, much against her parents\u2019 wishes. On the first day, she\u2019d fallen in love\u2014with Egypt and the dashing young professor. After she had seduced Liam with her body and her brain, he had seduced her with the wide, wild world beyond academia. He never would have thought to study something as geographically available as caravans in Sangland. And yet Jacinda was fascinated by the people here, curious about all their histories.</p><p>But the enigma came first. And the enigma in question was watching her walk toward him as if trying to decide whether to run away or swallow her whole.</p><p>The daggerman\u2019s posture was almost smug, the curve of his back suggesting a sleek jungle cat, asleep with one eye open. His dark hair was pulled back today, except for the bits that fluttered around his face. A beard shaded his cheeks and dusted his upper lip, enhancing the cut of his jaw. At first, Jacinda thought he used kohl on his eyes as the Bludmen did, but as she stepped closer and stopped about ten feet away, she thought it must be dark eyelashes. But then\u2014no, it was both, the bastard. He blinked, long and slow, his arm never stopping as it flicked knives lazily at a spinning target. A human shape was painted over the red and white bull\u2019s-eye, which spun with the nearly silent ticking she\u2019d come to associate with Mr. Murdoch\u2019s clockwork machinery.</p> <p>\u201cSee something you like?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe surface isn\u2019t what intrigues me, Mr. Taresque. It\u2019s the truth I\u2019m looking for.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and flicked his eyes at the bull\u2019s-eye. Faster than Jacinda could follow, a knife thunked into the target, right in the middle of the outlined figure. Right where its heart would be.</p><p>\u201cThe truth. You want the truth?\u201d She nodded, and he jerked his chin toward the knife sunk in the wood. \u201cSome things are better left buried, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda knew well enough when someone was trying to scare her. With a toss of her hair, she marched to the target, her boots crunching over the broken blades of grass. Wrapping both of her gloved hands around the knife\u2019s handle, she managed to tug it out as neatly as possible, considering the blasted thing was rotating slowly with the wood. She held it up, testing its weight, her fingers carefully pinching the leaf-shaped blade.</p> <p>Marco grinned at her, hands on his hips. \u201cDon\u2019t cut yourself, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda snorted, raised her arm, and let the knife fly in a black and silver blur to quiver in the ground a few inches from Marco\u2019s boot. He didn\u2019t move. \u201cEven I know throwing knives aren\u2019t sharp, Mr. Taresque.\u201d</p><p>His grin widened in appreciation and surprise, and Jacinda\u2019s cheeks flushed with sudden heat. \u201cThe tips are sharp enough. If you threw with any spirit, you could strike me down from there.\u201d</p><p>Tension rose as they considered each other. Jacinda felt rooted to the earth and yet as if she might fly free at any moment. His violet eyes went a shade darker, which didn\u2019t seem possible. Finally, Jacinda winked, knowing he would go on staring forever, trying to impose his will on her. Let him try. She knew his type well enough. She walked to him, then yanked the knife from the dirt and wiped it on the folds of her brown skirt. Holding it out, she risked looking at his face again, suspecting he would think the dimple in her cheek silly and frivolous. Not that she cared.</p><p>\u201cYou say I could strike you down, and yet you didn\u2019t budge.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI never budge.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I do everything with spirit. I want an interview.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d He took the knife from her glove, his kid-swathed fingertips dragging over the crease of her palm\u2014the love line, as an old gypsy woman had once told her. Jacinda shivered in spite of herself.</p><p>Her palm burning, she pulled out her notebook and pen. \u201cI have influence. The truth could exonerate you. Surely you\u2019d like the world to know you\u2019re innocent?\u201d</p><p>Marco stepped closer as he slipped the knife back into a loop on his vest with a whisper of metal on cloth, a strangely intimate sound. From far away, he\u2019d seemed a normal-sized man, but up close, the tips of his blades winking inches away from her body, he seemed large and solid and made of rocks and vines and wildness barely held together by his indigo waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cWhat do I care about the world so long as I know the truth myself?\u201d he said, barely loudly enough for her to hear. It seemed impossible, that his voice could be nothing more than a breath, a warm breeze on her jaw.</p><p>She swallowed hard. \u201cYou would have freedom. Your good name.\u201d</p><p>His glove cupped her cheek, his thumb stroking hot over her jaw as she struggled to hold still. \u201cI always have freedom. I don\u2019t need a good name to know who I am. You, on the other hand . . .\u201d</p><p>He released her, but she was frozen in place, chin up where he\u2019d last held it. He walked around her, a few simple steps, but it was as if the polarity of the planet reversed and she was suddenly the moon, something cold and foreign and powerful in itself. Something caught in uncontrollable orbit.</p> <p>\u201cI know who I am, thank you very much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re not free.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, her mouth open in surprise. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>His eyes were oddly soulful, gazing into hers, belying a peculiar sort of sorrow she didn\u2019t care to contemplate. \u201cYou think you\u2019re free. But something holds you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not toy with me, Mr. Taresque. I\u2019m a widow, not one of those giddy girls by the fire, mooning at you. I know what you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I did it, then?\u201d His voice changed as his teeth clenched, and he circled away from her, their connection broken. He pulled the knives from the target one by one, so quickly and roughly that even though she knew there was no danger, she expected to see blood. Jacinda could feel that she was losing him, would have to reel him back in with sure hands.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re hiding something. And I want you to tell me what it is. And why.\u201d</p><p>He spun, and his fine eyes narrowed at her, taking in her figure, her face. If those attributes would weigh in her favor, she would use them, and gladly. She let one corner of her mouth play up, slow and sly, her eyelashes lowering just a little, just enough.</p><p>But instead of softening, he stiffened, cocking his head. \u201cIs this a game to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA game?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you as brash as you pretend to be? Or is it part of your little act?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy act?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re echoing, sweetness. Might want to work on that.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda took a deep breath, trying to focus. He unnerved her, as much as she hated to admit it. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of you, Mr. Taresque. The truth is not a game. And I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m brash. Simply that I don\u2019t base my decisions on fear.\u201d</p><p>That earned her a wide, toothy smile that made her nervous. And rightly so, considering what happened next. \u201cSo prove it.\u201d</p><p>And he reached into his vest and held out a playing card.</p><p>.5.</p><p>Jacinda took the card from between his fingers, careful not to touch his black suede glove.</p><p>\u201cThe Queen of Hearts? Really?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally.\u201d</p><p>She held it up to the light. It was an old card, the image in sepia-tinged tones that might very well have been painted by hand. \u201cThere\u2019s a knife slash in this card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s add another one.\u201d</p><p>Her body stiffened before her mind caught up. \u201cExactly what are you proposing, Mr. Taresque?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA dare.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cElucidate.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cLet\u2019s make it simple. I strap you to the target. You hold this card out, as close to or as far from your body as you wish. I\u2019ll throw one knife. If I hit the card, you go back to wherever you came from and leave me the hell alone. If I miss . . .\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if I kill you, I suppose I\u2019m on the run again.\u201d</p><p>She shivered but swatted him with her notebook to cover the true frisson of fear. \u201cIf you miss?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll answer one question with complete honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly one?\u201d</p><p>That grin again. \u201cI have fifty-one more cards, if you find you like the game. Should be enough for your book.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda turned the card over in her hands. One knife-wide slice through it. Not a drop of blood, as carefully as she looked, and the paper was old and unwaxed, so she would have noticed. Her eyes flicked to the target, where a single gash of knife-struck wood marred the black-painted figure from his throw just moments ago. The bull\u2019s-eye still spun lazily, a constellation of scars outlining a body she could almost imagine as her own, if naked and corseted, the legs delicately spread and the arms up in what almost seemed triumph. Or surrender.</p><p>She shook her head. That was ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I walk away right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll never know the truth.\u201d</p><p>She walked past him in a huff, the card held in one hand, the edges of the paper cutting into her fingers.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to walk away, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>And that\u2019s when she stopped.</p><p>\u201cConsider it carefully. This is your last chance.\u201d</p><p>His voice was mocking, taunting, luring. And beneath all the posturing, the cruelty, the danger, there was something else. Pleading? So low, so deep, that even he surely didn\u2019t know it was there.</p><p>Could it be possible that he wanted to tell her the truth as much as she wanted to hear it? Even if it was a confession of guilt? But surely if Lady Letitia had seen her dying in a pool of blood in the carnival, she wouldn\u2019t have allowed Jacinda to stay. That had to mean it was safe.</p><p>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, her ribs creaking against her corset as she focused her will. With a cold, slow smile, she held out the playing card between two fingers. \u201cThen let\u2019s play, Mr. Taresque.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the second part of the deal. First, you have to call me Marco.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhere do you want me, Marco?\u201d</p><p>A lesser man would have betrayed himself at such bold speech. Swallowed hard, gasped, at least allowed his eyes to widen the tiniest bit. But not Marco Taresque. Not the Deadly Daggerman. No, he just raised one eyebrow and grinned. \u201cRight over the silhouette, sweetness. I\u2019ll strap you in as gently as I can.\u201d</p><p>That was the first time she noticed the narrow platforms at the base of each painted leg and the leather straps at each wrist. Fear trickled down her veins, starting with numbness in her hands and feet and a chill, heavy feeling that settled deep in her belly. But she wouldn\u2019t show Marco that. He was watching her so very carefully for any sign of weakness, for the smallest betrayal of her determination. After disparaging the flibbertigibbets of the caravan, she wouldn\u2019t give him the satisfaction of thinking her a coward or a lesser woman.</p> <p>After a second\u2019s consideration, she took the card in her left hand and held out her right. \u201cA warrior in the forests of Almanica once dared me to something similar involving a tomahawk,\u201d she murmured, low and dulcet.</p><p>\u201cAnd you took the dare?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did. I got a great story out of it. And a tattoo in a very personal area.\u201d</p><p>He ignored her baiting and took her hand to help her step up onto the platform, her skirts crushed between her stocking-clad calves and the painted wood. The abrupt change in her posture forced her chest out, knocking it into his arm. He absorbed the blow with a gratified grunt but neglected to make any comment. His fingers skimmed along her left arm and trailed over her bracelet before firmly holding her wrist against the wood and strapping it down gently. She understood then that he wasn\u2019t a man who allowed second chances, that the die was cast, and herself along with it. And she was the kind of woman who preferred it that way, so she tested the leather and nodded her approval.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you wear no gloves?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you wish to be eaten?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been to the far corners of the globe, and it was never the sight of my bare flesh that earned me a brush with the stewpot. It was usually ignorance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps you simply overestimate a creature\u2019s self-control.\u201d</p><p>He stroked the crease down the palm of her trapped hand, and she couldn\u2019t stop herself from shivering.</p><p>\u201cBut what of the card?\u201d Her right arm seemed oddly heavy and useless, the card suddenly flimsy in her grasp.</p><p>His fingers grazed her shoulder, indicating worn, curved prongs of wood a scant inch above her jacket. \u201cThese notches will keep you in place. Hold the card as close as you wish.\u201d</p><p>As Marco\u2019s hands caught the ankles of her boots, the breath rushed out of her with a whoosh, and she already felt as if she were spinning. What was she supposed to do with the card again? Did she want him to hit it\u2014or did she want him to miss? The terms of the deal had been . . . but no. It was forgotten. No heat passed from his gloves to the thick leather of her boots, sewn thick to ward off the biting creatures of the jungle, but still the warmth crept up her legs as he fastened the leather straps with almost impersonal strength. She\u2019d had men since Liam, sure. But none of them had left her breathless, not before or after the act. And here she was, quivering like a girl under the knife-wielding hands of a supposed murderer.</p> <p>What in heaven had she gotten herself into? She was just here to write a book. It should have been safe. But, suddenly, it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Marco knelt at her feet, and she looked down on gleaming hair the color of oiled teak.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He looked up, grinning, showing a handful of steel pins. \u201cTo hold down your skirts,\u201d Marco said, his voice barely a murmur. Jacinda felt the flush travel all the way up her body, lingering in places like puddled rainwater. \u201cKeep things decent.\u201d</p><p>At the word \u201cdecent,\u201d her head jerked up, and she scanned the area around the tent. She had forgotten that anyone else existed. The lizard boy was draped over his pillows nearby, but otherwise, everyone was engrossed in his or her own work. That was good. She felt silly, strapped spread-eagle to the target, and that was before he stepped back and gave her a better look at the long line of knives snaking down his body as naturally as stripes on a bludzebra.</p><p>Being pinned down was dangerous enough before she remembered the reason for it.</p><p>\u201cDo you ever miss, Marco?\u201d</p><p>Saying his name was like blowing a kiss, the way it made her purse her lips together. Maybe that was why she\u2019d resisted saying it for so long. Now that she was strapped onto the round target, her boots snug against the platforms, he had to look up to meet her eyes, and what she saw there made her breathless. Amused satisfaction, complete confidence, and an indolent, languid slowness that spoke of long patience. He liked her exactly where she was. The way his gaze raked her with open admiration told her plainly that she was but an object, and the way her breath sped up told her plainly that she didn\u2019t mind being objectified.</p> <p>\u201cIs that your question? Because you\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019ve taken my shot if you want an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not my question.\u201d The words tumbled out too fast, and she struggled to maintain her professional calm. She\u2019d stood up to kings and shamans and shambling corpses. Why was this man disarming her so totally?</p><p>Oh, right. The knives. And the leather straps. Not to mention the curling lips. And the eyelashes. She couldn\u2019t forget those.</p><p>He winked as if he knew exactly what she was thinking and moved behind the target. Turning her head, she found only wood. The leather creaked as she unconsciously tested her bonds, feeling vulnerable now that she couldn\u2019t see him.</p><p>\u201cGet ready.\u201d</p><p>So smoothly she barely heard it, the motor started, and the bull\u2019s-eye began to turn, her body with it. Jacinda had been hung upside down by booby traps and even suspended once by vines over a cauldron of boiling water, but she\u2019d never felt this strange, controlled, secure, mechanical movement. It was so very oddly smooth, perfectly balanced. He\u2019d strapped her down so carefully that as she turned fully upside down, the only real change in her person was a cascading of red curls into her eyes and the cold kiss of metal as her pocket watch fell out of her jacket. With a swift intimacy, as soon as she was right-side up again, Marco dropped it down the throat of her blouse and tightly between her chest and her corset\u2014an intimate gesture, but a necessary one, if she wished to keep the metal from smacking her in the face with each revolution. Her breath caught at the intimacy of the touch. Not until he had finished tucking her hair behind her ear did she remember to breathe again, and by then, she was upside down.</p><p>\u201cThe card, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>Oh. She had forgotten utterly that one arm was free, clutching the card against her chest in a white-knuckled grip. With a shaking hand, she pinched just the corner of the card, holding it against the painted wood as far from her face as she could allow without looking like a complete coward.</p><p>Marco nodded and walked to the exact place she\u2019d found him standing earlier, marked by a muddy, trampled spot in the grass. The lazy smile had never left him, but it deepened as he regarded her, reaching his eyes with pointed heat. His hand almost caressed the knives down his side, and he didn\u2019t look down as he drew one from its loop and weighed it in his palm, turning it this way and that. Jacinda watched, right-side up and upside down and sideways, unsure whether the spinning was all in her head or in the clockwork revolutions of the bull\u2019s-eye.</p><p>\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>She held her breath and willed the card to stop twitching with the beating of her heart. Marco narrowed his eyes, kissed the dagger with solemn reverence, and waited until she was perfectly right-side up. Then his arm flicked forward in a blur of motion.</p><p>She closed her eyes at the heavy thunk. She didn\u2019t feel pain or impact. But perhaps one wouldn\u2019t feel a knife, especially if the strike were fatal? She\u2019d never been stabbed before.</p><p>\u201cYou can look now. Cheater.\u201d</p><p>The amusement in his voice told her she was unhurt, because surely even a man as contained and unflappable as Marco Taresque, a man who could walk away from a blood-spattered murder scene, wouldn\u2019t stand in the open air of a public place and watch her scream after using that tone.</p><p>It took great control to unscrew her eyelids and look down.</p><p>The knife was stuck in the painted wood, right where the card had been.</p><p>The card lay on the ground, hearts up.</p><p>As she stared at the queen\u2019s smug smile, the machine stopped, and he stepped out from behind it, suddenly very close. She was turned sideways, suspended only by the leather straps on one wrist and around her waist. Marco knelt and held the card out to show her.</p><p>\u201cI hit the place where the card would have been. Hit it perfectly. But you, my dear, dropped the card.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, coyly, feeling strangely free with her feet off the ground. \u201cOops.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not good enough, sweetness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hit the card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made that impossible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never promised to make it easy for you.\u201d</p><p>He twirled the card in front of her face for a moment before placing it against the wood. He let go, and she thought for sure it would flutter against her cheek. Instead, it fell barely an inch before he\u2019d whipped out a blade and plunged it into the wood beside her eye with a heavy thunk, so close that she could count her eyelashes reflected in the shining steel. She gasped.</p><p>And while her mouth was open, he bent and covered it with his.</p><p>.6.</p><p>Jacinda was sideways, and Marco was standing, and their mouths met at opposite angles with exquisite dissymmetry. With no warning, his tongue slid between her lips from one corner up to the other, plunging into her depths to taste her with an intimacy as unexpected as it was right. She moaned as he pulled away, taking the sound with him and leaving her with the lingering ache for the unfelt rasp of his jaw against her cheek or perhaps somewhere even more secret.</p><p>\u201cWhere did you\u2014\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows rose as he crossed his arms. \u201cOne question.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBugger. Then I take it back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t. Where did I . . . ?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda tried to make her mind work, but it was as useless as harnessing mad bludmares to a moving wagon. He\u2019d unnerved her, and she\u2019d been on the verge of asking him where he\u2019d learned to kiss like that. At least he\u2019d stopped her in time. What a waste that would have been. And knowing what she did so far of his capricious nature, who knew what she would have to do to win the next answer?</p> <p>\u201cWhere did you hide the body?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head sadly, disappointed with her. \u201cOh, sweetness. There was no body.\u201d With a melodramatic sigh, he slipped his hands into his pockets and turned away.</p><p>\u201cMarco?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t stop walking.</p><p>\u201cMarco! Are you going to unbind me?\u201d</p> <p>He paused but didn\u2019t look back. \u201cNo more questions.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth, first to demand and then to beg that he undo the straps and let her down from his blasted bull\u2019s-eye. The knife was uncomfortably close to her skin, and without his presence to distract her, she was beginning to feel the cut of the leather against the softness of her flesh. But she could tell he wouldn\u2019t respond to demands, and she wasn\u2019t willing to lower herself to pleading\u2014yet. And so she closed her mouth and ran her tongue along her top lip, remembering with a shiver the exotic feeling of being kissed in an entirely new way. Damn, but the man was a mystery.</p><p>It took a few moments for her to realize her fingertips were to her lips, and it took a few moments more for her to chuckle at herself and reach to unbuckle the strap around her other wrist. She\u2019d utterly forgotten that one hand was free all along. With both hands on the buckle at her waist, she stopped. She couldn\u2019t reach her ankles until she undid this buckle, but as soon as the tension was gone, she would flop right over. Silly as it was, injury was possible, especially if the creaking sway of the bull\u2019s-eye indicated, as it seemed to, that the thing could spin freely. She\u2019d be upside down and making bets on how quickly her skirts would rip if she continued in her stubborn streak to free herself from Marco\u2019s clever cage.</p><p>But he was long gone, and she wasn\u2019t about to give him the satisfaction of causing a scene. The lizard boy was the only person she could see, and she hissed at him until her tongue went dry, but he didn\u2019t open an eye. She had just set her hands to the buckle at her waist and prepared for the worst when she noticed someone moving furtively along the outside of the wagon circle. It was one of the girls from the dining car this morning, the one with the odd speech and wistful, faraway manner. Jacinda\u2019s orderly and journalistic mind shifted through mental cue cards as she put on a warm smile.</p><p>\u201cDemi, dear? Do you have a moment?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Harville? What are you doing?\u201d</p> <p>For a Bludwoman, Demi had a hesitant walk, almost as if she was doing something that would get her in trouble. Her strange costume showcased the casual resplendence of a life lived in the caravan, with vibrant colors and patterns carefully fitted and ruffled by hands more expert than her own. The girl\u2019s hair was in a low ponytail, rippling over her shoulders in careless curls that matched the bangs cutting across her forehead. Something about her struck Jacinda as foreign, but she couldn\u2019t place the girl\u2019s looks or accent in any culture she\u2019d visited.</p><p>Jacinda sighed and rolled her eyes heavenward. \u201cI made a bad bet, I\u2019m afraid. Would you be so kind as to spin this machine around so that I\u2019m right-side up?\u201d</p><p>Demi stared her up and down, taking in the placement of the pins in her skirt and the tightly buckled leather around her waist and ankles. Something dark flashed behind the girl\u2019s brown eyes, and they narrowed.</p><p>\u201cDid Marco do this to you?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda blinked, going a little colder, recognizing instantly the ire of a woman with no right to be jealous. Since Liam\u2019s death, she\u2019d been plagued with such indignation across the globe any time she chose a lover and inadvertently gained rivals for his affection. She always knew she would stake no future claim, but the women of the cities and villages she visited never believed her. It was rare, in today\u2019s world, for a woman to take what she wanted without expecting more down the road.</p><p>But Demi was young and sweet, beyond the raised hackles. And Jacinda knew better than to forget for even a moment that the slender girl was a Bludwoman and that she herself was pinned to the target as surely as a piece of staked meat over a fire. So she smiled warmly and shook her head as if the whole thing were very silly, which it was.</p><p>It was.</p><p>\u201cHe said he would answer a question if I let him throw a knife at me, and I was fool enough to take him up on it. And then he left me here like a goose. It\u2019s beginning to hurt a bit. Would you mind?\u201d</p> <p>She twirled a finger, and Demi followed it hungrily for a moment before snapping awake and moving the wheel until Jacinda\u2019s head was finally where it belonged. She reeled for a moment with the rush of blood, and Demi thoughtfully reached down to pull out the pins holding her skirts to the wheel and unbuckle the leg straps. Jacinda undid the waist belt, stepped down, and nearly fell, the blood rushing to and from all her body parts in an awkward dance that left her dizzy.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much. I don\u2019t know how I would have gotten out without you.\u201d</p><p>Demi nodded and turned to go, her head hung a little low. Jacinda remembered well enough what it was like to be young and have crushes on older men; of course, she also remembered seducing her anthropology professor, marrying him, and taking off behind him on a camel for the six best years of her life. But Demi wasn\u2019t her, and Marco wasn\u2019t Liam, and she sensed in her bones that the young Bludwoman\u2019s destiny lay elsewhere.</p><p>\u201cHoney, I\u2019m sure everybody in this caravan has already told you he\u2019s too old for you.\u201d</p><p>Demi opened her mouth to deny any interest whatsoever in the desperately attractive man before wisely swallowing down the act and shuffling her boots a little in the muddy place where he stood to throw his knives. \u201cThey have. I mean, I know.\u201d</p><p>A few wooden crates sat just under the edge of the tent, and Jacinda walked to one and tested it with a hand before sitting. When she jerked her chin at Demi and flashed a dimple, the girl shrugged and followed her, sitting on the other corner.</p><p>\u201cHave you ever been out of the caravan, Demi?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I was younger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in five years.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda tsked. \u201cHave you ever been out of Sangland, then?\u201d</p><p>Demi thought for a moment. \u201cSangland is the only part of Sang I\u2019ve ever seen. But I want to see more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know caravans are exciting from the outside, but I\u2019m guessing that when you live in one, they\u2019re just as boring and normal as anything else.\u201d</p><p>Demi chuckled. \u201cYeah. The glitter rubbed off pretty quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know, I once thought joining a desert caravan would be glamorous. But the moment I wrapped my fingers around a bludcamel\u2019s teats and squeezed out the pink milk while she pissed on the lace edge of my skirt, I knew I was in for it. Thus began three weeks of sand, raw meat, and blud-tinged tea that I still crave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it was an adventure, right?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda\u2019s fingers roved unconsciously to the pocket watch Marco had recently tucked back into her corset. An etching of Liam grinned within, opposite the clock face. She hadn\u2019t wound the watch since his death. Her smile was soft, touching her lips as gently as a last kiss. \u201cOh, yes. It was the adventure of a lifetime. I very much advise determining the boundaries of your comfort zone and getting the hell out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what people usually tell me when I act antsy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Lady Letitia tell you?\u201d</p><p>It was Demi\u2019s turn to smile softly. \u201cOnly that when it\u2019s time to leave, I\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaiting really is the hardest part, isn\u2019t it? Every day, you walk out your door, always trying to figure out when you\u2019ll decide not to return.\u201d</p><p>They sighed in unison. \u201cYeah. That\u2019s pretty much it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour time will come, Demi. I promise. But until then, please keep in mind that Marco Taresque is at least ten years older than you and wanted for murder.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda gave the girl a companionable nudge with her elbow, and Demi went stiff all over, whether from the nudge, the bluntness, or the sudden realization that flirting with fire was, in this case, cavorting with carving knives.</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she said softly. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s any consolation, but I heard those two handsome daimon boys whispering about you this morning in the dining car.\u201d Demi perked up, and Jacinda hid her smile of triumph. \u201cI know a little Franchian. The words \u2018limber\u2019 and \u2018pretty\u2019 came up repeatedly.\u201d</p><p>Demi blushed, and Jacinda remembered that she was gossiping with a girl, not a grown woman.</p><p>\u201cBut let\u2019s focus on the \u2018pretty\u2019 part. Maybe add \u2018smart\u2019 and \u2018funny\u2019 to the mix, yes?\u201d</p><p>Demi stood with a regal, liquid languidness in her spine that reminded Jacinda again that the girl was a predator. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-six, not sixteen,\u201d she said stiffly as she placed a handful of pins on the crate. A smile broke through, briefly. \u201cBut thanks.\u201d</p><p>As Jacinda watched the girl walk away, she hoped Demi would one day come to trust her and share her story. Everyone she met piqued her interest like books waiting to be read, and she felt that Demi\u2019s past and future held tales worth telling.</p><p>The contortionist had left a neat pile of pins on the crate, the ones Marco had used to secure Jacinda\u2019s skirts to the target. Jacinda picked one up, noting that they were hatpins, each with a delicate wood flower for the head and a capital P carved into the back.</p><p>Was the P for Petra? Had these pins once held down another girl\u2019s skirts as she spun, waiting to feel the accidental kiss of Marco\u2019s blades? She looked closer, checking the steel points for blood, but found nothing. She had to find out what had happened to the knife thrower\u2019s missing assistant. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Demi and the carnivalleros could wait to tell their stories.</p><p>Marco might not.</p><p>.7.</p> <p>That night, Jacinda dressed in her most normal, boring clothes in hopes of blending in with the caravan\u2019s audience. No steel pith helmet. No leather corset or canvas dress. No tribal layers and bells and scarves. Definitely no Almanican face paint or even desert kohl. Just a plain, well-fitting, wine-red dress, a few years out of date but of fine enough material to suggest she was a purposeful anachronism. She put up her hair as best as combs could hold the curls and dabbed just a bloom of rouge on her lips. Years in the sun with Liam had brought out her freckles, but she wore them proudly, like war paint, never hiding them under white powder as so many city girls did.</p><p>Although it pained her, she left her notebook and pen behind on the desk. Brutus, on the other hand, she would keep by her side. During the day, the caravan was quiet and safe. At night, there was no telling what dangers lurked in the shadows within the wagon\u2019s circle and on the moors beyond.</p><p>Tucking three coins into her pocket with the watch, she said, \u201cBrutus, follow,\u201d and left the oil lamps burning. Long ago, she\u2019d turned them off every time she left the conveyance to make fuel last longer. And then, one day, she\u2019d found a man in her bed, waiting with a knife. Since then, she risked fire for the sake of illumination and kept the clockwork dog close whenever she went out after nightfall. The cuts on her hands had healed, but she was no longer as trusting of darkness.</p><p>Outside, she locked the door and took a deep breath. The caravan was a symphony of smells now, a mixture of sweet and salt and warm and spice that drew her forward as surely as the strings of lights swooping around the perimeter of the cars. She could have easily walked down two steps, across the grass, under the lights, and directly into the crowd forming around the puppet show, but she knew well enough that Criminy Stain was watching, wherever he was. She wasn\u2019t a liar, and she wasn\u2019t stupid, and she wasn\u2019t about to break his rules, especially considering his unexpected generosity in regard to her interests. She had heard of his famous hatred of reporters and had expected him to toss her out on her bustle, possibly after half-draining her for upsetting his evening routine. But instead, here she was, taking the long way around the caravan, averting her eyes politely from the acts already in progress, and waiting her turn in the queue among city folk quivering with fear and excitement.</p><p>Criminy himself was waiting at the turnstile, clad in a somber black that made him seem one size smaller and twice as sinister as she remembered him during daylight.</p> <p>\u201cAdmission\u2019s a vial or a copper, miss,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>She put a copper on his red-gloved palm. \u201cI don\u2019t think I want you developing a taste for my blood. What\u2019s your refund policy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou get what you pay for here, love.\u201d</p><p>He tossed the copper high in the air, where it flashed with lantern light and moon darkness. He held out his hand to catch it, but what landed across the red kid suede was a silver hatpin with a carved wood rose on the end. Jacinda\u2019s hand flew to her hair, a gasp on her lips.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be well rewarded for your time, Miss Harville.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Harville.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>She snatched up the pin in spite of his smirk and stuck it back in her hat. As much as she wished to pretend she didn\u2019t storm off with flaming cheeks, that\u2019s exactly what she did. And as much as she\u2019d like to think she took her time enjoying the charms of the caravan, that\u2019s not what she did, either. With the great clockwork dog a step behind her, she walked widdershins around the circle of wagons, to the well-trod spot where a repetitive musical thunk announced Marco\u2019s skills. She\u2019d watched him practice twice, but she had no idea what happened during his actual act.</p><p>The flavor of the carnival changed with each wagon. From the dizzy music of the dancing mistress to the tense silence under the tightrope walker to the cheerful horn of a clockwork monkey playing in time with the strong man\u2019s squats to the tinny giddiness of Imogen\u2019s butterfly circus, Jacinda absorbed it all like a greedy child in a candy store. She didn\u2019t stop to savor any one act, but she couldn\u2019t help but appreciate the universal excitement of the world Criminy had created, this glittery oasis in the dark sea of the moors.</p><p>Marco\u2019s wagon was the same color as the cloudless night, blending seamlessly with the shadowed wilderness beyond the lights. As Jacinda approached, the hum of a gramophone needle picked up, followed by a fanfare of trumpets. Twin lights blinked on, making her see spots. Although Jacinda expected to see the spinning bull\u2019s-eye she now knew so intimately, the setup was different on this side of the wagon. Of course, having met Mr. Murdoch, she would have been foolish to expect anything less than a masterpiece when it came to the caravan\u2019s equipment.</p><p>The backdrop was painted to match the idyllic fields of a time gone by, bright and golden, with rolling hills and happy green trees as fluffy as candy floss. Just like the fancy stage sets she\u2019d seen in Milano and Paris and London, there were several layers of independently moving parts that danced in time with the gramophone\u2019s music, like a puppet show without strings or puppet master.</p><p>Down in front, wooden bludbunnies gamboled, their merry eyes at odds with their blood-tipped teeth. Behind them, a family of bluddeer leaped, the fawn\u2019s eyes big and as melty as hot chocolate. Wooden birds swooped from the sky, and a bludrat darted among the bushes, its deep russet fur making it stand out among the muted pastoral hues. Jacinda squinted for just a moment, trying to uncover the secret of the clever mix of wood, paint, and clockwork. She immediately opted to enjoy the show and edged into the back of Marco\u2019s crowd.</p><p>An explosive crack and a puff of smoke drew every eye to the figure materializing from the hazy white. Marco was clad all in black, looking even more deadly than the image in the newspaper Jacinda now kept rolled up in her desk. His hair was pulled back low, and he wore a bandanna like an airship pirate, keeping his eyes free of windblown locks. He might have disappeared against the night sky if not for the spotlight\u2019s keen glare off the line of bright silver knives glinting from boots to shoulders, at least twice as many as he usually wore. As he posed and the audience clapped, Jacinda found herself daydreaming about pressing herself against his back and dropping the knives, one by one, from their loops to the ground, until his body was safe to explore without fear of the blades\u2019 pointed tips.</p><p>With smooth, practiced movements, Marco reached for the knives at his shoulders and flung them simultaneously in time with the gramophone\u2019s song. Twin flashes crossed in an X, and the knives flickered into two of the painted wooden birds flapping across the sky, one in each eye. The crowd clapped, and Marco\u2019s mouth twitched just the tiniest bit.</p> <p>Knife after knife flew at the targets in time with the music, seemingly straight from their loops. He made it look effortless, simple, as natural as a hawk swooping from the air to capture a bludbunny. The crowd\u2019s gasps grew fewer and fewer as he went on without missing a single shot. As if he sensed the exact moment their attention hung at a precipice, he stopped and pulled the bandanna down over his eyes. As the city folk murmured and nudged one another around her, Jacinda couldn\u2019t help focusing on Marco\u2019s sensual mouth, his cheeks cleanly shaven, and that little, delectable place above his upper lip desperately in need of kissing.</p><p>She shook her head. Nibbling on Marco wasn\u2019t part of the story.</p><p>With his eyes covered, he took more time with each throw, and the crowd cheered after each blade hit a target. Jacinda would have bet anything that he could see through the bandanna, no matter how opaque and thick it might look from the audience. The hesitation was purposeful, part of the act. But then again, he had said he liked taking his time. The way he had said it, however, meant something else entirely.</p><p>As the final knife thudded into the bright red bludrat, the last untouched target, the crowd went mad with wolf whistles, clapping, and the frantic wailing of overexcited women. Jacinda clapped politely, well aware that she was not the only one in the audience who\u2019d been waiting to see Marco without protective ribbons of steel up his thighs. Pulling off his bandanna, he bowed and straightened. His grin told her plainly, told everyone, that he was well aware of the effect he had on women, and when he winked at a buxom girl in the front row, the little ninny fainted dead away. Jacinda considered it significant that he caught her eye, just after that, one eyebrow raised in amusement.</p><p>As the applause built to a crescendo, Marco raised both arms, threw them down, and disappeared in another burst of smoke. Moments later, the crowd quieted and dispersed, still whispering about the mysterious knife thrower and the darkly dangerous look in his eye, so different from the soft, bespectacled men of the city proper, with their top hats and paisley waistcoats. Jacinda waited until the last giggling girl had given up on seeing Marco again before she walked around the backdrop, which had gone still. From behind, the mechanics were visible, a tangled orchestra of metal, cogs, pistons, and gears. She was almost tempted to touch the delicate mechanisms, but she suspected that everything in the caravan was rigged to punish people who were too curious or too foolish.</p><p>\u201cLooking for more answers?\u201d</p><p>With a blush in her cheeks, Jacinda spun around to find Marco standing at the front of the backdrop, grasping a knife to pull it free of the wood. He looked so pompous and self-contained that she wanted to beat on his chest with her fists until he spilled his secrets like angry bees from a hive. One by one, he pulled out the knives and slipped them into their hooks, barely looking down as he worked. With nothing else to do and desperately in need of distraction, Jacinda knelt to yank a knife from a red-eyed bludbunny. It was easier than it looked. Instead of handing him the first one, she stayed where she was and reached for another.</p><p>\u201cYour show seemed to go well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey always do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use the spinning target? From earlier?\u201d</p><p>She looked up in time to catch a fleeting grin. \u201cThat trick\u2019s no good without a pretty girl. Are you volunteering?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Remembering the momentary flick of his fingers that had sent a knife hurtling toward her body and recalling the split second when she couldn\u2019t tell if she\u2019d been hit or not, she shook her head. \u201cI need to be fully functional, thanks. It takes two hands to do what I do best.\u201d</p><p>He smothered a laugh. \u201cAre you saying you doubt my skills?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. But I do doubt the proximity of a well-trained chirurgeon, should something go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never drawn blood, you know.\u201d</p><p>She looked up sharply; he\u2019d divulged more than he had meant to. But Jacinda knew well enough how to lure a witness into confidence, into revealing more. So she calmly pulled out another knife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it called the impalement arts.\u201d She stood, three knives in her glove, holding them out with a welcoming smile. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t seem like much impalement actually occurs. At least, not if you\u2019ve any talent.\u201d</p><p>Had he been drinking just then, he might have choked, but as it was, he cleared his throat and took the knives, one by one, his fingers lightly dragging across her gloved palm.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more than one way to be impaled, Miss Harville.\u201d</p> <p>One fair red eyebrow rose. \u201cIt\u2019s Mrs. Harville. So yes, I know all about that.\u201d</p><p>The knives slid, one by one, into their loops with a whisper of cloth.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a very singular girl.\u201d He paused to stare at her lips. \u201cMrs. Harville.\u201d</p><p>He stepped closer, his presence a dark wall. She didn\u2019t move but tilted her head to look up at him. With careful fingers, she slid a knife out of its loop on his shoulder and drew it gently down his shirt, knowing he would barely feel it but enjoying the scratch of steel against cloth and the feeling of slight rebellion against a man who billed himself as the most dangerous thing around.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just accustomed to girls. I\u2019m a woman. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d</p><p>With a quick flick of his knife, she popped off his top button. It flew into the night, landing somewhere in the dry grass, not that he bothered looking for it. In a flash, he caught her wrist in a steel grip that didn\u2019t hurt so much as warn. As he slipped the knife out of her grasp, he leaned close to whisper, \u201cKeep playing games with me, if you like. I know some games, too.\u201d</p> <p>Jacinda\u2019s pulse was racing, and she realized she was up on tiptoes, waiting to see what he would do next. But he simply put the knife back and returned to his work, collecting the rest of his instruments until he was fairly bristling again. When he ducked around behind the backdrop, she followed him into the shadows. He turned on the machine, and Jacinda stepped back from the suddenly shuddering and twirling spears of metal.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s say I want to play,\u201d she said, voice pitched low. \u201cLet\u2019s say I agree to play by your rules.\u201d</p><p>His eyes raked her from hem to hat. \u201cI have a show to put on. Now is not the time for distractions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThink about it, then. Because I\u2019m not giving up. You might as well have some fun, being pestered to death.\u201d</p><p>The moment built, heavy and dark, the clockworks\u2019 ticking as inescapable as sand in an hourglass. Voices began to gather on the other side of the backdrop, and Marco pressed another button to start up the fanfare. His eyes didn\u2019t leave hers as he checked his bandanna, ran fingertips over the knives, and reached into a wooden crate for two round, paper-wrapped packets that smelled of powder and magic.</p><p>\u201cCrowd\u2019s gathering. You\u2019re stuck, sweetness. You\u2019ll have to wait out the show back here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. Time to myself in the dark with a bunch of well-oiled machinery. Whatever will I do?\u201d</p><p>That surprised him. With the smoke bombs in each hand, Marco couldn\u2019t reach out, couldn\u2019t step too close or touch her or even shove her away. He glanced from Jacinda to the backdrop as if weighing his chances. Before he could say something dismissive or discourage her further, she stepped forward, curled her fingers into his shirtfront, and kissed him with the controlled passion only a very experienced woman could handle under the circumstances. He was helpless to do anything but take her kiss, his mouth warm and his jaw rasping against her cheek as she ran her tongue past his lips with playful possession.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be right here. Not distracting you. Try not to hurt yourself out there.\u201d</p><p>Carefully transferring both smoke bombs to the same hand, he turned his back to her and made adjustments to his costume with a long, shaky sigh. She smirked to herself. If the key to finding out Marco\u2019s past was to keep him slightly confused by constant sexual tension, then she was going to enjoy this story quite a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhat a way to go,\u201d he said under his breath as he stepped around the backdrop.</p><p>Jacinda sat on the edge of a crate, the clockwork dog a still and solid presence at her side. She absentmindedly ran a hand over its boxy head and down its metal spine. She was a woman who appreciated a dangerous creature that could be harnessed but never tamed.</p><p>And when Marco was done with his show, she decided, she would have a little surprise for him, too.</p><p>.8.</p><p>As soon as the show was over, Jacinda slipped out with the crowd, darting among the shadows with the dog in her wake. She\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019ll be right here,\u201d but she\u2019d failed to mention how long she would stay there. Although she wasn\u2019t sure exactly how Marco appeared and disappeared with his smoke bombs, she wanted to keep him guessing, out of power. Thus far, he had admitted to never having drawn blood, and the offhand delivery suggested that he had been telling the truth. What, then, had happened to his assistant? Why had there been so much gore?</p><p>Walking the caravan against the flow of the crowd, Jacinda had never felt more alone. She\u2019d traveled with Liam for so long and had grown so accustomed to his nearness that even a year later, she would find herself turning with a smile to whisper something or reaching for a hand that was no longer there. At least she\u2019d traded in their larger conveyance for her small one, a private space unhaunted by her late husband\u2019s presence.</p><p>She knew that returning to Marco\u2019s act would be a mistake, would make her seem desperate. And she had promised Criminy she wouldn\u2019t interfere with his caravan during showtime. But the charms of the circus seemed tawdry to her at night, when she had a goal to accomplish. The people behind the glitter and paint were far more interesting to her than their magic-spiced acts. If she would move among them, she wanted to know them by light of day and not, as everyone else did, after dark had fallen and the lights had gone up. She wanted the stories of the people behind the show. The truth was more interesting than the artifice.</p><p>Try as she might, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Marco\u2019s lips, the rasp of his cheek, the cut of his shoulders, the chasm of his eyes. He reminded her of a vein of ore she\u2019d seen in a mine in Africa. Just a few glimmers aboveground hinted at the glittering depths and crystal caverns below. She didn\u2019t usually favor the strong and silent type, much less the darkly dangerous type. But she suspected that he hid the best parts of himself and let the world see only the surface. If he was as razor-fine inside as he was on the outside, it would be worth her while to dig. At the very least, she would enjoy trading kisses and winning his story from him bit by bit, if that was what it took. The book was still her goal, but a scoop that would rock London and the chance to exonerate an innocent man\u2014well, she wouldn\u2019t have turned that down, even if she hadn\u2019t been personally drawn to the subject.</p><p>Walking around the perimeter of the caravan, she felt rather the fl\u00e2neuse, the only person outside of the joy and wonder. She wasn\u2019t surprised when her feet brought her right back to Marco\u2019s trailer. The crowd had thinned as the night grew colder, and the only people left were a trio of troublesome boys conferring about whether or not to nick one of Marco\u2019s knives from the backdrop.</p><p>\u201cShoo, you little creeps.\u201d</p><p>They straightened and turned on her, wearing snarls. \u201cBugger off, lady.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda smirked. \u201cBrutus, exsanguinate.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the metal dog turned in their direction, the boys scrambled away, and with a roll of her eyes at the foolishness of lads, Jacinda began the work of collecting Marco\u2019s knives. It was always better to have work than to sit around, empty-handed and empty-headed, so far as she knew. She wasn\u2019t tall enough to reach the very highest blades, but she had two handfuls of bristling steel as she rounded the corner of the backdrop.</p><p>Strong hands found her waist, swinging her around until her back was against the wood. Brutus lunged forward with a metallic growl.</p><p>\u201cBrutus, disengage.\u201d</p><p>The dog froze in place, but Marco hadn\u2019t shifted his grip for even a moment. She was on full alert, the wood cold against her back, his hands warm on the narrow waist of her corset. With fingers carefully curled around the blades, she felt helpless. But there was something strangely lovely about it.</p><p>\u201cDoing my dirty work for me, sweetness?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like to be useful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know a good way to use you.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her face, her mouth slightly open and waiting. But he held her there, looking down with a teasing sort of smile. \u201cNow\u2019s the part where you kiss me,\u201d she whispered, and he chuckled and bent, ever so slowly, to taste her lips.</p><p>Jacinda savored his patience, the warmth of his mouth moving against hers with complete mastery and control. One of his hands left her waist to cup her jaw, just so, and she was surprised to find bare skin where suede should have been. His palm was warm and broad, his thumb stroking her cheekbone possessively as the other hand pressed the corset\u2019s stays into her hip. He opened her mouth with his lips, his tongue darting in, gentle and hot, making shivers run up and down her spine to pool in her belly.</p><p>She\u2019d kissed plenty of men since she\u2019d lost Liam, in part to help her forget. Because each man tasted and moved so differently, she\u2019d never had any trouble letting lust overtake her behind closed eyes. She\u2019d never felt anything for any of them, mostly younger men who could appreciate a woman\u2019s body without delving deeper into her heart and mind. But their first kisses had always been fast and sloppy, passionate and rushed, as if she might suddenly change her mind and leave them wanting. Not that she minded\u2014she liked the frantic hunger, liked the distraction of the intoxicating frenzy. Marco, on the other hand, refused to let her set the pace, defied her haste with hands that wouldn\u2019t budge from their places and a tongue determined to enjoy a deep taste before moving on. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>With a little whimper, she arched away from the wall, aching for the pressure of his body against hers. His hand tightened on her waist, holding her back, and she murmured, \u201cCome on, Marco,\u201d into his mouth.</p><p>He pulled away, leaving her panting. \u201cHungry little thing, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. And if I want more?\u201d</p> <p>He rubbed a thumb over her still-wet lips before releasing her and taking the knives from her clenched hands. As he stepped away, she nearly collapsed, her legs boneless and her hands suddenly empty and aching from making fists around the steel.</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to beg for it.\u201d</p><p>She was off balance for a moment, but she quickly regained her footing, sensing that she needed to keep him interested, that he was the sort of man who got bored easily and would toy with her only as long as he enjoyed the chase. \u201cDo I have to get on my knees?\u201d</p><p>That got his attention. He turned back from the crate, where he was slipping his knives one by one into a long leather roll. Their eyes caught, and with her chin held high, she gracefully dropped to her knees and sat back on her haunches as she\u2019d been taught when interviewing geishas in the East. Hands folded just so, she lowered her eyelids to gaze up through her lashes.</p><p>\u201cPlease?\u201d</p> <p>He swallowed hard and looked away, turning his head and listening to the sounds beyond the backdrop. She could hear it, too\u2014the caravan was closing for the night. The noise of the crowd had grown faint, wagon doors were slamming closed, and Criminy\u2019s voice shouted unnaturally loudly, thanking everyone and welcoming them back tomorrow if they weren\u2019t eaten by bludbunnies on the way home. She had almost forgotten they weren\u2019t the only people in the dark, that hundreds of people had been lingering and laughing just around the corner. But now they were alone. Almost.</p><p>\u201cFearless and shameless. What a combination,\u201d he finally said, and she laughed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a writer. I\u2019ve lived through hell and imagined worse. You don\u2019t scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven though they call me a murderer?\u201d</p><p>She stood in one smooth motion. \u201cThing is, I don\u2019t think you did it. I\u2019d like to prove everyone wrong. I\u2019m one of the only journalists out there hell-bent on the truth.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cSuch is my curse.\u201d</p><p>It was the wrong thing to say to him, and she felt the same drop in her gut as if moving a chess piece to a square that would lose her the game. His face closed up, his eyes going dark and fathomless, looking straight through her. \u201cI can\u2019t give you what you want.\u201d It came out ragged, his back to her as he finished with his knives.</p> <p>She was drawn to him, desperate to mend what she\u2019d torn asunder. Her hand found the small of his back, her fingertips spreading to enjoy the play of hard muscles. \u201cIs the truth so impossible?\u201d</p><p>He shuddered and shook her off, rolling up his knives and storming to the stairs of his trailer. He slipped inside and slammed the door in her face without a word, and she felt a flare of anger. It was bad enough to kiss her like that and leave her wanting, but to lock her out was a slap in the face. Even if the truth was his possession, his secret, she was unaccustomed to being treated so rudely. And damned if she wasn\u2019t burdened with a temper. But she wasn\u2019t about to knock or yell or beg. The time for that was past.</p><p>Forgetting that he had deadly aim and a history of supposed bloodshed and driven only by her cheated body and her angry heart, she reached into her pocket for her lock picks and had his door open in moments. The lights inside were warm, the room glowing with wallpaper in silver and black stripes. Marco sat on a low sofa, his head in his hands and his shirt half unbuttoned. Furious surprise was written clearly on his face.</p><p>\u201cDid you just break into my wagon?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth quirked up slowly. \u201cOf course not. The door was open.\u201d</p><p>She closed the door silently and leaned back against it, suddenly unsure. What was she doing? She\u2019d never thrown herself at a man\u2014at least, not since Liam. The rest had come running like bludrats scenting a bare foot. She\u2019d simply chosen one from the pack and let things run their course. But this was no pack, just a lone wolf, and the only one that would do. She had come to the caravan for an entertaining story, but now she couldn\u2019t think past her own stupid body and swiftly racing heart. She wanted his secrets even more.</p><p>It should have been easy. Seduce him. Take what she needed.</p><p>But this was more than she had expected, and she had to tread carefully.</p> <p>Marco didn\u2019t move, sprawled over his couch as he was with one leg up on a steamer trunk. He was surprised, sure, but still dripping with confidence, with a bone-deep certainty that he was the most dangerous thing in the very small, suddenly rather airless room. She realized that she\u2019d left Brutus outside, slammed the door in the metal dog\u2019s face. Even without the knives glinting up his shirt, she still suspected Marco was well-armed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose I should be glad you didn\u2019t break in while I was out and rifle my drawers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019ll you settle for?\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath. \u201cMore time to screw it out of you.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, his head rocking back against the couch to show a long, muscled neck already shaded with new beard. \u201cWhat makes you think I\u2019m interested?\u201d</p><p>She raised one eyebrow and cast a damning look at his lap.</p><p>He just chuckled. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve it.\u201d</p><p>He stood, his footsteps creaking across the wood floors, closer and closer. Even though she had invited the situation\u2014well, forced it\u2014she still felt as if her back was always against a door with him, that there was nowhere left to run as soon as his eyes found her. She pressed her hands against the wood, willing the blood out of her cheeks, the slight hitch out of her breath. He was angry with her, but he was amused, too. She had to hope the amusement would win out.</p><p>Marco\u2019s expression was sharp and dark and hungry, and she fought the urge to look away, to look down, to cower in any way.</p><p>\u201cWoman, do you know what you\u2019re getting into?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a big girl. I always know what I\u2019m getting into.\u201d</p><p>One finger, curled under her chin, made her tilt her head back to look up at him. Her lips parted, waiting for him to crash into her, to run his hands down her body with the frenzy she felt inside every time they traded barbs. Instead, he spun her around to face the door and pressed close against her back, hotter than the sun and breathing warmly over her neck. One after the other, he took her hands, pinning them against the door over her head. Her heart sped up, pounding against the door loudly enough that she was sure he could hear it, and with animal grace, she arched her back, feeling the hardness of him even through her bustle and the layers of skirts.</p><p>His lips brushed her ear, running down her hairline to the high collar of her dress. She\u2019d never hated fashion so much, never resented the way people in Sangland were forced to cover so much skin just to stay alive. As his mouth skimmed down the curve of her neck, she could feel the heat of his breath through the fabric, and when his teeth found her shoulder, she let out a small moan. One hand still pinned both of hers to the wood, his other hand tight on her hip, moving around to the front, to the sensitive crease just under the hipbone. Through layers of skirts, his hand steadily followed the line of her corset to where it came to a point, right at the crux of her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move your hands,\u201d he whispered in her ear. \u201cOr I stop.\u201d</p><p>He released them, and they stayed pinned to the wood, flat, one on top of the other. His right hand traveled with careful, cruel slowness, down her wrist, past the sensitive furrow of her elbow, down her shoulder, still wet with the marks of his teeth. All the while, his left hand rubbed through her skirts, back and forth, hard enough that she could feel it but softly enough that it provided no relief. Over the curve of her ribs, the valley of her corset, the swell of her hip, his right hand traveled with leisurely abandon, never pausing, even when she strained for his touch. When his left hand left off its work, she groaned. But she swallowed the sound when she felt him move back and downward, palms gripping her hips as he knelt behind her.</p><p>She almost turned around, but he had burned it into her: don\u2019t move. His hands caressed her ass reverently through the bustle and skirts before running down the outsides of her legs, past her knees, all the way down to the tops of her boots, just above her ankles. Damn. If she\u2019d known he\u2019d get this close, she would have worn the elegant boots with the sharp heels, the ones that laced up to her thighs. His fingers were feather-light as he moved them to the insides of her legs and trailed them upward, skimming over her fashionably ripped stockings. When he found the insides of her knees, they nearly buckled. And as he reached the softness of her thighs, he stood back up, dragging her skirts up with him and exposing her legs to the chill air.</p><p>Teeth clenched, she closed her eyes and set her forehead against the cool wood, just under her wrists. She felt with exquisite slowness and anticipation the moment when his hands changed courses under her layers of skirts and petticoats, the left one continuing up the tender inside of her thigh while the right one spread wide and caressed her ass briefly, gently, before curving around to her front, just under the edge of her corset. At the exact same moment, his fingers found the crux of her from either side, and she gasped and whimpered.</p><p>One finger slid up and curled inside her with expert precision, and she spread her legs wider to accommodate him, fighting her every instinct to use her hands, her mouth, anything to touch him. But: don\u2019t move. Or he would stop. So her own fingers curled against the wood in imitation of his fingers inside her, her nails raw against the gloves. Marco\u2019s body pressed hard against her as he worked her with both hands, and she wanted nothing more than for him to slide up and enter her with the same damnable slowness. As his finger rubbed up and down, barely dipping in and out, his teeth caught the lobe of her ear, gentle but unyielding.</p><p>\u201cYou want to let go. You want to drop your hands. You want to turn around and feel my tongue in your mouth, moving in time with my finger. You want to press against me, feel your nipples rubbing against the corset, against my chest. But you can\u2019t. You can\u2019t move.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she could, just the tiniest bit, pressing her ass more firmly against him. He responded by gently sliding in a second finger, and she shuddered with the first promising echo of the release to come. He let loose his teeth, and his tongue curled down around the shell of her ear, caressing the tender hollow where it met her jaw and sending shivers that made her shoulders shake. Still, she didn\u2019t move her hands from their place on the door; still, she didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>God, this maddening slowness, the pressure building, every drop of her pleasure completely out of her own control. She was accustomed to a passionate frenzy on the outside, to writhing bodies and flashes of teeth by firelight and moving a clumsy but eager hand to right where she wanted it. But the tempest was inside her now, the outside as still as a moonless night, even his clever fingers hidden by layers and layers of skirts. Her heart and her damnable panting were the only things taking on speed, and she began to understand that Marco wasn\u2019t going to be the easy mark she had supposed. She had expected a bad boy, full of himself and easily led into making the mistake of confession, whether under influence of wine or woman. Instead, he had trapped her, and she\u2019d never been so wet, so wanting, so desperate.</p><p>\u201cHow long will you make me wait?\u201d she whispered.</p> <p>She felt his chuckle rumble against her back. \u201cWait for what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you.\u201d She wiggled suggestively, hips rocking against him. He caught her, pressing firmly against her ass in a way that magnified everything else he was doing and made her whimper. She couldn\u2019t take it a second longer and dropped her hands, spinning around to reach for him.</p><p>But he only dropped her skirts and backed away, his smile amused but his eyes rueful. Jacinda felt entirely bereft and immensely frustrated.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious, Marco.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hands as if she had aimed a crossbow for his heart, his fingers gleaming. \u201cI told you not to move.\u201d</p> <p>Her teeth were clenched, her cheeks as hot as the sun. \u201cWe\u2019re adults. This isn\u2019t a game, as much as we might pretend to play. You clearly know exactly what you\u2019re doing. So why not drop the pretense and enjoy our mutual good fortune?\u201d</p><p>Hurt flashed in his eyes for some reason she couldn\u2019t fathom. \u201cGet out of my wagon, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco. Please. Do I have to get on my knees again?\u201d She licked her lips, slowly, her eyes dropping to the part of him that had so recently pressed against her ass. No matter how matter-of-fact he sounded, his own frustration was even more clearly outlined than her own.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t do any good. I don\u2019t care to be rushed. No matter how tempting it might be.\u201d</p><p>She had to resist stomping a foot. \u201cWho said you make the rules? When do I get a say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple. You want something from me. A couple of things. And that means I make the rules.\u201d</p> <p>Jacinda groaned and made fists of her hands, her stupid, greedy hands that just couldn\u2019t stay put when they wanted so badly to touch him in turn. Flooded with shame and frustration, she spun on her heel and jerked open the door.</p><p>\u201cNot used to being defied, are you, Jacinda?\u201d</p><p>In response, she slammed the door, wanting nothing more than to set the damned thing on fire and forget the cool smoothness of the wood under her gloves.</p><p>She\u2019d let him get under her skin. And now, damn them both, she needed more.</p><p>.9.</p><p>Sleep was hard to find and harder to keep that night, but she outright refused to seek relief under the darkness of her blankets, because, somehow, that meant that Marco had won. Instead, she formulated her plan. She was more determined than ever to get to the root of Marco\u2019s past . . . and his refusal to bed her. A normal man would have jumped at the chance, would have been more than happy to take pleasure in a pretty woman without shame, without commitments, without damage or shyness. As much as she hated to admit it, his rejection had wounded her confidence.</p><p>When she found herself staring into a mirror the next morning, looking for wrinkles or rogue freckles or anything that would make her less than desirable, she shouted, \u201cBugger you, Marco Taresque!\u201d and went for her notebook.</p><p>He said he liked to take his time; let him. Even if he had turned her away, she had seen the evidence of his own desire, and she would let him stew in it. She would ignore him and concentrate on her book, the reason she\u2019d sought the caravan in the first place. Perhaps watching her fawn over his fellow performers while immersing herself in her element would get him as riled up as she currently felt. If there was one thing she knew how to do, it was flatter and flirt. And, of course, write.</p> <p>With Brutus at her heels, she set out across the moor, commanding the metal dog to destroy the bludbunnies that lunged out of the grass and toward her leather-clad ankles. Four bodies dangled from her grasp as she entered the well-trampled grounds of the caravan proper. She made her way to the dining wagon, hanging the rabbits on a hook as she\u2019d seen the others do and using the chalk to write her name and four hatch marks on the chalkboard beside the names of the carnivalleros and their own bludbunny counts. Gathering food brought her one step closer to being one of their own and only six rabbits away from earning a copper for her trouble, if she remembered the gossip correctly.</p><p>\u201cGot your first one, my lady?\u201d the strong man called, and she waved with a grin.</p><p>\u201cGot my first four, Torno!\u201d</p><p>He laughed, his leather top hat wobbling. \u201cBut should the dog not receive the credit?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cHe can\u2019t be trusted with coppers. Always spends them on drink and loose women.\u201d</p><p>He bowed politely as she stepped up the stairs to the dining car ahead of him.</p><p>\u201cYou are a strange woman, but then, I think perhaps all women are strange in their own ways,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cMy husband used to say something quite similar. Tell me, Torno, have you ever been married?\u201d The hugely muscled man blushed red to the tips of his waxed black mustache, and she held open the door to the dining car with an inviting smile. \u201cJoin me for breakfast, and I promise not to ask anything too embarrassing. I\u2019m writing a book, you see . . .\u201d</p><p>An hour later, her notebook held pages of frantic scribbles, and she\u2019d enjoyed a riveting tale that could have been a book in itself, considering the adventures that had brought the strong but overly sensitive man from the small island of Sassily to the mainland, through a war, across the channel, and around the icebergs after being skyjacked by pirates. And no, she learned, he had never had a wife, not after his sweetheart had been thrown overboard by the pirate captain. The poor man had squeezed out a few tears, recounting the loss of his one true love.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Tish tell you?\u201d she had asked softly.</p><p>\u201cLady Letitia told me nothing of my heart. But I can\u2019t complain, you see, for she saved my life.\u201d</p><p>By the time he left to practice, she had grown accustomed to the galloping of his speech and realized she now saw him as the hero of his own story, one she hoped would have a happy ending that included the love he deserved and would cherish. To think\u2014he looked so big and scary, but inside he was a kitten. Filled with renewed purpose and shoving away thoughts of Marco, she turned the page on her notebook and approached the booth shared by Demi and Cherie.</p><p>Both girls looked up at her in surprise with red-painted lips, and she realized that they were most likely unaccustomed to being approached by Pinkies while drinking Pinky blood. From the bludcaravans of the desert to the lively bars of Darkside, Jacinda had never been threatened by a single Bludman and had no patience for anyone who feared them, nor did she have patience for gloves unless they were required for propriety. She hadn\u2019t approved of prejudice even when she\u2019d been expected to live a normal life in the city, and she smiled warmly and asked, \u201cMay I sit with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want to,\u201d Demi said, licking her lips clean and swirling blood around in her teacup with doubt written in her eyes.</p><p>Cherie, by far the meeker of the two, scooted over, daintily sliding her teacup away across the scarred wood of the table. Jacinda murmured, \u201cThank you,\u201d and sat beside the slender blond girl, realizing that, oddly, between the two of them, the predator was probably more frightened of the human.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know anything more about Marco, if that\u2019s what you were going to ask,\u201d Demi said quickly.</p><p>Jacinda rolled her eyes with the slight head shake she would use to discuss a mischievous child. \u201cConsider him pigeonholed. He\u2019s a tough nut to crack, that one. I\u2019ve got something bigger in my sights.\u201d She leaned closer, twirling her pen between ink-stained fingers. \u201cI\u2019m writing a book about the caravan, and I\u2019d like to write a chapter about the two finest contortionists I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUs?\u201d Cherie asked innocently.</p><p>Jacinda\u2019s smile was real. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing. I\u2019d like to know all about you both.\u201d</p><p>Demi reared back, panicked, her eyes shooting around the dining car. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing you don\u2019t want to share. I just sense you have a good story. As a journalist, nothing fascinates me more than learning about new people. I think your tales would greatly intrigue the young women of the city. And you can always give a pseudonym, if you wish.\u201d</p><p>Demi and Cherie had a conversation of gestures and squeaks, prompting Jacinda to get up and fetch a cup of coffee. Criminy hadn\u2019t said anything about food, but she could always toss coppers at him if he got too ornery. She had been careful to leave her notebook on the table, writing-side up and pen on top, so that the girls could see exactly what she did. The page was open to the tail end of her interview with Torno and included scrawled notes and a few unobtrusive sketches, all very favorable, if she did say so herself. One of her attractions as a journalist was her ability to write, draw, stay sober, and ride a bludcamel, as most practitioners in the field could manage only one of the four.</p><p>Sure enough, the girls were huddled over the book, Demi\u2019s dark hair almost touching Cherie\u2019s blond curls. They broke apart as she neared, Cherie blushing and Demi looking up in reckless challenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA book, huh?\u201d Demi asked, and Jacinda nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m known for writing about the places that most consider no more than dreams. The pyramids of Kyro, the native villages of Almanica, the daimon cabarets of Paris, the hidden jungles of Africa. But I\u2019ve never seen a single book about the truth behind a caravan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Criminy knows? He doesn\u2019t mind?\u201d Cherie glanced around nervously.</p> <p>Demi smirked. \u201cIf she\u2019s here, he knows. And he probably loves it. Crim\u2019s got an ego the size of a Mack truck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA what?\u201d Jacinda asked, as it was rare that anyone mentioned anything she hadn\u2019t heard of at least once.</p><p>Demi, blushed, her eyebrows drawn down as she looked away, annoyed. \u201cJust something from where I\u2019m from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where\u2019s that?\u201d Jacinda\u2019s pen was poised over a fresh sheet of paper, and she felt the familiar thrill of the blank page, the pause before the story started.</p><p>\u201cDemi, don\u2019t,\u201d Cherie said, but Demi just shook her head.</p> <p>\u201cAlmanica. But I won\u2019t talk about that.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda knew well enough how to dance around forbidden topics and still get the pieces she needed to enthrall an audience. And having been there herself for more than a year, she also knew well enough that Demi wasn\u2019t actually from Almanica.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Sangland, then. How long have you been here, and how did you get into contortion?\u201d</p><p>Demi sighed and drank the last of the blood from her cup with a determined air. \u201cOne question, first. Can you make me famous?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda didn\u2019t want to let the girl down; she looked so hungry and earnest and, suddenly, very innocent. \u201cMy books do fairly well, and I believe the city folk would be riveted by the tales of the caravan. But tell me, aren\u2019t you already a star? I\u2019ve seen the crowd gathered around your act, and I can tell you\u2019re very popular. Every girl in London dreams of what you have, this freedom and applause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough. I want more. I want to be famous.\u201d</p> <p>Poor Cherie looked as if she was about to collapse in on herself, her fair head ducked down between narrow shoulders and her face in her hands, although whether it was in embarrassment, worry, or fear, Jacinda couldn\u2019t tell. But Demi had her head high, her eyes gazing out the window and past the moors to the sky with near-feral determination.</p><p>\u201cBeing in a book is a good start, darling. I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d</p><p>Demi took a deep breath and focused. \u201cMy name is Demi Ward. I was attacked by bludbunnies, and Criminy Stain bludded me and pretty much adopted me, and when we were trying to think of some sort of work I could do to earn my way in the caravan, he suggested contortion. I was young enough and had a little acrobatic training, and Cherie was willing to teach me.\u201d She looked at her friend fondly, and Cherie looked up and smiled. \u201cWe were instant best friends and have been performing together for five years. But that\u2019s not really interesting, is it?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda shook her head, her pen scritching over the paper. \u201cThink about what it would be like to be fifteen years old, living in a cramped, dark apartment in London. Most girls your age have never been outside the city walls. You almost died and were saved at the last moment by the most notorious and handsome magician in the country. They\u2019d salivate to hear it.\u201d</p><p>Demi chuckled. \u201cNever thought about it that way. I\u2019ll try to make it sound juicy. Um. One time, the Magistrate raided the caravan with a bunch of Coppers and dogs, looking for Lady Letitia, and all the Bludmen ran away into the moors. But Cherie and I didn\u2019t want to run far, so we hid in the lookout box on top of our wagon and watched. It was totally brutal. They pulled out the old costumer and carried her away tied to a bludmare\u2019s rump. She beat three guys up with a sword hidden in her umbrella first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what about you? Any exciting stories of your own?\u201d</p><p>Demi thought about it for a few moments, her face slowly falling. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a single freaking thing. I mean, I wake up, drink blood, perform, drink blood, and sleep. I don\u2019t leave the caravan or go into the cities.\u201d She swallowed hard and let her head fall to her chest. \u201cI\u2019m just as trapped as they are.\u201d</p><p>The interview was not going the way she had hoped, and when the dining-car door opened, Jacinda was grateful for a reason to look away from the girl\u2019s tears. Marco didn\u2019t pause as he stepped into the trailer, but he did tip his head just a shade to smirk at her.</p> <p>Demi saw it, too, and her voice took on a tinge of resentment. \u201cI mean, there aren\u2019t even any guys here. All the good ones get taken. And Criminy makes sure I never get to talk to anyone in the crowd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t forget the daimon boys.\u201d Jacinda winked.</p><p>\u201cAnd Luc is looking right at you,\u201d Cherie began, tossing her hair and surreptitiously glancing to the other end of the wagon, where a lanky, good-looking boy with red skin joked with Marco by the drink dispenser.</p><p>Demi\u2019s eyes flicked to Marco and Luc. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Daimons?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda leaned close with a conspiratorial grin. \u201cI had a daimon lover in Paris. His name was Gael, and he was a dealer in rare books and antiquities. He looked quite calm until the spectacles came off. And then, ooh la la. Highly recommended. Since they feed off emotions, let\u2019s just say they\u2019re . . . highly motivated to keep you happy.\u201d</p><p>Demi\u2019s lips twisted up as she watched the boy laugh and turn around, tail waving. He caught her eye and winked with a daredevil smile, and Cherie giggled and hid her face.</p><p>\u201cHmm. Maybe you\u2019re right. I hadn\u2019t really considered it before, but I guess a Bludman being prejudiced against daimons is just as bad as Pinkies being prejudiced against me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll speak Franchian, too. Such a sensual language,\u201d Jacinda added.</p><p>Cherie giggled again, and when the daimon boy passed by them with a backward glance, Demi met it and nodded, just a little. Good for her. Jacinda loved an adventure, and the thought that the bright, pretty girl could be depressed in the caravan hurt the journalist\u2019s heart. It would do the girl good to have a fling with a daimon, one as giving and energetic as Gael had been. Just thinking about it brought her thoughts back to Marco and the night before, and she watched him contemplatively as he loaded up his tray.</p><p>Even though his back was to her, she felt as if he knew she was watching, as if he could sense her eyes brushing over his shoulders, the small of his back where his shirt tucked into his breeches, a place she\u2019d barely begun to explore. What else might have happened, had she kept her hands on the door last night? Damn the man! He was under her skin now, and she craved what she\u2019d barely tasted. But she wasn\u2019t about to admit it. She looked down at her notebook, where she had doodled the exact curve of where his back met his ass when she was supposed to be sketching Demi\u2019s face.</p><p>Turning to a new page, she asked, \u201cWhat about you, Cherie? Where are you from?\u201d</p><p>The girl blushed and looked down. \u201cOh, I\u2019m from Freesia. We were once a great family, but the tsarina argued with my mother, and we lost everything. Six of us lived in a wagon smaller than the one I share with Demi, all pulled by a pair of gray dappled bludmares named Snow and Ice. I fought a bludbear once . . .\u201d</p><p>As Cherie talked, Jacinda made the appropriate noises of surprise and assent, scribbling down the details of a life that would read like a fairy tale to the city girls. Festivals, balls, bludbears, wild unicorns, and bloodthirsty peacocks. To Cherie and Demi, it was boring, but to everyone else in the world, it was a beautiful dream.</p><p>Although Jacinda\u2019s mind was halfway on the story and aware of how valuable the tale would be, she couldn\u2019t stop glancing at Marco in between words. It slowly dawned on her that he was purposefully taking his time, giving her ideal views of his physique as he collected food and talked to Criminy by the cauldron of vials. His mouth was quirked up as if he knew his very existence teased her, as if he was more than pleased about it. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t surprised when he slid into the booth directly behind her. He leaned back, letting his hair brush her neck, and she went still like a dog on point, positive she could feel the warmth of his body through the wood between their backs.</p><p>It was hard to respond appropriately to Cherie with him so close, and she wondered that the girl couldn\u2019t feel the tension, the hot and cold running through her body. But no, Cherie just prattled, innocent as the girl she seemed. Demi stared contemplatively at Luc where he sat with his slightly less handsome brother at a far booth, sipping a daimon drink and staring right back. When Cherie reached what seemed like a stopping point, Jacinda closed her notebook with a satisfied nod.</p><p>\u201cThank you so much for sharing your stories with me, both of you. I may not be able to crack the toughest nut in the caravan, but this is just as satisfying. It\u2019ll be good to keep my hands busy with something worthwhile instead of sitting around, twiddling my thumbs, and doing nothing.\u201d</p><p>Behind her, Marco stifled a chuckle and cleared his throat. Demi and Cherie shared a look of bemused doubt.</p><p>\u201cUm, you\u2019re welcome?\u201d Demi said. \u201cAnd you should definitely talk to Veruca and Eblick. They don\u2019t talk much, but I think they\u2019ve got pretty good origin stories.\u201d</p><p>With a nod, the contortionists stood, and Jacinda rose to let Cherie out of the booth, purposefully stepping back just enough to allow her bustle to brush Marco\u2019s sleeve. As Demi and Cherie left to deposit their bloody teacups in the washing cube, Jacinda was sure she felt a hand slip into the pocket of her skirt, but it was so stealthy and quick that she might have imagined it. She paused a moment, rolling up her notebook, but the sensation didn\u2019t come again. Although she had planned on visiting with more of the carnivalleros this morning for research purposes, she changed plans and headed outside without a word or a look for the man behind her.</p><p>In her pocket, she found a bit of parchment hastily scribbled with pencil.</p><p>Find me later. I have something to keep your hands busy. M.</p><p>She smiled to herself, fingering the paper.</p><p>Oh, I bet you do, Marco. I bet you do. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>.10.</p><p>She made him wait.</p><p>Back in her conveyance, she refilled Brutus\u2019s tank with clockwork oil, added to her caravan notes and stored them in a new pigeonhole, and, much to her own annoyance, primped in front of the mirror, making sure she looked ravishing but not as if she were trying too hard. She\u2019d put on her fancier corset that morning, along with the new style of stockings she\u2019d picked up in Paris. Even if it was wishful thinking, she\u2019d found over the years that wearing fancy underpinnings gave her the confidence she needed to face up to anything from roaring bludmares to charging warriors in buffalo chariots.</p> <p>With an odd little twinge of surprise, she realized that she had abandoned completely the idea that he might be guilty. Even without hearing his side of it, even knowing him only a few short days, she felt, bone deep, that he had not committed the crime for which he\u2019d been accused. With renewed determination, she set out for his wagon and the answers she kept forgetting she needed.</p><p>She knocked on the door of his trailer first, but he didn\u2019t answer, and she wasn\u2019t willing to break in again, especially during daylight. Slipping past the clockwork bird was no problem, and she was soon exchanging pleasantries around the circled wagons, caught between wanting to win over the carnivalleros and wanting to get close enough to Marco to feel the ripple of acknowledgment her body seemed to experience every time he was near.</p><p>She found him by the target, throwing the knives with his usual offhand brand of lazy concentration. Waiting a respectful distance away, she admired his perfectly coordinated movements and the snap of his forearm that sent each silver missile thudding into the target. He didn\u2019t acknowledge her until he\u2019d thrown his last knife.</p><p>\u201cFound something better to keep your hands occupied?\u201d His playful smirk was back, so full of promise that she cocked her hips and licked her lips on instinct.</p><p>\u201cAs much as I hate to leave things unfinished, my time is too valuable to waste. I like playing games as much as the next girl, but I prefer to play to checkmate and have at least a few pieces to move around as I wish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTalking in metaphors. That\u2019s cute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs a button.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d collected all of his knives from the target by then, sliding all but one into their slots on his vest. Walking toward her slowly, he twirled the last one in the air. She wore an expression of bored expectation, but inside, her heart was racing, her toes curling in her boots.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to try this again?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around, one eyebrow raised. \u201cI\u2019d prefer somewhere more private, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman. You\u2019ve got a one-track mind. I meant target practice.\u201d He jerked his chin at the target.</p> <p>She grinned to keep from showing her disappointment. \u201cSame rules?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upping the ante. Twelve knives, one question. You in?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda took a deep breath, studying the painted shape on the target.</p><p>\u201cLet me get this straight. You want me to let you strap me to a spinning target and hold still while you throw not one knife but an entire dozen? And in return, I get to ask one measly question, which you might or might not answer to my satisfaction?\u201d</p><p>He took her hand gently and led her to the target. When he placed her palm against the shiny wood, her insides shuddered with recognition at the last time he had placed her hand, just so.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re good at what you do. Trust that I\u2019m good at what I do. There\u2019s not a single cut in that wood that I didn\u2019t mean to put there. It\u2019s not as dangerous as you think it is. But I need a live assistant, and you need incentive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncentive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you want the truth, you have to work for it. You\u2019re a woman who needs an occupation. And I think you like the excitement.\u201d</p> <p>With a raised eyebrow, she took her hand off the wood and faced him head-on. Putting her palm on his chest with the same gentle pressure he had used on her, she softly said, \u201cYou want to tell me the truth, don\u2019t you? But something\u2019s holding you back.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her hand, considering. \u201cTell yourself whatever you need to hear. But you\u2019ve got two choices: play by my rules, or go interview the lizard boy about his acid spit. You\u2019re the one who wants something here.\u201d</p><p>She ran her hand down his chest, hooking a single finger into his belt. \u201cYou don\u2019t want anything?\u201d</p><p>He pulled her hand away. \u201cStep up or keep walking, woman.\u201d</p><p>She detected bitterness, but she also understood that this was a dangerous dance. He wasn\u2019t just toying with her; any misstep on her part could cause him to shut down completely. She wasn\u2019t accustomed to jumping through hoops for a man, to dancing around rules or playing games. But she knew that she would forever regret it if she didn\u2019t find out the truth about Marco Taresque. So she stepped up, right onto the platforms, the wood against her back a familiar caress.</p><p>\u201cStrap me in, will you?\u201d</p><p>He obliged, silent as he gently tightened the leathers around her ankles, her waist, and, this time, both wrists. When he knelt to pin down her skirts, she waited, breathless, to feel his hands brush her legs. Because the game was so very tenuous, her senses were on alert, desperate for his attention. It was maddening. And intoxicating. When the pad of his thumb caressed her calf, the heat in her cheeks told her that he was right: she needed the thrill of this man and his knives.</p><p>For the flash of a few heartbeats, he disappeared behind the target, and then she was spinning slowly, wondering whether the drop in her belly was from gravity or from the man staring at her as if she was the only thing on earth.</p><p>\u201cSix knives.\u201d</p><p>He stopped twirling one and cocked his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve is insane. I want a question for six knives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t change the terms that you\u2019ve already agreed to.\u201d He walked up closer, close enough for her to count the holes in the buttons on his pants when she was upside down. \u201cFor the love of all that\u2019s holy, woman. You\u2019re strapped to a target. I could come at you with a hatchet, and you couldn\u2019t do a damn thing about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust because I\u2019m a gentleman doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m about to let you tell me how things are going to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight knives.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and turned away, walking back to his bare patch of ground. She was so riveted with the progression that she very nearly forgot that deadly steel would soon be flying at her body with only the meager armor of her corset, and that only protected her vitals and her heart. Her head, arms, and legs were utterly vulnerable. And she didn\u2019t know how many knives he would throw, although she swore to herself that it would be fewer than twelve, because she was betting he was an honorable man with a soft spot, somewhere under the dark clothes and darker eyes.</p><p>With a smirk that echoed down all of her own soft spots, he said, \u201cThis time, don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>She barely stopped herself from saying, Yes, sir.</p><p>The first knife surprised her, slamming into the wood by her hip. They came in quick succession after that, none of them coming close enough to really frighten her. She sensed he was going easy on her, that he could have outlined her every curve with steel had he so chosen, the blades pressing against her with the tenderness of fingertips. But they were all crowded in the vast plains of red and white rings between her arms and her body. She lost count, but as he walked toward her, she noticed three knives still in his hands.</p><p>\u201cNine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a square number.\u201d</p><p>He disappeared behind the machine, and she giggled.</p><p>When he stood before her again, he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The machine slowed to a stop, and he turned the target until she was head up. \u201cNothing. You just didn\u2019t strike me as a mathematician.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWoman, what you don\u2019t know about me could fit in a Kraken\u2019s belly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I let you throw nine knives at me. Now I get a question. What really happened that night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too broad. Like wishing for a million wishes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never said I couldn\u2019t ask a perfectly reasonable question.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, simply pulled the knives out around her. She felt exposed and ridiculous and realized suddenly that she hadn\u2019t given any thought to her question. The first time she had asked him where the body was, and he had told her there was no body. Which meant she\u2019d asked the wrong question.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Petra?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>The answer came quickly, and in a flash, he was behind her, turning on the machine. The target began to spin again and, with it, her mind. She couldn\u2019t concentrate with him staring at her, so she closed her eyes and wracked her brain as the knives landed, one after the other, in the wood around her.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>There was no body.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>He didn\u2019t know where Petra was.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>That meant his ex-assistant had to be alive.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>But if she was alive, where had the blood come from? He said he\u2019d never drawn blood.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>And why had he run, if there had been no crime? Why would he tell no one the truth?</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>She\u2019d read every word of the newspaper, gone through her archives. There was no mention of the name Marco Taresque, not even on the broadsheets.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>And Letitia wouldn\u2019t have let Marco stay if she\u2019d seen anything unsafe in his past or his future. And she wouldn\u2019t have let Jacinda herself stay had she seen danger.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>She was missing something.</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>Her skirts felt oddly tight, and she opened her eyes and looked down. The last knife quivered between her thighs, piercing the layers of her skirts and drawing the cloth tightly over her legs.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d</p><p>His mouth quirked up in a hungry, amused smile as she spun around slowly, and she pinned her lips together before the words escaped her and she stupidly wasted a question. What on earth are you trying to do? was not the question she\u2019d suffered near impalement to ask. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It only took one breath, and she knew.</p><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t do what they accused you of doing, why won\u2019t you tell the truth?\u201d</p><p>He switched the target off and spun her upside down. All the blood rushed to her head, and she found her mouth inches away from his thighs. She was about to ask him what the hell he was doing, again, but she knew: he was trying to confuse her, muddle her senses, keep her off balance. It was the same tactic she was using on him.</p> <p>He sat on his haunches and leaned close to whisper, \u201cBecause a man has his pride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride? Your pride is worth allowing the world to think you a murderer?\u201d</p><p>He spun her right-side up and began to collect his knives as she went over woozy.</p><p>\u201cIs that your next question? Because I can throw the knives faster, if you like. My aim is actually better when I remove my mind from the equation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being purposefully evasive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want something I don\u2019t want to give. You\u2019re lucky I haven\u2019t taken off for the hills.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you, then?\u201d</p><p>He stepped close, wrapping a fist around the knife he\u2019d thrown through her skirts. His knuckles brushed her body, making her shudder, and he held his hand there, warm and solid, his wrist against the tender curve inside her thigh.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re like an itch I can\u2019t scratch. I keep telling myself to disappear.\u201d He leaned even closer, his mouth near her ear and her hands pinned, unable to reach out in any way. \u201cAnd yet I keep coming back for more.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, licked her lips. \u201cFor which I\u2019m glad. Gladder still if you came closer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you from the start: I can\u2019t give you the things you think you want.\u201d</p> <p>He jerked the knife out of the wood, and the target shuddered against her back. That blade had gone deeper than most.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to let me down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepends. You want one more question?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, hoping that he would throw that knife again, so close to where she wanted other sorts of impalement. Instead of turning on the machine to spin her, however, he walked to his usual spot and said, \u201cReally, this time, don\u2019t move. Not a hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>His grin was fatal. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to know.\u201d</p><p>Before she could protest, a knife thunked into the wood, right against her ribs, touching her corset. Then another on the opposite side. Then one on each side of her waist. Then around her hips, the flat blades a whisper, a leaning away from her dress. Two more around her thighs, then her knees. The penultimate knife thudded beside her left ankle, and the last one glittered briefly in the weak sun before quivering in the wood beside her right ankle. But something was wrong. It burned.</p><p>\u201cMarco . . . I think . . .\u201d</p> <p>Blood bloomed in the green of her dress, and she tried to pull her leg away, but the blade was firmly stuck. With the skirts in the way, she couldn\u2019t see what exactly had happened, but the pain was radiating out. It was clear enough he\u2019d struck her, for all his bravado.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweet Ermenegilda.\u201d</p><p>He was beside her in seconds, yanking out the knife and unbuckling her, ankles first, then waist, then wrists. She all but fell into his arms, the blood drained from her arms and legs.</p><p>\u201cIs it bad? I can\u2019t see anything. It stings.\u201d</p><p>Marco glanced around before carefully placing her on the crate where she\u2019d once taken his carved pins from Demi and left all but one behind. He released her as if she might break, and she curled fingers around the splintered wood and tried to make the world stop spinning. He fell to his knees, running his hands up her ankles without asking permission and pressing the place that burned.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it might have been. Dammit, woman. You\u2019re too pretty. It\u2019s distracting.\u201d</p><p>He held back her skirts, and she leaned over to see a cut just above her boot top, her new stockings sliced neatly and blooming with blood. She\u2019d had a lot worse. But she was shaken by the combination of excitement, fear, pain, and the strange sensation of having all of the blood in her feet and nethers instead of in her brain and fingers where it belonged.</p><p>\u201cLet me fix it up for you. Can you walk to the cassowarrel? Stupid clockwork guards shouldn\u2019t be on during the day.\u201d</p><p>With a shaking hand, she reached into her pocket and pulled out her disruptor. \u201cI\u2019m in a hurry. Let\u2019s make trouble.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged and stood, putting his arm around her to help her hobble to the nearest clockwork, a gangly giraffe that she froze with one jolt of blue sparks. They struggled past the automaton and around the corner of the wagon to Marco\u2019s door. Her ankle was bleeding down her stocking and into her boot, and it stung, and she had trouble getting the disruptor back into her pocket. By the time she paid any attention to her surroundings, he was closing the door behind her and helping her onto the couch. He\u2019d soon pulled a stool up and fetched an old wooden cigar box. Without asking, he picked up her damaged leg and laid it across his lap.</p><p>After rolling back her skirt, he unlaced her boot and slipped it off, seemingly unaware of the effect his businesslike touches were having on her body. Taking the thin silk stocking in two hands, he tore the rip wider, exposing her calf and the freely bleeding cut that she no longer really felt, thanks to his closeness.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it needs stitches. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d</p><p>He palmed the back of her head, directing her gaze down to her own leg. \u201cStitches. Do you want them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and dabbed at the wound with a clean handkerchief. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing, a woman not losing her guts over a little cut.\u201d</p><p>She slipped farther down on the sofa, enjoying the strength of his hands. He\u2019d shed his gloves at some point, and she felt the heat of his touch, not to mention every move of his body as he cleaned off the wound.</p><p>\u201cOne time in Freesia,\u201d she began, \u201cwe were beset by a peacock and a unicorn\u2014they work together, you know. As the men fought the unicorn, the peacock went for me. Although I\u2019d heard their beaks were razor-sharp, I didn\u2019t quite believe it until he was licking the blood from my arm with his black tongue. That cut was far deeper than this one.\u201d She held up her arm, rolling back her sleeve to show a white scar cutting across her forearm.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI beat him to death with my umbrella and put his tail feathers in my hat.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, eyed her as if she was edible. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can show you the hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo fierce.\u201d</p><p>He was still dabbing gently at the cut, and she flicked her eyes to it. It was dry and clean and no longer hurt much at all. But he didn\u2019t stop touching her. \u201cHold on. I can make this easier for you.\u201d</p><p>She bent over, her foot still in his lap, and ran her hands under her skirts to pull the bow that held the stocking up at her thigh. She carefully rolled down the dove-gray silk under cover of the green fabric, smiling coyly as the thin material skimmed over the rip and the cut. His dark eyes widened, his breath catching with a satisfying pause. She pulled off the ruined stocking, tossed it onto the floor, and nestled her bare foot back in his lap. When she resettled herself against the sofa, he gently grasped her ankle, ignoring the wound as his thumbs massaged her arch and the ball of her foot. Her head fell back, a moan escaping her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about this, Jacinda.\u201d His voice was low, husky.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re forgiven, provided you keep doing that.\u201d</p><p>His hands froze. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the least I can do.\u201d</p><p>She wiggled her toes at him, and he sighed. There was something sad in the sound, some unknowable sense of loss, but she forgot it as soon as his touch changed, his thumb pressing with warm intimacy against the sensitive arch of her foot and running down to the cleft between her toes. With her eyes closed and the welcome but unfamiliar feeling of having one leg completely bare, she gave in to the eddies of warmth and electricity whirling through her.</p><p>\u201cI should tell you to leave, woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should pack up and hit the road. Find another caravan to hide in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should treat you badly. Say cruel things. Set fire to your conveyance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should kiss me, Marco.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI most definitely should not do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you want to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wanting got to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>She leaned forward, her lips a breath away from his. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so tough, don\u2019t you, Marco Taresque?\u201d</p><p>He tilted his head, his lips almost brushing hers. \u201cPretty sure I stabbed you today, and I wasn\u2019t even trying.\u201d He kissed her, lightly, teasingly, pulling back almost instantly. \u201cYou should see what I can do when I actually put my mind to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019d like to see that.\u201d</p><p>She tried to kiss him, but he pulled away. Her temper flared, but she tamped it down. There had to be some way past his defenses. With a sly smile, she leaned back and slowly unlaced her other boot, kicking it off and slipping her stockinged foot into his lap with the one he still held, cradled in warm, callused palms. It wasn\u2019t difficult for her toes to find what she was looking for, and he groaned, his fingers tightening on her other foot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be blunt. I want to bed you. It has nothing to do with the story. This is for me.\u201d</p><p>She felt the effects of her words under her toes and smiled at the truth he couldn\u2019t hide. He closed his eyes, his mouth falling open deliciously for just a moment before he groaned and stood, dumping her feet angrily on the floor. \u201cI can\u2019t. I flat-out can\u2019t. You think I don\u2019t want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you want to. You certainly seem . . . able. I just don\u2019t know why you won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have my reasons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already got a girl? You\u2019re married? You took an oath? You\u2019re cursed?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco turned away. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else. But otherwise, you\u2019re closer than you think.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and shook his head bitterly, his back to her. She didn\u2019t mind the view, but it pained her to see him so conflicted, to know that there was some real, deep reason he couldn\u2019t just throw her against the wall and kiss her until she cried, even if he ached for it as much as she did. She wanted him, she liked playing and flirting with him, and she realized that as little as she knew about him, she cared for him. And he was hurting.</p><p>She stood, wrapping her arms around him and putting her cheek against the solid curve of his shoulder. He smelled familiar and warm, wood and metal and the same incense she remembered from the caravans she\u2019d visited on her way to find Criminy\u2019s. She didn\u2019t grind herself against him, didn\u2019t let her hands roam. She just held him.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry for pushing you, Marco. I thought you were just flirting with me, enjoying the back-and-forth. I didn\u2019t know there was an actual impediment. I\u2019ll back off. Getting a story is one thing, but I\u2019m not the sort of journalist who tears people down. All along, I just wanted to prove you were innocent. But if you don\u2019t want that to be proven, if you can\u2019t take this farther, consider the issue closed.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away from him, her hands lingering briefly, wistfully, on his biceps. Silly. She felt silly now. Pursuing him when he didn\u2019t want to be pursued. Pushing him when he didn\u2019t want to be pushed. Coming back for more, when he\u2019d made his position clear, told her again and again it was a game, not real. Whatever his reason, it just seemed cruel to them both to continue on as she had been, goading and pressing and toying with him for her own amusement and pleasure.</p><p>As she bent to slip on her boots and leave, an embarrassed blush high on her cheeks, he murmured, \u201cThis issue damned well isn\u2019t closed.\u201d</p><p>Before she could straighten and ask him what he meant, his hands caught her hips and pulled her back, hard, against him. Jacinda gasped and straightened and wobbled, her foot half in her boot. He steadied her back against his chest, one arm around her waist and the other traveling up to her jaw to hold her, tightly but gently, against the length of his body. With a small sigh, she pressed against him, forgetting everything she\u2019d just said about respecting his boundaries.</p><p>His lips found the edge of her ear, and he turned her face to kiss along her throat, half frantic and half tender.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t want to say it, but his earlier conviction, his passion, had left its impression. \u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what I said.\u201d</p><p>His tongue slid past the lace edging of her collar, his fingers deftly undoing the buttons as his mouth undid the woman. It took every ounce of fortitude she had to wrap an arm around his neck, grab a fistful of hair, and yank his lips away from her skin.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would back off, and you agreed it was for the best?\u201d</p><p>He shook her hand off and nipped the shell of her ear. \u201cI did agree with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why is your other hand cupping my ass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s perfect.\u201d Both hands slid down to briefly frame the part in question, his lips warm on her neck. \u201cAnd because I\u2019m sick of running from the past. And the future.\u201d He flicked two more buttons and pulled back her collar, exposing her entire throat. \u201cYou can run, if you still want to.\u201d</p><p>She let her head fall back over his shoulder, her mouth against his ear. \u201cI never wanted to run at all.\u201d</p><p>He caught her throat in one hand and turned her face, their lips meeting, half open, and she realized that they\u2019d never once kissed normally, lined up like they were meant to. Thus far, it had always been sideways, upside down, over her shoulder, her back against his chest. She didn\u2019t care; she didn\u2019t want anything average. The fierce abandon of their tongues, their mixed breath, his hand slowly sliding down her open collar, seemed fitting for a wild creature like him. Caught between his hands and mouth, spine twisted and body pulled taut, she kicked off her boot and gave in to him entirely, to taking whatever he would give her, heedless of his best intentions.</p><p>With sudden ferocity, he swept her up into his arms, carrying her toward the back room of the wagon. \u201cI want to see you.\u201d He kicked open the door and laid her gently on a wrought-iron bed neatly made with a quilt of patchwork silks. \u201cAll of you.\u201d</p><p>She stretched her arms overhead, lifted her bare foot to let the hem of her dress slide up her calf and give him a view of creamy skin. Then, with a slow and wicked smile, she reached to grasp the headboard, arms spread wide, fingers curled around the iron bars.</p><p>\u201cReminds me of being strapped to your target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMm. You forgot something.\u201d</p><p>With a matching smile, he took an ankle in each hand and pushed them apart until she lay there, spread-eagled on his bed, as he climbed up to straddle her. She couldn\u2019t help admiring the way his black breeches stretched tight over his thighs, making her fingers twitch around the iron bars. His boot tips hooked over her ankles as he found the next button on her jacket and slipped it open.</p> <p>\u201cYou city women and your buttons,\u201d he mused, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a city woman. Haven\u2019t lived in a city since I left university.\u201d</p><p>He undid another button, traced a fingertip down her throat. \u201cWhat are you, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing that has a name.\u201d He flicked another button, this one just over her heart, and before she could elaborate, his mouth was on her, his tongue tasting her throat as his fingers continued downward, exposing the edge of her corset. She unclenched the bed frame, but he caught her hand and put it back firmly.</p><p>\u201cI like you like this, spread out for me. If you let me enjoy myself, I promise you won\u2019t regret it.\u201d His lips nibbled her clavicles, his tongue tracing the fine lines of her bones. \u201cI told you: I like to take my time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best. But I\u2019m not one for following orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it a polite request, then.\u201d</p><p>His tongue dipped into the valley between her breasts as he finished with the last button of her jacket, spreading the thick cloth from chin to waist and revealing an emerald-green corset that made her fair skin glow like porcelain held before the fire. She wanted so badly to touch him, to enjoy the softness of his dark hair and the breadth of his shoulders and the smart, enticing curve of his ass, but she was painfully aware of what had happened the last time she\u2019d moved her hands from his chosen place before he was satisfied. The frustration heightened the touch of his fingertips, callused from flicking blades and perfectly nimble with softer flesh as he gently eased her breast from under her corset. Her nipple hardened and pearled as he pulled it into his mouth, licking and tasting it. His fingertips found her other nipple, rolling and rubbing it, making her squirm to be free of the confines of stays and thick satin. He teased from one to the other before pressing them both together and tonguing both of her nipples at once, a sensation she\u2019d never experienced but that made her throw her head back with a strangled moan.</p><p>\u201cYou make that noise again, I\u2019ll have to do something about it,\u201d he murmured, his breath hot against her flesh.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re daring me to dare you, then I dare you.\u201d</p><p>Before she\u2019d finished speaking, his tongue was in her mouth, messy and wild and wet and all too brief, and then he was kneeling between her legs, his hands on her ankles under the hem of her skirts. His knees against her thighs made her squirm, as did the painful slowness with which he slid her skirts and petticoats up, revealing her legs inch by inch.</p><p>\u201cOh, this is pretty.\u201d He ran a fingertip up and down the lone silk stocking she still wore.</p><p>\u201cWhen I put them on this morning, I was thinking of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly mother, they go all the way up. Maybe the cities aren\u2019t so bad.\u201d Walking his fingers up her leg from ankle to thigh, he lifted just that side of her skirt to expose the dove-gray stocking. She closed her eyes and writhed, so impatient for him to reach the ribbon bows that connected the Franchian silk to her corset.</p><p>Reaching the curve of her hip, he paused.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t lying.\u201d His fingertip stroked the place on the crease of her thigh where an Almanican shaman had etched her skin with needle and ink in an elaborate ceremony. The stylized quill tattoo had been hard won, and she treasured it beyond words. After a short pause, he kissed it gently and said, \u201cBeautiful,\u201d and she exhaled in relief.</p><p>He leaned over, taking the black ribbon in his teeth and pulling so slowly that she could hear the bow spring free. It took everything she had not to let go of the iron bars and dig her nails into his back, not to beg him to give her something besides exquisite frustration.</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d He rubbed his cheek against her hip, the rasp of his stubble delicious against her skin. \u201cI like the stockings, but I like what\u2019s underneath better.\u201d He took the silk in his teeth and lightly dragged it down her thigh, his breath hot on the inside of her leg as he exposed her flesh to the cool air. When his nose grazed the tender curve of her ankle, she shivered, and he slipped the stocking free with his teeth and tossed it onto the floor.</p><p>Jacinda lifted her eyes, and he was staring straight at her, a look of such profound emotion on his face that she was momentarily bewildered. There was hunger and lust and darkness and a strange sort of sadness in him, and before she could ask him why he was so worked up over simple love play, he was nibbling up her ankle, his hand on her other leg matching pace and pulling up the other side of her skirt to expose her completely. His tongue and lips traveled up her calf, paused to dip into the tender spot behind her knee, and then began the ticklish, devilish, delicious trip up the inside curve of her thigh, closer and closer to the place where she\u2019d been dreaming of his touch. He was drawing it out as long as possible, making her breath build to pants and causing her body to strain toward him.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Marco, but you can work a woman up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very generous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerous with torture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be worth it. You won\u2019t believe the things I can do with my tongue.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more interested in what you can do with other parts of your body.\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s lips froze with a quick intake of breath, almost as if she\u2019d wounded him, even though there wasn\u2019t anything she could have done, spread out as she was.</p><p>\u201cI hope I live up to your expectations,\u201d he murmured, licking gently up the inside of her thigh until he exhaled, slowly, at the core of her.</p> <p>Jacinda held her breath, waiting. He was so close, his thumb nearly brushing her, just next to his mouth. Her entire world started and ended with the place where she waited for his touch, and she realized she hadn\u2019t wanted anything this badly in a long, long time.</p><p>When his caress came, it nearly ended her. Just the tip of his tongue, wet and gentle, barely dipping to taste her as his thumb pressed, softly, just beside it. She was already wet, dripping with want, and she whimpered and went stiff, beyond desperate for more. Lick by lick, he teased her, tasted her, touched her, pressed in the tiniest bit, nowhere close to satisfying her, taking his time as he had promised. One finger slid into her with infinite patience, his tongue probing her most secret of places. Marco was just as frustrating in bed as he was on his feet, and she loved and hated it with equal measure.</p><p>Since Liam, all her lovers had been fast and brash and pounding and innocently selfish, easy to lose herself in for a night and just as easy to forget come morning. But Marco\u2019s touch brought her back to herself, reminded her of what it was to yearn and want and need. She couldn\u2019t escape it, couldn\u2019t escape him, couldn\u2019t escape the feeling writhing in her chest, the hunger, the needing.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>One long, deep lick, tongue flat, enough to make her shudder. \u201cPlease what, sweetness?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust . . . please.\u201d</p><p>He put his lips against her and hummed, sending a thrum throughout every cell of her body. \u201cHmm. Please go more slowly?\u201d</p><p>She groaned. \u201cCurse you and your damn lips, Marco Taresque.\u201d</p><p>He paused, set his forehead against her thigh. \u201cCare to rephrase that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. No. Faster. More.\u201d He licked her again, and she whimpered. \u201cPlease. More.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled against her, slid a second finger in beside the first, and curled them as if he knew every inch of her body as well as he knew his knives. His tongue began to work her with purpose, pushing in and out in perfect time with his fingers, and she met his rhythm with every breath, with the little moans and whimpers that escaped her as her head thrashed back and forth. Her fingers were numb around the iron bars, her hands forgotten in the frenzy he\u2019d built inside her.</p> <p>\u201cBetter?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cSo close. Still not enough. All of you. Now.\u201d After one last, forceful, hard push of his tongue, he withdrew, leaving an emptiness behind where his fingers had brought her to the edge of a release she felt sure he wasn\u2019t ready yet to give her. The knowledge was thrilling, that he was so attuned to her body after so little time, that he was reading every signal she threw. She felt like an instrument in his hands, as if he knew how to coax songs from her that she didn\u2019t yet know how to sing.</p><p>Marco moved up, one knee at the juncture of her thighs, flush against the place his fingers had filled almost perfectly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t let go of the bed yet. Good girl.\u201d</p><p>He wrapped his hands around hers and bent his mouth to her lips, kissing her long and deep and fitting his knee more snugly between her thighs. His fingertips trailed down her arms, tracing over the fabric of her undone jacket until he came to the plain of her exposed chest, her breasts still floating over her corset and aching for his touch. He licked and sucked and teased them, but she could feel his patience turning to hunger, could sense that he couldn\u2019t go on like this much longer, drawing out her pleasure while denying his own. One by one, he unlatched the hooks down the front of her corset, kissing down the valley of fevered flesh until the last one popped free, exposing her utterly. As she gulped a deep breath, he licked a long line straight up from her navel to her throat. In a heartbeat, he was back at her navel and circling there, briefly, before dipping below the waist of her skirt.</p><p>Before she could twist her hips to show him the buttons, he\u2019d already undone them and begun to slip the heavy skirts and petticoats down her hips, his mouth lingering on the ticklish flesh of her hipbones. She lifted herself up, helping him slide the skirts off completely and toss them onto the floor. With a sigh of bliss, she wriggled all over, glad to be free of the heavy layers of fabric. His hands ran reverently over the curves of her, tracing and cupping and brushing as if he\u2019d never seen so much of a woman before. When she looked up, she was moved by the softness and awe in his eyes. He caught her looking and leaned over to take her face in both his hands and kiss her with such tenderness that her desire melted away, for just a moment, into bliss.</p><p>And then his finger found her again, testing the wetness pooled between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI think you might be enjoying this.\u201d</p><p>He began to ease in one finger, and she tossed her head and whimpered. \u201cI want to touch you, Marco. Please let me touch you.\u201d</p> <p>He shook his head no, but ever so softly, he said, \u201cDo, then.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers ached when she unwound them from the iron, and her head swam when she sat up. With tentative hands, he helped her draw off her jacket and unwrap the corset, and then she was completely naked before him, a field of sweetly flushed freckles and soft red hair. The way he stared with liquid violet eyes, as if she was an angel, made her feel cherished and beautiful and fierce. Jacinda slipped from the bed to stand between his knees, the wood floor cold under the balls of her feet.</p><p>With trembling hands, she began unbuttoning his shirt, pausing only to gasp when he cupped a breast in each hand and held them together, licking every curve. The soft black linen fell open, and she untucked his shirt and drew it down over his shoulders, skimming her hands down the smooth, hard muscles of his biceps and scratching her nails through the dark, curly hair on his forearms. Her eyes were drawn by a series of thick white scars that stood out from the golden skin of his shoulder, side, and chest.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and shook his head, turning it into a smile. \u201cBeing a daggerman has its perils. Like beautiful women throwing themselves at me.\u201d</p><p>She knelt in one smooth motion, his knees on either side of her. Kissing down his chest, she ran her hands over the curve of his ribs, over hard muscles, down to that elegantly delicious line where his hipbones made a V pointing somewhere lovely. Marco held perfectly still, his eyes closed, letting her do her work, his hands making fists in the coverlet as if he was afraid to touch her. After running her hands along his thighs and to his knees, she sat back on her haunches and slowly, so slowly, undid the buttons on his breeches. He leaned back and groaned as he sprang free, and she was smugly gratified by the evidence of his desire, that he had taken such time to drive her mad with hands and mouth while he felt the same hunger she knew.</p><p>The deadly Marco Taresque looked so very vulnerable this way, torso bared and head thrown back, throat exposed and eyes closed, wild hair tangling down his back. And she very much wanted to shock him, to drive him mad. And so, with her hands on his knees, she bent and took him deep into her mouth. He groaned and tensed and growled as she tasted him, just as slowly as he\u2019d tasted her.</p><p>\u201cNo . . . I don\u2019t . . . I can\u2019t . . .\u201d</p><p>Without pulling away, she innocently mumbled, \u201cCan\u2019t what?\u201d around him.</p><p>With a growl, his hands caught her waist and pulled her to standing, and her excitement ratcheted up a notch with his sudden ferocity and need. He pulled her close and gazed up into her eyes, and it was like falling into a cave of ever-twilight, into a dark, echoing, endless chasm.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re unspeakably beautiful.\u201d He laid his face against her side, nuzzling, and she tugged fingers through his dark, silky hair, waiting for his next touch, for him to finally initiate the release they both craved. But he made no move.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Marco?\u201d</p><p>His lips tickled her ribs as he spoke. \u201cEverything. I want to taste every inch of you and meet you a thousand ways for a thousand nights and hear you scream in my ear as you shatter under my mouth.\u201d He pulled away, traced her curves up and down with his fingertips. \u201cBut since you\u2019re asking, let\u2019s start with this.\u201d</p><p>He spun her around and sank his teeth into her ass briefly as his fingers found her, spreading her lips and pulling her back gently. With a smile of satisfaction, she spread her legs to straddle his knees. Ready as she was, he slid in easily, perfectly, deliciously, making her gasp as she settled against him. He let out a strangled sigh and set his forehead against her shoulder, and for just a moment, she imagined she felt the wetness of a single, solitary tear.</p><p>Then Marco\u2019s arm wrapped around her, pinning her hands to her chest, and he rocked forward tentatively. With a little \u201cOoh,\u201d she moved with him, grinding against him slowly. He moved her hair aside and caught the nape of her neck with his lips, finding a steady rhythm that battered against her, striking deep inside. With his arm still around her, his fingers wrapped around both of her wrists, she leaned forward, testing his strength, changing the angle just slightly, and his groan thrummed down her neck, down her spine, adding to the pooling pleasure at the core of her. His free hand roamed her body, cupping her breasts, pinching her nipples, and skimming her ribs, following the crease of her thigh to the crux of her, where he rubbed in time, moving faster in counterpoint to his thrusting.</p><p>Jacinda threw her head back and wrenched her arms free with a growl. Her hands found his thighs, finally, and she rode him without shame or regret or thought, becoming a being of pure hunger and desire and hot, wet sweetness, with no past, no future, no deep-down sorrow. As many times and ways as she\u2019d imagined being with Marco since the first time she\u2019d laid eyes on him, it was better still than that.</p><p>He fit perfectly with her, moved perfectly, knew just how to work her flesh with mouth and hand in a wild frenzy that drew her into ecstasy, into forgetfulness, into that pitch-black, starlit abyss where nothing mattered but this, but him, but the movement, the feeling, the riding. And still they moved faster and faster, until only his arm kept her upright and in one piece. She arched her back against him and whimper-screamed, her head over his shoulder and her fallen hair streaming down his back as he caught her mouth and swallowed the panting whimpers of her crest. With one last cry, she clenched her muscles around him and kissed him hard, until she felt the rhythmic pumping of his own release. The kiss ended when his climax ignited a second bloom of pleasure deep inside her, and she had no choice but to lean back against him and ride it out in one long, high scream. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She went silent and collapsed against him, and Marco fell bonelessly back onto the bed, taking her with him. Rolling off his body, she put her head to his chest and smiled at his slow, steady heartbeat.</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman,\u201d was all he could say before closing his eyes and going completely limp, his booted feet still on the floor and his undone breeches flung open.</p><p>\u201cDamn, yourself.\u201d</p> <p>He flinched, and she nuzzled closer. \u201cMaybe I should just say \u2018Wow\u2019 and leave it at that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, indeed.\u201d</p><p>He curled an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close, brushing her hair back from her temples. \u201cIf I\u2019d known it would be that good, I might not have resisted for so long,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI had my suspicions.\u201d She ran a hand over the dark hair fuzzing his chest. \u201cBut I always like it when I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>.11.</p> <p>The afternoon passed with that sweet, slow discovery of things above the neck. He liked poetry and read well, and she curled on the bed happily while he paced in breeches and boots and wooed her with words. She found his violin case under the bed when she stubbed her toe and persuaded him to play a little for her. It was slow and mournful and made her think of looking up through pine boughs at the winter sky, just before the snow came. After delving into her girlhood, he unearthed that she had once sung opera, and clad in nothing but her skin, she sang a few rusty arias for him, for which he went still and wide-eyed and reverent, which gratified her.</p><p>He kept an eye on the clock, and she felt a twinge of sadness when he rose to prepare for the night\u2019s show. His breeches had been utterly ruined, and she watched appreciatively as he pulled off his boots and stockings to change into a new pair that fit just as well. For all their leisurely and time-consuming lovemaking, she hadn\u2019t seen his body fully exposed before then. Jacinda lay back and watched him go through his ministrations as if he were a classical statue brought to life, all strong lines and ideal curves and masculine power balanced with beauty and just the right dusting of dark hair. Only the scars marred his perfection, and she felt a twinge of doubt. Had she just slept with a murderer? He\u2019d given her his body but not his truth. Had he shared himself with Petra like this . . . before she disappeared?</p><p>\u201cYou going to come watch me throw some knives, sweetness?\u201d</p><p>She jumped guiltily. Of course he wasn\u2019t a murderer, no matter how dangerous he appeared, no matter what the carnivalleros whispered, no matter what some biased rumor rag printed. He was watching her in the mirror as he brushed his hair and tied on his bandanna, and her heart softened at the smile in his eyes. She reluctantly stood and stepped into the petticoats puddled on the floor. She\u2019d been here for hours, naked and learning about the mysterious man she\u2019d needed so badly to bed. But now . . .</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the show. And I like the private show better. I\u2019ll be in my conveyance, working.\u201d</p><p>His eyebrows went down. \u201cAbandoning me already?\u201d</p> <p>She stepped behind him, pressing her bare chest against his back and wrapping her arms around him. He was about half a foot taller than she, and on tiptoes, her chin fit just over his shoulder with a possessive intimacy that made her feel warm all over.</p><p>\u201cYou have your work, and I have mine. I\u2019m not some fawning girl who\u2019s incomplete without a man and needs to follow you about, mooning like a fool. But I\u2019ll be counting the moments until the caravan is closed for the night and you\u2019re knocking on my door.\u201d</p><p>That seemed to satisfy him, and he turned his head to kiss her cheek. She went back to the pile of clothes, unlacing her corset so that it would fasten down the front again and then pulling the laces just enough for decency. The skirt billowed over her head, and the jacket covered her arms. Her legs felt naked and free without the stockings, but the matched pair was ruined now, thanks to his clumsy knife throw.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s twice you\u2019ve missed,\u201d she said, holding up the slithery gray silk to show the bloodstained slice where his knife had found her ankle. She\u2019d totally forgotten about the wound, couldn\u2019t even feel it anymore as she laced on her boots.</p><p>\u201cThe first time was your fault. You dropped the card.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the second time?\u201d</p><p>He stepped close, fully costumed and ready for the show, all vestiges of vulnerability replaced by the raw power that had originally drawn her to him against her will. \u201cThe second time wasn\u2019t an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou hit me on purpose?\u201d</p> <p>He tangled his hand in her hair and pulled her close, kissing her hard and deep and reminding her how very easily he could make her insides quiver.</p><p>\u201cAnd look how nice it turned out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sly dog. I can\u2019t believe you cut me just to get me into your wagon. I would have followed you in here willingly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFollowed me? Girl, you broke in once already! But I wanted it on my terms. I wanted you in my arms, not driving me before you like some idiot sheep. And I wanted to give you a reason to run, if you were looking for one. Getting involved with me . . . well, I\u2019m dangerous. And I\u2019m not a man who lets go of things easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike your past, for example?\u201d</p><p>A rueful sadness filled his violet eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t rush me, sweetness. A man can\u2019t give up all his secrets at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you. In time. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She sighed melodramatically and buttoned up her jacket. He watched her fingers, not blinking, his desire to see the jacket back on the ground all but palpable. \u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll be waiting to screw it out of you in my conveyance after tonight\u2019s show.\u201d</p><p>His eyes raked her as she twisted up her hair. \u201cWhat\u2019ll you be wearing?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, smug as a cat in cream. \u201cNothing but a smile.\u201d</p><p>Before he could kiss her, she turned and left, letting her hips swing. She didn\u2019t look back, just shut the door behind her as she stepped down to the ground. Far away, she could hear the banks rumbling over the moors, packed with city people, their pockets filled with clinking vials and coins. The carnivalleros were all in the wagons, preparing, as Marco was, for the night\u2019s show. Being seen by the audience before everything was perfect was considered a grand misstep, and Criminy himself was walking the perimeter with a copper monkey scampering at his side, checking that all was in place.</p><p>The smug and knowing smile he gave her made her roll her eyes. What did she care if the ringmaster knew what she\u2019d been at with the knife thrower?</p><p>\u201cFinding success in your endeavors, Mrs. Harville?\u201d he asked, giving her a polite bow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting what I need, yes.\u201d She kept walking toward her conveyance, and he fell into step beside her, swinging the monkey up onto his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not distracting my daggerman, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs much as possible, yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would upset me, if not for my wife\u2019s charming insistence that your continued presence is the only way I can keep him among us. It\u2019s hard to find a good knife thrower, you know. Especially one with such a lively reputation. I hope you don\u2019t plan on ruining it with the pesky truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just vexed that I\u2019ve been chasing him instead of interviewing you for your chapter in the book.\u201d</p><p>The ringmaster threw his head back and laughed, a wild sound that suited him perfectly. \u201cFor a journalist, you certainly have an honest streak,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, go back to your conveyance and find some new stockings before the two-headed Bludmen smell what you\u2019ve been up to and get hungry. It would be such a shame if you died before you immortalized me in prose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take orders from you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d just hate to see you get hurt before you can completely corrupt my daggerman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco\u2019s a big boy. And I\u2019m not one of your carnivalleros, you know.\u201d She flounced away to hide her embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cKeep telling yourself that, pet,\u201d he called with another mad laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re practically his assistant, which means you\u2019ll be asking me for wages soon.\u201d</p><p>A shiver ran up her spine at the word \u201cassistant,\u201d but when she turned back around to shout at him, the ringmaster had disappeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one\u2019s assistant,\u201d she muttered under her breath. \u201cI\u2019m a goddamn journalist.\u201d</p><p>She was beyond the caravan lights now, out among the wilder winds of the moors. A bludbunny darted out for her, and she kicked it away, wondering where Brutus had gotten off to. She\u2019d left the metal dog on Marco\u2019s doorstep, but she\u2019d seen no sign of it since emerging and had forgotten to leave it with orders. It had malfunctioned before and was programmed to return to the homing beacon in her conveyance. Still, out here, without her guard or an escort, she felt ill at ease.</p><p>The field between her conveyance and the warm lights of the caravan felt larger, wilder, and colder than it did in the daylight. Thunder grumbled menacingly, and Jacinda hurried faster, stumbling over a rogue bludbunny and almost falling into the waist-high grass. Back on her feet, she broke into a jog and didn\u2019t look back until she stood on the steps of her conveyance, unlocking her door by gaslight with shaking hands.</p><p>Gazing back down to the caravan that was beginning to feel like home, she shivered. Criminy was nowhere to be seen, and the carnivalleros were in place, waiting for the crowd that was moving down the moor in a frightened cluster of bright silks. No one looked toward the shadowy conveyance on the hill. And yet she felt eyes on her, danger hovering near, dogging her every step since she\u2019d left Marco\u2019s wagon.</p><p>Perhaps she should have gone to watch Marco\u2019s show, paid her copper to wander again among the glittering golden lights and laughter, where things felt safe. But no. Foolish fears had never stopped her before, and they wouldn\u2019t now. She didn\u2019t know if Criminy had been joking about the dangers of his pet Bludmen and the wild animals, if there was any real threat other than the same strangely oppressing darkness that hung always over the moors. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Drawing her curtains, she realized what was missing. She wouldn\u2019t feel safe again until the dangerous daggerman was back in her arms.</p><p>.12.</p><p>Once she was fortified with a cup of hot tea splashed with whiskey, Jacinda took great care preparing herself for Marco\u2019s visit. She\u2019d spent time within the labyrinthine walls of a sultan\u2019s harem once, and the women had taught her all the ways to entice a man using the full force of her beauty. With candles arrayed along the windowsill and soft rain beginning to play in counterpoint to the song she hummed under her breath, she bathed with a soft cloth and rubbed rich creams into her arms and legs. She plucked every hair that was out of place, lined her eyes with kohl, and brushed her hair a hundred strokes until it shone like fire in the candlelight. And although she\u2019d told Marco she\u2019d wear nothing, she slipped into a nearly transparent lace shift she\u2019d found in a Paris boutique while shopping with a daimon courtesan.</p> <p>Midnight came, and she arranged herself on the bed like an odalisque, waiting for Marco\u2019s knock to ring out over the sudden thunder of raindrops on the conveyance roof. At one o\u2019clock, she yawned and went to check the door, to see if perhaps a shadowy form was crossing the moors under a dark umbrella, his eyes deeper than the sky. The door swung inward, and movement caught her eye. An envelope, pinned to the wood by one of Marco\u2019s knives.</p><p>Her hands shook as she pulled out the knife and slammed the door on the sputtering raindrops. Had he made good on his earlier threat and run from her, even after the intimacy and mutual hunger they\u2019d shared? Was he having second thoughts about having a physical relationship, much less the real one she was starting to crave?</p><p>There was no wax seal, and the paper was damp but not soaked. She hadn\u2019t heard the knife, nor had she seen a shadow under the door. Moving to her bed, she clicked on the lamp and unfolded the paper. The familiar writing was hurried and frantic, the paper crumpled as if he\u2019d written it against the conveyance wall.</p><p>Meet me at 3 Cocklebur Lane in Scarborough. I\u2019ve leased a small cottage by the shore where we can be alone for a while. I\u2019m ready to tell you everything.\u2014M.</p><p>Her heart had sunk upon seeing the envelope instead of the man, but it rose again when she read the last line. If he was ready to tell her the truth, surely that meant he felt the same attraction, longing, and fondness, that the dangerous daggerman was ready to finally open up.</p> <p>She shed the nightgown and dressed in her heaviest adventuring gear, because even if her heart was ready to rush to him, her mind knew well enough that crossing the moors alone at night could be dangerous, even in a conveyance as well appointed and rugged as hers. Although the seaside was lovely, there were still bludseals to consider. Strapping her leather corset on over her canvas dress and pulling on thick gloves and the bracelet she always wore, she willed her heart to still and sought her thickest boots. Best-case scenario in this getup: she\u2019d enjoy Marco\u2019s delicious slowness as he labored to undress her.</p><p>Brutus hadn\u2019t returned to her conveyance, which troubled her. The mechanical dog was programmed to return when its orders were in question, but sometimes heavy rain could cause it to short out. She dug out her emergency homing beacon and pressed the red button, willing the dog to live up to the grand price she\u2019d paid for it and function according to its programming. When it hadn\u2019t arrived at the door within five minutes, she decided she would ready her weapons and go anyway. Making brash decisions was her general mode of operation, and she wasn\u2019t about to let one malfunctioning metal mutt keep her from Marco\u2019s body and heart. She\u2019d never trusted clockworks too much, anyway; not enough brain for her needs.</p><p>Powering up the conveyance, she flicked on the outside lights and rain wipers and undid the brake. The caravan was dark as she rumbled past, with only one light shining from the dining car. She smiled to herself, hoping that Demi and the daimon boy might be sitting in a booth, fidgeting with their cups and flirting awkwardly. For a homeless collection of mismatched wagons and people, the caravan was starting to feel a little like home.</p><p>Scarborough was the nearest city, and she remembered passing the white chalk cliffs and mostly abandoned seaside villages on her way to find the caravan. She followed the black ruts left by the banks over the lashing moor grasses, all the way to a high hill that showed the shifting sea, black and unfathomable, beneath a towering, jagged city like a beehive plastered in flotsam. When the bank tracks met the road to Scarborough proper, Jacinda turned left, maneuvering carefully down the white shell path that led to the beach roads. The rain had turned to drizzle, and the road was cut diagonally to keep it from being too steep and toppling the various conveyances of seagoers and fishermen. Her fingers clenched the trembling wheel as hard as they had curled around Marco\u2019s bed earlier.</p><p>As the main road leveled out and began to split off onto smaller avenues, she anxiously looked for Cocklebur Lane. She nearly missed the narrow white path bordered by a cliff, turning the conveyance on two wheels at the last possible moment. It was a tight fit, and the road was more of a footpath, but she wasn\u2019t about to get out in the dark, alone, to feel her way along sharp rocks.</p><p>A light soon appeared\u2014a lantern hanging from the front porch of a stone cottage that would have been charming with just a little more attention. The porch sagged, the flowers in the pots were dead and crumpled, and a mobile of shells and bones clattered helplessly in the breeze from the ocean. At least there would be no blud creatures about, this close to the salty sea spray. Well\u2014almost.</p> <p>She parked the conveyance and went to her bed, where she\u2019d laid out the many weapons she\u2019d picked up during her travels. The boomerang, the machete, the crossbow, the seawater gun, the brass knuckles with claws that fit over her fingers perfectly. Her main concerns here were giant lobsters and bludseals, which had developed a special oily coating that allowed them, alone of all blud creatures, to touch the sea\u2019s salt and survive. Practically nothing worked against lobsters, of course. Nodding to herself, she tied the machete\u2019s leather holster around her waist, took up her notebook and pen, and stepped down to the sand.</p><p>Outside, the drizzle had given way to air heavy and cold with mist, the sea spray floating toward her like formless ghosts and stinging her eyes. The wildness of the place appealed to her, and she smiled up at the sky, at the electricity latent in the clouds. She started up the path, her boots crunching on the crushed white shells. When the door opened to reveal Marco\u2019s shadow silhouetted with light, she sped up and gave him her fondest smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for this,\u201d she called over the sea\u2019s pounding.</p><p>He said nothing as she skipped up the creaking steps, and she squinted to see his face in the blinding light. What she saw chilled her to her bones. It wasn\u2019t Marco. It was a woman with a knife.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting, too,\u201d the woman said.</p><p>.13.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Marco? What is this?\u201d</p><p>The woman stepped forward until Jacinda could separate her form from the shadows. She was petite and perfect, with large, arresting golden eyes and shiny black hair cut short to show ears heavy with tribal baubles. Looking Jacinda up and down, the girl twirled one of Marco\u2019s knives between her fingers, quick and sure.</p> <p>\u201cSo this is what Marco was waiting for? You\u2019re so pale and round, like a city cow. To tell you the truth, I\u2019m disappointed.\u201d She pointed the knife at Jacinda\u2019s hand, now on the hilt of her machete. \u201cThrow that into the yard, and put your hands up. Now. I\u2019m as quick with a blade as my beloved Marco, you know. He taught me well.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, her eyes never leaving the girl, Jacinda obeyed, untying the belt and tossing the heavy knife out into the sand. The girl nodded slowly, and with a sick turn of her stomach, Jacinda suddenly realized whom she faced.</p><p>\u201cSo you must be Petra. Funny, you don\u2019t look murdered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither do you. Yet.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda stiffened, her eyes sliding sideways, looking for a weapon, an egress, an ally. The girl was clever. She must have been responsible for Brutus\u2019s disappearance, and Jacinda had utterly fallen for it, despite her paranoia. But where was Marco, and why did he say nothing? If he was in the house, surely he would come to her rescue?</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done with Marco?\u201d</p><p>The girl smirked as if they shared a joke. \u201cNothing he hasn\u2019t done with you and me. He\u2019s tied up. Come in and see.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda didn\u2019t move, and the girl twirled the knife in her face.</p><p>\u201cLet me be clear: come in and see, or die on the porch. And don\u2019t try anything funny, or he takes a blade in his soft parts.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing hard, Jacinda nodded. The girl opened the door wider and jerked her head inside. With one last, desperate look to her conveyance and the freedom of the sea, Jacinda stepped into the blinding light of the windowless cottage.</p><p>Lamps were hung everywhere, and a fire smoked in the heart. The walls were whitewashed and crumbling, the wind whistling in through cracks and carrying flurries of sand and dust. The smells of salt and fish and decay were overwhelming, with just the faintest hint of copper. Bile rising in her throat, Jacinda turned to find Marco pinned to a makeshift target of weathered wood. Ropes held him spread-eagled, tied tightly around wrist and ankle and wrapped thickly around his neck, his face an angry shade of puce. Knives nestled in the wood against his sides in blooms of blood. His eyes were wide with fear and anger, and her gray silk stocking trailed out of his mouth, silencing him.</p><p>\u201cMarco . . .\u201d</p><p>He shook his head no.</p><p>\u201cYou wanted the truth, didn\u2019t you? Here\u2019s the truth. Marco is mine and always has been.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda\u2019s temper flared. Before she could stop herself, she said, \u201cHe wasn\u2019t yours this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Quick as a whip, Petra slapped her\u2014using the hand not holding the knife. Jacinda\u2019s cheek went red, her fury burning up to the roots of her hair.</p><p>\u201cDid Marco tell you he likes to take his time? Because that\u2019s where I learned it.\u201d Petra walked to Marco, slender hips swaying in patchwork breeches, and gently ran the blade of the knife down his cheek. \u201cCan\u2019t go killing you quick, no matter how much you try to provoke me. Plus, I promised I\u2019d tell you everything, and I think someone should know, at least for a little while.\u201d She snatched Jacinda\u2019s notebook and tossed it into the fire, where the pages caught and curled over, black. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jacinda had never been angrier, but Liam had taught her, long ago, how to continue using her brain in a life-or-death situation, even when her body and temper betrayed her. It was the reason she was alive, and he wasn\u2019t. She took a deep breath through her nose, her hands shaking and cold.</p><p>\u201cSo tell me.\u201d</p><p>Petra spun, flinging her knife at Marco in a glittering silver arc that, before now, had given Jacinda a little rush of excitement. Now she just waited to see if the girl had drawn blood and, if so, how bad it would be. The knife was a hair\u2019s breadth from Marco\u2019s wrist but hadn\u2019t pierced his skin.</p> <p>\u201cWe grew up in neighboring caravans, my Marco and me. He was taught knife throwing, and even though I wished to learn with him, I was sent among the women to cook and clean and care for the snot-nosed brats. He gave me one of his knives, and I practiced in secret, and whenever our families circled the wagons, Marco would help me, teach me to throw. When it became clear that I caused nothing but trouble among the women, I was sent to his caravan to be his assistant.\u201d She walked to him, pulled out the knife, and paused, assessing him. \u201cThere was hope that he would marry me and settle down, but he resisted. And I did my best to break his resistance, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda felt the bile rise in her throat, watching the girl run her pinkie finger around Marco\u2019s lips. He couldn\u2019t move his head, but his nostrils flared with anger.</p><p>\u201cHas he kissed you sideways?\u201d Petra said. \u201cI taught him that.\u201d</p><p>Fighting for control but unwilling to let the little fiend gloat, Jacinda rolled her eyes and crossed her arms. \u201cIsn\u2019t this all a bit petty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPetty? Have you ever loved someone for ten years, offered them your heart and your body on a platter again and again, and had them pat your head like you\u2019re a tame dog? Every day that he strapped me onto the target, I prayed that he would hit me, that my blood or tears would force him to care for me even an ounce, touch me with any true feeling, but he never missed. Not once.\u201d She walked up to Jacinda, pointing the knife right at her eye. \u201cUntil yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been following him? Watching him?\u201d Jacinda swallowed. \u201cWatching us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEver since that night on the outskirts of London. Ever since I promised him everything and he turned me down, wouldn\u2019t even bed me. And I sliced him up so badly he went on the run out of shame. The Deadly Daggerman they called him. Everyone thought it was my blood. But he was too much of a coward to fight back, too much of a coward to admit he wasn\u2019t man enough to take a girl\u2019s virginity. Too much of a coward to admit he\u2019d been beaten by a woman half his size. Didn\u2019t even care enough to strike me, dripping with blood in his own wagon. Just ran away in shame.\u201d</p><p>Jacinda was lost in her imagination, remembering the picture in the paper, the cleaver splattered with blood. And now she knew where that story had come from: this girl. Her, and her knife, and Marco\u2019s blood seeping from those white scars she\u2019d found on his body.</p><p>\u201cRunning away in shame doesn\u2019t sound like the Marco I know.\u201d</p><p>Petra sneered and flung the knife again. It thudded into the wood between his thighs, barely a finger\u2019s width away from his pants. He flinched and looked away. \u201cYou don\u2019t know him like I do. He plays a good game, knows how to make a girl scream, but he can\u2019t close the deal. He\u2019s not even a man. Did you know he\u2019s a virgin?\u201d She cocked her head, staring at Jacinda with narrow eyes. \u201cOr he was.\u201d</p><p>Stunned, Jacinda looked at Marco\u2019s face, gauging his reaction. His eyes were wide, begging. And she knew, deep down, that if Petra knew the truth, they would both die here tonight.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps he has his reasons,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cDamn his reasons!\u201d Petra roared. \u201cWhat happened in his wagon today? No blasted windows. Did he kiss you? Did he use his mouth on you? Did he say that he loves you? Because he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t love anything or anyone.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes closed, tears trailing from long eyelashes. She stormed to the target and wrenched the knife from the wood, slamming it back into the target again and again in the unscarred space between his arm and his leg, closer and closer to his chest. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I make you love me, you bastard?\u201d</p><p>With Petra\u2019s back turned, Jacinda slipped the bracelet off her wrist and felt around to the reed that had been painted black. Marco\u2019s eyes flew wide, and she shook her head at him. As Petra spun back around, the knife pinched between thumb and forefinger and arm flung back to throw, Jacinda put the reed tube to her lips and blew explosively. A tiny feathered dart found Petra\u2019s cheek as the girl\u2019s arm jerked downward, her knife flying straight for Jacinda\u2019s chest.</p><p>.14.</p><p>The blade pounded into Jacinda\u2019s belly, and she gasped and stumbled backward. She didn\u2019t feel anything at first, just the impact of the throw. And she wasn\u2019t willing to look down yet and see the damage, because as long as Petra was standing, so she would be standing.</p><p>Across the room, the slender girl twitched, her fingers clawing at the tufted dart embedded in her cheek. Jacinda felt a small point of pride; the dart\u2019s poison would work even faster, considering the needle had pierced the girl\u2019s mouth. Through saliva and blood, it would swiftly travel all through her body, rendering her paralyzed. Jacinda had picked up the unusual weapon and the skill to wield it in the jungles of Africa and kept it always on her wrist, well aware that most of Sangland\u2019s inhabitants didn\u2019t even know such a thing existed. Brutus was the muscle, but this tiny needle was the brains.</p><p>As Petra threw the dart to the ground, she tripped and fell on her side. Only then did Jacinda allow herself to look down at her belly and see the damage done by a spurned woman with wicked aim. But all she saw was a dented scar on her leather corset. Running her hands up and down, she realized that the knife must have struck her with the unsharpened side rather than the piercing tip. Thank heavens for small miscalculations. She exhaled in a rush and plucked the dull silver from the floor before rushing to the target and pulling the stocking from Marco\u2019s mouth.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d he asked, breathless, and she could only shake her head no.</p> <p>\u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. But I\u2019ll live. Will she?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda looked down at the girl\u2019s form, still but for shallow breathing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s enough poison in that dart to take down a lion, so I don\u2019t actually know what it\u2019ll do to a person. The bludgazelle I shot with one never got up again. But she won\u2019t be able to hold a knife for a long time, in any case.\u201d</p><p>Petra\u2019s eyes rolled to her, glazed and unfocused, and Jacinda stepped around her to untie the rope choking Marco\u2019s neck. When she\u2019d finished with his wrists and legs, she helped him step down and immediately checked the bloodstained places left on his body by Petra\u2019s knife. She felt the tiniest shred of pity for the pathetic creature and her mad obsession but not enough to unleash her on the world again, no matter Marco\u2019s pride.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not as bad as it was last time.\u201d He put one hand to his side and pulled it away bloody. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been practicing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you let her go, after that.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled ruefully. \u201cTo be quite honest, I was in no shape to chase anyone. Just dragged my carcass off to heal. I never dreamed she would be so obsessed. I had no idea. If I had known she was following me, watching me. Watching us . . .\u201d He shook his head, reached to squeeze her hand.</p><p>She squeezed back. \u201cYou did warn me that being a daggerman is a dangerous job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is being a daggerman\u2019s lady,\u201d he said with a smile somehow both grateful and mischievous. \u201cNow, aren\u2019t I late for a date in your conveyance?\u201d</p><p>She raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cYou are. And as I tend your wounds, you\u2019re going to tell me what it was like, losing your virginity this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>He looked down, sheepish. \u201cIt was welcome. And way overdue. But I think you\u2019ll be especially interested about what happens now. That\u2019s the part you might regret.\u201d</p><p>.15.</p><p>Late as it was and considering they were both in shock, they blew out all the lamps and left the cottage for the short walk to Jacinda\u2019s conveyance\u2014after tying Petra securely to the target. She was still breathing, and Jacinda planned on delivering her to Criminy Stain\u2019s justice by the light of day. But first, there was business to attend to. With the conveyance door firmly locked from the inside and the sea pounding just beyond, Jacinda dumped her weapons off the bed and stripped Marco of his shirt. It wasn\u2019t the way she had planned to get him naked, but it would have to do.</p><p>She tended his wounds with water and a healing salve from her travels, then bound the shallow slices with soft bandages made of her torn stockings. As she fed him biscuits from a tin and brewed the tea, he leaned back against her pillows and rubbed his eyes tiredly.</p><p>\u201cSo that bracelet you always wear\u2014it\u2019s been a weapon all along?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda grinned and sat beside him, careful not to jostle his wounds as she held up the bracelet of reed tubes. \u201cSmall, pretty, hidden in plain sight. It\u2019s a traditional Abyssinian weapon, although putting it on the bracelet was my idea. They tend to wear them as necklaces or stuck through their ears.\u201d He traced a finger over the inside of her wrist. \u201cA little ostentatious, for my tastes. Liam said . . .\u201d She trailed off, and he curled his fingers around hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Liam say?\u201d</p><p>Jacinda squeezed her eyes against the tears that always threatened. \u201cHe said I should have a hole put through my nose, as the Abyssinian warrior women do. He was half serious.\u201d A few tears escaped, and Marco caught them on his finger and gently stroked her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with sadness, and I don\u2019t expect you to stop loving someone you lost. Never be sorry for talking about him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe died defending me, you know. It was so stupid. Should have been just another scuffle in the street. But the man who made a vulgar offer for me . . . he was big, and he hit hard, and Liam\u2019s head struck the stone wrong. He died in my arms. And that\u2019s when I decided I had to learn to defend myself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Marco held her close, stroking her back. \u201cI can\u2019t complain about that. You certainly saved my life tonight, sweetness. And I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>For a few moments, she finally gave in and allowed herself to grieve in Marco\u2019s arms, feeling safe for the first time since that night. When the kettle whistled, Jacinda took it as a sign to put away her sorrow. She straightened, brushing the tear trails away and getting up to fix the tea.</p><p>\u201cEnough about me. Stop stalling and spill. I was promised a story about a handsome virgin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAlways so hungry for a story.\u201d He settled back against her sultan\u2019s pillows. \u201cI guess Petra already told you what you originally wanted to know. She caught me on the moors tonight, on the way to your door. She was always too fast and strong by half, for such a little thing, and she said she\u2019d kill you outright if I didn\u2019t go with her. What she told you about our childhood was true\u2014and it\u2019s also true that I saw her as a little sister, not a lover, and definitely not a wife.\u201d Jacinda handed him a mug of tea, and he wrapped his fingers around it with a grateful smile. \u201cBut the main issue is a prophecy my grandmother made when I was very young, although I always called it a curse. Nonna\u2019s a fortune-teller. Not like Lady Letitia\u2014she reads palms.\u201d His eyes went far off. \u201c \u2018Listen well, Marco Taresque. Where you sow, you\u2019ll reap. Where you lie, so you\u2019ll stay. Guard your virginity, for the woman who takes it will be your own forever. Choose carefully.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jacinda shivered, and not only with the realization of the gift he had given her that afternoon and the repercussions to come, if one believed in prophecies. She remembered all too well that one strange night she had spent with a traveling caravan outside of London on her way to find the famous Criminy Stain. Like a knife in the heart, she recalled exactly the way one old woman had regarded her, eyes twinkling across the bonfire.</p><p>\u201cI think I met her. She told me how to find Criminy\u2019s caravan,\u201d she said softly. \u201cShe admired my leather corset and told me to be careful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like Nonna. As I grew up, I asked her again and again if there was a way around it, if she would look at my palm again and see if something had changed. There I was, young and handsome, girls throwing themselves at me, and I couldn\u2019t get my grandmother to elaborate on whether any seed I spilled would shackle me to a woman forever. It was torture. Pure torture. Even if I\u2019d wanted to bed Petra, I would never have taken the chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re so good at . . .\u201d</p> <p>Marco smiled sheepishly, looked down, ran a hand through his hair. \u201cIf you\u2019re a man like me, living in a caravan, you find a way to please women so well they don\u2019t speak of your noble refusal to bed them. They only talk about your proficiency and generosity in other realms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo today . . .\u201d</p><p>He reached over, took both her hands in his own. \u201cI should have told you first, but I couldn\u2019t turn away from you anymore. Everything about you calls to me. I either had to take you or die of longing. I\u2019ve never wanted a woman, wanted anything, so bad.\u201d</p><p>She cupped his face in one hand, noting for the first time that his eyes were the same wild violet as the old woman\u2019s. \u201cDo you think your grandmother knew it would be me? And that\u2019s why she told me where to find you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, nestled his cheek in her palm. \u201cWho knows what that old devil sees? When we sat around the fire as children, she used to beckon us close with a finger. \u2018I know a secret,\u2019 she would say. \u2018I know who goes to heaven and who goes to hell.\u2019</p><p>\u201c \u2018How do you know, Nonna?\u2019 \u201d I would ask.</p> <p>\u201cHer smile was twisted and dark and smug as she answered, \u2018You go where you think you will go.\u2019 \u201d</p><p>Jacinda chuckled and kissed his cheek. \u201cWhat does any of that mean, Marco?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means you saved my life tonight, and I\u2019m indebted to you. The night that I disappeared, Petra went mad, out of control. Just like tonight. Threw my own knives at me, raged against me, tried to take me against my will. The punishment for hurting your own in a caravan is death, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to condemn her for loving me to the point of madness. She ran away, and I ran away. I couldn\u2019t admit the curse of my virginity. I couldn\u2019t send her to death. I couldn\u2019t stay there, among my brothers, carrying scars from a woman. So I ran away and let people say of me what they would.\u201d He pulled her into his lap with a groan, cradling her gently against his bandaged chest. \u201cI\u2019ve never told anyone about what happened. I didn\u2019t think I ever would. I was basically committed to dying a virgin with a very talented tongue because I\u2019d never met anyone I wanted to be shackled to forever.\u201d</p><p>She twined her fingers with his. \u201cWhy me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause when I saw you for the first time, I finally understood the obsession Petra had felt for me. I wanted you, no matter what. Even if it meant confessing everything to you, even if it meant driving you away to protect you. And even if it meant that you stabbed me in the heart rather than spend forever by my side. I just knew.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cYou didn\u2019t show it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve gotten good at hiding my real feelings behind my smoldering good looks and wicked smile. Besides, if I\u2019d made it easy for you, you wouldn\u2019t have chased me. And I do like the way you chase me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to miss that, now that you\u2019re stuck with me?\u201d</p> <p>He stroked her hair and flicked the brass clasps down her leather corset, one by one. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever stuck, Jacinda. If you\u2019ll have me, I figure it\u2019s my turn to chase you\u2014all around the world on your adventures. I want to see more of sang, and once Petra\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll be totally free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll show you the world.\u201d She smiled and stood, dropping her corset with a thud and walking to her desk. She rolled back the top, selected a new notebook, and cracked the cover, opening it to the front page. \u201cBut first, you\u2019ve got to heal. And I\u2019ve got a book to write about a certain caravan. Starting with Marco Taresque, the Deadly Daggerman who never misses a target.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI missed once,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cYou might have nicked my leg, but my heart took all the damage.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
