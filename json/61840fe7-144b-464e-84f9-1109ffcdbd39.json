Unfortunately, this wasn\u2019t someone in a costume.</p><p>\u201cIs that any way to talk to your mother?\u201d Samantha Denning-Markham-Lloyd braced her hand against his chest and shoved him out of the way to enter his condo uninvited. The tap-tap-tap of her ever-present stilettoes clattered against the hand-scraped hardwood floors and echoed off the high ceilings, resounding through his downtown Dallas loft.</p> <p>As he followed her across the foyer and into the great room, she picked up his remote and turned off the football game with a dramatic sigh. The TV mounted on the exposed brick wall went dark\u2014sort of like his mood.</p><p>\u201cNo, really, Mom. I wasn\u2019t watching that or anything.\u201d He crossed his arms over his chest.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in three years, and you\u2019d rather gawk at grown men chasing an oblong ball? Don\u2019t you even have a hug for your mother?\u201d</p><p>Samantha had barely allowed him to touch her, even when he\u2019d been a little boy. Now, she only ever wanted something from him when her life had gone to hell and she wanted help fixing it. \u201cYou mean like we\u2019re a warm, well-adjusted family? They usually spend Christmas together. But oh, you didn\u2019t show up last year, like we\u2019d planned. Thanks for not calling to let me know you weren\u2019t coming. I had a fabulous holiday alone, thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Samantha sighed. \u201cYou have your father\u2019s sarcastic streak. I could live without it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad I can\u2019t. Is there a reason you couldn\u2019t return my messages? I haven\u2019t moved or changed my number for the last few years, so I know you didn\u2019t fail to call because you had trouble finding me. I assumed you were too busy with husband number three for your only son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here for guilt.\u201d She waved his words away, and he noticed that her ring finger was currently bare. \u201cLloyd is long gone. The poor bastard went bankrupt. I couldn\u2019t possibly stay.\u201d</p><p>Jason supposed that whole \u201cfor richer or for poorer\u201d thing didn\u2019t mean much to Mommy Dearest. \u201cSo you dumped him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs it happened, I met another man about the same time. Robert swept me off my feet.\u201d</p><p>Translation: He had a lot of money and spent a nice chunk on her. \u201cSo you left Lloyd for Robert. Beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was,\u201d she defended. \u201cWe had a fabulous wedding in Fiji. You would have loved it.\u201d</p> <p>Doubtful, but since he hadn\u2019t been invited and it sounded like the union was over, his opinion was moot. \u201cIs the divorce final yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. He just filed last week.\u201d She pursed her artificially plumped lips as much as the injections allowed, looking a bit like a three-year-old in the body of a woman on the downhill slide to sixty. \u201cHe met a girl making a music video, of all things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA musician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She scoffed. \u201cA model strutting around in a bikini and spreading her legs on the hoods of cars for the camera. She convinced him that he still had the libido of a man half his age. Now they\u2019re engaged.\u201d She gave him a dainty huff. \u201cI kept up my end of our prenuptial, as I have with every husband. I remained a size four. I played the gracious hostess for all his boring business parties. I even gave him the requisite blow job once a week.\u201d</p><p>Jason winced. \u201cTMI, Mother...\u201d</p><p>So Robert had left her\u2014a first for Samantha. She was used to men of all ages falling at her feet and offering her the world. She was usually the trophy. Maybe those days were over.</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t tell much difference in his mother\u2019s appearance since he\u2019d seen her a few years ago. She stayed in impeccable shape with a personal trainer. A stylist dressed her. She religiously saw an esthetician and had a plastic surgeon on speed dial. Most people wouldn\u2019t think her more than a day or two above forty.</p><p>She fluffed her artificial blonde hair and shot him an impatient stare. \u201cDon\u2019t you have anything to say?\u201d</p> <p>Not really. Though he sensed the incident had broken her ego more than her heart, she still hurt. \u201cIs he refusing to honor the terms of your prenup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but...\u201d She paced, looking out over the Dallas skyline all lit up in its evening glory yet not really seeing.</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d he prompted. The sooner she said whatever she needed to get off her chest, the sooner she would leave.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s thirty-five years older than her. It\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Jason refrained from pointing out that billionaire Charles Denning had been thirty-two years Samantha\u2019s senior when she\u2019d married him. She hadn\u2019t believed the age gap ridiculous then. Since his mother had given birth to him six months after she and his father exchanged vows, Jason didn\u2019t think his mother had wooed his father away from his first wife of twenty-seven years with her scintillating conversational skills. Pointing that out now would only make her snit worse.</p><p>\u201cDo you want a glass of wine?\u201d A few of those usually solved her problems.</p><p>She shook her head and unwound her cashmere wrap, then tossed it at him. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mix well with my Xanax, and I can\u2019t afford the extra calories. I\u2019m looking for another man, one younger than me. I\u2019ll show Robert.\u201d</p><p>His mother sounded bitter. He wasn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019d always acted as if the world owed her something.</p><p>It was going to be a long evening.</p><p>Jason paced to the fridge and grabbed a beer, then tossed himself onto the black leather sofa, peering at the cityscape. He should probably keep his mouth shut. After all, he knew damn well that she hadn\u2019t come to him for advice, probably money and sympathy\u2014in that order. But she was all the family he had left. Even if she hadn\u2019t been much of a mother, she was his.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should take some time to be alone, consider what you really want in a marriage before you dive into number five. There\u2019s a reason things never work out, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d she shot back. \u201cYour father died on me when you were barely thirteen. I was married to Daniel Markham for over a decade before he got stingy.\u201d She sighed. \u201cLloyd and I had a good five years, then...like I said, he went broke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd Robert couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants. Got it. I\u2019m just saying that maybe some soul searching wouldn\u2019t be all bad before you get involved again,\u201d Jason suggested.</p><p>She cut him a blue-eyed glare as she perched on the edge of a gray suede chair and crossed her ankles. \u201cWhat would you know? You\u2019ve never been married.\u201d</p><p>Jason froze. He should probably shut up now, but he\u2019d learned a thing or two lately. \u201cActually, I\u2019m currently married. Have been for almost a year.\u201d</p><p>With that admission, a familiar weight pressed into his chest, unbearable and suffocating. Anger charged his veins. The constant, nagging pain followed. He shoved it all down and blanked his face.</p><p>Samantha reared back, eyes wide with shock, as if he\u2019d just said he kept Godzilla as a pet. \u201cYou married? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried. That\u2019s what the invitation to spend some family time last Christmas was supposed to be about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, well. I didn\u2019t know. You didn\u2019t invite me to the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was somewhat...impulsive.\u201d Because at the time, he\u2019d thought that if he didn\u2019t own that woman in every way possible, he would go insane.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d slipped a ring on her finger and taken her to bed. Sadly, none of that had kept him from losing his damn mind.</p><p>He\u2019d been a stupid bastard.</p><p>Samantha\u2019s surprise deepened. \u201cYou\u2019re never impulsive. And you\u2019ve always expressed utter contempt for marriage.\u201d</p><p>For years, he had. The not-so-shining examples around him had convinced him that he should never attempt happily ever after. That no one should. But she had been different. He\u2019d been right about that. But he\u2019d been so fucking wrong, too. He\u2019d taken a stab at marriage, and the blade had cut him deep.</p><p>\u201cWho is she?\u201d Samantha rose to her feet, looking all around. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Jason dragged in a deep breath and gritted his teeth. \u201cShe isn\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>And she was probably never coming back. The truth fucking hurt.</p><p>For once, his mother looked genuinely concerned about him. \u201cSo you\u2019re separated? Have you started divorce proceedings yet?\u201d</p><p>It had crossed his mind...but Jason couldn\u2019t make himself call his lawyer. Some senseless part of him kept hoping that if he gave her more time, she would return.</p><p>It\u2019s been three hundred forty-four days. What are the odds she\u2019ll come back to play happy wife?</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas she violated her prenup? You do have one, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do, and she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>His mother looked around his condo. All sleek black leather, chrome, floor to ceiling windows, and pristine kitchen\u2014without a feminine touch anywhere. Every square inch of the place screamed bachelor pad. Samantha might be a pain in his ass, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. She\u2019d know his wife didn\u2019t live here and never had.</p><p>\u201cHow has she not violated the terms of the agreement? You were specific, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI outlined how much money she would receive after every milestone anniversary if we divorced. There\u2019s a sunset clause after twenty-five years. There\u2019s a division of assets in the event of my death.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cTypical stuff, but nothing she violated.\u201d</p><p>Samantha wagged a finger at him, looking aghast. \u201cJason Edward Denning, you know better than that. You\u2019re a young, good-looking billionaire. You could have any woman you want in any way you desire. Didn\u2019t you spell out her duties with regard to the house? The living and sleeping arrangements? The type and amount of sex?\u201d</p><p>Jason stifled his anger. He\u2019d wanted her to be a real wife; he hadn\u2019t wanted to buy her. \u201cI kept it simple. Unlike your Prince Charming, Robert, I declined to contractually obligate her about how often I wanted oral gratification.\u201d</p><p>His mother rose and crossed the room, sitting beside him to lay her delicate fingers on his knee. \u201cThat\u2019s your mistake. You just need to be detailed with her. Surely, if you made yourself clear\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted her to choose to be with me. She didn\u2019t and now she\u2019s gone. End of conversation.\u201d</p><p>Growing up steeped in wealth, he\u2019d seen all sorts of couples marry for reasons that had far more to do with money than devotion. Not that he didn\u2019t understand a man\u2019s desire for companionship while protecting his assets. But from those interactions, he knew that relationships were a barter, affection bought and paid for. The currency might change, but the concept didn\u2019t. Meeting his wife had somehow altered his opinion.</p><p>He\u2019d not only appreciated and deeply admired her altruistic, self-sufficient nature, he had married her because of it. Eventually, he\u2019d hoped she would be the mother of his children because she brimmed with honesty and fought for what was right. For her, nothing had been about money, but loyalty and kindness. Caring. He\u2019d trusted her more than he\u2019d ever trusted a female. She put family first. Jason had never imagined the traits he\u2019d once admired so much would bite him in the ass. Or that she\u2019d not only leave him, but deny his most basic rights as her husband and her Dom\u2014to help and protect her\u2014proving that she didn\u2019t trust him at all.</p><p>Then again, hadn\u2019t that been a recurring theme for them?</p><p>\u201cCall your attorney,\u201d his mother advised. \u201cMaybe you can \u2018clarify\u2019 the terms of the agreement. Then she\u2019ll have to sign and recommit or you\u2019ll box her into a corner and she will have to leave the marriage first. And in that case, she won\u2019t receive anything, right?\u201d</p><p>Yes, he could do all that. But she would only hate him for it. For some reason he couldn\u2019t fathom, he found that idea intolerable.</p><p>Jason slammed his beer on the glass-top table and rose. \u201cI\u2019m going out. If you need a place to stay, there\u2019s a guest room at the top of the stairs and to the right. If you need money, there\u2019s ten grand on my dresser. You\u2019re welcome to either. But if you\u2019re here when I come back, my marriage isn\u2019t a subject open for discussion\u2014ever.\u201d</p><p>Club Dominion was closed on Sunday nights, but Jason kept a private playroom here and had round-the-clock access to it. The moment he let himself into the dark, still dungeon, he realized it wasn\u2019t the room he sought, but the memories.</p><p>Quickly making his way down the hall, he pictured his wife as he\u2019d first seen her, arresting a rowdy drunk in the parking lot who\u2019d been harassing females entering. She\u2019d been questioning the club\u2019s owner, Mitchell Thorpe. Despite the badge on her chest and the holstered gun at her side, everything about her expression and posture had shouted that she leaned submissive. When she\u2019d looked at him with her soft, dark eyes, Jason\u2019s need to possess her had slammed into him like a visceral force. But she\u2019d been gone before he could even learn her name. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The next evening, he\u2019d spotted her out of uniform, entering Dominion with Thorpe, who both escorted and explained. Jason hadn\u2019t wasted a second before approaching her. The Dungeon Master had introduced the beauty as Greta. An oddly German name for an obviously Italian girl, but he accepted that she\u2019d chosen a club name as a way to protect her anonymity, especially important since she worked in law enforcement.</p><p>They\u2019d talked that first night for hours, mostly about the lifestyle, what she secretly yearned for, what she wanted to understand...and what he would be more than happy to give her.</p><p>For over a blissful year, Jason had. Casually at first, of course. He purposely didn\u2019t form attachments to others. It wasn\u2019t logical when so many merely sought him for his net worth. But from the start, his wife had been different.</p><p>Over time, she\u2019d grown from an anxious novice, unsure if she truly wanted to pursue the lifestyle, to an eager, if somewhat willful submissive. During those months, he\u2019d learned her beautiful soul, and their connection had grown. Shockingly, she lacked interest in his money or stature. At first, he\u2019d wondered if her silence on the subject was a ploy to disarm him. Then his infatuation had kicked in, and he\u2019d stopped thinking altogether.</p> <p>When he\u2019d been foolish enough to make their relationship permanent, everything had gone to hell. Now he had a wound with her name on it. He\u2019d tried to patch and heal it...but he\u2019d never been successful. Since Jason wasn\u2019t accustomed to failing, the bleeding bothered him even more.</p><p>\u201cHi, Denning.\u201d Thorpe stepped out of the shadows. \u201cIt\u2019s been weeks since you\u2019ve darkened these halls. What are you doing here tonight? Not a lot of action.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe leaned against the wall, his pose seemingly casual. Bullshit. Nothing the man ever did lacked purpose.</p><p>Jason shrugged. Thorpe was one of the few who knew he\u2019d married \u201cGreta\u201d and that it hadn\u2019t worked out. Thankfully, he\u2019d never asked questions.</p><p>Unfortunately, Jason had a hard time maintaining a similar silence. \u201cHave you heard from her?\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe cocked his head. \u201cGreta is no longer a member here.\u201d</p><p>That made Jason stiffen and his seeping wound throb. \u201cThat\u2019s not her name. Don\u2019t treat me as if I don\u2019t know any better. I\u2019m her fucking husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy apologies.\u201d Thorpe\u2019s tone was smooth and somehow not apologetic at all. \u201cGia is no longer a member, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe let her fees lapse? I\u2019ll pay them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. She called me last month to revoke them. I refunded her the unused portion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd it didn\u2019t occur to you to call me first?\u201d He tried not to sound like he was seething.</p> <p>Apparently calling him hadn\u2019t occurred to Gia, either. In fact, she had reached out to the club owner before she\u2019d contacted her own husband. More unexpected pain whacked him. Dominion had been his first common thread with her. The place had brought them together. And she had renounced it without a word.</p><p>\u201cGia asked me not to. I respected her privacy, just like I do everyone in this club.\u201d</p><p>Just then, a petite pixie of a brunette padded through the dungeon with her phone pressed to her ear and a grin on her face. Her tinkling laughter somehow brightened the room. Even from a distance, Jason saw her blue eyes dance with a hint of mischief.</p><p>No way Thorpe failed to miss it, either.</p><p>\u201cYou mean like you\u2019re protecting Callie\u2019s privacy now?\u201d Jason drawled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d he questioned. \u201cUnless I miss my guess, she\u2019s on the phone with Sean. She accepted his collar months ago, but you\u2019re eavesdropping on her conversation like whatever she says or does is still your business.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe watched the beauty as if he\u2019d forfeit a limb for the chance to touch her. Once, the two of them had been close\u2014not lovers, but certainly more than friends. Jason had no idea what had caused their rift, but clearly the club owner wasn\u2019t letting go. And as Callie stole a longing glance at her boss, Jason knew Thorpe\u2019s feelings weren\u2019t one-sided.</p> <p>\u201cListen to me because I\u2019m only going to say this once.\u201d Thorpe clenched his jaw. \u201cI protect every woman who passes through those doors, regardless of who or what they require shielding from. Your wife chose this separation. I\u2019m respecting her wishes. I suggest you do the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you enjoy the distance between you and Callie these days?\u201d Jason watched the woman end her call with a happy little sigh that left him little doubt she had feelings for Sean. Thorpe looked ready to spit nails. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, but you let it happen. That\u2019s your choice. Good for you. But I didn\u2019t ask for this separation from Gia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d Thorpe said.</p><p>Regardless of the platitude, the man wasn\u2019t going to budge. Thorpe, of all people, should fucking comprehend how agonizing this situation was.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, Jason resisted an unusually violent urge and tried and another tactic.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find my wife. I\u2019m worried about her. She was going through a great deal of personal trauma when we split. She sold her house, disconnected her number. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s all right or needs my help. She\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my client. I\u2019ve sworn to protect her privacy. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>His empty apology nearly yanked the leash off Jason\u2019s inner caveman. Maybe being alone for the last eleven and a half months had finally unhinged him. Maybe it was that damn hollow ache gashing his chest and infecting his judgment. Maybe seeing his mother had shown him the future he now stared down. Whatever.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not putting my fears to rest.\u201d He gritted between clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t want to argue with Thorpe. The man was as bendable as steel. But he refused to give up because he wasn\u2019t going to heal without seeing Gia again. \u201cTell me something. What would you do if Callie left Dominion\u2014and you\u2014without warning?\u201d</p><p>Thorpe\u2019s face tightened as he searched for the right response. \u201cThere is no place she can go where I won\u2019t find her.\u201d</p><p>Jason saw his opportunity and seized it. \u201cBut what if she disappeared? Wouldn\u2019t you goddamn look for her and want to chew the head off of anyone who kept her from you?\u201d</p><p>With a sigh, Thorpe sized him up. Resolution crossed his face. \u201cCome into my office and have a drink. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>That sounded like as much fun as a lobotomy, but it was progress. Besides, the Dungeon Master had left him little choice.</p><p>After trailing the man into his well-appointed office, Jason sat in a cushy leather chair. Thorpe lifted a cut crystal decanter of Scotch from a heavy cabinet and poured him a glass. With a nod, Jason took it. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>After rounding his sizeable desk, Thorpe sank into what could only be called his throne. \u201cStart at the beginning and fill in the blanks for me. Tell me what I\u2019m not seeing in this picture.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Thorpe would intervene only if he heard the facts and decided the situation warranted his help. Jason didn\u2019t particularly like the idea of the other man as judge and jury.</p><p>\u201cYou know the basics.\u201d He really didn\u2019t want to air his dirty laundry. He revisited the moments he and Gia had shared enough in his head.</p><p>Yes, he could hire a private investigator, but he knew exactly how that would chafe Gia\u2019s independent nature. He would find her again, but she\u2019d be too mad to speak to him. If he wanted to locate his wife and have any chance of reconciling with her, he had to play this Thorpe\u2019s way.</p><p>Leaning back in his seat with a sigh, Jason tried to decide where to start. Not the first big scene he\u2019d set up with \u201cGreta\u201d at Lakeside Park late one night. His wife had exhibitionist urges\u2014and a lot of Catholic good-girl upbringing to overcome. She\u2019d been unable to let go that night, and it had become a disaster.</p><p>He\u2019d recovered quickly and staged another scene at Dominion a few days later, more private but still public enough to give her a thrill. Logan Edgington, another member of Dominion, and his wife Tara, at the time an FBI agent in field training, had witnessed his lovely sub stripping down to her skin, exposing her newly waxed pussy, then masturbating for her unknown audience. She\u2019d surrendered to him entirely, giving him every bit of her body for the very first time. Jason still remembered how perfect she felt clinging to him, clutching his cock inside her snug little cunt. He\u2019d suspected even before then that \u201cGreta\u201d was special, but that nooner had sealed the deal.</p><p>No sense in spilling those details to the club owner. Because Logan had seen it, the former SEAL had undoubtedly shared it with his buddy Thorpe. Even if Logan hadn\u2019t, Thorpe somehow knew most everything that happened under his roof.</p><p>Jason swirled the Scotch in his glass. Where to begin? Not the early days of their courtship, but later...when she\u2019d finally trusted him with her real name, when everything between them had become genuine. The beginning of the end.</p><p>\u201cLast November, I invited Gia to a benefit dinner for the homeless. It raised money for a shelter and kicked off a coat drive. She\u2019d seen enough of my life by then to know that we\u2019d be photographed and that people would speculate. At first, she told me that she didn\u2019t own a dress fancy enough for a five-thousand-dollar-a-plate dinner. I offered to take care of it. She insisted I take the money I would have spent on her ticket and a dress and donate it because those people needed it far more than she did. She was the first woman I\u2019d ever met who turned down money.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe sipped his drink. \u201cAnd that shocked you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCompletely. I was already infatuated with her. But her selflessness...did something to me.\u201d And he\u2019d never recovered.</p><p>He swallowed, remembering that he\u2019d driven to her house that night, uninvited, and fucked her like a man possessed. She\u2019d been surprised, but welcoming. Happy, even. The night had been extraordinary, and he\u2019d realized then that he hadn\u2019t scened or had sex with anyone else since meeting her. He hadn\u2019t wanted to. A first for him.</p><p>\u201cThe next day, Gia called me because she\u2019d heard on the news that the same foundation would be serving an early Thanksgiving dinner to the homeless downtown and that I would be there helping. She surprised me again by asking if she could come along to lend a hand. When she refused the benefit dinner, I\u2019d wondered if she didn\u2019t want to be seen with me and gossiped about. But no. She really just didn\u2019t want to take money that would help the needy. Instead of accepting a Versace gown so I could wine and dine her, she offered to donate food, cook, clean\u2014whatever we needed.\u201d</p><p>Jason had seen Gia\u2019s big heart and lost his head. As he\u2019d stood beside her and dished out trays of food to the homeless, he had totally fallen for her. A pressing need to make her utterly his assailed him. He\u2019d been unable to talk himself out of it, so he\u2019d set the wheels in motion.</p><p>\u201cYour wife is a good person. I understand the circles you were raised in. A big heart is both very rare and very attractive.\u201d Thorpe looked out the open door of his office and spied on Callie, tidying up around the silent dungeon\u2014and sneaking a peek Thorpe\u2019s way.</p><p>The yearning on the man\u2019s face told Jason that he did, in fact, perfectly comprehend.</p><p>\u201cThe day after Thanksgiving, I took Gia to dinner.\u201d He gave a self-deprecating grin. \u201cIf I\u2019d been thinking, I would have realized that The Mansion on Turtle Creek wouldn\u2019t have been her first choice. I probably also would have chosen a more modest engagement ring, something more her style.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe looked mildly amused. \u201cHow big was it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe center stone was about five carats, cushion cut, set in platinum with another two carats surrounding it. I might have gone overboard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMight?\u201d Thorpe raised a brow.</p><p>Jason shrugged. \u201cOkay, so I did. My wife isn\u2019t a little thing like Callie, but the ring looked huge on her hand. I don\u2019t even know if she liked it. She didn\u2019t say a word other than \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d</p><p>That had been one of the happiest nights of his life. Gia was the most genuine person he knew, and she made him look at everything in a different light. With her around, he could be more generous and grateful, even optimistic. Other than an isolated childhood, life had been pretty damn good to him. But she\u2019d made everything perfect for that idyllic forty-eight hours.</p><p>\u201cYou hustled her to Vegas the next day?\u201d Thorpe asked, though he knew the answer.</p><p>After keeping her in his bed all night long. \u201cI did. I wasn\u2019t going to give her any time to change her mind. By that Saturday afternoon, we were married. We had the penthouse at The Venetian, along with all the room service and champagne we could consume.\u201d</p><p>And they\u2019d had each other. That incredible night\u2014the only he\u2019d ever spent with her as his wife\u2014was forever etched in his memory. Hands down, it had been the best of his life. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhen did things start to roll downhill? From my vantage point, it looked awfully fast.\u201d The Dungeon Master swallowed back the last of his booze, then glanced at Callie as she pranced past his door again.</p><p>Thorpe didn\u2019t like having emotions for the girl. A hundred bucks said they made him feel somewhere between uncomfortable and unwise. Jason related.</p><p>\u201cThat Sunday at four a.m., Gia received a call from her father saying that her brother had been killed in the line of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard. He was a cop too, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. His partner at the time was the only one who witnessed the shooting deep in South Dallas gang turf. He apparently stayed with Tony rather than running the asshole down. None of the other units were willing to come into that neighborhood to back him up and track the thug down. Gia was heartbroken. We rushed home. And that\u2019s when things went wrong.\u201d</p><p>That\u2019s when the terrible hemorrhaging had set in.</p><p>\u201cShe was going through a lot,\u201d Thorpe pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd like an idiot, I stepped back to give her space because she asked me to.\u201d He rubbed at his forehead, where he felt a headache developing. \u201cDuring that conversation, she admitted that she\u2019d never told her parents about me. She hadn\u2019t met my mother either, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I didn\u2019t really understand what a big deal family was to her until it was far too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she say why she turned you into her dirty little secret?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. She\u2019s from a family of police officers. Her parents wanted her to marry some guy named Enzo, another cop they\u2019d handpicked for her. He\u2019s a member of her church, and she\u2019s known him all her life. Gia swore that she married me because she loved me. Whatever that means.\u201d Probably not relevant since it hadn\u2019t lasted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s the kind of woman who would lie about her feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIntentionally, no. I think she liked the fantasy of me better than the reality. When faced with the prospect of telling her family about the guy who wasn\u2019t Catholic and didn\u2019t have a drop of Italian blood in his veins...not so much.\u201d He shook his head. \u201cUntil then, I\u2019d never heard that money didn\u2019t fix everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe she just needed time to tell them gently.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understood why she didn\u2019t want to spring the surprise on them the day her brother died, but I thought she\u2019d do it in the next few days. Certainly before the funeral. But she didn\u2019t. Instead, she attended without me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOuch.\u201d</p> <p>Jason hated to admit even now the agony that had caused him. He\u2019d needed to lend her support, hold her hand, and be her rock. But she\u2019d turned away from him and anything he might have provided her. Instead, she\u2019d disregarded their vows and elected to do everything for her family alone. In some ways, he\u2019d been proud as hell. He\u2019d been fucking infuriated, too.</p><p>\u201cShe barely called that first week. Never came to see me. I left her umpteen messages. It didn\u2019t take long before she stopped returning them. A week slid into a month. I\u2019m not unfamiliar with the mayor. I asked him to poke around to find out what the hell was wrong. He did some digging, and I learned that Gia was consoling her parents and helping her sister-in-law through an injury of some sort. She was also caring for her nephew and newborn niece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had a lot of people counting on her. Her communication could have been better, but you can\u2019t fault her heart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. However, I can fault her for turning into a one-woman vigilante squad, determined to bring down the gangster who\u2019d killed her brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, if you discovered that she was gunning for him, you absolutely had to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I did,\u201d Jason confirmed. \u201cAs soon as I found out, I called and left her another message, told her that she had twenty-four hours to contact me or there would be hell to pay. I\u2019d had enough. I missed my wife. She hadn\u2019t let me lift a finger to help her, goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. A day went by. Then another.\u201d He dragged in a deep breath. \u201cShe didn\u2019t bother to refuse; she just didn\u2019t acknowledge me at all.\u201d</p> <p>Thorpe sat up, leaned across the desk. \u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep. Instead, she went back into that ghetto and tried to arrest the punk by herself. And he shot at her. I was fucking done.\u201d</p><p>Thorpe winced. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. What did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI reached out to a few people, called in favors, greased palms.\u201d Jason shifted in his chair. \u201cI had her put behind a desk. There was no way I was going to stand by and watch her get killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that got her attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, she came to see me that night, angrier than hell and itching for a fight. I was dumb enough to give it to her. She threw her ring back at me and stormed out. Hell of an early Christmas present.\u201d He smiled grimly and shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to her since.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d tried. For months, he\u2019d called. Not to apologize. He wasn\u2019t going to say that he was sorry for trying to keep her safe, especially after she\u2019d backed him into a corner. But he\u2019d left messages asking her to fucking talk to him, to at least meet him halfway. Nothing. The last time he\u2019d called her, he\u2019d gotten a recording that her number was disconnected. Somewhere between fed up and worried, he\u2019d climbed into the car and driven across the city through rush hour and road construction to her house\u2014only to find that she\u2019d moved out months ago and new owners had taken her place.</p><p>Never once had Gia asked for his help. She\u2019d just picked up and carried on with her life as if he didn\u2019t matter. No, as if he no longer existed.</p><p>Damn it, his chest throbbed again.</p><p>\u201cThese last months must have been difficult, but you did the right thing. After all, you can\u2019t force her to submit if you doesn\u2019t want to put herself in your hands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t I fucking know it.\u201d Jason raked a hand through his hair. \u201cSince she apparently wants nothing to do with me, I keep expecting her to file for divorce. I\u2019m surprised she hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight now, that\u2019s not possible since I can\u2019t find her.\u201d No, that was an excuse\u2014and he knew it. \u201cEven if I could, I\u2019m not ready to quit. We only had twelve hours together as man and wife to decide if we were compatible. I\u2019ve seen people get divorced quickly, but even that would be a record.\u201d Besides, their time together had been damn near perfect. And he had to understand why she\u2019d ended all contact and cut him off at the knees. He might have to give her up eventually, but he refused to do it without a fight.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know Gia\u2019s side of the story,\u201d Thorpe admitted. \u201cWhen she called to revoke her membership, she sounded stressed and upset. I pressed gently, but she wouldn\u2019t talk. I\u2019d be violating my own rules if I gave you her current contact information, but I can call and ask if she\u2019d be willing to speak to you.\u201d He sighed, sneaking a sideways glance at Callie. \u201cBecause if someone left me like that, I wouldn\u2019t rest until I had answers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Gia Angelotti sat across from Jason and tried not to visibly shake. Impossible. He always rattled her.</p><p>The restaurant she\u2019d chosen for their meeting was loud and public, busy for a Tuesday night. Chatter filled the air, along with the faint notes of mariachi music floating from the overhead speakers. A young Hispanic man set salsa and a bowl of chips on the table between them. She barely noticed because she couldn\u2019t do anything except stare at her husband.</p><p>God, he looked good. His dark hair appeared recently razor trimmed. His eyes lured her, such an intense crystal blue made even more striking by the two days of stubble and his stark white collar. A charcoal suit coat accommodated his broad shoulders perfectly. Then again, he\u2019d likely had it made to fit him.</p><p>Seeing him again kicked her with a bittersweet pang. She\u2019d missed him so much.</p><p>Tonight, they had only exchanged clipped pleasantries, and Jason looked through her like a stranger. Maybe she shouldn\u2019t have come. But Gia knew she owed him.</p><p>A year ago, he would have kissed her breathless, then probably spanked her for the fun of it before commanding her body to stunning ecstasy. She\u2019d always surrendered herself, as if he held some sway over her. As if he alone held the key to her pleasure. But he inflamed more than her flesh. His blazing wit intrigued her. His absolute command of himself and everything around him compelled her. Then last Thanksgiving at the charity dinner for the homeless, Jason had given her intimate glimpses behind his walls, into his compassion. How many billionaires would take the time to serve someone penniless?</p><p>As they\u2019d talked, she\u2019d been struck by how few people he seemed to have in his life. He rarely discussed friends and never mentioned family. His lonely solitude had tugged at her heart. Gia ached to help him, heal him because under that stern mien, he had a good heart. When he\u2019d asked her to marry him, she couldn\u2019t say anything but yes.</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cI was surprised when Thorpe called and said you wanted to see me.\u201d</p><p>For a precious moment, she held her breath. He was going to serve her with divorce papers; she just knew it. That would hurt like hell, but Gia understood. She\u2019d been unable to be a wife to Jason, and he had every right to move on. Maybe she would see their split as a blessing someday...in the very distant future.</p><p>She\u2019d been stupid to hope that her fairy tale would end happily ever after. They were from different worlds. What did a sophisticated mogul want with a blue-collar girl who liked pizza and beer and quiet evenings at home? Gia had always thought of Jason as her gorgeous prince. His demeanor might be a little sharp and definitely Dominant, but he had so much to give besides money.</p><p>Sadly, no matter how much she loved him and always would, they would never have a happy ending.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to talk to you, and you didn\u2019t leave me any choice.\u201d Anger sharpened his tone.</p><p>Gia tried not to wince. She hated disappointing him. \u201cYou\u2019re right, and I fully accept that responsibility.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything for an uncomfortable minute, just stared expectantly. \u201cThen would you care to explain why my own wife ceased speaking to me?\u201d</p><p>The explanation brought up so many painful memories, but he deserved to understand. \u201cI was going through a lot and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would have been there for you, but you cut me off at the balls. I couldn\u2019t help you since you didn\u2019t tell me what the fuck was going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life changed completely, and you didn\u2019t sign up for all that. I didn\u2019t think it was fair to drag you through my muck. We\u2019d been married for, like, five minutes, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive minutes or five decades, we were still married. My number one job was to give you what you needed, and you didn\u2019t give me the chance.\u201d</p><p>She felt his rage thick in the air between them, sizzling across her skin, pulling at her chest. Gia had to fight not to plead with him, to point out that he\u2019d made mistakes, too.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let me explain.\u201d She paused, bracing herself to relive the last terrible year. \u201cMy sister-in-law, Mila, had given birth to my niece, Bella, just a month before Tony was killed. She was already showing signs of postpartum depression, but the evening after the funeral, she tried to commit suicide by shooting herself in the heart with his gun. Another inch to the right and she\u2019d be dead.\u201d</p><p>He sat back, his expression shocked before he softened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Is she all right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. We covered up her attempted suicide so that she wouldn\u2019t lose the kids. She still struggles with depression, so I live with them and try to provide stability. I have since last December.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you had told me all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t because there was nothing you could have done. You would only have driven yourself crazy trying.\u201d His lips tightened, and Gia prayed he would understand. \u201cI had two children under the age of three in my care. My nephew didn\u2019t understand why his dad was suddenly gone and his mom wasn\u2019t the same. My parents were too grief stricken to handle the demands of two little kids, and my mom isn\u2019t as mobile as she used to be. I had to handle everything while still holding down my job. Thank God for daycare. But I needed another pair of hands and I didn\u2019t expect you to provide them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You were overwhelmed, and I would have helped you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I didn\u2019t picture you changing diapers and warming bottles for two a.m. feedings.\u201d</p><p>His expression went from remote to downright chilly. \u201cWhat had I ever done to make you believe that I\u2019d leave you to deal with everything alone?\u201d</p><p>Nothing. Maybe it was unfair, but his playboy image hadn\u2019t given her the idea that he was prepared to cope with kids. The one time she\u2019d been to Jason\u2019s condo before their marriage, she\u2019d been struck by how spotless\u2014and cold\u2014the place looked. Black, chrome, glass...everything that would show fingerprints. Floating stairs a child could easily tumble down. Walls of windows with a balcony that a curious toddler might be able to scale and fall twenty-four stories to his death. Unfair, perhaps, to judge Jason\u2019s ability to take care of children by his condo, but in her mind it had been an indication of his lack of readiness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHave you ever even held a baby?\u201d she challenged.</p><p>\u201cI could have learned.\u201d</p><p>True. He was brilliant, and helpless was the last word she\u2019d ever use to describe him.</p><p>\u201cOr I could have hired someone qualified to help you. I might not have any experience with kids, but I\u2019ve got a fortune.\u201d</p> <p>Gia knew that. She\u2019d even thought of asking him for monetary help at the time, but... \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to take on my family crisis. It wasn\u2019t your responsibility.\u201d</p><p>His mouth tightened. \u201cYou are my responsibility. As your husband, your problems are my problems. Instead of giving them to me, you shut me out and shouldered everything yourself. Stubborn, independent...\u201d He clenched his jaw. \u201cYou\u2019re making my palm itch.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t allowed herself to think about how much she\u2019d missed his discipline, his touch. Now, her womb clenched. Her clit throbbed. Her heart ached.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s been taking care of you?\u201d he demanded. \u201cThe bags under your eyes suggest you never sleep through the night any more. Your loose clothing tells me you\u2019ve dropped fifteen pounds you didn\u2019t have to lose. Your hair has grown at least three inches, as if you haven\u2019t had time to cut it. You have a broken fingernail and a shoe that needs resoling. I\u2019m going to guess your pedicure is months old, as is the wax job on your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Gia gasped. Jason had always been observant, but his attention to her every detail left her speechless.</p> <p>He leaned closer, intent. \u201cStop acting as if I don\u2019t know you. I see you. Just like I see that no one has given a shit about you in the last year as I would have.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t refute him. God knew she\u2019d been horrifically lonely. She\u2019d missed Jason so damn much that sometimes the pangs had been every bit as wracking as the physical ache of withdrawal.</p><p>\u201cA million times, I stared at my phone, needing so badly to hear your voice.\u201d She\u2019d yearned for his steadiness and calm control to soothe her.</p><p>\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>\u201cBetween work and caring for the children, I didn\u2019t have anything left to give. I knew that wasn\u2019t fair to you. I couldn\u2019t take without giving back. Besides...\u201d How did she put this into words that he\u2019d understand? \u201cSome nights, I\u2019d rock Bella to sleep, tuck Tony Jr. in, then spend half the night trying to reach Mila, but she\u2019d just lie pitifully on a mountain of pillows in her bed and stare out the window as if her world had fallen apart, refusing to speak. Guilt crushed me. Why should I have what my heart desired when everyone around me was suffering so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou felt guilty for wanting to be happy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s part of it. The other part...\u201d She teared up. \u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t been in Vegas with you that night? I probably would have heard about the shoot out sooner. He called for backup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t on duty that night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut maybe I could have gotten there\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of \u2018what ifs\u2019 and \u2018mights,\u2019 and you\u2019ll never know the answer. Stop beating yourself up for failing to prevent what you couldn\u2019t foresee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve told myself that logically. But I can\u2019t seem to get past the feeling that I let Tony, Mila, my parents, and the kids down.\u201d Gia pressed her lips together to hold tears at bay. After nearly a year, she\u2019d hoped the grief would abate, but she still felt her brother\u2019s absence every single day.</p><p>On the other hand, she\u2019d be lying if she said that missing Jason hadn\u2019t compounded her sorrow.</p><p>Her husband reached across the table and grabbed her hand. \u201cYou\u2019ve endured a lot this year. If you thought you were saving me, you thought wrong. I would have been there for you. We would have faced it together.\u201d</p><p>His tender, emphatic words nearly undid her. Tears stung her eyes.</p> <p>All these months, she\u2019d felt horrible about cutting him from her life, but tried to tell herself she\u2019d done it for his own good. Now... Had she done him a terrible disservice? After all, he\u2019d always seen to her welfare. On their trip to Vegas, he\u2019d treated her like his queen. Maybe he would have stood beside her and found some way to deal with the kids and the chaos. Maybe.</p><p>But Jason had betrayed her, too.</p><p>The waiter came by and took their drink orders. For a moment, they perused the menus. Gia wasn\u2019t hungry. In fact, she hadn\u2019t had an appetite all day. Her nerves about this meeting had been eating her up inside. Still, she knew from experience that Jason would insist on feeding her. In the past, he never let her skip a meal. God, she\u2019d missed his exacting care.</p><p>By the time she yanked herself from her thoughts, the waiter was setting down their drinks and asking what they\u2019d like to eat. Gia ordered a taco salad, then sipped at her iced tea. Jason frowned and ordered fajitas. After the waiter read back their order, he departed. The sounds around the restaurant nipped at their cocoon, but silence hovered between them.</p><p>Gia broke it. \u201cI should have explained everything sooner. I was lost and bottled up. I\u2019m sorry I left you hanging. I was honestly trying to figure out how I could be with you again in some way without my problems swallowing your whole life. Then your phone calls to the brass forced me to ride a desk. After that, I was just furious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t communicating, and I needed answers. Once I got them, there was no way I was going to let you put yourself in the path of your brother\u2019s killer. I understand you were grieving. You were angry at the world and wanted revenge. You wanted to bring this thug down for your parents and your sense of justice.\u201d</p><p>Gia sat back. Sometimes, she wondered if Jason knew her at all. Other times, like now, he understood her so perfectly that he scared her.</p><p>\u201cAs a husband, I was worried. As your Dom, I was giving you hard boundaries the fastest way I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou jeopardized my ability to support my family,\u201d she accused.</p><p>\u201cI would have taken care of them.\u201d He clipped every word insistently.</p><p>\u201cBut they\u2019re my responsibility.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t start that again. We\u2019ve covered that ground.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. You blemished my career.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He narrowed his eyes at her. \u201cI brought your actions to light. You made the choice to go after that scumbag all on your own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to. And thanks to you, I\u2019m still stuck behind a desk,\u201d she spit, her anger clawing its way up from her belly to her chest.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still alive,\u201d he countered, sitting back and crossing his arms.</p><p>His stare assessed her, his irritation vibrating in the air between them. How could she be so angry with him at the same time she yearned to fall to her knees and obey his every illicit command?</p><p>\u201cAnd Tony will never have justice. A killer is still on the loose. My brother\u2019s children will never really know their father. My parents won\u2019t ever be complete again. My sister-in-law doesn\u2019t say a word, but I know she\u2019s tormented that I haven\u2019t caught Ricky Wayman and made him pay for Tony\u2019s murder.\u201d</p><p>Not that Gia had given up. More than once, she\u2019d gone to the thug\u2019s crime-ridden neighborhood alone to seek out Ricky. She didn\u2019t plan to stop until she brought him in. Confessing that to Jason wouldn\u2019t be smart. At this point, she didn\u2019t know exactly what his reaction would be, but she didn\u2019t think it would be pleasant or accepting.</p><p>\u201cWhat if you got yourself killed? How would your parents take that? What would your sister-in-law do without you?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t quite meet his gaze. \u201cSince I\u2019m in no danger of being on the streets anytime soon, I guess it\u2019s not an issue.\u201d</p><p>Jason sent her a hard stare. \u201cYou\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel useless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would still make those same phone calls again.\u201d He grabbed his beer and took a long swallow before setting the bottle far too carefully on the table. \u201cWhat do you want to happen next? With us, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Now came the conversation she\u2019d dreaded and feared, but they had to air this out. \u201cI\u2019m assuming you want a divorce.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t been any sort of wife to him, so that seemed logical.</p><p>Instead, he just looked pissed off. \u201cYou\u2019re assuming?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go on this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinally. Something we agree on.\u201d He leaned in again, elbow braced on the table as his stare snared hers. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to give you a choice: Spend between now and our anniversary with me\u2014and I mean twenty-four/seven with me, in every fucking way I deem. If the twenty-fourth rolls around and you still want a divorce, file. I won\u2019t fight you. In fact, I\u2019ll not only honor the terms of our prenuptial agreement, but I\u2019ll give you the amount stipulated if we\u2019d remained married five years. If you want a divorce now, I\u2019m filing tomorrow, and you get nothing.\u201d He raised a brow at her. \u201cDecide.\u201d</p><p>Gia sucked in a breath at his proposition. \u201cThis instant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe offer is only good for the next ten minutes.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d always known that Jason played hardball, but she hadn\u2019t expected him to use those skills on her. The prince she\u2019d fallen in love with wasn\u2019t trying to reconcile with her, but control and punish her.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to coerce me into bed for a little revenge, or do you just want to work me out of your system?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMy motivation is irrelevant. I merely asked you to make a choice.\u201d</p><p>Gia\u2019s immediate instinct was to tell him to shove his choice up his ass. She couldn\u2019t be bought, no matter how rich and powerful he was. On the other hand, her conscience wouldn\u2019t allow her to turn her back on him again. Besides, the two hundred fifty thousand dollars he dangled in front of her face could change her entire life. All she had to do was give the man she loved slightly less than three weeks of her time.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t exactly a nightmare scenario\u2014except for the part where he probably ended up crushing her heart at the end. Maybe she deserved it. Jason might not admit it, but she knew she\u2019d hurt him this past year. If having her under his thumb for a few weeks enabled him to move on after they ended, she owed him that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come with you.\u201d She\u2019d figure out what to do about work, what to say to her parents, how to make sure Mila and the kids had the help they needed.</p><p>A satisfied little smile danced across his lips. \u201cExcellent. Present yourself at my condo tomorrow at precisely six p.m. Arrive wearing no more than three garments and a pair of high heels. Pick whichever three you want, but if I have to peel off more than that before I fuck you, we\u2019ll start with punishment.\u201d</p><p>Shock whiplashed her. He\u2019d always been direct, but his sharp command, followed by the declaration that he intended to take her to bed, both made her mad and frothed up her libido. She hadn\u2019t had sex since their wedding night. She hadn\u2019t even had energy or privacy for masturbation. Though her long-denied sex drive wasn\u2019t at all upset about his demands, her head knew that his proposition was riddled with land mines. Eventually, this would blow up in her face.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t possibly refuse.</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them said a word more until the waiter set their food down. Even the smell of Jason\u2019s sizzling fajitas didn\u2019t rouse her appetite for food. Another sort of hunger plagued her. Why should she want him so much when he was being a ruthless bastard? Because she\u2019d always found that side of him hot, and Gia\u2019s own excitement now pissed her off.</p><p>He thanked the waiter, then turned back to her. \u201cIf work presents a problem for the next few weeks, I\u2019ll make the necessary phone calls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you will,\u201d she drawled.</p><p>He ignored her jibe. \u201cDoes your sister-in-law need a nurse or a nanny during your absence? If so, I\u2019ll provide it. I have no desire to leave them in a bind.\u201d</p><p>Guilt stabbed her. Gia softened. \u201cThank you. That\u2019s generous of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t want you spending our time together thinking about anyone else.\u201d</p><p>Of course not. And Jason was used to getting his way.</p><p>Gia stifled her guilt. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mila tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever she needs so she can manage without you for a few weeks, she\u2019ll get. Are we understood?\u201d</p><p>The concept wasn\u2019t difficult. Jason had bought her until November twenty-fourth, and she\u2019d let him. Though she\u2019d chosen this path of her own free will, it made her feel dirty. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>He nodded at her. Then the conversation ceased, and he dug into his food. Gia stared at her salad. Her stomach roiled too much to take a bite. She picked at the greens and plucked at the grilled chicken, thinking about tomorrow night. How long would it take him to wholly own her body and heart again? An hour, or could she actually manage to hold out an entire night?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not eating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had a late lunch,\u201d she lied.</p><p>He set down his fork slowly. \u201cDo you remember what I do to subs who aren\u2019t honest with me?\u201d</p><p>Orgasm deprivation\u2014hours and hours of it. Her sex tightened. Heat crawled up her cheeks. Even on an olive-skinned Italian girl, the blush would be impossible to miss.</p><p>\u201cI see that you do.\u201d Jason looked satisfied. \u201cThe sensual torture last time will seem minor compared to what I\u2019ll do tomorrow night if you don\u2019t tell me the truth now.\u201d</p> <p>Gia gritted her teeth. Until tonight, they\u2019d never even had an argument. She\u2019d just willingly fallen under his spell and into his embrace. Trying to resist Jason now was as futile as it was arousing.</p><p>\u201cAll right, then. I was nervous when I walked in and now I\u2019m sick to my stomach that I let you buy me, even for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>With a cynical curl of his lips, he lifted his beer and toasted her. \u201cEveryone has their price, Gia. I just found yours.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Gia tried to breathe through her nerves as she arrived at Jason\u2019s condo the next night. The mountain of lies she\u2019d told her family still scalded her with shame. They wouldn\u2019t understand. Mila would tell her not to compromise herself. Her parents would be disappointed that she\u2019d sold her morals and her body, even briefly. Her brother, if he\u2019d been here, would have gone after Jason with cocked fists and a loaded semiautomatic.</p> <p>Fabricating excuses had been far better for everyone.</p><p>As she stepped off the glass elevator that gave her aerial views of the city stretching on forever, she crept into a foyer with a water feature cascading down a glass wall. His door stood to the left. Gripping her suitcase in her hand, she glanced at her phone. Three minutes until six. One hundred eighty seconds to decide how the hell she was going to leave in eighteen days with her sanity and her heart intact. Of course, she\u2019d had nearly twenty-four hours to ruminate on that problem. She\u2019d come up with absolutely nothing.</p><p>Gia focused on his imposing black wood and wrought iron door, but couldn\u2019t make her feet move. Her belly clamped. Her heart stuttered. She tried to convince herself that she could handle this, but the mental pep talk wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>To her shock, the door opened suddenly, and Jason stood there in jeans, a long-sleeved jersey knit top in midnight blue, bare feet, and that triumphant hint of a smile she wanted to slap off his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re on time. Very good.\u201d He stepped back to admit her. As she entered with leaden legs, he glanced at her suitcase that had seen better days. \u201cIs that all you brought?\u201d</p><p>Had he expected her to bring her whole closet? \u201cYou gave me the impression I wasn\u2019t going to need many clothes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d He shut the door behind her and took her bag. \u201cI don\u2019t have many ground rules while you\u2019re here. Anything you see in the kitchen you want, take it. Don\u2019t leave the building without consulting me. I\u2019ve got a heated pool on the deck outside our bedroom. There\u2019s a full gym downstairs. You\u2019re welcome to use either as you\u2019d like. No work while you\u2019re here, especially on your brother\u2019s case. We\u2019ll discuss any family emergencies together as they arise. When we\u2019re sceneing, you will call me Mr. Denning. Is anything I\u2019ve said confusing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She supposed that since she hadn\u2019t seen or knelt for him in nearly a year, he no longer wanted her to call him Master. That was just fine. That slash of pain didn\u2019t mean a damn thing.</p><p>To avoid staring at him, she eyed his personal space. The expanse of a two-story wall of windows was unbroken by a drape or blind. Then again, why bother? Who could peek in on them this high up?</p><p>\u201cNice shoes.\u201d He glanced down at her dressiest T-strap black heels. \u201cWhat three garments did you choose to wear with them?\u201d</p><p>His high-handed attitude made her feel like a piece of merchandise. Gia tried to keep a grip on her temper. Was he punishing her for the last year or was she seeing the real Jason Denning now that he had no reason to woo her?</p><p>\u201cHello to you, too. My day was hectic. How about yours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt dragged by while I counted the hours until I could fuck you again.\u201d He pulled his phone from his pocket and glanced at it. \u201cI\u2019m much happier now that my wait is over. And I don\u2019t want to hear the attitude again. I\u2019ve done nothing you haven\u2019t agreed to, so don\u2019t act as if I\u2019ve insulted you.\u201d</p><p>Technically, he was right, and that rubbed Gia completely wrong. \u201cShould I just drop all my clothes here, get to the floor, and spread my legs? Or will I make it up to the bedroom before you\u2019re all over me?\u201d</p> <p>Jason froze. \u201cDo you need to reconsider your decision? The door is right behind you if you\u2019d rather divorce now and forfeit the money.\u201d</p><p>So cold. Where was the firm but caring Dom she\u2019d fallen for? If she was smart, she\u2019d take him up on this reprieve and walk out the door. But she couldn\u2019t afford to. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t be the right thing to do. She\u2019d hurt him, so now he meant to hurt her back. An eye for an eye.</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m staying until the twenty-fourth.\u201d</p><p>For a silent moment, he let her feel the weight of his anger. \u201cThen act like it or we\u2019ll start talking about consequences.\u201d</p><p>Gia knew she shouldn\u2019t mouth off to him again, but she had to ask him one thing. \u201cWould your parents be proud of you right now?\u201d</p><p>He shifted his weight and seemed to ponder her question. The conclusion he reached apparently amused him. \u201cMy father would. He was an absolute bastard who ate other people for breakfast. My mother would expect it. In fact, just a few days ago she suggested that I take you in hand and be firmer in my expectations. I didn\u2019t listen to her much growing up, but I think she might be onto something now.\u201d</p><p>His answer horrified her, mostly because he appeared dead serious. Nor did he seem to think his behavior was appalling. Oh god... She wasn\u2019t just in over her head; he\u2019d no doubt drown her before the night was through.</p><p>Jason had not only bought her body until their anniversary, he\u2019d bought her soul. She\u2019d sold it to him almost without a fight.</p><p>Gia closed her eyes in shame. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a sweater, a bra, and jeans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo panties?\u201d he murmured in her ear as he set her suitcase down and began circling her like a shark. She heard the rustle of him around her, felt his body heat across her skin.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very pleased. Take everything off.\u201d</p><p>Her brows drew together as she tensed and tried to find her fortitude. Would it be even harder when she had to spread her legs for him and allow him inside her, knowing he merely wanted revenge? Or would he, like before, overwhelm her with pleasure until she panted and begged? She didn\u2019t know which would hurt more.</p><p>Slipping out of her shoes, she stepped onto the textured wood. It was solid, comforting, kind of like the floor in her dad\u2019s den. Gia focused on that as she peeled her sweater over her head and dropped it to the ground. She tried not to think about what she was doing when she reached behind her and unhooked her bra. Not that the lace covered much, but as she removed what little protection it afforded, cold hit her nipples. They beaded. She refused to believe it had anything to do with Jason\u2019s blistering stare.</p><p>Slowly, Jason reached out and touched her. Gia started with a little gasp. His ghost of a smile haunted her when he ran his knuckles up the curve of her waist, to the swell of her breast, brushing over the sensitive bead. Against her will, a jolt of desire shivered through her system. Her breath hitched.</p><p>\u201cPretty. Soft,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNow lose the jeans so I can see your pussy.\u201d</p><p>Gia dragged in a shuddering breath, her whole body tense. Why did she resent him and want him so much at the same time? What mystical control did he have over her body? Or did she simply respond because she\u2019d always loved him?</p><p>Her fingers shook as she unsnapped her pants. The zipper fell with a subdued hiss. Then she fitted her hands on the waistband and pushed them down her hips. A year ago, they\u2019d been tight. Since then, they\u2019d gotten so big, they fell to her knees with the tiniest shove. She stepped out of them, leaving them piled on the wood beside her sweater.</p><p>Gia stood totally bare in front of him, eyes squeezed tightly shut.</p><p>Jason took her chin in his grip. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to escape me by closing your eyes and pretending I\u2019m someone else.\u201d</p><p>Lashes fluttering, she lifted her lids. \u201cThat\u2019s not... I wasn\u2019t even thinking of another man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo this is the sacrificial martyr routine. Perfect,\u201d he snapped. \u201cNothing makes a man feel more wanted than cringing.\u201d</p><p>Gia clenched her fists. \u201cFor the next eighteen days, you can tell me where to be, what to wear, where to sleep, how to kneel, and the way you want me to spread my legs. You do not get to tell me how to feel.\u201d</p><p>He hesitated, his stare taking her in. She wished she could see warmth in his blue eyes\u2014something that made his strict care seem like the safety net it once had. Now it just felt like a blade he held at her throat.</p><p>Finally, he stepped back, reaching behind him to grab a fluffy white robe on a coat rack she hadn\u2019t noticed. It was too small for him, and it made Gia wonder if he kept it here for his overnight conquests. She tried not to weep at the thought as he slipped it over her shoulders and she rushed to belt it around her waist.</p><p>\u201cGo upstairs,\u201d he demanded. \u201cAt the end of the hall, you\u2019ll find our bedroom and someone waiting for you. I\u2019ll be up soon.\u201d</p><p>Someone? He wasn\u2019t coming up to push her into bed right this second? Or had he arranged for another person to do his bondage dirty work first? She frowned.</p><p>Annoyance tightened his lips. \u201cProblem?\u201d</p><p>Whatever awaited her upstairs would allow her precious time to confront her feelings and get them under control. She\u2019d been terrified out of her mind on the job once or twice. She\u2019d buckled down, pushed through, and taken care of business. This required the same strategy.</p><p>\u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>Gia swept past him and headed up the stairs. Before they\u2019d married, she would have taunted him with a kiss and a flirty smile. Now, she risked a peek at him over her shoulder and found him watching her, unblinking and resolved.</p><p>With a shiver, she raced to the master bedroom and got her first look at his personal space. The soft lights of the recessed cans and the golden glow from a lamp on his nightstand illuminated the room, muting the view of the city. The big dark leather-tufted headboard dominated one wall and lorded over the king-sized bed, covered in white with accents of shimmering taupe. It looked like a sleek hotel room. Except for the two women who stood inside the space, both gorgeous and impeccably groomed.</p><p>\u201cGia?\u201d a blonde in her mid-thirties asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Were they Jason\u2019s lovers? Did he want her to hear their bedroom tales or something?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Michaela.\u201d Her smile broadened, a friendly gesture that surprisingly set her at ease. Then she gestured to the woman beside her. \u201cThis is my assistant Stacia.\u201d</p><p>The very petite, exotic brunette bowed her head in welcome. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>What was going on? \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll come with me into the bathroom, we\u2019ll get started on your hair,\u201d said Michaela.</p><p>Her hair? Jason wanted her tresses arranged in some fancy do before he tousled her in his big bed? Then again, this was his show. She was here to entertain him.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>As they rounded the corner into the modern space, she stopped short. A contemporary oval tub stood alone in the corner of the room on dark slate tile. Views of the city sparkled from the two walls of windows. A double vanity with hideously expensive marble carved out not only the counters but the sinks, all in severe angles. The piece took up half the length of one wall. A massive shower ate up the rest. No curtain or glass partitioned it off. The space was designed to simply walk into, with shower heads to spray a body from every direction, as well as overhead.</p><p>In the middle of the large space, Michaela had set up a big leather chair with an ottoman and waved Gia toward it. \u201cPlease sit here.\u201d</p><p>Getting her hair done wasn\u2019t exactly like being waterboarded. With a shrug, she eased into the seat.</p><p>Immediately, Michaela had her hands in Gia\u2019s tresses, fluffing and testing its texture. \u201cTell me what you\u2019d like to do with your hair. I\u2019d recommend a trim to clean up the ends. We can play with the color if you want. Your dark brown has gold tones. It\u2019s pretty, but I can add more warmth, frame your face with some highlights. We can also give you some depth with lowlights.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t give you specific instructions?\u201d If he\u2019d paid a pair of beauticians to come to his place, she figured that Jason would want to call the shots.</p><p>\u201cJust to bring out your natural beauty and make you happy.\u201d</p><p>That puzzled the hell out of Gia. She\u2019d never been a girly-girl, and highlights would just mean maintenance later that she didn\u2019t need to deal with. Her plate was already full. But a free haircut was a free haircut. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJust a trim, please.\u201d</p><p>Michaela didn\u2019t show her disappointment. \u201cOf course. I\u2019ll condition it, too. Now that winter is coming, you\u2019ll need a little extra moisture.\u201d</p><p>Sure. Whatever.</p><p>Gia leaned back, lowering her head into one of Jason\u2019s sinks as Michaela wet her hair. Stacia approached her with several bottles of nail polish and asked her to pick one for her pedicure. Absently, she picked a peachy-bronze color and sighed as Michaela began to shampoo her. Gia knew she should relax and enjoy the pampering. She hadn\u2019t had any in the last year. Instead, the worry that the temporary nanny wouldn\u2019t remember to read Tony Jr. a bedtime story distracted her. And the hope that Jason would soon be in a better mood ran a close second.</p> <p>An hour later, she stared at herself in the mirror, blinking in surprise. With a few snips of the scissors, the brandishing of a blow dryer, and some turns of a curling iron, Michaela had transformed her hair into something beautiful, full of body and shine. Stacia had finished her pedi, and now shaped and buffed her fingernails.</p><p>Afterward, she emerged from the bathroom. A baby-doll nightie in a blush color, trimmed with beige lace that would cup her breasts and flirt with her thighs, lay strewn across the bed. A very small thong accompanied it. A pair of new champagne-hued Louboutin stilettos sat on top of their box, their bows glittering, the red soles a bright warning.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m supposed to put all this on?\u201d she asked no one in particular.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d Michaela answered, then turned to her assistant.</p><p>Gia caught sight of a pot of wax heating as Stacia set up what looked like a wide massage table and covered it with a clean sheet. Her stomach dropped. Jason really meant everything he\u2019d said. He intended to take her to bed. For that, he\u2019d want her waxed. After all, why shouldn\u2019t he insist on his money\u2019s worth? Remembering how much she\u2019d hurt him and how much she owed him, she eased onto the table, vowing not to give her husband any more of herself than her body.</p> <p>Scrubbing a hand down his face, Jason paced his kitchen. The scents of the savory garlic-herb roasted chicken and vegetables blended with the delicious aroma of yeasty bread. He should be hungry by now. Starved, even. Hell, he couldn\u2019t notice a damn thing but the clock ticking, his dick aching, and that wretched pain only Gia could make him feel gouging his chest.</p><p>His wife had chosen money. He\u2019d offered her the funds in desperation, never imagining that she\u2019d take them. Rather, he\u2019d clung to the hope that she had agreed to meet him at the Mexican restaurant because she wanted to resume their marriage. In truth, Jason had been worried that Gia had come to seek a divorce. He\u2019d been prepared to talk fast to convince her otherwise. But never had he imagined that she\u2019d actually take him up on his wretched offer and sell herself.</p><p>Apparently, she wasn\u2019t different from the rest, after all.</p><p>The only saving grace to this situation was that his mother had been gone when he\u2019d returned home late Sunday. Not surprisingly, she\u2019d taken the cash on his dresser. Later, she\u2019d texted to say that she had found a new friend while consoling herself at Neiman\u2019s. Apparently, the man had invited her to dinner at The French Room. Jason hadn\u2019t seen Samantha since. Her new friend must be \u201centertaining\u201d her. Hell, if the guy had enough money, he\u2019d probably be husband number five.</p><p>Finally, the two beauticians he\u2019d hired to take care of Gia\u2019s personal needs made their way down the stairs, implements all packaged up in their roller bags. He exchanged a few words with the quiet blonde, but didn\u2019t hear a lot beyond the fact that his wife was finished and waiting for him upstairs.</p><p>More eager than he wanted to be, Jason paid the women and tipped them amply before he tossed together a dinner tray, added a chilled bottle of wine, and headed up to find his bride.</p> <p>His heart raced as he reached the closed door. \u201cGia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t sound at all happy. He\u2019d given her more than one opportunity to leave, but she\u2019d taken the mercenary path. He refused to feel sorry for her.</p><p>Balancing everything in one hand, he turned the knob and opened the door. As soon as he saw her, he nearly dropped the tray. She looked like his fantasies\u2014only better. Her hair hung in loose waves. One of the women had done something that made her skin glow under the lights. Even her toenails shimmered. When he\u2019d bought the miniscule scrap of lace she now wore, he\u2019d imagined how she would look in it and gotten hard as hell. But seeing her in person? Damn. He could picture her spread out across his sheets, her gaze on him, her arms open as he ripped her thong away to expose her smooth, pouting pussy. The \u201cfuck me\u201d shoes made him want to do exactly that. Jason nearly growled with need. But he\u2019d enjoy the sex more if Gia felt half as eager as he did...and if she\u2019d lie to him and say she loved him, like she used to.</p><p>Patience.</p><p>If Gia wanted a divorce and she wanted to be paid for her freedom, he planned to make her earn every penny of it first. And if he was very lucky, maybe he\u2019d figure out how to get enough of her and move on.</p><p>He set the tray on the dresser, still looking her over. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><p>She cast her gaze down submissively. Either that or she couldn\u2019t bear to look at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI brought us some dinner.\u201d He poured the wine, and she took the glass, her expression somewhat guarded. \u201cTo...new endings.\u201d</p><p>Her face closed up entirely. \u201cHopefully, a quick one.\u201d</p><p>Jason made a noncommittal sound, repressing his urge to get her naked and flat before he put his stamp on her, hold her in his thrall the way she\u2019d done him. Instead, he forced himself to wait. Gia gulped half her glass as if she needed the liquid courage.</p><p>Trying not to grit his teeth, he lifted the lid on the dishes, then pointed at the bed. \u201cSit.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she sat back against a stack of fluffy white pillows and took the plate. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Their gazes met before hers skittered away.</p><p>Holding in a curse, Jason gave her a fork. When she grabbed the far end, refusing to even brush his fingers, his lips tightened. If she had a new aversion to touching him, he\u2019d quickly put a stop to it.</p><p>Plate in hand, he sat back on the bed against the grouping of pillows, leaning against the headboard beside her. Digging his fork into his rice, he did his best to focus on the food and act as if nothing happening between them bothered him in the least.</p><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve been dealing with your family. Tell me about the progress you\u2019ve made in bringing your brother\u2019s killer to justice.\u201d</p><p>Gia tensed. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any. My brother\u2019s former partner initially pointed the finger at a thug named Ricky Wayman. A few days later, he recanted and claimed he wasn\u2019t sure, but I know better. Patrick was either scared off or paid off. The day before my brother died, he told my dad that he knew Ricky had something big going down and he intended to stop it. Tony died on Ricky\u2019s turf, so I know damn well who shot my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one has arrested Wayman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey haven\u2019t even brought him in for questioning.\u201d And that obviously infuriated her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t the police usually go all out to hunt down a cop killer?\u201d</p><p>Something cynical and mad as hell twisted her delicate features. \u201cUsually, yeah. Wayman\u2019s got a sick rep and a lot of firepower.\u201d Fingers gripping her plate until her knuckles turned white, she drew in an angry breath. \u201cI think the brass is already convinced it\u2019s an unwinnable war and it would cost too many lives to bring this one punk to justice. He takes out a lot of other criminals, so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey let him slide.\u201d Jason turned her words over in his head, angry on her behalf. Not only did someone as principled as Gia want the badges she worked with to do their jobs and put criminals behind bars, she expected it. She\u2019d been disillusioned by their failure to act.</p><p>\u201cTotally,\u201d she confirmed, no longer eating.</p><p>Jason knew damn well how his wife had been spending her time this past year. Since she hadn\u2019t gotten the help she needed from her fellow officers, she\u2019d refused to give up on justice for her brother. \u201cSo you\u2019ve spent all your free time tracking Wayman down yourself and trying to prove his guilt, even after I had you put behind a desk.\u201d He sent her a speculative stare. \u201cYour parents don\u2019t know, do they?\u201d</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she admitted, \u201cMy dad tried to make me promise that I wouldn\u2019t go after Wayman alone, but my mom is so grief stricken. I have to try and give her whatever comfort I can. That killer behind bars would help.\u201d</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, Jason tried to pull back on his anger. Gia\u2019s sense of good and right wouldn\u2019t allow her to sit this manhunt out. Funny how the determination and rectitude that had drawn him to her had become the very things he wanted to throttle her for.</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d</p><p>Gia hesitated. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see people you care for in pain, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cExcruciating.\u201d</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t agree more, and though logic told him that her circumstances shouldn\u2019t matter, he couldn\u2019t ignore her anguish. \u201cEat your dinner before it gets cold.\u201d</p><p>She exhaled and seemed to deflate altogether. \u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t a request.\u201d He sent her a stern glare.</p><p>\u201cOf course it isn\u2019t. And people always obey you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGenerally, yes. I won\u2019t apologize for it, especially when it\u2019s for your well-being.\u201d</p><p>And Jason refused to say another word until she\u2019d consumed at least half of the food on her plate, even giving him a low moan at the tastiness of the bread.</p><p>When they\u2019d finished, he took her plate and padded downstairs, leaving the dishes in the sink. His maid would be in come morning to take care of the mess.</p><p>He pulled the refrigerator open and lifted one large crystal cup, then grabbed a single spoon from the drawer and headed back upstairs, mentally weighing the evening\u2019s events.</p><p>As he made his way to the bedroom again, he was unpleasantly surprised to find Gia no longer in his bed. After setting the items he held aside, he visually swept the room and sighed in relief. She stood at the window and stared out, looking at the sky lit night and the urban sprawl giving way to suburbia farther north. His wife might be physically in the room with him, but she was really a million miles away.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She jerked back to attention and shook her head. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>As she turned to face him, her expression looked neutral, all traces of whatever or whomever she\u2019d been thinking about gone. He held in a snarl of frustration.</p><p>\u201cSit for me.\u201d</p><p>Dragging her feet, Gia did as he bid, stopping at the edge of the bed. \u201cNaked, I presume? Now that you\u2019ve done your Domly duty and seen to my needs, you\u2019re intending to see to yours, right? Is this the part of the evening where you nail me into the mattress?\u201d</p><p>Jason felt his ire rise. Then he caught onto her game. \u201cTrying to make me feel guilty for this arrangement will neither anger nor upset me enough to halt it. I made you an offer. You accepted. End of story.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a little huff. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re doing this.\u201d</p><p>To hear her admit that she had no idea why he might want to spend time with her bugged the hell out of him. It also told him that she\u2019d given up on them already. Somewhere in the back of his head, he\u2019d known that, but it bothered him all the same. \u201cI have my reasons and I\u2019m not obligated to share them. You\u2019re my submissive for now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just say it. I\u2019m your whore and you\u2019re getting off on exercising your control over me.\u201d</p><p>Jason froze. It took everything inside him not to rise to her bait. \u201cIf that\u2019s how you choose to see the situation, I can\u2019t stop you. I merely asked you to sit on the bed. I\u2019m still waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine.\u201d She tossed herself onto the mattress and sat against the pillows, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cThank you. Now hold your arms up at your sides.\u201d</p><p>Her dark eyes flashed suspiciously. She narrowed them as if trying to guess his intent. Finally, she complied, holding them straight out from her shoulders, almost as if opening her arms to him...but not quite.</p><p>Jason reached behind his headboard and plucked at a padded wrist cuff, attached to an adjustable chain, then secured it around his wife\u2019s wrist.</p><p>Gasping, she drilled him with a shocked stare. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are now sceneing. What should you call me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell, Mr. Denning?\u201d she snarled, jerking her free arm down to her side.</p><p>He grabbed it again and brought it to the other cuff. Gia fought him, and Jason dug deep for patience. \u201cGive me your wrist or use your safe word. It\u2019s divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being a bastard, Mr. Denning.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, we can\u2019t all be angels like you. Since opposites attract...\u201d He gave her a tight smile. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, I\u2019m not offended. Much meaner people have called me names far worse. Are you saying your safe word or giving yourself over to me?\u201d</p><p>The fight left Gia. She lifted her hand to him.</p><p>\u201cJust to be clear, you\u2019re choosing to give your power to me, yes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She gritted her teeth. \u201cMr. Denning.\u201d</p> <p>Even though she\u2019d given him the green light grudgingly, satisfaction still rolled through him. For the first time in nearly a year, he would finally have the gratification he\u2019d craved\u2014and he intended to take it. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>Wrapping his fingers around her forearm, he aligned her wrist with the cuff and snapped it in place. Now she was beautifully at his mercy.</p><p>\u201cAre you uncomfortable physically in any way?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have anything you want to say before we get started?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your safe word is...\u201d he quizzed.</p><p>\u201cDivorce.\u201d Gia sounded as if she worked hard to shove down her anger.</p><p>It couldn\u2019t be greater than his own, and he\u2019d get to the bottom of hers when she felt more amenable to conversation. For now, he had something else in mind to remind her once and for all of the way a Dom/sub relationship worked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He reached into his nightstand and pulled out a sleep mask. It worked wonders when he needed shut-eye on bright Texas mornings...or when surly little subs needed an attitude adjustment.</p><p>When he lifted the mask to her eyes and fitted the Velcro strip behind her head, she gasped. \u201cJason, no.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d He injected sharp rebuke into his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Denning...\u201d</p><p>Now she sounded breathy and afraid, and he backed down immediately. Cradling her face in his hands, he pressed his lips to her ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a shaky gulp of air. He could almost hear her mentally reviewing the months they\u2019d spent as Master and slave, remembering all the ways he\u2019d seen to her well-being then.</p><p>And slowly, her frozen muscles melted a bit. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>So she hadn\u2019t forgotten the manners he\u2019d taught her when playing with him. He smiled.</p><p>As he rose from the bed, Jason stepped back to admire Gia all spread out like a sacrifice, arms wide, innocent lace barely hiding her nipples and pussy from him, eyes covered and breath held, awaiting his pleasure. The sparkling shoes with their five-inch heels elongated her sleek legs. The idea of those shoes in the air while he fucked her turned him on.</p><p>With a grimace, he adjusted his hard cock in his jeans and made his way to the dresser to retrieve the goodies he\u2019d left there. Once in hand, he sat on the edge of the bed next to her. God, he couldn\u2019t wait for this.</p> <p>\u201cOpen your mouth.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing caught before the rate of her respiration picked up. Then slowly, she parted her moist, rosy lips. He\u2019d missed kissing her so much, feeding his cock into that mouth and drowning in the warm heaven...</p><p>Shit, he had to stay on track.</p><p>He lifted the dish and dipped the spoon inside to gather a generous bite. Then he inched it onto her tongue and waited.</p><p>As soon as the taste hit her buds, she wrapped her lips around the spoon with a moan that fired his blood and sucked the utensil clean.</p><p>\u201cYou like that?\u201d A grin tugged at his lips as he scooped up more of the confection for her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d she hummed, her face lax with pleasure. \u201cYou remembered?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat chocolate mousse is your favorite, yes. I remember everything.\u201d</p><p>She tensed. Jason weighed his next options, but he\u2019d done enough cornering and hounding her for the moment. She knew the score. Now was the time to coax her.</p><p>He raised the spoon to her lips again and nudged her wider. Gia didn\u2019t hesitate, but eagerly took the mousse into her mouth once more. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d</p><p>Because he\u2019d hunted down a five-star rated chef and paid the man a small fortune to make this just for her. If he was going to coerce her into spending nearly three weeks with him, he had to show her some of the perks. This was a start.</p><p>\u201cI think I\u2019d like to try some, too.\u201d</p><p>Rather than giving her time to ponder his declaration, Jason set the dish and spoon aside, then reached for the buttons holding the baby-doll together between her breasts. One, two, three, they all came undone without a fight. He pushed the sides of the filmy garment apart and exposed the sight he\u2019d been craving since he\u2019d last taken her on their wedding night.</p><p>Beauty came in all shapes and sizes, but he was a breast man. And Gia had just about the most beautiful he\u2019d ever seen. Round, firm, on the large side but not disproportionate. Dusky tips surrounded by inch after inch of unblemished olive skin. Just perfect.</p><p>As the cool air caressed Gia, her nipples tightened. His mouth watered. With a feral grin, he dipped his finger into the mousse, then rubbed the dark, sugary cream on her distended tip. So the other didn\u2019t suffer indifference, he covered it as well.</p><p>Gia\u2019s small hands curled into fists and she bit her lip, but arched toward him, begging him without a word to ease her ache. Jason gladly complied.</p><p>He bent and cradled one breast in his palm, lifting it toward his mouth. The scents of chocolate blended with the succulent musk rising from her skin. As he took one sugary nipple in his mouth, her flavor intoxicated him. She made him dizzy with her sweetness.</p><p>Fucking hell, he\u2019d missed Gia. No woman smelled or tasted or affected him the way she did. After nearly two decades of sex for the sake of sex, he knew the difference. And as he laved her peak, licking off every morsel of the chocolate goodness, Jason wondered how he would ever do without her again.</p><p>As he sucked on the hard tip of her breast, a whimper slipped from Gia, as if she couldn\u2019t hold her reaction in. He refused to let her. She forgot that he knew her body way too well to hide from him. But he\u2019d remind her.</p><p>He nipped at the sensitive crest of her breast, then drew on her, sucking hard. She gasped as she tossed her head back with a thump against the headboard. Before she could absorb the pressure of his mouth, he pulled back enough to grip her wet nipple between his thumb and forefinger. As he squeezed, he latched onto the other breast, capturing the hard tip against his tongue and eating off the chocolate while feeling her nipple harden even more.</p><p>\u201cJason...\u201d</p><p>His wife\u2019s voice sounded somewhere between a moan and a plea. He drank it in, letting the little sigh resonate in his head and swirl together with all the unique things about Gia that left him hungering for her. But he had a point to make now that wasn\u2019t about his pleasure\u2014as much as he wished otherwise. Time to remind her exactly who\u2014and what\u2014he was.</p><p>Jason pulled back, withdrawing his fingers and lips, removing all stimulation. \u201cNot \u2018Jason.\u2019 Try again.\u201d</p><p>Her brow furrowed. Her lips pressed together. Gia was confused and frustrated. Clearly, she wanted more pleasure. He withheld. Maybe now she could understand a fraction of what he\u2019d endured for nearly the past year.</p><p>\u201cMr. Denning,\u201d she finally gasped out, arching her breasts even closer to him. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he praised before he took her nipples in his mouth again, one after the other, savoring the soft skin of her breasts with his fingertips.</p><p>The starch that had stiffened her muscles since she\u2019d walked through his door melted more with every pull of his mouth on the candy-hard crests. He could smell her now. The tang of her arousal filled his nostrils and made his blood boil. Every time he had Gia under his power, she fired him up like no woman ever had. Feeling her now warmed him like the sun after a long, cold winter.</p><p>But after what seemed like a thousand freezing seasons without her, he needed more.</p><p>With a growl, Jason fitted his hands around the little straps over her hips and ripped her thong away. He lay his palm over her bare pussy, letting her feel the claim he had placed here long ago. Then he ground the heel of his hand in a tight circle, directly over her clit. To his great satisfaction, she spread her legs wider to him, granting him even more access to her secret flesh.</p><p>He\u2019d been wrong earlier. His wife didn\u2019t just intoxicate him; she held him spellbound.</p><p>\u201cGia, baby, I\u2019ve missed you,\u201d he blurted.</p><p>He nearly bit his tongue off. No way should he admit that. The truth gave her power. He had to watch himself, somehow not get lost in her.</p><p>With a mewl, she lifted her hips to him. He sank his fingers between the velvety folds of her cunt, dipped his fingers into her wetness, and he caressed her clit. His slow rub had her writhing as he awakened the nerve endings under the hood of her flesh. Then he withdrew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you, too. Don\u2019t stop,\u201d she begged.</p><p>Wondering if she meant that or merely said what she thought he wanted to hear, Jason massaged her clit again, more circular motions that hardened the little bud and had her bucking closer for more. \u201cTell me who else makes you feel this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d she breathed out.</p><p>Gia had admitted as much before they married, and he\u2019d hoped the same was still true. \u201cWho else has touched you like this in the last year?\u201d</p><p>As he brushed her nerve-laden bundle again, she whimpered. \u201cNo one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t let anyone pet this pretty pussy since me?\u201d He wanted to hear her admit it again. He ached to believe it.</p><p>Jason softened his touch, concentrating the rhythmic cadence exactly where she wanted it, taking her closer and closer to the edge of pleasure.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cEven when I saw you with other women in the newspaper, I couldn\u2019t...\u201d Her thighs went taut, and she gyrated, trying to take him deeper. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p><p>She thought he\u2019d been unfaithful? That grated on him. It would probably be wise to let her think it, but where his wife was concerned, he had yet to make a damn logical decision.</p><p>\u201cI attended benefits and art showings with \u2018appropriate\u2019 dates for one good cause after another. I smiled as photographers snapped pictures. I did not take anyone to bed.\u201d</p><p>Gia turned her head away and tried to draw her legs together to shake off his touch. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he agreed. \u201cSo why would I bother? Nothing in our prenuptial agreement prevents me from fucking someone else. But I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Around the edges of the mask, he could see her brows furrow together. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d He ripped the mask away. \u201cBecause you think I\u2019m a deceitful playboy who chases one piece of ass after another?\u201d</p><p>She blinked, readjusting to the light and focusing on him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have married you if I thought that.\u201d</p><p>Jason raised a brow at her. \u201cDo you think I cheated because you\u2019re not special enough to inspire fidelity?\u201d</p><p>\u201cN-no.\u201d</p><p>He sat back on his heels. The denial had come out, but he didn\u2019t believe it. He wasn\u2019t even sure she did.</p><p>\u201cThen tell me why you think I\u2019ve been playing musical beds.\u201d</p><p>Rolling her shoulders back and crossing her legs, she shut her eyes and refused to meet his gaze. \u201cI assumed you\u2019d moved on with your life.\u201d</p><p>The way she\u2019d moved on with hers. Damn it. He should probably do the same, but now that he had Gia here, he wasn\u2019t convinced he could ever let her go.</p><p>Jason grabbed her chin. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth twisted and her nose reddened as she fought tears. \u201cCan\u2019t you just take what you want already?\u201d</p><p>So she could hate him for it later? No. She seemed to think he merely saw her as a body to fuck. Or that he didn\u2019t care about any pleasure but his own. If they were going to make any progress in the future, he needed to set the record straight now.</p><p>Hovering over her, he plunged one hand into her hair and tugged until he captured her gaze and her mouth trembled directly under his. He thrust two fingers into her weeping pussy and prodded her clit with his thumb. As she gasped and her body opened to him again, almost as if against her will, he slammed his lips over the soft velvet of hers and fused their mouths together.</p><p>Hell, he couldn\u2019t inhale her fast enough, take her deep enough. As he shoved his way into her mouth, sweeping inside for a devouring kiss, Jason reveled in the fact that he touched her, penetrated her. He meant to do it again\u2014frequently\u2014lap at her flavor and drink in her reaction. He\u2019d listen to each little breath and eat up every inch of her surrender over and over until she was completely in his hands and under his control again.</p><p>Pumping his fingers in and out of her as he swept through her mouth, Jason waited until an aroused glow suffused his wife, until she held her breath and her legs twitched, until she fought her restraints and kissed him with abandon. Then he jerked away, staring hard at her beautiful flushed face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo...\u201d She pleaded with him.</p><p>He merely raised a brow at her.</p><p>\u201cMr. Denning,\u201d she added hastily. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, she was killing him. But this lesson had to take precedence. He might not respect her choice to come here for money, but he refused to let her believe he saw her as a whore.</p> <p>Shaking his head, he tried not to soften in the face of her entreating stare. \u201cYou\u2019re my submissive and my wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cI have not touched another woman since our wedding night.

I want you to think about that, Mrs. Denning. I\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>The door shut behind Jason, enclosing Gia in his bedroom by herself. His words hung in the silent room and reverberated through her body. His sudden absence made her feel ridiculously alone, but having him gone didn\u2019t stop her body from throbbing for what only he could give her. With her breasts bare and her pussy exposed, she couldn\u2019t not be aware of her naked vulnerability. Nor could she seem to pry her heart from her throat.</p> <p>What the hell was going on?</p><p>As a police officer, the idea of being restrained in a man\u2019s bedroom somewhat against her will should bother her. But Jason had relegated her to a desk because he didn\u2019t want her hurt or killed hunting down Tony\u2019s killer. Her husband would never physically harm her. On the other hand, he would very likely make her heart bleed\u2014as if she hadn\u2019t already been suffering since their separation.</p><p>If he hadn\u2019t aroused her just now with the purpose of wringing every bit of his money\u2019s worth from her body, then why had he touched her? To prove he could rev up her libido? Or something entirely different? Everything about his behavior in the last twenty-four hours confused her. She\u2019d assumed that he wanted a divorce and that he sought to make her pay with her body before he paid in cash. Now...she wasn\u2019t sure. If he\u2019d brought her here merely to use her before he began legally shedding her, why would he insist he\u2019d been faithful? Or speak her married name so emphatically, like he meant to underscore the fact that, at least on paper, she was still his wife.</p><p>Once, she\u2019d believed that he loved her. He\u2019d never said the words, but what he lacked in verbal affection he\u2019d more than made up for in a hundred other ways, like his romantic, over-the-top proposal. Like remembering that she loved stargazer lilies and having huge bouquets stuffed with them at their last-minute wedding.</p><p>Like having chocolate mousse for her tonight?</p><p>Gia closed her eyes. Why couldn\u2019t everything be different? The night she and Jason had married, she\u2019d been on top of the world. He\u2019d been the most dashing groom. Somehow, in less than twenty-four hours, he\u2019d seen to every detail of their elegant ceremony. He\u2019d even had a selection of insanely beautiful wedding dresses delivered to her door so she could pick one and have it hemmed or tucked as needed.</p> <p>That night, she\u2019d been Cinderella at the ball, swept into his glittering world for an enchanted evening, fooling herself into imagining that she belonged beside him. Her phone ringing with the news of Tony\u2019s murder had been her clock striking midnight. Reality had ripped her from fantasy. Suddenly, she\u2019d realized that her brother was gone forever, her parents didn\u2019t know she had a husband, and she had a mountain of responsibilities that weren\u2019t going to go away simply because she\u2019d been foolish enough to marry a man she couldn\u2019t keep.</p><p>When she\u2019d forced herself to let go of Jason mentally, Gia had been sure he would forget her within a month or two. Six at most. But nearly a year later, he seemed resistant to the idea of releasing her for good.</p><p>Was it possible he still cared?</p><p>Gia glanced at the clock. He\u2019d only been gone ten minutes. Somehow, it felt like a week. But that wasn\u2019t new. For unending months after their marriage, being away from Jason hadn\u2019t been a mere ache, but a plague\u2014a ceaseless yearning that had hounded her days and haunted her nights. After just a little taste of him tonight, the need thrumming inside her, demanding to be close to him was twenty times worse.</p><p>What was she going to do about their marriage? As much as she still had feelings for him, she didn\u2019t see how she could toss aside her common sense again. But even if the two of them living happily ever after was a fantasy, the thought of letting him go again made her heart constrict.</p><p>The door opened, abruptly ending her thoughts. Automatically, she curled her legs up to her chest to hide as much of her nudity as possible.</p><p>Jason quirked a brow. \u201cLower them.\u201d</p><p>He stood stock-still until she complied, flattening them on the bed once more and revealing her breasts.</p> <p>\u201cSpread them,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She dug deep to tamp down anger\u2014and the even more insidious arousal. No way could she let him know. Already, she\u2019d begged him. Stupid move. Jason had so much command over her. Tipping her hand and revealing how much she wanted her husband would only give him more.</p><p>Still, she couldn\u2019t stop her trembling as she parted her thighs. His stare immediately dropped to her sex, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction. She stung with both desire and shame.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. More mousse?\u201d he asked, sauntering to the nightstand and taking the crystal dish in hand.</p><p>The chocolate was scrumptious. Since Jason could usually take or leave anything sugary, she suspected he\u2019d had someone whip up the dessert for her. The surprising gesture was sweet\u2014a word few associated with him. But Gia had seen that side of him before and knew it existed. Yes, he\u2019d been an ass tonight, but she had expected as much. He was angry and hurt, and she bore most of the guilt for their faltering marriage. Throwing his thoughtfulness in his face now would only be juvenile.</p><p>\u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>He relaxed, as if pleasantly surprised that she hadn\u2019t rebuffed him. Then again, after months of rejection, why should he have expected anything else from her? Guilt gnawed at Gia again.</p><p>\u201cOpen up.\u201d Jason sat on the edge of the bed and spooned up some of the mousse, then brought the heaping chocolate toward her mouth.</p><p>Willingly, she opened for him, cradling all the goodness on her tongue while he fed her. The independent woman in her probably shouldn\u2019t like this, but why lie? Sometimes, he could be so attentive, even tender, that she simply melted.</p><p>In silence, he lifted one bite after the other onto her tongue until she\u2019d swallowed the last of it. Gia couldn\u2019t contain the happy little sigh that escaped her throat. \u201cThank you. That was incredible.\u201d</p><p>Jason brushed a piece of hair away from her face. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. How are your hands and wrists?\u201d</p><p>Though she was still cuffed, everything was surprisingly comfortable. \u201cI\u2019m all right, except I don\u2019t know why you left the room with me restrained. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cBut that orgasm you pleaded for earlier is mine. I\u2019ve waited nearly a year for it. I wasn\u2019t going to let you take it from me by your own hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taking chances. Are you still hungry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight\u2019s dinner was more than I usually eat in three days. I\u2019m stuffed.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cYou\u2019ve lost weight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t eat when I\u2019m stressed.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t comment directly, he just reached over to uncuff her wrist on the far side of the bed. His chest hovered near hers, their faces inches apart. Gia couldn\u2019t deny how much she craved his kiss again.</p><p>Instead, he stared, silent and inscrutable, as if trying to see down to her soul. His sharp blue eyes enthralled her. Stubble covered his strong jaw. His broad shoulders eclipsed so much of the room beyond. God knew he was good in bed. Maybe she could resist if she didn\u2019t love him.</p><p>Finally, he popped a latch, and her left cuff sprang free. Jason eased back and released the other, then began massaging her shoulders. \u201cDo they ache?\u201d</p><p>Gia wasn\u2019t dumb enough to lie. Besides, she deeply suspected that her wrists would be in those same cuffs again in the very near future.</p><p>\u201cA bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d He peeled off her shoes and helped her to her feet.</p><p>Swallowing down her questions, she trailed him to the massive bathroom as he began running the tub. As the water turned warm, he eased the stopper down and added a bit of some exotic bath oil with a hint of coconut and musk before turning to her.</p><p>At the gravity of his stare, she swallowed. With fingertips skimming her shoulders, he slid the baby-doll nightie down her arms and off her body. When she stood bare before him, raw lust seared his face. That expression said he wanted to lower her to the floor and fuck her right that second. Gia wanted to let him.</p><p>He held out his hand, looking her up and down. \u201cGet in.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t once occur to Gia not to comply. She closed her eyes in delight as the warm water enveloped her feet and lapped at her ankles.</p><p>Since she\u2019d moved in with Mila and the kids, the little house\u2019s only bathtub was on the other side of the place, and Gia hated to intrude in the children\u2019s space. She\u2019d missed the luxury of being immersed in warm, fragrant water.</p><p>\u201cSit back.\u201d Jason helped ease her down into the water.</p><p>Though she usually liked to wait until the tub filled to avoid the cold surface against her skin, she didn\u2019t argue. But when she lay back, Gia was shocked to realize the entire surface of the tub was comfortably warm.</p><p>\u201cThe back is heated?\u201d</p><p>He smiled faintly. \u201cYes. It\u2019s also an air tub with colored LED lighting. The towels are heating now. So is the floor.\u201d</p><p>Wow. She never even stopped to consider such luxuries. Money had always been tight in her family. Now it was a downright issue. She\u2019d better enjoy all this pampering while she could, but it was far more special because Jason shared the luxury with her. In her stupid heart, he did it because, despite his anger, he still wanted to take care of her.</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d She settled back again and closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He ran his fingers through her hair. Another touch she\u2019d always loved. And he remembered. Gia moaned as he gently rubbed at her scalp, brushed his hands over her temples, applied the perfect pressure to the back of her stiff neck. He touched her as if they didn\u2019t have a care between them. It would be so sinfully easy to slip again into the fantasy of being Jason\u2019s fairy-tale soul mate.</p><p>Once upon a time, she\u2019d fallen hard for him. It had nothing to do with his money and everything to do with the very personal way he cared for her. Insistent, yes. Hands on, definitely. But she\u2019d never felt more adored in her life than she did with Jason.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Her eyes slid shut. \u201cYou\u2019re making it impossible to do anything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He gathered her hair in his hands and clipped it atop her head.</p><p>Then she smelled something new, a blend of lavender, rosemary, chamomile, and a few other scents she couldn\u2019t identify. Suddenly, his big hands covered her shoulders and began kneading, working the oil down her arms, then back up to her neck. She gave a low groan and melted against him.</p><p>\u201cJason,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He bent and brushed his lips against her ear. \u201cYou like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm...\u201d she breathed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>When Gia had first arrived, she\u2019d been sure that he would immediately force her into bed. Not physically. After all, she\u2019d agreed to give him her body at any time in any way he wanted until their anniversary. But instead of ordering her surrender, he seemed intent on coaxing it from her. And he was doing a damn fine job.</p><p>\u201cStill sore?\u201d He massaged the tense muscles and tendons of her shoulders and arms, dissolving her accumulated stress with every gentle dig of his fingers.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Jason dipped his hands in her bath water, rinsing them. Then he caressed his way up her hips, her waist. Gia\u2019s breath caught and held as his fingertips traced a path over her damp skin until he cradled her breasts in his hands.</p><p>\u201cThese are perfect,\u201d he murmured, thumbing his way toward her nipples.</p><p>They beaded in anticipation of his touch, tightening, lengthening. He captured them in his grip. She eased her head back against the rim of the tub and drew in a shaking breath before exhaling in an aroused rush. Why did he always turn her inside out?</p><p>He slid his cheek against hers, the stubble prickly soft. The slight abrasion of his skin added another layer of texture to his possession. His woodsy-musky scent surrounded her and reminded her of the hundreds of times he\u2019d driven her to ecstasy with seeming ease. Now she was on his turf, playing by his terms...and heading for his bed again. For a blissful moment, she didn\u2019t regret it.</p><p>The last eleven and a half months had been so devastating, so stressful and terrible. Temporarily dropping all the crushing responsibilities for finding Tony\u2019s killer while juggling her small niece and nephew was such a wonderful, guilty relief. Giving Jason anything but her body wasn\u2019t smart, but Gia didn\u2019t think she could hide the fact that she still cared. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When Jason released her nipples then clamped down on them again, she arched into his hands, reveling in the way he cradled her in his grip. Pleasure clouded her thoughts, as if she\u2019d consumed a whole bottle of wine. Tomorrow she would care that she\u2019d given in too easily. Tomorrow she might even resent him for being so able to unravel her restraint.</p><p>Tonight, she just didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He buried his nose in her neck and inhaled. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed your smell. For a month after we left Vegas, I sniffed the nightgown you wore on our wedding night. It made me hard and hungry to fuck you every damn time. Just like I am right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to seduce me.\u201d She couldn\u2019t seem to make her voice sound accusing.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any plans to stop at trying. You\u2019re my wife, at least until the twenty-fourth. That\u2019s how I intend to treat you. I\u2019m going to strip you, bind you, penetrate and possess you every chance I get.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t doubt him. Jason might be motivated by revenge or a need to work through whatever residual emotions he had, and he might want to be indifferent to her in every way except sexually, but she sensed he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cStand.\u201d He grabbed a towel from the nearby rack.</p><p>As she complied with a shiver, he wrapped the warm terrycloth around her, tucking it between her breasts. Dizzy and off balance, Gia swayed closer. Her chest met his. As Jason wrapped his arms around her, she grasped his shoulders and eased her head back. She couldn\u2019t help but stare into his eyes. They didn\u2019t look crystal cold now, but a hot, dark blue. His jaw clenched. His nostrils flared. Desire tightened his face.</p><p>It might be the stupidest thing she\u2019d ever done, but Gia lifted her face, stood on her tiptoes, and brought her mouth toward his. Jason met her halfway, his lips crashing over hers.</p> <p>He held her tight and sank deep, as if he could inhale her all at once. The inexplicable need to be close to him, along with a sense of rightness, stunned her.</p><p>Gia opened herself to him and took the aggression of his kiss. It had been such a long time, and she wanted him, craved the sense of safety and care he inevitably gave her. She\u2019d done far too much damage to their relationship to expect much more than lust in return, and she should probably use this time to work Jason from her system, in case he was doing the same. Problem was, she didn\u2019t want that at all.</p><p>The last year had proven that she didn\u2019t always get what she wanted.</p><p>Shoving the confusing tangle of her thoughts aside, Gia drowned in his scent, his taste. He made her body ache\u2014and her heart yearn. Lost in him, she gave herself over.</p><p>Suddenly, Jason tore away, drew in a breath, repositioned to get deeper, fisted her towel, and devoured her once again. Gia couldn\u2019t stop herself. Desperate for more, she stumbled over the rim of the tub and pressed her body to his.</p><p>Her husband lurched back against the bathroom counter, and she finally felt every inch of his hardness\u2014chest, abs, thighs, as well as that cock she remembered filling her so perfectly. Gia whimpered as she curled her tongue around his, begging because she couldn\u2019t bother to part from him long enough to speak the words.</p> <p>With a growl, Jason yanked back, panting. He scanned her expression for a long second with a curse before he lifted her and turned, plopping her on the counter. He ripped the corner of the towel from between her breasts. The terrycloth fell away, exposing her entirely. He remained fully clothed, and she felt so vulnerable under his hot stare. Determination stamped itself all over his face. He meant to have her now.</p><p>Gia\u2019s nipples peaked. Her stomach knotted with excitement as her blood fired hot and her pussy clenched. If he walked away from her again, she swore she\u2019d shrivel up or go insane, so she did the one thing she knew would inflame him.</p><p>She lowered her gaze, noticing the big bulge beneath his fly, and spread her legs for him. \u201cTake me.\u201d</p><p>Jason clenched his teeth. It would be so easy to do that.</p><p>But instinct told him that he had to decide whether he merely wanted his pound of flesh...or to keep his wife by his side forever.</p><p>If he let Gia into his life again, he would have to remove feeling from their arrangement or risk her hurting him once more. But if he took her to bed now only to watch her slip through his fingers again later, then what?</p><p>At the thought, Jason was torn between leaving the room once more until he could be rational or fucking her absolutely senseless.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he muttered.</p> <p>How had she crawled under his skin again so quickly? Or had he ever truly stopped caring? Jason knew the answer. It wasn\u2019t a comfort.</p><p>So he had to find some way to induce her to stay, figure out what she wanted and give it to her, no matter the cost.</p><p>His entire life, he had wondered why his father had been stupid enough to marry Samantha, knowing she cared about his money far more than him. Sadly, Jason understood now.</p><p>\u201cSpell it out for me,\u201d he insisted, clasping her face in his hands and spearing her gaze with his own. \u201cWho am I and what do you want from me? Exactly. I won\u2019t have any more miscommunication between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want you inside me, Mr. Denning.\u201d Gia\u2019s voice trembled.</p><p>She gave a shit about what happened here. If nothing but nerves caused her shaky tones, she wouldn\u2019t have sounded so damn steady when they\u2019d argued earlier.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sceneing right now. Try again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJ-Jason...\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWho am I to you? Just some guy you want to fuck?\u201d</p><p>She recoiled, shock raising her brows and dropping her jaw. \u201cNo. We might not have had an ideal first year or even a honeymoon, but legally we\u2019re still married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ve never had the chance to truly be your husband, so where does that leave us?\u201d</p><p>Gia tried to back away. \u201cI thought you wanted sex.\u201d</p><p>Jason held firm. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask what you thought I wanted. You\u2019re avoiding my question.\u201d</p><p>Her expression looked a bit guilty. \u201cYou\u2019re my husband.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And...?\u201d</p><p>The way Gia squirmed in his grasp told him that she wasn\u2019t ready to admit any feelings she might be having for him. Oh, she was willing to cede her body. Jason meant to use it to bind her to him. Once he\u2019d managed that, he would work like hell to capture at least a corner of her heart. If that didn\u2019t work...well, he had more money.</p><p>\u201cSpit it out. What do you want from me? Does tonight mean anything or do you just have a fire that needs putting out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she insisted. \u201cWhy are you making everything between us sound so ugly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m simply making sure I understand what you\u2019re begging for.\u201d</p><p>Her lips tightened. She leaned back against the mirror with a huff and grabbed for her towel to gather it around her body. He slammed his hands down on either side of her hips, pinning the terrycloth to the counter.</p><p>\u201cLet me have it,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a little growl. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who demanded we spend this time together. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor you to stop hiding from me and be honest.\u201d</p><p>Gia crossed her arms over her naked breasts. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? I\u2019ve never stopped wanting you. Fine. There\u2019s the truth, but I like you much better when you\u2019re nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d Jason turned her words over in his head. \u201cWhat the hell does that mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know, like when you helped me into the bath and rubbed my shoulders, unlike when you accused me of being horny or desperate for just any man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you like it when I kissed you and shoved my fingers up your cunt?\u201d</p><p>A little flush dashed up her cheeks. \u201cYou know I did.\u201d</p><p>Her admission wasn\u2019t loud, but he heard it. And he understood. Gia opened to him every time he treated her like a treasured lover. Was there any chance she actually still cared?</p><p>The thought revved him far more than it should.</p><p>\u201cPut your arms around me.\u201d</p><p>It took her a long moment to release the grip on her biceps. Finally, she did and scooted closer, raising her arms to him slowly until she clasped them behind his neck.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Her body heat rose and her scent swirled all around him. Hell, just having her here made him rabid with the need to claim her now. He should probably stop, get control of himself and the situation, regroup and plan. All he really wanted to do was consume her in a blistering conflagration so she never considered leaving him again.</p><p>Jason covered her lips with his own once more. He gave up anything that resembled careful consideration and seized her mouth with a scorching kiss, stroking deep, feeling her lips mold to his kiss. Gia\u2019s breath caught, and she grabbed at his hair. Desire pinged from her body to his and back, revving with enough charge to power Dallas on a sweltering day.</p><p>Gathering her thighs in his desperate grip, he pulled them wide and dragged her closer until his aching fly rested against her pussy. Jason cursed the zipper separating them. Why the hell hadn\u2019t he taken his clothes off, too?</p><p>Dragging in a determined huff, he broke away and pulled at his shirt, not really caring how he got the damn thing off. As he tugged, some of the buttons pinged onto the floor, but BFD. Claiming his wife again was far more important.</p><p>His jeans fell victim next to his blazing need to be inside Gia. He ripped at the snap and yanked down the zipper, then shoved them off until he, too, stood naked and needy.</p><p>Some part of him really hated wanting her so much. That voice screeching in his head sounded like his father\u2014calculating and remote. But he wondered how he\u2019d last another hour without her, much less the rest of his life. Jason had never been good at forming attachments, but with Gia it had just...happened.</p><p>Fuck, these feelings were so foreign. Even if they gave her too much power, he wanted to be inside her in the next sixty seconds or less.</p><p>Jason reached into the bathroom cabinet and grabbed a condom. \u201cTell me again you want this.\u201d</p><p>Gia nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me you want me.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze clung to him as her face softened. \u201cI haven\u2019t wanted anyone else since I met you.\u201d</p><p>At her trembling admission, his cock ached even more. If he hadn\u2019t had the same experience, he probably would have bowed to his inner cynic and assumed she was lying. But he knew firsthand how true those words could be.</p><p>\u201cNo regrets afterward,\u201d he warned.</p><p>Hesitation flitted across her expression. It bothered Jason. Worried him, even.</p><p>Finally, she shook her head. \u201cNo. I\u2019m not going to feel whole until I\u2019m with you again, at least this once.\u201d</p><p>Once, my ass. After he took her, there\u2019d be no letting her go again. But no way was he going to argue when he could be immersing himself inside the slickest, hottest heaven he\u2019d ever lost himself in.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t hold back.\u201d He tore into the foil and rolled the condom down his aching cock.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to.\u201d</p><p>And I won\u2019t let go. For better or worse...until death do us part.</p><p>The silent vow made, Jason swiped a pair of fingers through Gia\u2019s folds. She moaned, and her wet heat put all his worries to rest. His wife was every bit as ready as he felt, and later he would touch her at will, delight in seeing her flush and pant and whimper for the orgasms he vowed to give her. He\u2019d also take her properly in the bed he intended to share with her for the rest of their lives. Right now, he needed to make her his again.</p><p>Jason clasped her thighs and dragged her ass to the very edge of the counter. He was damn thankful that he was tall and had long legs. And then he didn\u2019t think anything at all as he wrapped his hand around his cock and guided it to her swollen, weeping cunt.</p><p>As soon as he buried the head inside Gia\u2019s sweltering opening, he clutched her hips, fused his stare to hers, and began to tunnel inside. She gripped him like hot silk and made his eyes cross as pleasure instantly blazed through his body.</p><p>As he pushed deeper, she tensed and gasped. Jason gritted his teeth. It had been nearly a year for both of them. Of course she was tight. He fought the urge to shove his way balls deep and pound at her pussy. Damn it, he didn\u2019t want to be wearing this condom. Taking her bare and feeling her walls clench down on him in climax before he spilled his seed deep inside her, hoping she would swell with their child...</p><p>Hell, he had to stop thinking that before he lost all self-control. He\u2019d waited way too long to be inside Gia again to rush this.</p><p>Slow strokes, easy pumps back and forth. She gripped his shoulders, her eyes widening with every inch he managed to work inside her.</p><p>\u201cGia.\u201d His voice sounded like he\u2019d honed it with sandpaper. \u201cTake all of me.\u201d</p><p>Fighting to get inside her, the friction of her tight flesh all over his... Fuck, it was unraveling him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying.\u201d She nearly cried the words.</p><p>\u201cDeep breath. In...yes. Now let it out.\u201d Amazingly, she relaxed around him, and he sank a little farther, over halfway in. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJason,\u201d she keened.</p><p>He grabbed her hips tighter, his fingers biting. \u201cI know,\u201d he panted. \u201cAnother deep breath. We\u2019re so good together. Once you let me in, I\u2019m going to fuck you deep and make you feel so good. Just let me...yeah. Like that,\u201d he groaned as he slid completely inside her. \u201cOh, baby.\u201d</p><p>Gia grabbed his shoulders and mewled, moving in perfect rhythm underneath him.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so damn good. I couldn\u2019t think about anything all day but you.\u201d He caressed her lush ass and withdrew in a torturously slow stroke.</p> <p>\u201cI imagined this,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI fantasized about us.\u201d</p><p>Her pleading expression fueled his urge to thrust deep once more. His need to spur her climax drove him to action. Once he finished, he intended to do it again and again until they were sated and spent and smiling.</p><p>Determined, he shoved deep inside her once more. This time, submerging was as easy as diving into a warm pool of water.</p><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d Her nails bit into him. \u201cIt feels so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect. Yeah.\u201d He thrust a fist in Gia\u2019s silky dark hair and fastened his mouth to hers, drinking her in and filling her every way he could.</p> <p>Her whimper made him harder. His balls tightened and his heart twisted. He did his level best to undo her one relentless thrust at a time. Her spice filled his nostrils. She made love the way she lived life, with caring and honesty\u2014throwing her whole self into it. Her pussy clung to him, as if she couldn\u2019t bear for him to leave her for even a moment. The sensations had him flirting with orgasm. And with every thrust, he only craved her more.</p><p>Gia tore her lips from his with a gasp. \u201cFaster. Harder!\u201d</p><p>Normally, he didn\u2019t take orders well from anyone, especially a submissive. But tonight, he couldn\u2019t disagree. \u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Jason slammed back inside her, deeper than he could ever remember being. His cock prodded her cervix. Her nails clawed his back. She cried out in pleasure. He set up a merciless rhythm, chasing their pleasure until his heart pounded in his ears and his legs trembled. Fuck, he wasn\u2019t going to last, and he had to make sure that she didn\u2019t either.</p><p>Jason slid his hand between them, fingertips circling her clit. Gia tightened and clawed at him, her cunt clamping down. She blinked up and held her breath, silently begging, every muscle braced in anticipation. Then she wailed out her climax. The sound bounced off the tile walls and floors, ringing in his ears. He wanted more of that.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, baby. Yes...\u201d he groaned as she sucked him deeper. \u201cSo. Fucking. Good.\u201d</p> <p>As her peak stretched on, unrestrained and beautiful, his spine tingled, his balls tightened. Jason\u2019s self-control broke.</p><p>He wanted to be the man who gave her more pleasure than she\u2019d ever known, the person she turned to when she needed someone to laugh with, someone\u2019s hand to hold, someone to share her tears. Whatever it took, whatever energy he had to expend or money he had to burn, he would be that man for her.</p><p>With a last long stroke, Jason centered his world entirely on Gia and let go. Her scent filled him. Her flesh surrounded him. His heart beat with hers as he shouted her name in a hoarse groan and gave her everything.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Nine days later</p><p>Gia padded down the stairs, weak morning sunlight drizzling into the kitchen through the thick clouds. Mid-November had turned a bit cooler, and she curled her arms around herself, huddling in Jason\u2019s T-shirt, wishing she\u2019d donned warmer clothes. Then again, he\u2019d take them off in nothing flat. After all, she didn\u2019t need a stitch in bed.</p><p>As she landed in the big open space of the first floor, she found him pacing the great room wearing a pair of sweat shorts. He\u2019d doffed his nylon tank and slung it over one thick shoulder as he pressed the phone to his ear. Even the sight of him made her tingle like a girl in the throes of her first crush.</p><p>\u201cI need a report,\u201d he demanded as he stared out the window.</p> <p>Residual sweat from his workout slicked his wavy hair from his face. The muscles of his back rippled and moved every time he shifted his weight, breathed\u2014or made an angry gesture with his arm, as he did now.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean there\u2019s no progress? That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d Jason paused. \u201cTime is the one thing I lack, so don\u2019t tell me to be patient. It\u2019s been a week. If we\u2019re not getting results, we need another tactic.\u201d</p><p>He walked to the other end of the room, toward the front door. Gia continued to gawk. His broad shoulders tapered into a lean waist, narrow hips, and muscled legs. The thin fabric of his shorts clung to his incredibly appealing backside. He had an athlete\u2019s body, one he pushed to its full potential nearly every morning in the gym downstairs. Today, he\u2019d added extra cardio, making love to her before his workout until she\u2019d screamed\u2014repeatedly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re asking me for suggestions? Isn\u2019t this your area of expertise?\u201d Jason opened the front door, and his Wall Street Journal waited there. He bent to retrieve the paper and clenched it in his fist. \u201cDo you need more money?\u201d</p><p>The party on the other line said something, and Jason tensed even more.</p><p>\u201cThen I don\u2019t want to hear excuses. Solve the problem.\u201d He turned just enough to reveal a chiseled profile and his flush of quiet rage. \u201cYou\u2019ve got seventy-two hours before I cut you loose and find someone who can do what I\u2019ve asked.\u201d</p><p>Her husband conducted business full throttle. She\u2019d been privy to a few of his calls. It shocked her that he spoke fluent Japanese, at least when it came to money management. Whoever he talked to now didn\u2019t quite understand that Jason was used to getting what he wanted and would drive hard until he got it.</p><p>That described their relationship. She\u2019d been trying to hold her heart separate from her body, but every night Jason rocketed her to the stars, urging her on and up until she was spent and dizzy. Then he held her close, their hearts beating together, until she wondered if she could separate from him again without crumbling.</p><p>For so long, Gia had coped by dealing with only the most pressing issues. The future and its associated problems, she\u2019d shoved into a mental compartment marked \u201clater\u201d and locked away. Little by little, Jason pounded at her mental safety barriers like a battering ram. Gia felt perilously close to caving in. The possibility of parting ways with him for good on their anniversary filled Gia with dread.</p><p>\u201cTry that. Spreading the word is critical, but do it carefully,\u201d he insisted, then turned back toward the kitchen. The moment he spotted her, his eyes darkened. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call you back.\u201d Jason didn\u2019t wait for a reply. He simply hung up. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d The word came out breathy, and she kicked herself. She sounded almost as love struck as she felt. A man like Jason could use her feelings to wring all the sex and devotion from her he desired.</p><p>Would giving in be so bad? He no longer seemed to want revenge or simply to bang her out of his system. In fact, the way he talked to and touched her, studied her, and spooned her each night made her wonder if he had something else entirely in mind.</p><p>A shiver wracked her, part cold, part desire as she remembered how he\u2019d bent her over the sofa last night to pump her with ferocious strokes of his thick cock as they looked out over the city\u2019s glittering lights. He\u2019d growled in her ear that he craved her\u2014and that she belonged here with him always.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t smart, but her body had flowed with his, her pleasure rolling up to him like the ocean at high tide. And damn it if her heart hadn\u2019t yearned to stop resisting and surrender.</p><p>\u201cSleep well?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She always did when she curled up beside him. \u201cYou?\u201d</p><p>Jason smiled faintly. \u201cA few hours. You know me.\u201d</p><p>She did. Mentally restless, he always worked on ways to make money grow or plot some business scheme to his advantage. Gia knew damn well his thoughts were hardly limited to commerce and interest rates. Every day he found some new way to engage her until she felt like the most interesting topic he wrapped his thoughts around. When Jason focused on something, he did it with single-minded fervor, and she couldn\u2019t deny how much she loved being the center of his attention.</p><p>If she could experience that every single day, it would be a dream come true. Then again, hadn\u2019t hoping for the fairy-tale ending and ignoring reality landed her in this mess?</p><p>Gia averted her gaze. \u201cI can make breakfast this morning. What would you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo worries. I had a few things delivered. I\u2019ve got fabulous breakfast burritos in the warming drawer and fresh fruit in the fridge. Give me a minute, and I\u2019ll have a surprise, too.\u201d</p><p>He never let her lift a finger. The pampering had been nice at first. Now, she felt without direction. Even if she wasn\u2019t staying forever, she had to contribute. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not useless.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cOf course not. You\u2019re very capable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you see to everything around here. Why won\u2019t you let me pitch in? I cook, Jason. I clean. I do laundry. I can even garden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to. I employ people. Let them do their jobs. You\u2019re here to focus on us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. But what\u2019s the point of me having nothing to do? If it\u2019s to take a vacation, believe me, I haven\u2019t slept this much in a year. I haven\u2019t eaten this much ever. I\u2019m ready to be productive again. You\u2019re still conducting business. Since you don\u2019t want me working on my brother\u2019s case, at least let me contribute in some way.\u201d</p><p>He sent her a sly grin with a flash of white teeth. \u201cIf you think you\u2019re not playing a vital role, let me assure you otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy being available for sex?\u201d</p><p>The smile fell off his face, replaced by a chilly warning. \u201cBy being my wife.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, his ploy made sense. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to show me how you envision every day of our married lives.\u201d</p><p>On the one hand, she was more than a little touched. On the other, she couldn\u2019t live this way. Did Jason think that the \u201cjob\u201d he paid her for in luxuries and physical pleasure was to be at his carnal beck and call?</p><p>He stiffened. \u201cWould that be so terrible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo if we stayed married, you\u2019d insist I hang around and be available whenever you wanted me naked? I wouldn\u2019t do anything vital, like work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would take care of you in every way. Keep you safe, adored, and\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBored out of my damn mind.\u201d She gaped at him. \u201cI need purpose.\u201d</p><p>He stalked closer, eyes narrowed. \u201cYou came here exhausted and half starved. If that\u2019s what \u2018purpose\u2019 does to you, I won\u2019t tolerate it. I\u2019m not expecting you to do nothing. I understand you\u2019re a determined woman with goals. I know your submissive nature drives you to help others. You\u2019ve given a lot to your family. That\u2019s admirable. But you can\u2019t do it all at your own expense, Gia. Let me help you. Why should you give up food and sleep when I can provide them so easily and let you turn your attention to something else important?\u201d</p><p>A half dozen relevant responses raced through her head. Her family wasn\u2019t his responsibility. But they\u2019d already had that argument. She understood his point. They hadn\u2019t been married long, but did the length of time matter? Spouses were supposed to be partners in life. If her mother ever needed help and didn\u2019t tell her father, he\u2019d be very hurt. Fine. Message received.</p><p>Naturally, Jason didn\u2019t want her important task to have anything to do with bringing Tony\u2019s killer to justice. Hunting Ricky Wayman down alone and cuffing him would bring her immense satisfaction...but the task was dangerous almost to the point of suicidal. And in the back of her head, Gia worried that even if she could manage to arrest the thug and a grand jury indicted him, the trial wouldn\u2019t see right served. Her brother\u2019s former partner, Patrick, had quickly recanted his statement that pinned the blame for Tony\u2019s murder on Wayman, so she couldn\u2019t rely on the lone eyewitness account to convict him. But last week she\u2019d learned from another friend in the precinct that Patrick had bought a fancy new boat this past spring. She could guess where that money had come from, and it left a bitter taste in her mouth. She\u2019d called Internal Affairs to report the incident, but hadn\u2019t yet heard a thing. Frustration was setting in.</p><p>If Jason didn\u2019t see her filling Tony\u2019s shoes again to care for Mila and the kids, and if she accepted that trying to bring Wayman to trial might be exasperating\u2014not to mention risky\u2014where did her husband think that left her? Just a guess, but she figured he would be much happier if she didn\u2019t strap on a badge and gun every day and patrol the streets of South Dallas. Gia had mixed feelings about that.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re saying,\u201d she began. \u201cI just don\u2019t know where that leaves me.\u201d</p><p>Jason didn\u2019t answer immediately, and she tensed, watching him open the warming drawer under the oven with a couple of breakfast burritos inside. \u201cBacon or sausage?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBacon,\u201d she answered automatically.</p><p>He grabbed the rolled foil item on the left, then retrieved a plate. As soon as he set her breakfast on the shiny black china, he reached into the refrigerator to pull out a cup of pineapple, bananas, and mandarin oranges. He continually surprised her with her favorite things, and she couldn\u2019t help but be moved, even when she was miffed.</p><p>\u201cTake this to the table.\u201d He handed her the plate, then gestured to the breakfast nook.</p><p>\u201cI need an answer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEat. We\u2019ll talk.\u201d</p><p>Gia knew damn well that arguing with him when he expected her to fill her belly wouldn\u2019t get her anywhere. Shaking her head, she took her breakfast and plopped down at his table, looking out over the city. He lived in the clouds, her prince occupying his castle in the sky...and she could almost get used to sharing his kingdom every day.</p><p>Was she really thinking about staying? The thought was dangerous, but difficult to drown out. How could she do it with so many people relying on her? How did she admit to her family that she\u2019d been married all this time? And how did Jason expect her to fill her days?</p><p>Despite all these obstacles, the sense of rightness when she was with him gripped her and never let go.</p><p>As she unwrapped the burrito, Gia heard the popping of a cork and turned. Sure enough, he was pouring champagne into a flute and adding a little orange juice.</p> <p>Her jaw dropped. \u201cA mimosa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my mother\u2019s favorites.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cI thought you might like it.\u201d</p><p>And he\u2019d arranged this treat because he\u2019d been thinking of her. The whole thing struck her as thoughtful and indulgent, if a little excessive. But he went above and beyond in taking care of her. How could she be angry about that?</p><p>Crap, he had her so confused.</p><p>As she took her first bite of heavenly warm egg-filled burrito and followed with a spoonful of the luscious fruit, Jason finished mixing the drink and brought it across the room, easing it directly in her hand. Beside her plate, he set a bottle of hot sauce. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will as soon as you tell me what you see me doing with my next nine days.\u201d Or the rest of my life?</p> <p>She gulped down half her mimosa, then had to hold in a moan. That tasted really good.</p><p>Jason pulled out the chair beside her and sat. Gia had the distinct impression that he collected his thoughts and organized his words.</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re willing to simply enjoy our time together, but if you genuinely need something to occupy you, come up with ideas and we\u2019ll discuss them. Do you want children someday?\u201d</p><p>The change of subject made her head spin. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>He stood again and paced, paralleling the wall of windows along the north side of the kitchen with his long stride. Sharp and controlled, he pivoted to face her again when he reached the counter and ran out of floor.</p><p>\u201cI do, too. And I want them with you. Let\u2019s cut to the chase. Tell me what you need to stay with me and make that a reality.\u201d</p><p>Gia blinked at him, unable to breathe for a long minute. \u201cYou want us to have children together?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>Nothing in his expression told her what he might be feeling. The only thing she sensed was edginess, a hint of anxiety. He wanted this, probably more than he wished her to know.</p><p>She tried not to soften too much. After all, who knew why he\u2019d chosen her to procreate with. So he wanted her. And he\u2019d given her every reason to suspect he cared. But neither of those truths added up to a reason they should create life together.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What I need to stay? Um...\u201d She tried to give him a coherent answer, but that proved hard with a nonsensical question.</p><p>\u201cYou know.\u201d He gestured impatiently. \u201cTell me what I\u2019ll need to provide in order for you to stay with me. A bigger house, a new car, diamonds, a trip to Paris... Whatever it is, consider it done.\u201d</p><p>Was he serious? \u201cFirst, I\u2019d need a life with fewer problems. I have to figure out what to do about my family. You and I would need to work out our differences and find some common ground. Another house with safe stairs is a must once kids start walking.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cBut buying me a car or jewelry or taking me overseas won\u2019t fix anything unless... Was that supposed to be some bribe to induce me to remain your wife and have your children?\u201d</p><p>He bristled. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest exchange. I give you something you want so I can have something I want.\u201d</p><p>The idea was completely distasteful. \u201cWhat makes you think I would even accept something monetary to enter into motherhood?\u201d</p><p>His face turned colder. \u201cYou would hardly be the first woman. Several of my mother\u2019s friends had monetary provisions rewarding them for the birth of each planned pregnancy written into their prenuptials. Besides, once you accepted my offer to come here in exchange for a better divorce settlement, I saw no reason you wouldn\u2019t be amenable.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d thought wrong. Was that how marriage worked in his experience? \u201cNo! Children aren\u2019t a clause in a contract. People should have them because they\u2019re in love and want to grow their family so they can pass that love down to the next generation.\u201d</p><p>He raised a dark brow at her, a silent rebuke. \u201cLove is...something movie producers and greeting card companies use to manipulate our emotions so we\u2019ll open our wallets. Usually, it\u2019s lust, loneliness, or the desire to display the \u2018right\u2019 wife on your arm. Over time, \u2018death do us part\u2019 is more about one being too fond of the dollar signs in their bank account to engage in a messy divorce. Gia...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cUnconditional love and eternal devotion are seductive thoughts, but they don\u2019t exist.\u201d</p><p>Every word horrified her. She stood to face him, shock bouncing inside her. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019ve seen them every day. I have no clue where you got your warped ideas but... If you really feel this way, why the hell did you marry me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were already having sex,\u201d she argued. \u201cYou didn\u2019t need to marry me for more of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to call you mine. I still do. You fill some void I hadn\u2019t realized existed in my life. I enjoy spending time with you, pampering you, and fucking you. I\u2019d like a family since I didn\u2019t have much of one as a kid. So I need to know what you require in order to make it happen. Give me your price.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour love,\u201d she choked.</p><p>His face closed up. \u201cI could lie, but I\u2019d rather not insult you. What else can I give you?\u201d</p><p>Gia felt time stand still, the air stop. Pain crushed her, starting dead center in her chest and rapidly spreading like a disease.</p><p>\u201cWithout love, I can\u2019t stay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s it? You\u2019re going to divorce me on our anniversary and walk away because I won\u2019t give you syrupy words I don\u2019t believe in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She approached him on bare feet. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you go so you can find someone you will fall in love with so you can see how real it is.\u201d</p><p>With a controlled sigh, he clenched a fist. \u201cI don\u2019t want \u2018someone.\u2019 I want you. I\u2019ll treat you like a queen and give you the world. Can\u2019t that be enough?\u201d</p><p>Gia\u2019s first instinct was to refuse. If she did, it would mean spending her life without Jason. Should she relinquish the man she loved over an ideal? Who was to say that he wouldn\u2019t eventually realize he more than wanted her? That maybe he even loved her deep down? Or was she rationalizing because he had her heart and always would?</p><p>Suddenly, her phone rang from a distant corner of the house. A quick listen told her the ring tone was Mila\u2019s. Had something happened to one of the kids?</p><p>Sending Jason a glance that pleaded with him to understand, she dashed for her purse upstairs.</p><p>He followed. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sister-in-law,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder.</p><p>Cursing under his breath, he trailed her into the bedroom, watching with unwavering focus. Gia couldn\u2019t mistake his impatience to finish their earlier discussion. She felt the same.</p><p>Today had, perhaps, been their most honest conversation. Before they\u2019d married, she and Jason had lived in the moment. She\u2019d read enough about his upbringing online to know that hers had been vastly different. He must know that, too. Since she\u2019d returned to Jason, they had shared space, but they hadn\u2019t really tried bridging the chasm between them.</p><p>This morning felt like a first step.</p><p>As the fourth ring pealed, Gia snatched her phone from her purse and hit the button, pressing the device to her ear. \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi, G,\u201d Mila greeted. \u201cSorry to bother you. Just a quick question. Where did you leave TJ\u2019s insurance card?\u201d</p><p>Her sister-in-law had taken to calling Tony Jr. by his initials because Mila could no longer bear to speak her late husband\u2019s name.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in your purse or affixed to the fridge?\u201d Gia asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s not in the junk drawer or with your mom, either. I\u2019ve looked in the obvious places. Last I remember, you had it when you took him in for his cough.\u201d</p><p>Crap. Yes, she had\u2014the day before she\u2019d come to Jason\u2019s.</p><p>Gia plowed through her purse and found her wallet. The second she opened it, the little card spilled out. \u201cI\u2019ve got it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need it.\u201d</p><p>Her heart stopped. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I totally forgot that TJ has a well appointment today. I wish they\u2019d let me use my card, but I guess the insurance company is cracking down against members using the wrong one, so...\u201d Mila paused. \u201cIs there any way we can meet so I can get it? His appointment is at three.\u201d</p><p>A glance over her shoulder told Gia that Jason stood in the doorway, staring and conscious of every word she spoke to her sister-in-law. She barely managed not to wince. Introducing Jason to Mila might as well be introducing him to the whole family. No way would her brother\u2019s wife keep quiet about a man. But Gia already knew that crossing town to spend a few hours without him wasn\u2019t an option. She\u2019d committed to spending twenty-four/seven with him until their anniversary.</p><p>\u201cHow about if I drop it off at the doctor\u2019s office and you can pick it up there? I have to get back downtown this afternoon, and I\u2019d rather not fight rush hour traffic.\u201d Gia rubbed at a pain in her chest that couldn\u2019t be anything but a stab of guilt.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Mila sounded a little surprised and hurt that she didn\u2019t want to meet for a cup of coffee or lunch, like they usually would, but her sister-in-law could be a one-woman inquisition. If Jason was anywhere in earshot, he would state the bald truth.</p><p>What a terrible way for her close-knit family to find out the two of them had been married for nearly a year.</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll have it there by one or so.\u201d She sent Jason another glance for confirmation, and he nodded.</p><p>Then he slipped from the room and headed down the hall, toward the stairs. Gia breathed a guilty sigh of relief that he\u2019d elected to let her finish her conversation in private.</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d Mila assured.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the new nanny?\u201d Gia almost held her breath, anxious for the answer.</p><p>\u201cIncredible! I don\u2019t know how you managed to talk your new boss into paying for someone so amazing. The kids love Colleen, and she\u2019s made life so easy. I wish I could keep her forever.\u201d</p><p>A sad relief. Great that the woman was working out, but Gia\u2019s worry that she\u2019d failed her family hurt. She\u2019d given her all, but between work and hunting Wayman, there hadn\u2019t been enough of her to go around.</p><p>\u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey miss their Auntie G,\u201d Mila added.</p><p>\u201cI miss them, too.\u201d She tried not to cry. In truth, she missed her whole family.</p><p>\u201cHopefully, you won\u2019t be busy much longer,\u201d Mila said gently. \u201cOh, the other reason I called... We\u2019ve had to move your father\u2019s birthday dinner to tonight. I know it\u2019s short notice and you\u2019ve got a tight job, but any chance you can make it? It would mean a lot to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight? Dad\u2019s birthday isn\u2019t for two weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanksgiving is late this year, so his big day falls on Black Friday. The Delvecchios are out of town that weekend for the holiday.\u201d</p><p>The family owned her dad\u2019s favorite little hole-in-the-wall for food. He wouldn\u2019t want to celebrate anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cYour mom and I realized it this morning, so we rescheduled,\u201d Mila went on. \u201cPlease come.\u201d</p><p>How would that work? She doubted seriously that Jason would allow her to attend a family event without him. In fact, he\u2019d told her just minutes ago that he wanted to be with her a lot longer than nine days. It stood to reason that he\u2019d demand to meet the Angelotti clan.</p><p>When she and Jason had first eloped, she\u2019d had a plan to invite her parents over for dinner, introduce Jason and let them get to know him over the meal, then announce that they were husband and wife. But once Tony had been killed, her plan had gone out the window. Gia didn\u2019t know how to broach the subject with them a belated year later. Or if she even should. She\u2019d know what to do once she\u2019d decided whether to stick it out with Jason or throw in the towel. But springing a surprise marriage on her father, especially when it might not last, wouldn\u2019t be much of a birthday gift. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI want to come, but I\u2019m really tied up here.\u201d Gia winced. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do... If I get free, tell me again what time I should be at Delvecchio\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFive thirty. It was the only time they could take us last minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can be done with my downtown appointment this afternoon by five thirty. Don\u2019t be surprised if y\u2019all have to go on without me.\u201d Gia made a mental note to ask Jason if they could shop for a gift today and drop it off at the restaurant before her family arrived.</p><p>\u201cI was afraid you\u2019d say that.\u201d Mila sounded disappointed. \u201cIf your schedule changes and you can make it, then come by. I know your dad would be thrilled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSure. Yeah. Thanks for the heads up. If I end up having to leave the gift at the restaurant, I\u2019ll text you. Talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>Gia shoved her phone in her purse again and turned suspiciously to the hall, wondering if she\u2019d find Jason lurking there. But no. She crept downstairs and found him in the kitchen sipping coffee and browsing his newspaper.</p><p>\u201cSo we need to drop your nephew\u2019s insurance card by the pediatrician\u2019s office?\u201d</p><p>His question rattled her. \u201cI can take care of it and be back by two.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s blue eyes turned dark, his entire expression disapproving.</p> <p>Or not...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be driving you, Gianna.\u201d He spoke her full name, telling her with just one word that she\u2019d reached an unbendable boundary.</p><p>She tried to hold in a sigh. \u201cI also need to drop off a little something for my dad. Would it be possible to stop by a mall first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have time, I understand. You sounded like you were on an important call when I first came downstairs, so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing is more important than you.\u201d</p> <p>His words made her stomach flutter. Honestly, she didn\u2019t understand her husband. He hadn\u2019t even pretended that he believed in love, yet he\u2019d done everything to make her happy, comfortable, and sated since she\u2019d walked through his door. If he\u2019d told her that he loved her this morning, she would have believed him. Oh, his demeanor could be remote. But his behavior spoke volumes, every word saying so clearly that he cared.</p><p>Confused and yearning, Gia lowered her gaze. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure. Why don\u2019t you shower? I\u2019ll set out something for you to wear. We\u2019ll leave when you\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find my own clothes. You don\u2019t have to...\u201d</p><p>Gia stopped. No, Jason didn\u2019t have to choose her clothes, but his raised brow told her that he wanted to. In fact, he insisted. It should really bug the independent woman in her, but the idea that he sought to select every stitch on her body from the skin out excited her.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cExcellent. Off with you. I\u2019ll take care of everything else.\u201d</p><p>Jason watched his wife walk up the stairs. She intended to keep him separate from the rest of her life. Not acceptable. He suspected Gia worried about her parents\u2019 reaction to their marriage. No, he wasn\u2019t Catholic, but Marco and Silvana Angelotti would surely find other redeeming qualities in him\u2014namely that he would always take care of their daughter.</p> <p>Later, he\u2019d allow himself to feel disappointment in Gia\u2019s behavior. Now, he had other plans.</p><p>Before he\u2019d asked Thorpe to reach out to his wife, Jason had examined his marriage from every angle and found three impediments to making their relationship last. He\u2019d cured the first by bringing Gia here to actually spend time with him so she could see what their life together might be like. He hadn\u2019t completely fixed the second problem, but he\u2019d started the process. It shouldn\u2019t take much longer. The last? Well, maybe today he could enact change...even if he had to force her to face her fear.</p><p>For now, he\u2019d show her a pleasurable afternoon while he ironed out this new wrinkle between them: her insistence on love.</p><p>Frowning, he pulled out his phone and made a few arrangements, then headed upstairs to the bedroom he shared with his wife. That had a nice ring, and he had to admit that he\u2019d been much happier since getting her under his roof. She looked better rested. He\u2019d even managed to put a few pounds back on her. All in all, it had been a successful nine days.</p><p>Time to step up his game and close the deal.</p><p>Once in the master bedroom, he heard the shower running behind the closed bathroom door. Prowling to his adjoining walk-in closet, he opened his armoire and pulled out a few bags. He\u2019d carefully chosen the contents of each over the past week. A bra here, a skirt there. Understated but sexy heels. A designer bag with a beautiful pop of bright pink. According to his assistant, these would thrill Gia, and he enjoyed buying her things she\u2019d never buy for herself.</p><p>Next, Jason pulled open the jewelry drawer. Inside, he found the Tiffany blue velvet box with Gia\u2019s wedding ring tucked away and clutched it in his fist.</p><p>Nothing ventured, nothing gained...</p><p>With a decisive nod, he shut the armoire doors and laid all the items out on their bed, including the ring.</p><p>Quickly, he made use of one of the showers down the hall, then returned and dressed, just waiting for her reaction. It should be enlightening.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>About mid-morning, they pulled up in front of one of the swanky, old-money malls of Dallas. She\u2019d heard of this place, but it was easily thirty minutes from her part of town, and she\u2019d never had the bank account to shop here.</p><p>Gia pursed her lips. She couldn\u2019t blame Jason for bringing her to this mall when she hadn\u2019t been specific about which one she wanted. His condo wasn\u2019t far from here, and to a guy, one shopping center was probably as good as the next. Hopefully, at least one store would allow her to buy a present for her dad that didn\u2019t cost her an arm and a leg. But when they breezed in from the parking lot and the first merchant on her right was Tiffany, Gia didn\u2019t hold much hope.</p><p>And it reminded her of the little blue box Jason had put on the bed beside the ensemble\u2014minus panties, of course\u2014that he\u2019d instructed her to wear. In every other way, the outfit was classy, well-made, and fit perfectly. She\u2019d squealed over the raspberry-colored Kate Spade bag. Even the black Jimmy Choo kitten heels were surprisingly comfortable. Since the tags had still been on everything, she\u2019d choked at the cost. Was Jason insane? Nine hundred dollars for a Roberto Cavalli skirt? She would never have even looked at something this pricy, much less bought it. But this was his show, so she\u2019d worn everything he\u2019d given her, hoping like hell she didn\u2019t spill anything and stain the garments.</p><p>Jason escorted her inside, then stopped her with a subtle grasp in front of the legendary jeweler. \u201cWhere\u2019s your ring, Gianna? I set it out for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>Damn. She\u2019d known he would ask. \u201cIn my purse. I don\u2019t think wearing the ring is such a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be Mrs. Denning much longer?\u201d</p><p>Gia hesitated. Everything between them was up in the air. Until she figured out whether she could stay with a man who might never say he loved her, she had to play it safe. \u201cBecause at this point we\u2019ve only agreed to spend a few more days together. I\u2019d hate to lose it while we\u2019re deciding about the future.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look happy with her answer. \u201cDo you dislike it?\u201d</p><p>It was far bigger than anything she\u2019d ever imagined someone putting on her finger. She was almost afraid to find out how much he\u2019d spent on it. Every minute she\u2019d worn it last year, she\u2019d checked to make sure the center stone hadn\u2019t somehow popped out or that the ring hadn\u2019t slipped off her finger.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, I\u2019ll get you something else.\u201d He looked toward Tiffany &amp; Co.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I just...\u201d How did she put this into words? \u201cThe conversation we had this morning disturbed me. The point of marriage and family is love. Desire isn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean to give up on us because I won\u2019t say three silly words? Other than that one conversation, we\u2019re getting along perfectly. I\u2019ve enjoyed this time with you more than I can express. Until this morning, I believed you felt the same. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>Lying wouldn\u2019t solve anything. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Having a realistic view of marriage in no way negates the fact that I care about you. You\u2019re not just a trophy or a body to me. I believe we can have a good life together. I\u2019ve got nothing against roses and champagne. I\u2019m happy to buy you all the lace you want. I\u2019m too direct to ever compare your eyes to stars or whatever romantic drivel people spout. Beyond that, no two people should have their world revolve entirely around the other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that is love.\u201d Was he really that clueless? Where did he get these notions? She had a suspicion... \u201cYou know, we never talked about your parents. Tell me about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me put your wedding ring on your finger and I will.\u201d When she opened her mouth to object, he shushed her. \u201cIf you lose it, it\u2019s insured. I\u2019ll replace it. Any other objections?\u201d</p><p>At the moment? \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>In truth, the ring was beautiful, but it was dangerous to entertain the fantasy they were a loving husband and wife out together for a relaxing afternoon before they returned home to cuddle on the couch to watch TV or make love.</p><p>\u201cSo what\u2019s the problem? Do you want to avoid wearing my ring more than you want to hear about my parents?\u201d</p><p>With his tight jaw and down slashing brows, he turned away angrily. But when Gia curled a hand around his elbow and nudged him to face her, he looked more hurt than anything. Her resistance melted.</p><p>\u201cI do want to hear.\u201d Gia dug into her purse and laid the cheerful blue box in her palm.</p><p>Jason\u2019s big fingers curled around hers, her ring sandwiched between them. When they touched, the electric contact gave her a jolt. He curled his other hand around her neck and cradled her head. God, she always got so lost in his eyes...</p><p>During their year apart, she\u2019d often had dreams about him. No matter what happened during those episodes, when she woke, it was his eyes that haunted her. But she loved so much more about Jason.</p><p>His sophisticated precision and the relentless way he attacked life had always fascinated her, yes. He cut through the BS and simply said what others only dared to think. Once he\u2019d zeroed in on her, he\u2019d quickly snagged her attention and conquered her heart. Since then, he hadn\u2019t let go. Gia thought she had, but now she wasn\u2019t so sure.</p><p>\u201cBaby...\u201d he murmured as he bent to brush a kiss over her lips.</p><p>Gia closed her eyes, soaked Jason in, and opened to him. With something between a sigh and a groan, he took her mouth, plunging deep, his grip tightening on her. He took her breath as he stole her heart all over again.</p><p>She grabbed his shoulders, wriggling closer and fusing herself against him. How could she want him again so desperately? But like always, the moment their lips met, the passion sparked to a blaze that quickly became a conflagration.</p><p>Because she loved him. But according to him, he would never love her in return.</p><p>Damn it, what was she supposed to do about that?</p><p>As he let go of her hand and gripped her wrist to bring her closer, someone jostled them and cleared her throat. Gia looked up to find an elderly woman silently scolding them as she passed.</p><p>Jason smothered a laugh. \u201cGuess she doesn\u2019t believe in PDA.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPublic displays of affection weren\u2019t big in her day. My parents don\u2019t mind indulging, but I remember my grandparents. OMG, the moment my mom and dad would kiss, my granddad would bluster and rail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds nice, actually. I never knew my grandparents.\u201d With a sad smile, he plucked the box from her palm and opened it. \u201cGive me your hand.\u201d</p><p>With her heart thumping, she did. When he removed the ring, he snapped the little case shut and pocketed it before sliding the gorgeous jewel on her finger. The moment hovered, breathless and profound as he settled the ring in place. It still fit perfectly, and the diamonds glittered in the light. Just like the first time she\u2019d seen it, Gia fell speechless.</p><p>\u201cI really will get you something else if you don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think?\u201d She looked up at him, blinking in shock. \u201cI love it. If I never told you that, I\u2019m sorry. Wearing it terrifies me. Losing it would be crushing because it\u2019s the most beautiful thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>Jason breathed what looked like a sigh of relief. If he didn\u2019t have deep feelings for her, if it\u2014like her\u2014was just a status symbol, would her opinion even matter?</p><p>\u201cTell me about your parents.\u201d She squeezed his hand.</p><p>His smile looked tight and cynical as he squeezed back and let go, strolling deeper into the mall. \u201cWell, my father married my mother, his assistant, after he got her pregnant. He was fifty-five. She was twenty-three. He divorced his first wife, leaving her and their three college-aged children. My mother wanted wealth, and he wanted an upgrade on his piece of ass.\u201d He cocked his head and sent her a challenging glance. \u201cAre you thinking, \u2018poor little rich boy with the scarred psyche?\u2019\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Actually, yes. She might have grown up knowing her family watched every penny, but she\u2019d never had any doubt they loved one another.</p><p>\u201cWere they happy at all? Ever?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cMom was happy when she was shopping. I think my father was happy when he was showing off his pretty, young wife so everyone could see what great taste in women he had. They \u2018oohed\u2019 and \u2018aahed\u2019 that he could afford her. To this day, she\u2019s very expensive looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNone of that is happiness,\u201d she pointed out.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that.\u201d He took her hand in his.</p><p>\u201cSo they weren\u2019t affectionate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe \u2018affection\u2019 my parents shared was outlined in their prenuptial agreement. If my father wanted more, it usually cost him at least a new Louis Vuitton bag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo basically, he bought her?\u201d</p><p>Jason paused, then nodded. \u201cI suppose, but she wanted it that way. He didn\u2019t object.\u201d</p> <p>That explained why he spent ridiculous amounts of money on her and why he didn\u2019t believe in love. Why he\u2019d been trying to buy his way into filling her womb with his children. He only understood what he\u2019d seen.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the way marriage should be,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cForgive me if I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d He sent her a brittle smile. \u201cNow, what do you need at the mall?\u201d</p><p>Biting her lip, Gia vacillated. Tell him? Don\u2019t tell him? If she spilled, he\u2019d insist they go to her father\u2019s party. The family would learn her secret...and there would be trouble. Besides, if she introduced Jason to everyone and they didn\u2019t stay married, she\u2019d shock her parents and break their hearts. Her mom and dad were fairly hip about lots of things, but they were still Catholic. They didn\u2019t believe in divorce.</p><p>On the other hand, no one had ever shown Jason real love. Maybe he needed her far more than she knew. Or maybe she was inventing reasons to stay with him because she wanted to so badly.</p><p>She needed time to think.</p> <p>\u201cJust a little something for my dad,\u201d she hedged. \u201cIt won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p><p>He said nothing, just led her through the mall. Gia had the vague sense that he was disappointed. Or maybe that was just her guilt talking...</p><p>It didn\u2019t take too long before Gia found a nice pair of wool-lined leather gloves and a striking plaid scarf for her father. She protested their expense and moved on. Since pinching pennies in Neiman\u2019s was counterintuitive, the second she sought the restroom, Jason went back and purchased the gift for her father. Marco Angelotti was his father-in-law, even if the man didn\u2019t know it. Besides, Jason had an ulterior motive.</p><p>Bag in hand, he waited for Gia at the end of the hallway outside the restrooms. She came out with fresh lipstick and a smile.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking, if we start heading toward my parents\u2019 house, there\u2019s a sporting goods store Dad likes to browse that\u2014\u201d She peered at the bag in his hand. \u201cWhat did you buy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe items you think your father will enjoy. And don\u2019t say a word. He\u2019s important to you, so he\u2019s important to me. End of conversation.\u201d</p><p>She pursed her lips together. \u201cIt\u2019s not. There\u2019s no way I can afford those, so he\u2019ll know they didn\u2019t come from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake the price tags off and say you got a great deal.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cOf course, you could always tell him the gift is from his daughter and son-in-law.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a good idea. The first thing they\u2019ll want to know is if you love their little girl. If you can\u2019t say yes and mean it, they won\u2019t be welcoming.\u201d</p><p>If they had a drop of practical blood in their veins, they\u2019d realize he could provide for her and any children they had in great style. They might not be thrilled that he\u2019d joined the family, but he\u2019d bet they\u2019d be smart enough not to object.</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me. I can be very convincing.\u201d He took her by the elbow.</p><p>Gia tensed, and Jason had no doubt she was flustered. Time to take his pretty wife in hand and start persuading her that love was just another four-letter word. She mattered to him. They could enjoy one another and build a solid foundation on which to raise children. And he\u2019d spend every moment they had left together proving it.</p><p>\u201cCome with me.\u201d Jason led her toward a section filled with clothing that looked well-made and stylish with a hint of sexy.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndulge me for...\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cAn hour or two. You don\u2019t have to be at the pediatrician\u2019s office for a while.\u201d</p><p>She frowned, still agitated about her dad\u2019s gift. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and led her to a rack of sexy black skirts that would hug her ass in the best possible way.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a very manicured fifty-something saleswoman asked them.</p><p>\u201cNo. We\u2019re just browsing,\u201d Gia answered.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he contradicted. \u201cMy wife wants to try this skirt on.\u201d He spotted a shimmery blouse in a champagne shade that would look fabulous against her skin. \u201cAnd that. I\u2019d like to see some casual clothes, too. Classic, but not stuffy. Something age appropriate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe also needs lingerie and shoes.\u201d He rattled off her sizes.</p><p>Gia gaped at him. \u201cJason!\u201d</p><p>He patted her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We have time.\u201d</p><p>Because he wasn\u2019t going to hear a damn word about money. His subtle warning glare should tell her that.</p><p>\u201cWill your wife need a purse or two? Any jewelry or cosmetics?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. If you\u2019ll bring the purses with the outfits to the dressing room so she can see how everything looks together, I\u2019d appreciate that. Also, we\u2019re going to need this block of dressing rooms to ourselves. My wife is very private, and I respect her modesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d The woman bowed her pale head deferentially. \u201cI\u2019ll call some other associates and we\u2019ll be happy to bring you everything you requested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He grabbed Gia\u2019s hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll wait for you inside.\u201d</p><p>The moment the woman hustled away, no doubt adding up her potential commission, Jason led his shocked bride to the fitting rooms against the far wall.</p><p>As soon as they walked into the partitioned area and saw that they were alone, she stopped and gaped at him. \u201cAre you crazy? I don\u2019t need all that. I certainly can\u2019t affor\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop. Right. There.\u201d He glowered. \u201cI asked you to indulge me and you agreed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you wanted me to look at something interesting.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cConsider me spoiling you the most fascinating subject ever.\u201d</p><p>With a roll of her eyes, she sighed. \u201cI appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do, but you don\u2019t need to buy me anything.\u201d</p><p>Jason studied her with a frown. She would spend every day and night until their anniversary with him for a healthy divorce settlement, but wouldn\u2019t accept his gifts during their marriage? \u201cI didn\u2019t need a new Porsche last month, but it made me happy. Not everything is about necessity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you ever heard the words \u2018frugal\u2019 or \u2018economical?\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have. They only apply when I wish them to. Don\u2019t worry about money, Gia. I have nine zeroes in my bank total. I can handle a day of shopping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t wear any of this when I go back to work.\u201d</p><p>Her argument was somewhere between tiring and insulting. \u201cSo I should not wish to buy things for my wife for the express purpose of seeing her look good or smiling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen explain. If I had to guess, you think that if I spend money on your clothing, I\u2019ll demand something from you in return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt feels a lot like you\u2019re trying to buy me, the way your father did your mother.\u201d</p><p>So she wanted his money without strings? That made sense to the cynic in him, but every other part of him protested that Gia wasn\u2019t mercenary.</p><p>Jason snorted. Either he was getting soft or his wife had played him well.</p><p>\u201cNot at all. Let me put it to you this way: Would your mother ever object to your father if he wanted to do something nice for her?\u201d</p><p>Gia paused, obviously trying to think of some way\u2014any way\u2014she could say yes to that and mean it. Finally, she gave a little huff. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if your father told your mother they could afford something, she would just accept that as fact.\u201d</p><p>Her long sigh told Jason he\u2019d hit a bull\u2019s-eye. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you give me the same courtesy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father would never buy her all the things you\u2019re suggesting,\u201d she argued.</p><p>\u201cHe likes to make her happy, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen if he had the means, I guarantee he would buy her everything in the store she wanted. Hell, you make it sound like he\u2019d give her the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loves her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe values her above all others.\u201d And now they were playing a game of semantics. \u201cJust like I value you. I fail to see the difference.\u201d</p><p>The sales associate saved him whatever argument Gia had on the tip of her tongue by coming in with an armful of bright but warm clothes for the coming winter. She set them in the first dressing room then disappeared and returned moments later with two fellow employees, who each carried in shoes and bags and a stack of lacy panties, sheer bras, and even a pair of stockings or two.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few minutes to check on you. If you need me sooner, there\u2019s a call button on the wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive us half an hour, please.\u201d He smiled politely, but it wasn\u2019t a request.</p><p>The woman didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>As she left, Jason looked around in satisfaction. He\u2019d been inside dressing rooms equipped with what his father used to refer to as the \u201cman chair,\u201d but he\u2019d never seen one outfitted with something between a chaise and a bed. It looked ready for sex. Draped in fuchsia, emerald, bright blue, and gold, he lounged back on the soft surface and watched his wife stomp toward the first dressing room.</p><p>\u201cProblem?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou just take over everything. You bossed that woman around. You always tell me what to do. You even buy me things when I\u2019ve asked you not to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe sales clerk is here to assist us. She doesn\u2019t seem unhappy with the tasks I\u2019ve given her. And I fully expect that, by the time we\u2019ve left, I\u2019ll have made any extra effort worth her while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everything is about money.\u201d</p><p>His pretty wife sounded na\u00efve. \u201cMost everything is. It\u2019s ugly but true. As for you...\u201d He rose from the bed and prowled toward her. \u201cIt\u2019s a husband\u2019s right to provide for his wife, and maybe indulge her every now and then. If it will make you feel better, I won\u2019t ask you for a blow job in exchange for anything I buy. All I want is your company. Why are you angry?\u201d</p><p>When he cupped her shoulder, she shrugged it off and turned away with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not angry. I just feel everything spinning out of control. No matter how I try to stop it\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the problem. You\u2019re trying to control not only this situation, but everything in your life. Baby, no one can.\u201d He turned her back to face him, something inside him hurting when he saw the tears gathering there. \u201cWhen we met at Dominion, you agreed to my Dominance because you said you were ready to give me control. It took you months to truly let go, but every time you relinquished a bit of your tight grip and began to trust me, I was so thrilled and proud of you. During our separation this past year, you seem to have forgotten everything we once worked on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause there was no one else to take on all this responsibility. I had to be strong.\u201d</p><p>That stung. \u201cNo one?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and looked away. \u201cAfter all these months, submitting still feels kind of foreign and irresponsible. Maybe I\u2019m not wired for that any more.\u201d</p><p>Gia still believed she couldn\u2019t let loose and see to her own needs because she\u2019d been so busy caring for everyone else\u2019s for months. She was mistaken. And he\u2019d still love to paddle her for refusing to let him shoulder any of her burden. Arguing certainly wouldn\u2019t get him anywhere. He simply had to show her.</p><p>Jason pressed a kiss to her forehead, her lips, then stepped back. \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looked at him as if he\u2019d lost his mind.</p><p>\u201cDid you have difficulty hearing my command?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOverthinking everything. I\u2019ve given you a simple command.\u201d She wouldn\u2019t remember how much surrender fulfilled her until he gave her the experience again. Once she did, it would bring them closer. \u201cI expect you to obey. Deep down, you want to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gia hesitated, her dark eyes searching his face as if looking for answers. \u201cWhat if someone walks in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeave that to me.\u201d He smiled as he shut the door to the dressing room, enclosing them alone together.</p><p>After another hesitation, she nodded and dropped her hands to her blouse, her trembling fingers working the buttons.</p><p>Jason knew that Gia she was still a police officer who, if caught, would face censure for breaking the law. It had worried her in their past. After playing the role of parent to her niece and nephew, it would worry her even more. But she still trusted him enough to peel off the gauzy shirt covering her pretty breasts and slide it to the floor.</p> <p>He began loosening his own shirt buttons, watching as she fiddled with the waistband of her skirt and hesitated. Gia had to work through this in her head. She\u2019d always had an exhibitionist streak, but struggled with letting go away from the privacy of the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cOff with the skirt. You didn\u2019t disobey me and wear panties, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gia sounded breathy and aroused, just the way he liked her.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d He waited until she pushed the skirt down her hips and stepped out, holding it in front of her like a shield. \u201cHand it to me.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed nervously and paused, then finally held the skirt out to him. Perhaps he\u2019d ease up and take pity on her if her nipples weren\u2019t peaking through her thin bra and she didn\u2019t already look wet.</p> <p>Damn it, he couldn\u2019t wait to get his hands on her. It might sound trite, but every time he explored Gia\u2019s body, he found something new to appreciate, another way to savor her.</p><p>For now, he merely pushed her comfort zone by hanging the skirt over the top of the door behind him, far out of her reach. \u201cNow your bra.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled up as she formed fists. She pressed her lips together. Jason could see the pulse beating furiously at her neck. His wife was going to give into him, and the thought drove him mad with anticipation. Fire seared his veins, engorged his cock. He fought the urge to grab her and tear the undergarment away, then shove her down on his stiff length until she took every inch. Instead, he snapped his fingers, letting her know that his thin patience had given way to expectation.</p><p>She let out a shuddering breath. \u201cJason...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour safe word is still divorce. It\u2019s your only out. Unless you want to use it, give me your bra now. If you make me wait any longer, I\u2019ll spank you here and now. I won\u2019t care at all who hears.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes went round. Gia believed him. Good, because every word was the truth.</p> <p>He held out his hand again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got three seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing me.\u201d</p><p>And she was stalling.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what a Dom does.\u201d He wriggled his fingers.</p><p>With a little wince, she reached behind her and pulled off her bra, then handed it to him. Jason barely looked. He was far too focused on her breasts, their natural weight plump and pretty as they rested gently on her chest. Her nipples stood straight and so beautifully engorged. He\u2019d started this to remind her how satisfied she felt when she put her submission into his hands. But no way could he ignore how stunning she looked.</p><p>Without once taking his gaze from her, he slung her bra on top of her skirt. \u201cCome closer. Cradle your breasts in your hands and present me your nipples.\u201d</p><p>At his words, she whimpered, but she did as he\u2019d commanded, settling her palms underneath the weight of her orbs and lifting them up just enough to thrust their hard tips higher.</p><p>Jason watched her image reflected in the trifold mirror. They showed him her body from every angle, and he decided then to install one near his bathtub just so he could watch her emerge from the warm water, skin steaming and dripping, for his viewing pleasure.</p> <p>Easing into the simple black and chrome chair behind him, he stared at Gia as she edged nearer. Hungry, ready, he itched to fasten his hands on her hips and drag her close enough to taste. Instead, he waited. She had to dredge up her courage and dig a little deeper into her submission with every step forward she took.</p><p>Finally, their knees bumped, and he cast his gaze from her nipples to her face. Nervously, she licked her lips. Smiling, he scanned the rest of her. Gia\u2019s flat belly twitched. She looked far wetter than the last time he\u2019d peeked.</p><p>Excellent.</p><p>\u201cSpread your legs.\u201d</p><p>She stepped out a few inches with her right foot, still supporting her breasts in her hands. God, what a gorgeous sight. Aroused, offering herself, so lush and wanton...</p><p>\u201cWider. Straddle my legs,\u201d he said, slouching in the chair and enjoying the view.</p><p>Gia frowned, her dark brows forming a frown. She glanced down toward his lap and stepped forward, the inside of her knee brushing his thigh. Awkwardly, she stumbled closer, spreading her legs wider until she straddled his own.</p><p>Every delectable part of her was on display for him. She might look hesitant, but he knew her desire and the need to submit had overcome her caution. Breathless, she stood, waiting, looking down at him with need glowing in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he demanded softly.</p><p>\u201cThat you make me ache and want you when I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He petted her thigh, curled his fingers around to the back of her leg, and prowled up until he cupped her ass. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you desire your husband? We won\u2019t get caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t love me.\u201d</p><p>Jason pulled her into his lap, her thighs gripping his hips before he grabbed her chin. \u201cI will place your needs above my own and take care of you until the end of time. I will never let you hunger or suffer or worry. I will bear your burdens, father your children, and hold your hand. No man will ever give you more.\u201d</p><p>And he refused to let this topic fester any more between them now. He\u2019d rather drown out her thoughts with pleasure.</p><p>Cradling her head in his hands, he yanked her toward him. Her lips crashed into his. Gia gasped, conveniently opening to him. Jason took advantage, sliding inside to claim her with a ravaging kiss.</p><p>Intent on stealing her breath, he stroked ever deeper into the silky heaven of her mouth. He tasted the little butterscotch candy she\u2019d sucked on just before they arrived. The musky dew of her cream wafted in the air between them. In his head, the two blended for a sensory buzz that had him reeling.</p><p>Jason urged her closer. Fuck, he had to get inside her soon.</p><p>But he had to fulfill her first. Gia needed to surrender, to pull that submissive part out of her and give everything over to him so he could make her feel safe. So she\u2019d be whole. So they\u2019d have a stronger bond.</p><p>As he broke away from the kiss, he nudged her back and helped her to her feet. He leaned to retrieve a skirt the sales associate had brought Gia to try on and ripped the belt from its delicate loops. \u201cTurn around.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as if she had to steel herself or find courage, but she did exactly as he asked.</p><p>\u201cKeep your legs spread and give me your hands.\u201d</p><p>Gia looked at the two of them in the mirror, her gaze bouncing from her completely exposed body to his face, trying to read him. He remained purposely blank. When she\u2019d submitted and pleased them both, he would make sure she felt his approval.</p><p>Finally, she stepped wide again and wound her hands around to the small of her back. He grabbed them with greedy glee and looped the wide cloth belt around her wrists, loose enough to allow blood to flow, but tight enough to keep her under his control.</p><p>Taking her hips in his hands again, he turned Gia to face him. \u201cPretty. I always like you bound and merciless. Now be a good girl and suck my cock.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught, and she cut her gaze to the dressing room door. They had at least fifteen minutes before anyone interrupted them.</p><p>\u201cFocus on me,\u201d he snapped as he unbuckled his belt and slid the button free. The zipper went down with a little hiss.</p><p>Gia\u2019s breathing picked up speed. She bit her lip as if nerves dive-bombed her, but her skin flushed and her nipples looked harder than ever. The fear of being caught was part of the game for her. It scared her, but not enough to stop playing.</p><p>\u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><p>The words fell from her lips, an automatic response she\u2019d given to him a thousand times when they\u2019d played at Dominion. He\u2019d always loved hearing her shaky little voice acquiescing to his every dirty demand. But now it meant so much more. Whether Gia intended it or not, she was letting him past her walls, allowing him back into her psyche, trusting him.</p><p>The thrill of that raced through him as she lowered herself to one knee, clearly intending to kneel to her task.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he corrected. \u201cStand with your legs spread and bend at the waist. I want to see your pussy in the mirror.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. Somehow, he still managed to shock his little wife every now and then, and that gave him a supreme thrill.</p><p>As he wrapped his hand around his engorged staff, holding it up to her, she began to obey, bending to him slowly. About halfway down, he stopped her with a finger under her chin. \u201cOpen your mouth. Let me see how you intend to take me.\u201d</p><p>Her lips parted. Her brown eyes darkened. He released her face and filtered his fingers into her hair, bracing around her neck to urge her down.</p><p>As she wrapped her plump lips around his cock, he hissed in a breath at the shock of sensation. He focused straight ahead, staring down the line of her back and into the mirror. Every swollen fold of her drenched pussy reflected back at him, pink and scrumptious\u2014and all his.</p><p>Gia curled her tongue around his length, worked the head with a series of slow licks and long pulls, then took him deep, right to the back of her throat. Heat. Thrill. Power. Jason felt drunk on them. But his wife intoxicated him most, her aching, almost desperate submission igniting his blood and torching him like gasoline on a bonfire.</p><p>\u201cGood, baby. Yes...\u201d He fisted her tresses and guided her to a faster rhythm. \u201cDon\u2019t tease me or you know what will happen.\u201d</p><p>She bobbed her head, both nodding her agreement and razing him with a soft glide of lips back up his cock. Her teeth glided over the head. Biting back a moan, he urged her on even faster.</p><p>Fuck, she looked pretty and helpless. She sucked him like she wanted only his pleasure. She saturated him in a heady grip of desire. She was...his world. There was no way he was leaving this dressing room until she\u2019d screamed her release.</p><p>He tugged gently on her hair. \u201cStop.\u201d</p><p>Gia licked her way to the head of his cock, then looked up. Their stares met. Her dark eyes looked doe-soft and yearning. He\u2019d tapped into her submissive nature, and now she couldn\u2019t wait to give him more. She pleaded silently, as if she worried that she\u2019d displeased him or that he\u2019d spurn her. Immediately, he put her fears to rest.</p><p>Jason locked his lips with hers, breathing her in as he urged her mouth open and tasted her. Why did she reach into his chest and yank without mercy at the damnedest times? He wanted to consume her, shove her against the wall and fuck her madly. But he also wanted to slide his skin against hers, his heart beating in sync with hers. He wanted her beside him every damn night of their lives. Jason wasn\u2019t exactly sure why he\u2019d fixated on her, but he couldn\u2019t deny the truth.</p><p>\u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>Gia\u2019s voice cracked. A glance told him that she neared the end of her rope. And if he didn\u2019t want to be interrupted, they were running out of time.</p><p>Jason fished a condom from his pocket and shoved it on in seconds before he snagged her arm and pulled her onto his lap, her legs dangling over the sides of the chair. He sought her opening and plunged deep, filling her cunt completely in seconds. Gia gasped sharply.</p><p>Because her hands were tied behind her, she had no choice but to rest all her weight on him. She also had no way to pull back. No leverage. No control, and he fucking loved it.</p><p>Fingers tightening around her hips, adrenaline and need charged through him as he lifted her up, then used his strength to control her slide down. Slow. Rough. Deep. Her moan shuddered as she tossed her head back. He gritted his teeth and hissed in pleasure. Yeah, he would give her every inch, every ounce of the heat scalding his cock\u2014and she was going to take it.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you wanted?\u201d he growled.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She barely managed the words between pants.</p><p>\u201cDoes this feel good?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, yes.\u201d</p><p>Satisfaction soared. \u201cYou want your husband to fuck you?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m aching...\u201d</p><p>Beneath her, he rolled his hips as he lifted her, then lowered her back onto his erection. Tingles clawed up his spine. His body went electric as he watched her come apart for him. Her brown eyes darkened, softened as her cheeks flushed and her lips parted with a silent moan. Gia wriggled, trying to rush him. Her pussy clenched tight around his dick.</p><p>He impaled her on his length again and grabbed her nape, forcing her to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t determine the pace, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Master,\u201d she whimpered.</p><p>He released her neck and again used his arms to lift her into his strokes. Faster. Rougher. Deeper. Jesus, she was like lightning in his veins. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leaning in, he nipped at her shoulder, then bent and caught one nipple in his mouth. As he sucked, she let out a keening cry.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby. Make noise for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t.\u201d Worry wrenched the words from her.</p><p>\u201cYou will. I\u2019ll take care of everything.\u201d He pulled on her nipple again before switching to the other. \u201cI just want to hear you.\u201d</p> <p>His wife might be worried about being discovered, but this turned her on. Around him, she felt so slick and tight. So stunning and breath stealing.</p><p>\u201cYes...\u201d</p><p>The flush broke out across her chest. Gia gushed all over his cock again. Her little whimpers picked up in volume. She was close.</p><p>\u201cCome for me, my sweet wife, and scream.\u201d</p><p>Her hard breathing became outright pants, then she dragged in one long breath and held it. Jason pumped hard straight into her depths, praying he could fuse them together in a way that would last far longer than the orgasm and its afterglow.</p> <p>Then he wasn\u2019t thinking any more as the ecstasy shot through him like he\u2019d injected it straight into his heart. It zipped through his body, taking over. And as she let out a high-pitched squeal of pleasure in the sound of his name, he released everything he had to her, shuddering through every thrust, doing his best to claim her once and for all.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>An hour later, Gia left the department store still blushing to the roots of her hair and dazed. Beside her, Jason held her hand and carried three huge bags of things he\u2019d bought for her in the other. Behind them, two clerks carried the boxes of shoes her husband had insisted she needed. All eight pairs of them. When she\u2019d pointed out that she only had two feet, he smiled and whispered that he only had one penis, but it really appreciated the view of her in sexy stilettos. Any other objection she\u2019d raised, he\u2019d waved away. His credit card had taken even more of a pounding than she had in the dressing room.</p><p>The thought made her blush again, especially when she recalled the way the sales associate had returned a few minutes later with a gentle clearing of her throat and a repressed smile. Gia herself hadn\u2019t been sure whether to smack Jason for inducing her to do something arrest-worthy or simply giggle. No denying that she felt happier, lighter than she had in over a year. Being with him fulfilled her, and it had nothing to do with what he bought her and everything to do with the way he coaxed her out of her comfort zone and made her feel special with just his touch.</p><p>She was head over heels in love with him again. Well, still. She sighed.</p><p>What could she possibly give him in return? A blue-collar outlook on life? Arrest procedures? He knew how to cuff someone without her pointers. Gia shook her head. She liked herself, but didn\u2019t at all see why a billionaire would pursue her. Was it because she\u2019d left him for the better part of a year and he wanted what he saw as the unattainable?</p> <p>The thought gnawed at her as they loaded the car and left the mall. It chewed some more at her as they glided down the highway, heading west toward her part of town. He drove his sleek black Porsche like he conducted business\u2014aggressively and without paying much attention to the rules.</p><p>\u201cYou get a lot of speeding tickets?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cMaybe a few. What can I say? I like the adrenaline rush.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou one of those idiots who jumps out of perfectly good airplanes with just a canvas backpack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep.\u201d He laughed. \u201cI love skydiving. I\u2019ll get you to try it someday soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, we\u2019ll tandem jump. You\u2019ll enjoy it. I\u2019ll keep you safe,\u201d he promised.</p><p>For no logical reason she could think of, that actually made her reconsider. Jason would do exactly as he said. He would ensure that nothing happened except a crazy jump from five thousand feet and a smooth landing. She trusted him.</p> <p>Of course, would she really be with him long enough to make that a reality?</p><p>Maybe...she should think about their future more. Yes, she was better rested and more relaxed since she\u2019d come to Jason\u2019s condo. But if she stayed, it would only be because he made her genuinely happy. And because they were both in love.</p><p>Once in her neighborhood, she and Jason had a fabulous lunch at a nearby Japanese hibachi and sushi place she\u2019d been wanting to try. Afterward, he drove her to the pediatrician\u2019s office, where she dropped off the insurance card.</p><p>When she hopped back in the car, it wasn\u2019t quite two in the afternoon. She assumed Jason would head back toward the city. Instead, he drove directly to her old house and parked in front of it.</p><p>Gia stared at the cozy little ranch-style abode. It hadn\u2019t been much. Small with an ancient kitchen and a crappy master bathroom. But she\u2019d been proud of the little fixer. She\u2019d bought it with her own money and spruced it up as finances allowed. Seeing it now gave her a terrible pang. She\u2019d lost so much in the last year. Her brother. Her husband in so many ways. She\u2019d also lost her independence and missed it deeply. The thought made her feel selfish, so she tried to squelch it. Truth was, she simply hadn\u2019t been prepared to shoulder the responsibility of her entire family while she\u2019d been in shock and mourning.</p><p>\u201cWhy are we here?\u201d Her voice shook.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you sell your house?\u201d</p><p>Such a complicated question... \u201cLong story short, after my brother\u2019s death, Mila couldn\u2019t cope without me. I was running myself ragged driving the nine miles between her place and mine, sometimes in the middle of the night when Bella was sick or Tony Jr. had nightmares, and grief was eating her alive. She really didn\u2019t function for a good three months.\u201d Gia paused. \u201cMy mom had just had a knee replacement. My dad was a great cop in his day, but he doesn\u2019t know much about being the primary caretaker for two kids under the age of three. It was just easier to move in with Mila.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not rent your house out while you stayed with your sister-in-law so you\u2019d have a place to come home to?\u201d</p><p>She let out a huge sigh. After the way she\u2019d avoided him for months following their wedding day, she owed him this explanation. He\u2019d probably seen her disconnecting her phone and moving away as her means of avoiding him, rather than trying to deal with the tragedy and accept the obligations she\u2019d suddenly inherited.</p><p>\u201cWhen Mila learned she was pregnant again, my brother overextended himself to buy her and the kids the house they now live in. They needed a place with three bedrooms because if they put the baby in with Tony Jr., she\u2019d keep him up half the night. Nothing worse than a cranky toddler.\u201d</p><p>Jason grimaced. \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it. So you...sold your house and gave her the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy brother would have done the same for me if our roles had been reversed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour parents couldn\u2019t help out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mom raised kids and never worked outside the home, and my dad is retired. Their income is fixed and tight. Mila didn\u2019t want to burden them any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sacrificed a lot to help your brother\u2019s wife and kids.\u201d</p><p>Yes, including her marriage to Jason. \u201cI\u2019d help them all over again. Mila would never have been able to stand on her own this past year. The kids are adorable, but a constant handful. But if I had to do it again, I\u2019d try much harder to include you. In my head, leaning on you so much didn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiving me up was?\u201d</p><p>Her only defense was that she hadn\u2019t believed he\u2019d miss her that much. She still didn\u2019t know what it was about her he\u2019d latched on to. \u201cYou\u2019re right. My sense of duty and my pride got in the way.\u201d</p><p>Jason sent her a pensive stare. \u201cThat can\u2019t happen again, Gia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>He caressed the crown of her bowed head, a silent gesture of acceptance and forgiveness. \u201cSo you grew up around here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShow me where you went to school.\u201d</p><p>It might be stupid, but his request made her feel giddy. Would he ask if he didn\u2019t care? No, nor would he fight for her to stay by his side. She hadn\u2019t bothered to truly open up to him before they said \u201cI do.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t kill her to do so now. In fact, he was trying so hard to keep them together, putting...well, not his heart on the line, but his pride at least.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019d like that. You can tell me about your crazy high school days while I do.\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t take more than three minutes to reach her alma mater, but he was already regaling her with tales about playing football as a teenager. Even in the schools for the wealthy kids, they still pulled pranks on rivals and coaches alike.</p><p>He parked, and several of the male students stopped to gawk at his car. As Jason took her hand in his again, he patiently answered questions and even gave a few a peek at the interior. This relaxed version of her husband was giving, fun to be with. She more than respected the driven, take-no-prisoners man she\u2019d married, but in this moment Gia really liked him, too.</p><p>Once the boys had gone, they walked the grounds of the school. The teenagers\u2019 day of learning had come to an end. Behind them, students peeled out of the parking lot as she and Jason walked together. On campus, they ran across the group of color guard girls taking advantage of the last of the nice weather before winter. They danced and tossed bright flags in the air to the beat of a dramatic tune.</p><p>After observing their routine and clapping at the conclusion, the girls giggled. Jason led her inside the halls and asked about her favorite classes, teachers, and memories. They watched part of a basketball game in progress and had a little footrace on the track. Since her husband was so athletic and he wasn\u2019t wearing heels, he won by a lot, but she laughed all the way back to the car, surprised to see that sunset was near.</p><p>Back at his sleek Porsche, he opened her door. Gia paused before climbing in, curling her hand around his shoulder and stepping on her tiptoes to kiss him. \u201cThat was fun. Thank you for a wonderful day.\u201d</p><p>His face softened. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I wanted to hear about this part of your life. Thank you for sharing it.\u201d</p><p>Gia blushed. They should be far past the innocent joys of \u201cgetting to know you,\u201d but here she was, feeling like an adolescent with her first love. A little backward since they were already married, but she liked feeling the butterflies in her tummy.</p><p>She smiled at Jason, wondering again what she could possibly give him to make him half as happy as he made her?</p><p>Jason slid into the driver\u2019s seat beside her and looked something up on his phone. Moments later, he revved the engine. It purred out of the parking lot, and she found herself lost in a haze of contentment.</p><p>Gia had married her husband once because she\u2019d believed they would be happy together, but she\u2019d never had the opportunity to test that theory. After today in particular, she knew she\u2019d been right. Sex in a dressing room wasn\u2019t something she wanted often, but Jason somehow understood her craving for that edge of wild\u2014within a net of safety. He always delivered. She was the one who had failed him, first that summer night long ago when he\u2019d arranged a sensual tryst in the park. She had failed him again when she\u2019d assumed he would want nothing to do with her family problems. She hadn\u2019t stood by their marriage.</p><p>\u201cThank you for refusing to give up on us.\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, stare sharp as he slid to a stop at a red light. \u201cYou\u2019re not angry any more?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than anything, I was afraid. And I felt guilty. I knew so much of the blame for our separation could be laid at my feet. I didn\u2019t think I mattered to you any more and that you\u2019d ordered me to your condo to punish me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re trying to put us back together. Our last nine days have been better than anything I could have dreamed of.\u201d</p><p>Gia had a hard time admitting all that when Jason wouldn\u2019t tell her that he loved her. But he cared. Neither of them were perfect. Maybe they would grow together in time. Maybe...but it still bugged her. Could she live the rest of her life feeling his adoration but never hearing the three most powerful words a husband could give his wife? Were they a clich\u00e9 or some vital glue that held a marriage together?</p><p>Jason reached for her hand and gave it a squeeze, then punched on the gas pedal when the light turned green again. \u201cI\u2019m relieved to hear you say that. We have another nine days together, and I\u2019ll enjoy every minute of them. But I would enjoy it more if you told me you would stay beyond our anniversary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crossed my mind. We have some issues to work through if we\u2019re going to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe do. And I want to start now.\u201d</p><p>With those cryptic words, Jason took her hand from his and gripped the steering wheel. His stare on the road looked somewhere between focused and grim.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t answer right away, and she stared at the clock. Five forty. Her family would just be sitting down to her dad\u2019s birthday dinner. She hadn\u2019t had the chance to drop her father\u2019s birthday gift off at the restaurant, and it was too late now. Gia cursed under her breath. She would just have to hang onto it until her father\u2019s actual birthday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She pictured her family chatting, singing, moaning over good food. They would miss having her there. The kids must be confused. She\u2019d been a constant in their lives for the last year, and not seeing them felt like someone had punched a hole in her heart. They were so close to the restaurant... Gia thought of telling Jason about the gathering and suggesting they go. But as she glanced down at her three thousand dollar outfit and the gorgeous rock on her finger, she knew her parents would be shocked. If she remained Jason\u2019s wife, she would tell her family when they\u2019d married and why she\u2019d hidden the union from them, but not while they celebrated her father\u2019s birthday. Not in public. Not when she wasn\u2019t sure if she and Jason had a future.</p><p>As the familiar streets passed, she focused on Jason\u2019s strong profile and waited for an answer. Finally, he turned off one of the town\u2019s main drags and down an ancillary street, slowing down as they approached Delvecchio\u2019s. Her heart stopped as he pulled into the parking lot.</p><p>Crap! He\u2019d overheard her on the phone with Mila earlier. \u201cJason...\u201d</p><p>He shoved the car in park and turned to her. \u201cYou admitted that we have some issues to work through. The fact that I haven\u2019t met your family is a huge obstacle. I want to remove it now. Hell, do they even know we dated?\u201d</p> <p>No. She\u2019d been worried when she\u2019d met Jason that her folks wouldn\u2019t understand. He represented so many things her old-school, old-world parents didn\u2019t like\u2014establishment and money. He\u2019d never worked with his hands. He wasn\u2019t a part of the Church. No one in her family\u2014not a single one of her sixteen cousins\u2014had married anyone who wasn\u2019t both intensely Italian and devoutly Catholic. She didn\u2019t care about any of that, but her parents would. They would understand even less that she\u2019d concealed her marriage from them.</p><p>Most of all, she didn\u2019t want to put her family through this upheaval unless she believed that she and Jason could truly make a life together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d he contradicted. \u201cI\u2019m not who they would have chosen for you. I understand that, but it\u2019s your life and ultimately your choice. You say they \u2018love\u2019 you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey do, but\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo buts. If they value your happiness, then they will allow you to make the best decision for you and respect it. Am I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re oversimplifying. They\u2019re parents; they always think they know best.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re an adult with your own life.\u201d</p><p>He was absolutely right. \u201cBut they\u2019ve been the biggest part of it for years. I couldn\u2019t do without them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t be your dirty little secret any longer.\u201d Jason gritted his teeth and sucked in a breath. \u201cWe are going to walk into that restaurant, and you\u2019re going to introduce me as your husband. Or you are going to say your safe word. Tell me again what it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDivorce,\u201d she choked out.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. And we will never escape that possibility as long as you hide me from your family. All refusing to introduce us does is prove that you never intended to incorporate me into the important parts of your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need time.\u201d But as soon as the plea slipped from her lips, Gia knew she asked for too much.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had nearly a year.\u201d</p><p>She had more objections, but they were all about her escaping her family\u2019s disappointment. About her not having to endure their shock and anger. Waiting did nothing but convince Jason that he wasn\u2019t important to her. And that wasn\u2019t true. If they could work it out, she wanted to stay with him. She loved him and wanted his happiness.</p><p>Her world tilted on its axis for a breath-stealing second. She steadied herself against his car as her thoughts raced. Could she even make him happy? Cold dread gripped her. Gia had no idea what Jason really saw in her. Maybe nothing.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s why he cared but didn\u2019t love her.</p><p>God, she needed answers and she simply didn\u2019t have them.</p><p>\u201cGia?\u201d he asked, concern deepening his voice as the setting sun slanted through the windshield and cast a golden glow over his inky hair and bronzed skin. He watched her with blue eyes, fixed and unwavering.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said automatically.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t. She\u2019d been that insecure girl who\u2019d let self-doubt cloud her brain and screw her up. She\u2019d let fear rule her\u2014and still did. She wasn\u2019t a supermodel or a brainiac. She hadn\u2019t come from a gilded background or even finished college. All along, she\u2019d been unclear what she could possibly give him, and the moment her family obligations had separated them, she\u2019d allowed her doubts to creep in and craft a million excuses for why they should remain apart.</p><p>Self-flagellation and guilt blistered through her.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s time for you to decide. Do we meet your family or are you saying divorce?\u201d</p><p>Instantly, Gia knew that if she uttered that word, he would take it literally and file tomorrow. On the other hand, if she stayed with him and he lost interest in a few months or years? It would hurt so much more.</p><p>No, she couldn\u2019t look at it that way. She refused to lose him again because of her fears or to save her feelings. It reeked of cowardice and self-doubt, and she would not be that woman. Even if she disappointed her parents, she had to believe they would never stop loving her. She owed it to them to come clean. And she owed it to Jason to try making him a part of her family.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d She grabbed her purse from the floorboard and shoved open the car door, shaking from head to toe.</p><p>They walked through the shadowed parking lot. Jason took her hand, holding her father\u2019s professionally wrapped gift in the other, leading her to the door. He opened it for her, and the heavy wooden thing squeaked on its hinges. Delvecchio\u2019s wasn\u2019t big. The small bar area and takeout counter sat to the right, doing a steady business already. A dining area big enough for maybe fifty people lay beyond the hostess stand in front of a half wall just inside the foyer.</p><p>Gia swallowed, her palms turning sweaty as the familiar hostess turned to her. \u201cHi, Renee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia!\u201d The Delvecchio\u2019s youngest daughter, only recently graduated from high school, called out to her with a little squeal. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in forever.\u201d She eyed Jason not so discreetly. \u201cYour parents said you weren\u2019t coming tonight. They\u2019ll be surprised to see you.\u201d</p><p>Completely. That filled her with an anxious dread, but she wasn\u2019t backing down.</p><p>\u201cWhat corner did you sit them in? You know they\u2019re going to be loud, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMila warned me.\u201d Renee winked. \u201cThey\u2019re in the big booth right outside the kitchen. Need a menu?\u201d she asked Jason, looking a little star struck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wing it.\u201d He gripped Gia\u2019s hand more tightly.</p><p>She flipped her gaze up to her husband. He\u2019d pushed to make this meeting happen...but he was nervous. This mattered to him, and Gia found that endearing. Maybe she should still be mad at him. God knew she was so worried, she probably looked a charming shade of green.</p><p>\u201cCan you have your brother bring a bottle of that Cabernet I like?\u201d Gia asked the girl.</p><p>\u201cSure. Nick will take care of you. Holler if you need anything else.\u201d</p><p>She nodded at Renee and figured it was time to stop hiding behind the hostess stand.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Gia led Jason around the partition concealing the restaurant from the front door. Instantly, she saw her family in the corner. Longing buckled her chest. Dad laughed. Mom held his hand. Mila rocked the baby while smiling at her folks. Tony Jr. played with a pair of plastic cars on the table, crashing them together and making explosive sounds. He looked so much like her brother sometimes that it hurt.</p><p>The boy looked their way, his dark eyes piercing, then they lit up with recognition. \u201cAn\u2019 Gia!\u201d</p><p>As he clambered from his chair, nearly toppling it and his booster seat over, he darted across the restaurant toward her. Jason released her so she could crouch and welcome the happy child into her arms. The moment the little boy crashed into her, Gia reached back to right her balance and laughed. Automatically, Jason braced her with a hand on her back. She sent him a grateful glance before she turned back to Little Tony.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s our big boy? You been good for your mama?\u201d</p><p>He nodded earnestly. \u201cI helped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColleen helped, too.\u201d The little boy grinned.</p><p>From his smile, Gia had no doubt that he liked the woman Jason had hired to help Mila and the kids during her absence. \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>As she stood and ruffled his hair, Jason took her hand again and nudged her forward. She looked up to see her parents and sister-in-law all gaping and silent.</p><p>She held up her palm in greeting as she closed the short distance between her husband and her family. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>They all gave her the once-over before their collective gazes slid over to Jason. They studied him unabashedly. Her father frowned.</p><p>Her mother stood. \u201cHello, dear. Mila said you wouldn\u2019t be here. I\u2019m glad you could make it. You brought a...friend.\u201d She smiled wanly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you introduce us?\u201d</p><p>Here went nothing.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not just friends, Sil,\u201d Mila corrected her mother-in-law gently.</p><p>His frown morphing to a scowl, her father stood and looked Jason in the eye. \u201cYou dating my daughter?\u201d</p><p>Gia sighed. \u201cDaddy, be nice. If you\u2019ll give me a minute\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, sir.\u201d Jason held out his hand and waited until her father shook it. \u201cI married her.\u201d</p><p>What the hell? She turned a peeved glare at Jason, but he just sent her a cool glance.</p><p>Maybe it didn\u2019t matter if he\u2019d blurted the truth. There was no good way to drop this bombshell.</p><p>Her mother gasped and blinked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re married to Jason Denning?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat, and they looked around to see most of the restaurant staring at them. She recognized a girl she\u2019d gone to high school with. Their neighbors down the street sat two booths away. She and Jason had managed to keep this marriage secret for nearly a year. Between crazy Twitter peeps and gossipy folks in the neighborhood, the truth would travel so fast, they might make the local ten o\u2019clock news.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we sit down, Mom?\u201d She looked pointedly around her.</p><p>Mama pursed her lips. Her short dark hair didn\u2019t quite hide the flush of her cheeks. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Her father followed them. Mila just stared. This meeting wasn\u2019t going down as she\u2019d hoped.</p><p>Awkward prevailed as they pulled up spare chairs. Gia lifted Little Tony and set him in her lap, glad to hold him again and have a buffer. \u201cMom, Dad, Mila, you\u2019ve obviously heard of Jason Denning. He\u2019s my husband and he wanted to meet y\u2019all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you do the proper thing and ask me for my daughter\u2019s hand?\u201d Daddy scowled.</p><p>Her mother looked uncertain. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d</p><p>Mila frowned. \u201cHow long have you been married and how did we not know about this?\u201d</p><p>Gia slapped a hand over her face. \u201cCan we skip the interrogation, please? Dad, we chose to elope. Mom...\u201d She sighed. \u201cCan you let me handle the whole love thing? I\u2019m a big girl.\u201d Then she turned to her sister-in-law. \u201cWe married the night before Tony\u2019s death. When I got the phone call with the news, Jason and I were in Vegas. When we returned, everything was crazy, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to lay more upheaval on any of you...so I made the choice to live separately from my husband while you needed me.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s scowl deepened, then he leaned across the table to glare at Jason. \u201cYou supported this decision?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least. She slipped through my fingers for a while, but no more. I\u2019ve been trying to convince her for nearly two weeks that we belong together. She\u2019s proving a little stubborn, but I intend to persevere.\u201d</p><p>Her father seemed to like that answer. A little smile lifted the corner of his mouth. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHappy birthday.\u201d Jason set the present on the table between them.</p><p>Gia watched the exchange, stunned. Her father hadn\u2019t growled or thundered? She turned to her mother, keenly aware of the woman\u2019s confused stare. She also looked a bit hurt.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t marry him to upset you,\u201d Gia vowed.</p><p>With a tilt of her head, the older woman acknowledged that truth. \u201cHe\u2019s not Italian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen of other nationalities can be equally wonderful,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>Mom looked at her husband of thirty-two years. \u201cPerhaps. I might be a little biased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not Catholic, either, ma\u2019am,\u201d Jason jumped in, sending her mother a reassuring expression and placing his hand over hers. \u201cBut I assure you that I\u2019ll always take care of your daughter and any children we have for as long as she\u2019ll let me.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll probably do it even when she fights me kicking and screaming.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>A reluctant grin tugged at her mother\u2019s lips\u2014and broke the ice. \u201cWhich she will. My daughter is more than a little stubborn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd who does she get that from?\u201d her father teased, pressing a kiss to Mama\u2019s forehead and dropping a hand to her thigh.</p><p>\u201cYou, of course,\u201d her mother quipped.</p><p>Her father laughed, then bent to murmur something in her mother\u2019s ear that made her blush.</p> <p>Little Tony squirmed off her lap and ran around to his grandpa with his toys, looking for someone willing to join in the fantastic imaginary car crashes. Bella started fussing, and Gia\u2019s mother took the baby from Mila with a fond smile.</p><p>Jason\u2019s gaze bounced back and forth between her parents, seeming to look for any other objections he could stop before they began. Honestly, Gia couldn\u2019t believe they weren\u2019t more shocked or angry. In fact, they hadn\u2019t really protested much at all. Oh, they\u2019d have words later, but she\u2019d been sure the announcement would immediately cause World War III. So far...no.</p><p>Of course she was pleasantly surprised, but what the hell was that about?</p><p>A harried waitress came over a few minutes later, and Gia immediately recognized that the blonde was new. She smiled and asked for their order as Nick, the Delvecchio\u2019s son, brought the bottle of red wine she\u2019d asked for.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness,\u201d Gia muttered as Nick poured the wine and gave Jason a speculative stare.</p> <p>The second her glass was full, she took a long swallow and downed half. Gia still couldn\u2019t relax. She kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.</p><p>Dad opened his gifts with thanks and smiles aplenty. He loved what she\u2019d picked for him. Wine flowed. Food came. Mila actually looked happy. Little Tony sidled up to Jason and wanted to play cars with him. Her husband was patient and attentive, and Gia watched, falling a little more in love with him every moment.</p><p>By the time they finished the food, her father was telling Jason jokes. Her mother patted his shoulder with a welcoming smile. Bella woke, and Mila stood, placing her in Jason\u2019s arms. He blinked and sputtered a bit, but her sister-in-law gave him instructions on holding her properly. The girl eyed Jason with an avid brown stare, then placed her little hand on his chin with a giggle. He grinned back.</p><p>Gia breathed through a sting of tears. He looked natural with children. He might have a ruthless bastard side, but he would also be a fierce protector who would move heaven and earth for his kids. When Jason caressed Bella\u2019s head, she also knew he\u2019d be a giving but firm father\u2014exactly like her own.</p><p>As the waiter took their food away, Jason engaged Mila in conversation about the kids and their habits.</p><p>Her mother rose from the table and kissed Dad, then turned to her with a pointed glance. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the ladies\u2019 room?\u201d</p> <p>Mama wasn\u2019t asking exactly, and Gia knew the woman must have questions.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m right behind you.\u201d</p><p>Jason watched as she rose, his expression bolstering her. Yes, she could handle whatever happened with her family. Gia had put off this introduction, building it up in her head to a terrible confrontation that simply hadn\u2019t materialized. He\u2019d been right to give her a shove. She\u2019d wanted to wait until she \u201cknew\u201d they would last to make him an official part of the family, but no couple had a guarantee of forever. It hadn\u2019t been fair to him.</p><p>She\u2019d made more than one decision about her marriage that she regretted.</p><p>As Gia and her mother left the table and wended through the growing crowd to the restrooms, she felt Jason\u2019s eyes still on her. But when they disappeared into the ladies\u2019 room, her mother turned to her immediately.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been married nearly a year and didn\u2019t tell us?\u201d</p><p>Gia winced. Her mother rarely beat around the bush, but she was often gentle enough not to put someone on the spot. No mistaking her mom\u2019s determination for information now.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother frowned. \u201cYou thought the truth would upset us?\u201d</p><p>She should have realized Mama would see right through her. \u201cI know he\u2019s not Enzo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney...\u201d Her mother\u2019s face softened with understanding. \u201cYou don\u2019t love Enzo the way you love Jason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I wanted to for your sake, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. I know your dad and I put a lot of pressure on you in the past, but Tony\u2019s death made us realize that no one is assured a tomorrow. We want every day you spend in this life to be a happy one. Enzo doesn\u2019t love you the way Jason does.\u201d</p><p>Well, since her husband didn\u2019t love her at all, according to him, she wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to reply to her mother. \u201cIt\u2019s been a really tough year, Mama. I cut Jason out of my life and it hurt so much. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s forgiven me, why he wants me back, why he chose me in the first place. I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf loving someone doesn\u2019t scare you at least a little, then they don\u2019t really mean much to you.\u201d Her mother pulled her into a hug. \u201cHe chose you because you\u2019re beautiful and giving, because you\u2019re selfless and smart. What more could he want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone like him. Someone raised in his circles with all the money and the advantages it buys. Hell, sometimes when he takes me out, I\u2019m embarrassed that I don\u2019t know which fork to use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t fall for someone raised in your circles. Do you love him less because he\u2019s not Italian or a cop or Catholic? Because he knows which utensil to use when?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d When her mother said it, the whole idea sounded silly. \u201cBut I thought you might.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you really have left him for good if your father and I didn\u2019t approve?\u201d Mama cocked her head in a silent scold. \u201cYou\u2019re a grown woman, Gianna.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. You\u2019re right.\u201d She loved Jason too much to leave him again. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s in my heart that matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Does he make you happy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but we have some unresolved issues between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen work them out. That\u2019s what people who stay married do. Talk. Be as honest as you can. Share your fears. Give him your worries.\u201d</p><p>Gia grimaced. \u201cI haven\u2019t been really good at that. When I got the phone call about Tony, I just...broke away. I knew the family would need me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave up your happiness for Mila and the kids. Did you ever think that adding another member to the clan would make it stronger? That maybe he could help you and lessen the burden for everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d And she saw it so clearly now that sorrow and guilt weren\u2019t clouding her. \u201cI didn\u2019t really give him a chance. I just assumed he wouldn\u2019t want to be knee-deep in diapers and baby vomit and all the depressing reality of Tony\u2019s death and Mila\u2019s problems.\u201d</p><p>Her mother shot her a skeptical stare. \u201cHe hardly looks like the type who would crumble in the face of adversity.\u201d</p><p>Again, Mama was wise. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I feel like an idiot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have left originally because of our tragedy, but you didn\u2019t return to Jason for some reason I suspect is bigger than your obligation to Mila and the kids.\u201d</p><p>She hadn\u2019t trusted in what they had, in her appeal and ability to hold him. She had been sure that if she presented him with all her problems instead of her ass for a good spanking, that he\u2019d get annoyed and leave. She\u2019d lacked faith in herself, in him... \u201cI have to fix it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s my baby girl.\u201d Her mother smiled. \u201cShow me your ring. It blinded me across the table so I didn\u2019t get a good look at it.\u201d</p><p>Gia laughed and held out her hand. Mama took it and peered down at the jewels.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s incredible.\u201d Her mother squeezed her hand.</p><p>\u201cSo is he.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen just be you and open up. Everything will work out.\u201d</p><p>They shared another hug before Mama disappeared into a stall. Gia did the same, then they washed their hands in silence before returning to the table. Jason was playing peekaboo with Bella and answering her father\u2019s questions about savvy investing while Mila watched with an indulgent smile.</p><p>\u201cAre we ready to go?\u201d Mama asked as she approached the table.</p><p>\u201cNot quite.\u201d Mila grinned, then gestured toward Nick.</p><p>He came out with a big slice of Italian wedding cake all lit up with candles. Their waitress followed, juggling forks, a knife, and another bottle of wine.</p><p>As Gia took her seat beside her husband and gripped his hand, everyone at the table started singing, Little Tony screeching the words he knew at the top of his lungs. She laughed.</p><p>In this golden little moment, all was right with her world. Not perfect, but really close. She had to work on herself and cut Jason some slack. He didn\u2019t understand love...yet. But with time and patience, if she gave him her whole heart, he would.</p><p>As the song ended, her family clapped. Dad even looked a little misty-eyed\u2014a first for her big, tough-guy father\u2014as he thanked everyone. The group dug into the cake while her father lifted baby Bella above his head for an airplane ride, followed by a kiss. The day seemed more complete for having Jason beside her.</p><p>Once the dessert had been devoured, her husband rose and disappeared. Frowning, Gia watched. What the devil was he up to? He returned a moment later with a smug smile. Before she could puzzle that out, Nick nearly danced his way to the table with a beaming grin, then handed Jason his credit card.</p><p>With an absent scrawl, her husband signed the slip, and she looked down. She wasn\u2019t surprised that he\u2019d paid tonight\u2019s bill, but the family could eat at Delvecchio\u2019s every week for a year and probably not spend that much.</p><p>Nick handed her father a gift certificate. \u201cFrom your daughter and Mr. Denning. Happy birthday.\u201d</p><p>Daddy looked at the slip of paper and scanned it, then handed it back toward Jason. \u201cA thousand dollars? You didn\u2019t have to do that. I can\u2019t accept...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I know where Gia gets it from.\u201d He sighed. \u201cPlease take it. If it makes you happy, it makes your daughter happy. And you know the saying... Happy wife, happy life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s too much,\u201d her father argued.</p><p>\u201cIf you enjoy this place, it\u2019s just right.\u201d Jason wrapped an arm around her.</p><p>She smiled up at him. He was trying so hard to fit into her family. Maybe he\u2019d gone overboard, but she knew Jason meant the gesture to please, not bribe. No one had ever done something that nice for Daddy, and he deserved it. No doubt he would appreciate it.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou can thank me later,\u201d he murmured hotly in her ear as a cell phone rang somewhere nearby.</p><p>\u201cNot because you bought him something,\u201d she scolded.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t thank me. I just can\u2019t stay away from you.\u201d</p><p>Gia giggled. \u201cYou\u2019re so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, just wait. I\u2019ll get much worse when we\u2019re alone. I might have a new paddle with your name on it. Or maybe we\u2019ll go for a swim in the pool on my deck and I\u2019ll fuck you there.\u201d</p><p>Out in the open, where anyone could see. Well...anyone with a helicopter or binoculars in a nearby building. But the idea made her more than wet. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring a bathing suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a shame...\u201d He grinned.</p><p>She fought down a shiver and a blush. Jason cradled her chin and lifted her face for a kiss as she heard a third ring, then her father answer the phone.</p><p>\u201cYes, this is Marco Angelotti.\u201d He pressed his finger to his other ear, trying to drown out the background noise in the restaurant.</p><p>Her mother grabbed her purse as Mila gathered Bella\u2019s little dish and spoon, then removed her bib. Little Tony retrieved his toys. And Gia glowed with happiness. Her family knew about Jason and they accepted him. They weren\u2019t angry or disappointed or throwing her out of the family.</p><p>All that time she\u2019d wasted because she\u2019d been worried about their reaction. If she\u2019d taken Jason to meet her parents when they\u2019d been dating, her father would have yelled and refused to let him in the house. Her mother would have cried, crossed herself, and asked why her only daughter was trying to kill her. Today...a whole different story. She\u2019d never imagined that Tony\u2019s passing had caused them to change their outlook about the proper son-in-law.</p><p>\u201cCan you repeat that?\u201d Her father frowned.</p><p>Mama paused to send him a questioning look. He closed his eyes and clenched his fist. Gia\u2019s stomach dropped like a stone. Worry filled the void.</p><p>Beside her, Jason\u2019s phone dinged with a text. Nothing new since he constantly conducted business, but she wished all the noise and chaos around them would abate so her father could hear and they could all figure out what had him upset.</p><p>He pushed past Mama and Jason and marched toward the door. Everyone gathered their belongings and followed him out. Apprehension gripping her, she trailed after her family, then looked behind her to see Jason reading his phone before he darkened the screen with a satisfied nod. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to see what\u2019s wrong with my dad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you,\u201d he promised, pocketing the phone. \u201cIs he upset?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell for sure.\u201d</p><p>Jason grabbed his coat and escorted her out the door just as her father hung up the phone, his face pale and shocked. He stepped closer to his truck, shaking, then balanced himself against it, head bowed.</p> <p>Mama curled up against him and lifted a palm to his cheek. \u201cMarco?\u201d</p><p>Gia ran to her dad, flanking his side and taking hold of his arm. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>He tensed, swallowed, then lifted his head to stare at them all for a long moment. His weighty gaze steadied on Mila before shifting back to his wife. \u201cRicky Wayman is dead.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, they sat around the breakfast table in her parents\u2019 kitchen. Mama busied herself making coffee. Mila settled Little Tony in front of the TV in the next room, then put Bella in her playpen. Jason linked his fingers with her own. Daddy didn\u2019t say a word.</p> <p>\u201cWho gave you the news? What happened exactly?\u201d Gia asked finally as Mila entered the kitchen again and Mama sat down with her steaming mug.</p><p>Her father sighed. \u201cSergeant Miller called. He still works at the precinct, right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s retiring in March.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thought I\u2019d want to know that Wayman had been killed. Apparently, he got into a fight with one of his homies and it ended with a gunshot.\u201d</p><p>Gia sat back in her chair, the shock still pinging inside her. A thousand emotions pelted her. Vindication warred with anger. Wayman had been an unrepentant thug, well known for selling drugs to kids. Whoever had shot him had probably done the human race a favor. But she\u2019d wanted to arrest him and at least try to make him answer to a jury and the prison system for his crimes. His violent end shouldn\u2019t be surprising, not when he lived so violently himself. Still, the suddenness of it left her reeling.</p><p>\u201cDo we know why?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>Mila breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cDo we care why? He\u2019s dead, and I say good riddance. Wayman shot your brother in cold blood, and I hope he pays for what he\u2019s done in Hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t disagree,\u201d her father said gruffly, sipping at his coffee. But he still looked shaken.</p><p>Mama reached out and tucked her hand in his. \u201cI know I should look at it differently as a good Christian, but that criminal took something from me\u2014from all of us\u2014I can never replace. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to forgive him. Maybe now that he\u2019s reaped what he\u2019s sown, I can. I don\u2019t know. But I also know there\u2019s a mother out there tonight grieving the loss of her son. She will miss him at Thanksgiving and Christmas, every year his birthday passes, every time she sees something he would have enjoyed... Even if her son committed terrible deeds, my heart goes out to her.\u201d</p><p>Daddy nodded fiercely and wrapped his arms around her mother, breathing loudly into her hair as if trying to get a hold of his emotions. A long moment later, he kissed her head. \u201cHis death probably saved lives. And right or wrong, I feel a sense of closure now.\u201d</p><p>Gia didn\u2019t. She was relieved in a way, but even more, she felt cheated. The whole swirl of emotions barely made any sense to her. But right now had to be about her family.</p><p>Beside her, Mila sobbed quietly. \u201cI know Wayman\u2019s death doesn\u2019t bring my husband back.\u201d Her breath hitched on his name. Still, she pressed on. \u201cBut I feel better knowing that man doesn\u2019t walk the streets any more and can\u2019t pull the trigger again. He can\u2019t rob any other woman of her husband or son. Maybe now, we can all move on with our lives.\u201d</p><p>Beside Gia, Jason squeezed her hand. She knew she should let go of her anger against Wayman and her driving need for revenge to focus on tomorrow, on building her own family with her husband. On the surface, that sounded great. But how did she just forget the fact that she\u2019d needed to give her family\u2014and herself\u2014some finality before she moved on?</p><p>\u201cWe certainly weren\u2019t going to get closure from DPD,\u201d her father added cynically.</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Gia frowned. Did her dad know something she didn\u2019t?</p><p>\u201cThink about it. A good cop died and no one lifted a finger? The story of an officer murdered on the streets within days of Thanksgiving barely made it to the press. And Patrick recanted his eyewitness testimony after a few days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d she drawled. \u201cAnd I have little doubt he bought a boat with the bribe that made him suddenly \u2018unsure\u2019 of what he\u2019d seen. I even reported him to Internal Affairs. It\u2019s like...they\u2019re stalling or they just don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Wayman was paying off most of the precinct, including the brass. I can\u2019t prove that, but I know he targeted your brother because Tony refused to be bought.\u201d</p><p>Gia sat back, feeling flattened all over again. It all made sense, and she should have seen it sooner. But no, she\u2019d wanted to believe that the people she worked with weren\u2019t corrupt assholes more concerned with lining their pockets than justice. She felt damn na\u00efve.</p><p>How was she going to return to work when her stay with Jason was up and look those people in the eye without wanting to rail and scream at them all?</p><p>Jason\u2019s phone rang. He pulled it from his pocket and glanced at the screen, then stood. \u201cI should take this. You okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>Sort of, anyway. She might self-combust in the next ten seconds if her head didn\u2019t stop spinning. Hell, what else didn\u2019t she know?</p><p>\u201cExcuse me for a minute.\u201d Jason nodded and ducked out of the room.</p><p>Gia watched him ease out the front door with his phone pressed to his ear, his posture telling her he was already in business mode.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a hell of a night,\u201d her father commented with a sigh.</p><p>She nodded, then reached for Daddy\u2019s hand. \u201cIt has, but I want you to know that I\u2019m here for you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Mila insisted, jumping out of her chair with her hands on her hips. \u201cHell, no.\u201d</p><p>Blinking, Gia stared at her usually reserved sister-in-law. \u201cWhat the...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou listen to me.\u201d Mila wagged her finger. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare give up one more minute with your husband! Tony and I had six wonderful years together. Even though they ended terribly, I wouldn\u2019t trade a second with him because I loved him. You gave me a year when your place was with Jason. Don\u2019t spend more time apart from him that you may someday regret. I should have been standing on my own two feet all this time. I will from now on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we had known you were newly wedded, honey, we would have done so much more to pitch in and help.\u201d Mama\u2019s expression looked somewhere between miserable and guilty. \u201cI let you handle everything because I felt lost myself. Taking care of the kids would have given me purpose and allowed me less time to wallow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t up to it.\u201d</p><p>Her mother snorted. \u201cI\u2019m not ancient. I would have managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hoped dealing with the kids would give you less time to hunt Wayman,\u201d her father admitted. \u201cI damn near did a jig when you were put behind a desk. You were too set on revenge to be looking for that killer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDaddy, I can take care of myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought Tony could, too.\u201d He shook his head solemnly. \u201cI kept fearing I\u2019d get a phone call about your murder next.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have risked myself.\u201d</p><p>Her father scoffed. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Gia sighed as guilt ricocheted through her. \u201cI was careful.\u201d</p><p>He shook his salt-and-pepper head. \u201cBullshit. You went into Wayman\u2019s \u2018hood with guns loaded and cocked. I made a couple of phone calls and tried to get you reassigned or put behind a desk, but I don\u2019t have any influence since I retired. Whoever finally realized that you were going to get yourself killed and did something about it, I want to shake his hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you approve.\u201d Jason closed the door behind him suddenly and crossed the front room into the kitchen with his hand outstretched.</p><p>Daddy took it, pumping vigorously. \u201cYou got Gia desk duty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m acquainted with the mayor. I might have suggested that if he wanted a healthy donation for his reelection campaign, he needed to make sure a certain beautiful female officer didn\u2019t get hurt in the line of duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, hot damn!\u201d A grin broke out across her father\u2019s face. \u201cI like you even more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Tears trembled in Mama\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Mila nodded, wearing a mirror expression.</p><p>She glared at them. They all approved of Jason\u2019s manipulation? What the hell?</p><p>Jason looked surprisingly grim. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet.\u201d Then he turned to Gia and took her hands. \u201cYou know I\u2019d do anything for you, that I would move mountains to keep you safe and happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said cautiously.</p><p>He\u2019d proven it again and again these past nine days. Really, since they\u2019d met. She might not always like the boundaries he gave her, but she couldn\u2019t deny that he had her best interests at heart.</p><p>\u201cAlways,\u201d he vowed, then faced her family. \u201cThat phone call I just took was from an associate of mine. A week ago, I hired him to spread the word in Wayman\u2019s neighborhood that I would pay anyone who brought information leading to the thug\u2019s capture a hundred thousand dollars.\u201d</p><p>Her father choked. Her mother gasped. Mila\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d Gia demanded.</p><p>\u201cOnce word got out, one of his fellow criminals didn\u2019t want to just give us information. Apparently, this one decided he could run the hood better, so he tried to turn in Wayman and collect a little money, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWayman would never go in quietly. He\u2019d fight to the death... Oh my god.\u201d She pressed her hand to her mouth, shaking.</p><p>\u201cYour reward put an end to him,\u201d Mila said.</p><p>Jason shrugged. \u201cHis fellow gangster\u2019s greed prompted him to turn on his \u2018buddy,\u2019 and Wayman chose to die rather than go to the station for questioning. Maybe I should cry or feel guilty, but I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t always get to use my money for something good, but I think in this situation, we got the best outcome possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I wanted to bring Wayman in myself,\u201d Gia said through her shock.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI knew it was going to kill you, too.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t argue that he hadn\u2019t done everything possible to keep her safe, but he\u2019d completely missed the point. Later, when she was less stunned, she might not be so angry. But not now. \u201cYou didn\u2019t even discuss it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw no reason to mention it unless my plan actually worked. And I didn\u2019t know Wayman would rather die than be questioned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you think he\u2019d just go quietly?\u201d She tossed her hands in the air.</p><p>\u201cMost people do, so yes. My intent was simply to get him into the station, which I hoped would lead to his arrest and eventual conviction. I did this for you.\u201d</p><p>She knew that logically, but somehow she had a hard time simply thanking him. \u201cWhat gave you this crazy idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe night we met for Mexican food, I knew you needed closure. The way you spoke suggested your family did, too. I knew you\u2019d kill yourself trying to provide it. So I took care of it. It took me a few days to find the right person and another week for results but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat phone call this morning, the one I overheard after I first woke up... That was him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threatened to fire him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted results. How does that make me the bad guy?\u201d</p><p>It didn\u2019t, and in her head Gia knew that. But right in her gut where the anger and rage over Tony\u2019s death lived? Not so much. \u201cYou didn\u2019t talk to me about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you could tell me not to and go on risking your life?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>She held up her hands, feeling seconds away from explosion. She didn\u2019t even know how to put everything she felt into words. Jason\u2019s heart had been in the right place, but that didn\u2019t excuse his interference.</p><p>\u201cYou had me put behind a desk, then you blackmailed me into spending a few weeks with you. You bought me clothes without consulting me, forced me to introduce you to my parents. And now you tell me that you had my brother\u2019s murderer turned to dust. When do I get to make some decisions about my own life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGia!\u201d Mila screeched. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be more grateful to him.\u201d She turned to Jason, then rounded the table to hug him. \u201cThank you. From the bottom of my heart, really. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>He put an awkward arm around her. \u201cI\u2019d do it again.\u201d</p><p>Meeting Jason\u2019s stare over the top of her sister-in-law\u2019s head, Gia dragged in a breath, trying to get ahold of herself. They\u2019d been so happy an hour ago. She\u2019d been almost convinced this could work. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Almost.</p><p>Her father grabbed Jason\u2019s hand again and shook it. \u201cYou did what I wish I\u2019d had the means to do. My wife and I are grateful.\u201d</p><p>Mama nodded. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019re a permanent member of this family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means a lot.\u201d Jason disentangled himself from Mila.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s leave them alone,\u201d her mother suggested to the others.</p><p>Bella started crying, and Little Tony called for his mother. The women sent Jason one last grateful smile before they disappeared into the family room. Her father followed. As they retrieved the children, turned off the TV, and disappeared into the back of the house, the yawning silence suddenly enveloped she and Jason, threatening to swallow them whole.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really angry with me?\u201d he challenged.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Fury growled at her, threatening to break free from its chain. \u201cApparently, I\u2019m the only one. I know you did it for the right reasons, but...I can\u2019t believe you went around me like that.\u201d</p><p>Jason tilted his head. \u201cYou left me so few options. As long as Wayman was at large, you weren\u2019t going to stop obsessing. It takes two to have a marriage, and I can\u2019t be the only one fighting for us, Gia. I might make choices you hate, but damn it, at least I\u2019m trying. What are you doing to keep us together?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou only offered that reward because you didn\u2019t think I was good enough at my job or strong enough to bring Wayman in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. That\u2019s your insecurity talking. I did it because I knew you were brave and determined to keep going until the day one of you died.\u201d</p><p>His words knocked her back on her heels. For a long moment, Gia couldn\u2019t quite breathe.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve always made me feel so special and cared for\u2014until this. Now you\u2019ve just taken away my sense of purpose. Poof.\u201d She tossed her hands in the air. \u201cAll gone\u2014without saying a word to me. Yes, I know you did it to protect me. But you tried to distract me with pretty baubles that don\u2019t mean a damn thing. I needed to make this world a safer place for my family by bringing Wayman down way more than I needed new designer clothes. And you just didn\u2019t get that love is more important than Prada. Or care. You might be able to buy another wife, but not this one. If you don\u2019t see that, I\u2019m not sure we need to stay together.\u201d</p><p>He stiffened, then clenched his jaw as he stepped back from her deliberately and slowly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t discussed any of your plans with me for nearly a year, especially this obsessive, dangerous manhunt. Or your decision to move in with your sister-in-law and totally ignore your husband. But I digress... I\u2019m sorry for not consulting you and for trying too hard. Neither will happen again. I\u2019ve done everything I know to make you care about our marriage, but it\u2019s clear to me that we will never be a priority for you.\u201d He shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cTell your family that it was nice to meet them. I have a reward to pay out tonight. Good-bye, Gia.\u201d</p><p>Jason raised his hand like he wanted to touch her. But he didn\u2019t. He simply clenched his fist and turned on his heel before he walked away. Her chest imploded as she watched him, the jagged and raw pieces of her heart a splintered heap. Gia wanted to call him back...but why? Loving Jason wasn\u2019t enough. She couldn\u2019t change him any more than he could fit her into the mold of women, like his mother, he understood.</p> <p>As her husband shut the door quietly behind him for the final time, Gia knew that nothing would ever be the same again. A sob tore through her chest.</p><p>Jason paced his condo. The November sun streamed through the floor to ceiling windows, blinding him. If he\u2019d been able to drink himself into a stupor after last night\u2019s debacle, his hangover would be bitching at the light. As it was, he had nothing to blame his squinty, vampiric avoidance of the sun on except his bad mood. Why should the day be so fucking cheerful when he wasn\u2019t?</p><p>Stalking back into the kitchen, he grabbed a bottle of water and downed long swallows. He hadn\u2019t been able to run this anger out of his system, even after a punishing eight-mile jog on the treadmill. Business hadn\u2019t distracted him during his sleepless night. Neither had trying to logic his way out of this mess. No matter how he told himself that he\u2019d failed at marriage and now he should move on, Jason couldn\u2019t make himself listen. He\u2019d even tried to convince himself that Gia was just another woman who could be easily replaced. On paper, maybe. Something inside him wasn\u2019t buying it. He had no idea why.</p><p>She\u2019d been a pain in his ass, with her quick Italian temper and headstrong ways. The woman wasn\u2019t logical. She\u2019d taken a long time to give him her submission, railed every time he tried to set boundaries or keep her safe, insisted that she didn\u2019t need his money or his protection or...much of anything from him. Jason sighed.</p><p>In some ways, those traits were the very ones that had drawn him to her, which probably made him sound like an idiotic loon. But he\u2019d enjoyed the challenge of coaxing her from her shell. Gia\u2019s independence coupled with her submissive nature had been so unlike anyone he\u2019d met. The fact that she didn\u2019t seem to give a shit about his fortune was refreshing. Hell, he respected it. She\u2019d wanted money from their divorce, yes. It disappointed him, but the businessman that lurked in his brain said that in her position, he\u2019d want the sum they\u2019d mutually agreed upon, too. His attraction to Gia was everything he\u2019d thought and still more he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on. Her loyalty, for sure. The way she so often put the people she cared about first.</p><p>Sadly, she\u2019d never made him one of her priorities. So where did that leave him? Mooning over a woman who would never return half of his...what, sense of attachment? No. He\u2019d mooned over some of his girlfriends in high school. What he felt was more than mere connection. Missing her now hurt like he\u2019d lost something vital. A limb, maybe. But even more important.</p><p>Like his heart?</p><p>Jason downed another swallow of water, then huffed out a breath of air. Oh, shit. Was that even possible? He\u2019d always believed that love was a fabrication, but what else explained why Gia would sacrifice so much of herself to help raise her niece and nephew? Risk her life to vindicate her brother? Worry so much about her parents\u2019 reaction to their marriage? She genuinely loved those people, would do anything for them.</p> <p>Maybe she hadn\u2019t been able to love him because he didn\u2019t understand the meaning of love. His parents had been lousy examples. Samantha would never have lifted a finger to help raise the children of a relative grieving the loss of a spouse. She would have cheered Wayman\u2019s death and Jason\u2019s method for bringing it about because she wouldn\u2019t have had to get her hands dirty. She could simply spend another day at the spa, drink champagne, and think about how grand life was. Even his dad hadn\u2019t been a shining example of devotion. Jason had never said anything, but he had zero respect for a man who would leave his wife and three kids because he\u2019d been stupid enough to bang his secretary and knock her up. All his life, Jason had seen \u201clove\u201d exchanged for a new pair of shoes or a trip to anywhere exotic.</p><p>Before she\u2019d ever taken a dime from him, Gia had proven that wasn\u2019t love at all.</p><p>So what was it exactly?</p><p>Jason whipped out his phone and opened his browser to search. Dictionary results popped up. With a shrug, he figured that was as good a place to start as any.</p><p>1. A deep, tender, indescribable feeling of affection and care toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.</p><p>That was a really convoluted way of saying he gave a shit about her way more than the average person and that he had a hard time explaining his feelings. Check.</p><p>2. A feeling of intense desire and attraction toward a person with whom one is disposed to make a pair; the emotion of sex and romance.</p><p>Check, though those were really clinical words to describe the feelings unsettling him. He\u2019d never felt anything like this and he didn\u2019t have anything to compare it with. What her parents felt for one another? That had looked like love to him. When he\u2019d seen Marco and Silvana, he\u2019d been struck by an odd jealousy. Those two had been through hell together, would have done anything to make one another happy and whole. Jason couldn\u2019t deny he wanted what they shared.</p><p>3. Sexual passion.</p><p>Um...like mad. He wanted his wife all the time. Check, check, check.</p><p>Well, shit. He was in love. What a fine time to realize it now that Gia was gone.</p><p>If his mother could see him now, she\u2019d laugh her head off\u2014after she\u2019d asked him for money, of course.</p><p>Jason gripped the phone tighter. What did he do about this mess? He\u2019d been angry with his wife last night. He\u2019d tried to help her and keep her safe, and he\u2019d been hurt. So he had thrown in the towel. But really, he couldn\u2019t keep the relationship going for them. She had to want it, too.</p><p>Why didn\u2019t she? Was he that unlovable?</p><p>As he ping-ponged mentally whether he should let her go and call his attorney or find another way to lure his wife to his side, his phone rang. He stared at the display.</p><p>Gia.</p><p>His heart stopped. But he could only make one choice.</p><p>He stabbed the button with his finger and answered. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, I need to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Her voice trembled, and he braced. Whether she felt guilty or angry or worried, she\u2019d brought them to this place. Okay, he\u2019d probably helped. Being decisive and in charge worked for him in business. It didn\u2019t translate quite as well in marriage. His mistake, and he\u2019d already taken note for future reference. That, and the fact that he fucking missed her, were the only reasons he\u2019d answered her call now. But without calm, productive conversation...their marriage could only be heading one place.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFace to face. I can\u2019t do what I need to over the phone.\u201d</p><p>Do, not say, he noticed. Had she decided not to wait the eight days until their anniversary to file for divorce? Most women wouldn\u2019t pass up decent six figures just to be free a few days early. Gia? With her, anything was possible.</p><p>He could point out the pitfalls of bailing early on their agreement, but she was smart. She knew the score. And even if it made him foolish, he wanted to know what the hell was going on in her head. He wanted to see her, too. Might as well not kid himself. Besides, once she\u2019d served him with papers and they started down the grand road to divorce, he wanted to look her in the eye and tell her that he loved her. In part because he knew he\u2019d never feel like he\u2019d given this his all until he did. And also because he wanted Gia to know exactly what she\u2019d lost.</p><p>\u201cWhen and where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour thirty. Lakeside Park, by the granite teddy bears.\u201d</p><p>The park he\u2019d taken her to early in their relationship for their first scene together, a semi-public one meant to open her submission and fulfill a fantasy. The same one in which she\u2019d called her safe word and nearly ended everything between them for good.</p><p>Symbolism. Fabulous. He loathed that shit.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. See you then.\u201d</p><p>Before he could reply, she hung up. Jason cursed, then paced his empty condo. He had exactly eight hours to decide how to approach her.</p><p>Grabbing his gear, he left his place. Too many memories of Gia here pelting him now. He wished like hell he would have thought of that before he\u2019d coerced her to stay in his home. He could have gotten a suite at the Crescent or something. But no. He\u2019d wanted her in his personal space, in his bed, as if she shared his life. So she would experience what their marriage could be like.</p><p>Dumb ass.</p><p>Making his way out the door and to his Porsche, he drove the city aimlessly, past his boyhood neighborhood, past upscale shops and family neighborhoods. A pretty brunette pushed a stroller on the sidewalk, a napping toddler securely tucked in. The smiling woman looked visibly pregnant with another child.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t that be his life? His family?</p><p>Damn it, he sounded maudlin.</p><p>His phone rang again. He couldn\u2019t see the screen while driving, but he pounced on it. \u201cGia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that your wife or your latest girl toy?\u201d</p><p>Samantha. He sighed. \u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m being a good mother this time and inviting you to my engagement party.\u201d</p><p>Jason recoiled. \u201cThat was fast. The guy you met at Neiman\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>She sighed as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world. \u201cGeoffrey is a wonderful man. You\u2019ll like him. He takes such good care of me.\u201d</p><p>Whatever. \u201cWhat do you like about him? I mean, besides his bank balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he\u2019s charming, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love him?\u201d</p><p>She gasped, affronted. \u201cWould I marry anyone I didn\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>Only four other times. \u201cWould you take care of him through thick and thin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJason, Geoffrey is ten years younger than me and in perfect health. Neither of us are on our death beds.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And his mother was missing the point of the question completely, probably on purpose.</p><p>\u201cWould you do anything to comfort him if he lost something priceless?\u201d He couldn\u2019t compare Gia\u2019s unflagging support of her family after Tony\u2019s death against his mother helping her next fianc\u00e9 through a missing cuff link or whatever. The questions were soaring right over his mother\u2019s head because she valued things far more than people.</p><p>She laughed off his questions. \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019d find the appropriate words for such a moment and hand him a double Scotch. Where are you going with this?\u201d</p><p>Jason winced and gave up explaining it to her. She had limitations, and he wouldn\u2019t change her. But one thought resonated in his head over and over: If he let Gia slip through his fingers, he\u2019d probably wind up with a new wife every five or ten years, each one much like Samantha.</p> <p>The thought sickened him.</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t control everything between them. He certainly couldn\u2019t make her love him.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>\u201cWhen is the party?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTonight at eight o\u2019clock.\u201d She rattled off an address, somewhere off of Mockingbird in Highland Park.</p> <p>Old money. Naturally.</p><p>\u201cI have a meeting at four thirty. If it wraps before then, I\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely. Don\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Samantha hung up.</p><p>Jason ended the call and shook his head.</p><p>He felt sorry for his mother because she would never know anything deeper than the joy of pretty, shiny things for sale. She\u2019d never really feel her heart. Moreover, he didn\u2019t want to be like her. He wanted what Gia\u2019s parents had.</p><p>He wanted Gia.</p> <p>How could he impress that upon her when he saw her this afternoon? All his usual ideas\u2014jewelry, handbags, shoes\u2014took him in the wrong direction. She wouldn\u2019t care about any of that. She wouldn\u2019t take a trip to an alley with him, much less anywhere tropical and fabulous so that he could romance her unless she wanted to be with him.</p><p>Other than her divorce settlement, she didn\u2019t seem to care about money. In fact, now that he thought about it, her agreeing to spend eighteen days with him for the cash seemed out of character.</p><p>Unless the money wasn\u2019t for her at all.</p><p>He pounded on the steering wheel with a sigh. Oh, hell. He\u2019d been so stupid.</p><p>But at least he knew what to do now.</p><p>A few errands and a lot of anxious waiting later, Jason pulled up at the park, locked his car, and headed toward their meeting point. The sun shined brightly, the thermometer edging toward the seventy degree mark as the last of autumn fought against a winter that would soon encroach. A few leaves still clung to the trees. Ducks swam in the nearby pond. Kids ran and laughed across the little stone bridge near the granite bears that served as monuments in the park. He\u2019d grown up here and always thought of this place as a little slice of heaven, a refuge in the city.</p><p>Now being here just ate at his guts.</p><p>Jason glanced at his watch. Right on time. He looked around for Gia, leaning against a little railing, hoping like hell he\u2019d made the right decision.</p> <p>As he second-guessed himself, Gia approached in a pair of faded jeans, a simple coral-hued T-shirt paired with a beige sweater, and flip-flops. What she didn\u2019t wear was her wedding ring or a smile. Jason couldn\u2019t stop the anxious slide of his stomach to his toes.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want a goddamn divorce.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she greeted. \u201cThanks for meeting me here.\u201d</p><p>He wanted to hold her. Fuck, he wanted to take her, possess her, convince her that she was his and always would be. But she put off a vibe that gave him pause. Not a fuck-off sort...but not precisely welcoming, either.</p><p>\u201cOf course. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d</p><p>She drew in a not-quite-steady breath\u2014a hint that she was nervous, too. \u201cI\u2019ve given everything that happened recently a lot of thought. I\u2019ve made some decisions and taken some action.\u201d</p><p>Here it came, Gia telling him that she\u2019d filed. He clenched his jaw, braced for the worst, and resolved to at least listen before he spoke. Then he intended to fight like hell. She might not see it yet, but they were right for one another.</p><p>\u201cWe made an agreement before I came back to you. I am determined to keep up my end of things, so I\u2019ll return for the next eight days if you want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you want the money from the divorce settlement?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...you haven\u2019t filed yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Thank God for that. \u201cThen what? You plan to hire an attorney and just...go on with your life as if this never happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said softly. Her expression broke, and he watched her fight tears.</p><p>It took everything inside Jason not to intervene and comfort her, to reach out and try to make everything okay.</p><p>\u201cThen what?\u201d He frowned at her, not understanding. \u201cExplain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be the one to file. I can\u2019t stop you if that\u2019s what you want, but...\u201d She shook her head, tears gathering. \u201cI\u2019ll never make the first move to end our marriage. I tried for a year to go on as if we never happened. I already know it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p><p>His chest seized up. Breathing stopped. His heart thundered furiously. \u201cAre you saying you don\u2019t want a divorce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She emphasized her answer with a shake of her head. \u201cI\u2019ve given this a lot of thought. You\u2019ve been trying to show me affection in the way you know how, with gifts. It\u2019s not an insult, and I have to stop being too proud to see that.\u201d</p><p>Gia had been thinking.</p><p>Relief poured through him. \u201cI never once tried to hurt or offend you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019ve gone out of your way to help me. Trying to have Wayman arrested is a good example. I might not like your methods, but you meant to keep me safe and eradicate him from my life all at once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo birds, one stone. I\u2019ve been telling you my motives for a while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have, and I...\u201d She shook her head and curled her fingers together nervously. \u201cI can\u2019t hate you for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtecting what\u2019s mine is in my nature. I know you don\u2019t like my methods\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your intentions are in the right place, I know. Sometimes, I lose my temper and I get emotional. When I look back later, I see clearly that I overreacted. I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at eating crow over the years. I wish you had told me that you intended to deal with Wayman, but I know you didn\u2019t mean to take away my opportunity for justice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I calmed down, I realized that I took my frustration out on you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou always want to right the wrongs. I respect that about you. I\u2019m sorry if I stepped on your toes. I might be a bit too accustomed to calling shots and making decisions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard enough of your business conversations to figure that out. I just had to calm down enough to realize you didn\u2019t do this to hurt me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I wanted to be really mad at you for forcing me to introduce you to my parents.\u201d She gave him a wry, if reluctant smile. \u201cAs hard as it is to admit it, you were right. They really love you.\u201d</p><p>A bright spot in this mess. \u201cI\u2019m pretty fond of them, too. Your niece and nephew are adorable and clearly idolize you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are a handful. I\u2019ve loved every minute I\u2019ve been with them.\u201d She sighed. \u201cBut we\u2019re not here to talk about the kids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cYou don\u2019t want a divorce. What do you want?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want? When you left last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mad, too.\u201d A tight grin tugged at his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t often lose control of my temper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want these last eight days with me?\u201d Gia looked like she held her breath. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to coerce me. I\u2019m more than willing to give them to you.\u201d</p><p>Jason couldn\u2019t find her words anything other than endearing. \u201cWhy do you ask? Because you want to spend those days with me or because you need money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth,\u201d she admitted quietly.</p><p>He watched her closely, trying to puzzle her out, but her normally expressive face didn\u2019t give a lot away. \u201cWe can negotiate the time together. The money...\u201d He reached into his pocket and pulled free a piece of paper he\u2019d folded and placed there earlier after picking it up off the fax machine at his office, then he handed it to Gia.</p><p>She scanned it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRead it,\u201d he encouraged with a bob of his head.</p><p>With a frown, she did. Her expression changed from impatience to confusion. Finally surprise overtook her face, complete with a gasp. \u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked innocently.</p><p>\u201cYou paid off my sister-in-law\u2019s house?\u201d</p><p>She screeched the question, and he took a step back. \u201cYou\u2019re mad? I\u2019m not trying to buy you, if that\u2019s what you think. I just thought that since you always worry about Mila and the kids\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d Gia threw herself at him, arms encircling his neck, legs around his waist, squeezing tight.</p><p>Damn, the minute she touched him, he wanted to tear her clothes off, restrain her, and get as deep inside her as possible.</p><p>Not far away, he saw a few moms watching over their kids stop and stare at them. Public scenes were nothing new to him...but definitely not with kids nearby.</p><p>Jason cleared his throat and gently eased Gia to her feet. \u201cBaby, as much as I\u2019d love to do every fabulously dirty thing to you I can think of, now isn\u2019t the time.\u201d</p><p>She sent him a little scolding glance with a laugh, but she still blushed. \u201cI know. I just... Wow, I know you paid off Mila\u2019s mortgage for me, and I can\u2019t think of anything that makes me happier.\u201d</p><p>Relief wended its way through his bloodstream. \u201cThank God. I finally figured out this morning that you wanted the divorce settlement to help your family, so I just took care of it. I know I didn\u2019t consult you first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the most thoughtful thing you\u2019ve ever done for me.\u201d She grinned from ear to ear. \u201cMila is happiest being a stay-at-home mom, and even with my salary and the proceeds from the sale of my house, I could barely keep up financially. I didn\u2019t want her worrying about affording the house or wondering how they\u2019d find the money to eat. Now, without a mortgage, she\u2019ll have enough left after Tony\u2019s death benefits to take care of their necessities and save a little for the future. She\u2019s going to be so incredibly happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re happy, that\u2019s what matters to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thrilled. But...\u201d She winced. \u201cI still want the money from the settlement.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn top of paying Mila\u2019s mortgage? All two hundred fifty thousand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Today, if you can get it to me.\u201d</p><p>Jason\u2019s first reaction came from the cynic in him. She wanted money and she still intended to let the divorce happen? Why? Had she decided that she couldn\u2019t live without the swanky shopping? He stared down into those deep dark eyes of hers, the lush rosy lips and paused. Did her reasons really matter? If all he had to do in order to keep Gia was take her to the mall and buy her a few things to line her closet...</p><p>He frowned and put the brakes on that thought altogether. Gia wasn\u2019t Samantha. She\u2019d been thrilled that he\u2019d spent his money paying off a family member\u2019s house, rather than try to bribe her with baubles.</p><p>\u201cWho needs the money?\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated. If you\u2019ll at least consider it, take me to your bank, and I\u2019ll show you what I\u2019m thinking. Then...you can decide what you want to do about the money and about us.\u201d</p><p>Knowing his wife, the money would benefit someone else far more than her, at least directly. She would probably derive her satisfaction from knowing someone she loved no longer had to worry, but who? Her parents?</p><p>\u201cSeparate cars? You lead. I\u2019ll follow.\u201d They headed toward the lot.</p><p>Gia gave him a sheepish grin. She looked like such a sensual woman most of the time. Her beautiful femininity had caught his eye first. She was all curves and angles, graceful. At the moment, however, she looked a bit like a child with that smile.</p><p>\u201cCan I ride with you?\u201d</p><p>Jason palmed his keys. \u201cYou like the car.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019m fascinated by the way you drive. It\u2019s aggressive. And...sexy.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cHop in.\u201d</p><p>As he pressed the button on the fob, the car beeped and unlocked. He opened her door and helped her in, then shut her inside. Bracing against the car, he closed his eyes for a second, allowing himself a moment of triumph. She didn\u2019t want a divorce.</p><p>So what happened with them after this jaunt to the bank? Gia wouldn\u2019t tell him what she had in mind until she was good and ready. But any time he spent with her was a pleasure, so he played along. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jason slid into the low, sleek vehicle, letting the black leather hug his body as he started the car and let it roar. He backed out of the lot, threw it in drive, then revved the engine. A smile crept up her face.</p><p>\u201cYou know, Officer Angelotti, I might break a traffic law or two today. Think you want to try to arrest me for that?\u201d</p><p>Her smile disappeared, and she turned suddenly somber. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Hell, what had he said? \u201cDid I upset you? I was just teasing.\u201d</p> <p>Face pensive, she licked her lips. He got hard at the sight and cursed himself. She was upset. As much as his cock wanted those lips around him, Jason had to focus on her.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not you. I\u2019ll explain after our stop.\u201d</p><p>Something still bothered her. Jason examined their conversation from every angle, trying to determine what. Their marriage? This errand? He came up blank.</p><p>A few minutes later, they pulled up in front of the bank. Jason emerged and opened her door, curiosity eating at him. Whatever she was about, he wanted this settled so they could deal with their marriage and their tomorrows...and start letting Gia know that she was his.</p> <p>As they approached the door, she stopped and placed her fingers on his chest. \u201cBefore we go in, I want to say a few things.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her to the side to let another customer enter the branch and tried to rein his impatience. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhether you want to give me the money or not, it doesn\u2019t change my decision. I won\u2019t file for divorce. Obviously, I can\u2019t stop you from doing it, and if you still choose to at the end of eight days, I won\u2019t expect more money.\u201d</p><p>His silly wife hadn\u2019t yet grasped the way he saw their relationship working, but as soon as he figured out what she was up to, he\u2019d make a few things clear.</p><p>\u201cAll right. Anything else?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then took in a shaky breath. \u201cLast night, I gave a lot of consideration to my future, all parts of it. I took a long, hard look at my job and decided that I can\u2019t keep working for a precinct where no one cares if justice is being served. When money becomes more important than right, I have no business being there. I talked it over with my dad. He understands. This morning, I quit.\u201d</p> <p>The words stunned him. Happily, of course. He never thought he\u2019d see the day that Gia gave up the pursuit of order and goodness. He loved the idea that she wouldn\u2019t be risking herself in the line of duty and possibly wind up a casualty like her brother, suddenly gone because some street punk had pulled the trigger. But Jason remembered their argument in his kitchen yesterday morning. She needed purpose in her life.</p><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a decision you\u2019re happy with, then you made the right one. If you want my support, you\u2019ve got it.\u201d And he would totally provide for her. If she never wanted to lift a finger again, he\u2019d be happy to give her everything she needed.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the money comes in,\u201d she admitted, wrapping her arms around herself as a breeze whipped through her sweater.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s a nest egg for the future?\u201d Did she think she\u2019d remain married to him but live separately?</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s the beginning of my new purpose. If I\u2019m not going to be a police officer, I\u2019ve got to do something good with my life. So I\u2019m going to start a fund to help the families of slain officers. It will provide assistance for everything from burial expenses to child care to financial planning for the future. And grief counseling, definitely. Whatever these survivors need, I want to make sure they get. The money from the settlement will allow me to get a good start on fundraising and assisting others.\u201d</p><p>Shock and pride both smacked him. God, Gia had the biggest heart. She made him feel alive for the first time in his life. Until her, he\u2019d never known what it meant to think with goodness. Jason felt blessed to have her. If he had his way, he\u2019d spend the next fifty years absorbing more of that love and giving it back to her.</p><p>\u201cDid you already set up an account here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I did file the paperwork to create a nonprofit LLC so I could open one. Do you hate the idea?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, baby. I love it. I think it\u2019s every bit as amazing as you are,\u201d he assured her. \u201cLet\u2019s get this started.\u201d</p><p>An hour later, they emerged from the bank. Evening was just falling, leaving a bright orange-pink swath across the sky. Gia wore a smile of such serenity that she glowed. Jason had been attracted to her the moment he saw her, but he found her so much more beautiful because he knew how good she was inside as well.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he murmured as he helped her into the car again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really excited to get started. Thank you so much for doubling the contribution. I can do more for others much faster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He started the car and drove back to the park.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long before they pulled into the lot again. Most of the minivans and SUVs had cleared out.</p><p>\u201cSo...that\u2019s everything I had to say.\u201d She looked at him expectantly. As Jason pondered the best way to tell her what was on his mind, she grabbed her purse and fished her keys out. \u201cI\u2019ll...um, get out of your hair.\u201d</p><p>Jason reached out and grabbed her wrist. \u201cNo, you won\u2019t. I need to say a few things before anyone goes anywhere.\u201d And now that the moment had come for him to finally speak what was in his heart, he felt nervous as all hell.</p><p>She sank back into the seat but still didn\u2019t look relaxed. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>Shit. He hadn\u2019t planned this speech exactly. Without knowing what Gia had on her mind, he hadn\u2019t been sure what to say. Usually, he went on with his thoughts and plans, then let everyone else adjust as necessary. Besides keeping him off guard, his wife deserved more consideration\u2014especially since she always put everyone else first. No one did that for her, and he wanted to be the one she could count on.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m listening,\u201d she assured softly.</p><p>He gulped down rare nerves and took her hands in his, clutching them. \u201cGia, baby, I don\u2019t want a divorce, either. I want you to stay with me and live as my wife. I want to take care of you and watch you grow this foundation in your brother\u2019s honor, be a part of your family...and start our own. W-will you do that with me?\u201d</p><p>The beginnings of a smile broke across her face, and she pressed her lips together to squelch it. Even so, he saw the moisture gathering in her eyes and making them glisten. Damn it, if she wasn\u2019t the most beautiful woman he knew. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah...\u201d He squeezed her hands. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a lot, too. I love you.\u201d</p><p>Gia froze, completely silent. Then she shoved her purse to the floorboard and launched herself into his arms, pressing her lips to his with a need that floored him. The passion to become one with him flowed from her kiss, deep into his mouth where they joined...then straight to his heart. Over the gearshift, he held her tighter, wishing like hell he could pull her body completely against him and make her his all over again.</p><p>But first, he had to hear her say that she wanted what he yearned for, too.</p><p>He tore away. \u201cIs that a yes?\u201d</p><p>She panted, her slick, passion-stained lips parted and tempting and... Shit, he needed to keep his head together. This answer was too important.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Gia brushed a solemn kiss on his mouth, then smiled softly at him. \u201cYes. I\u2019d love that because I love you. So much.\u201d</p><p>When she gasped suddenly, then dove for her purse on the floorboard, he frowned. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>After a wild dig through her purse, she came up with a triumphant grin on her face. \u201cPut this on me?\u201d</p><p>Gia handed him her ring, then kept something back in her other fist.</p><p>Jason wondered what little plot she cooked up now, but he smiled. \u201cMy pleasure, wife.\u201d</p><p>In the solemn silence, he slid the ring onto her finger. This time, he knew it would stay there. Joy lit up every nerve and jetted through his veins. He couldn\u2019t imagine being any happier than he was right now.</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d she breathed, looking down at the symbol of their marriage all glittering in the falling light. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful...but not perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not?\u201d</p><p>Gia grabbed his left hand in hers, set it against her cheek, kissed his palm. Then she looked into his eyes and, with shaking fingers, she settled a perfect platinum band around his finger. \u201cI bought it this morning when I figure out what I wanted. In our rush to Vegas, we never picked out a ring for you, and I wanted you to have something from me so you\u2019d always remember that you\u2019re my husband.\u201d</p><p>Fuck if he didn\u2019t feel his throat close up as he choked on the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I\u2019ll cherish it because you gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mr. Denning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Mrs. Denning. Hell, I enjoy saying that.\u201d He laughed, filling with light and joy and more happy tomorrows. \u201cI\u2019ll probably say it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d She grinned, then gazed out the windshield. \u201cI think all the moms and kids are gone.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around the empty parking lot. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>Gia opened the door, stepped out, and bent to toss him a come-hither look. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been a very bad girl, Master.\u201d</p><p>Jason wondered what she was up to but figured he\u2019d like it. \u201cYou have. I still owe you one hell of a spanking for deserting me for so long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do,\u201d she agreed. \u201cYou\u2019ll always keep me safe, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways, to my last breath.\u201d</p><p>Her smile filled with mischief. \u201cThen spank me...and whatever else you have in mind. That is, if you can catch me.\u201d</p><p>Her words clicked through his brain and had registered with his libido by the time she slammed the car door and started jogging into the park. He\u2019d finally have her here, where their relationship had almost ended once\u2014and now she\u2019d trusted him enough to surrender. She\u2019d love him more than enough to make it sweet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s on, baby,\u201d he muttered as he jumped out of the Porsche and clicked the fob to lock it as he ran after her. \u201cWhen I catch you, I\u2019m going to spank your ass red and take you right then, right there.\u201d</p><p>As she reached a towering tree, she curled her arm around the trunk, then peeked back at him with a grin that lit up her whole face. \u201cI can\u2019t wait...\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
