I couldn\u2019t stop myself. I was that tired, and lonely, and he...he sat with me of an evening.\u201d</p><p>The judge snorted and Loveday thought he might have woken up, but then he started snoring again.</p><p>The Duchess of Berrow had very kind eyes, but she shook her head at Loveday. \u201cYou were already married to Avery, that is, Mr. Mosley, when you married John.\u201d</p><p>Loveday hung her head. \u201cAvery left me three years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know as how he wanted me anymore, because he said I was stupider than a sow in springtime.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess had a quiet sort of prettiness about her, like a preacher\u2019s wife. Her gown was black, but it had a shine to it. Her hair was lovely too, looped and frilled and ruffed over her head, the way fine ladies did those things. And her eyes were so forgiving that Loveday suddenly felt like telling the truth. It was as if she were a youngster back in her mother\u2019s kitchen, having stolen a cake.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t really married to Avery Mosley,\u201d she said. Out of the corner of her eye she saw Avery swing up his head. \u201cI was already married before I married Avery. And I didn\u2019t really marry him because it were an Irish minister named Usher and he told me privately that it weren\u2019t a real marriage.\u201d</p><p>Avery probably fell off his chair at that news, but Loveday was focused on the duchess. \u201cMy da married me off the first time, when I was twelve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve!\u201d</p><p>The duchess looked a bit stricken, so she tried to explain. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad. I had developed, you see, and I was worth something, and it wasn\u2019t so bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat was Mr. Buckley. But he died, so after Mr. Buckley passed on, I married Harold Eccles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose that Mr. Eccles is dead?\u201d The duchess sounded hopeful.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s about as alive as anyone could be in debtor\u2019s prison. I always visits him when I\u2019m in London. Two hatbands and a coat, they got him for. He\u2019s been there almost eleven years now.</p><p>\u201cSo I married\u2014\u201d she paused for a moment, just to get it right \u201c\u2014Monsieur Giovanni Battista. He was an Italian man, and he said he\u2019d take me away. But he gave me a pair of gloves, and then he went away instead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then Mr. Mosley came along?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>Loveday nodded. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d she said. \u201cI knows as I shouldn\u2019t have. But I didn\u2019t know what to do, and he asked me. But he left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were in a difficult position,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cIf I have this right, your first husband died, the second is in prison, the third went to Italy, the fourth was not a real marriage, and the fifth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no one to care for myself and the babes because my dad doesn\u2019t speak to me after the Italian man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildren?\u201d The duchess looked through the long pieces of paper that were floating around the table. \u201cThere\u2019s no mention of children in these pleadings.\u201d</p><p>The fancy London man standing next to John answered. \u201cIt was not considered relevant to the matter at hand, Your Grace. My client married her in good faith as the certificates indicate. And may I point out that these court proceedings are highly irregular? Surely the Honorable Judge Truder should be roused?\u201d</p><p>The duchess ignored him. Loveday could have told the London man that in Berrow, this was the way of it. Truder was a drunk, but it didn\u2019t really matter as he and the duchess did the business together, just as it was in the old days, and that was good enough for the town of Berrow.</p><p>\u201cWhose children are they?\u201d the duchess said, turning back to Loveday.</p><p>\u201cAll of them, really,\u201d Loveday said hopelessly. \u201cI gave them each one. Except for John, of course, because we only married a bit ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have four children?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>\u201cFive. Harold, him as is in prison, has two.\u201d</p><p>There was silence in the courtroom. Loveday could hear John moving his feet. If only...but it was too late.</p><p>\u201cYou are really Mrs. Eccles,\u201d the duchess observed.</p><p>Loveday nodded. \u201cI know as how you\u2019re right, Mrs. Duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d a man next to her hissed.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said obediently. \u201cBut Harold is in debtor\u2019s prison.\u201d</p><p>The duchess looked over at the box, so Loveday looked too. There was John, with his blue eyes. And Avery with his angry small mouth, just like always.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you pursue this indictment, Mr. Mosley?\u201d the duchess asked.</p><p>Avery burst into words, but the gist of it was that he wanted her back, even after the things he said about her.</p><p>The duchess looked at him steadily. Then she turned back to Loveday. \u201cHave you any money?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Loveday said. \u201cI\u2019ve no money but what my husbands give me.\u201d</p><p>There was quiet for a moment, and then the duchess said, even more gently, \u201cIs your father still alive, Mrs. Eccles?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he\u2014\u201d and she stopped.</p><p>The duchess folded her hands and looked so sweet. \u201cHe\u2019s ill, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard so,\u201d Loveday whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd your father has some money that he might leave you?\u201d</p><p>Loveday looked back at John\u2019s blue eyes, and she felt like a fool. \u201cThat\u2019s why Avery wants me back. Because of the mill. And John...I suppose that\u2019s why John courted me. For the mill.\u201d</p><p>John got up and left, so that sort of spoke for itself.</p><p>Avery left too, so Loveday cried for a little bit, and then the duchess said, \u201cYou were very wrong to marry so many men, Loveday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Loveday said, sniffling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to advise the judge to acquit you. But you mustn\u2019t marry again. I want you to bail out Mr. Eccles. And then live with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Loveday promised.</p><p>The duchess reached over and poked the judge. He snorted once or twice and woke up. She said something to him and he snorted again and said, \u201cCase dismissed!\u201d Then he slumped back down in his chair.</p><p>Loveday stood there for a moment before she realized she was free to go. Except the duchess wanted to see her. So she went to the front, and the duchess took her hand. She told her a fairy tale, about how Mr. Eccles\u2014that would be Harold, in prison\u2014should treat her like a princess, because she was to be a mill owner.</p><p>Loveday just smiled and smiled. That duchess was the most lovely, best-smelling woman in the world. She had a funny way of talking, and daft ideas, but you couldn\u2019t help liking her. Especially when she sat right there, holding Loveday\u2019s hand\u2014Loveday, who everyone said was as stupid as a sow though she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>And finally the duchess gave her five pounds, which she could use to get Harold out of prison right away. Harold didn\u2019t owe more than a pound or two, even counting charges for board, so Loveday tried to give some back, but the duchess wouldn\u2019t take it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then the judge woke up again and he seemed to have a terrible problem with gas, so the duchess smiled at Loveday just as if she were a normal person, and they both left the room.</p><p>Loveday Billing had never been so happy in her life.</p><p>A duchess liked her, and had quitted her, whatever that meant, and told her what to do.</p><p>And she did just that.</p> <p>Chapter One</p><p>In Which Cinderella Dresses for the Ball and Her Fairy Godmother Brings a Goose Instead of a Pumpkin</p><p>January 6 (Twelfth Night), 1784 A Costume Ball The Country Seat of the Duke of Beaumont</p><p>N ursery tales are full of fascinating widows, although they aren\u2019t always the nicest characters. Cinderella\u2019s stepmother likely put on a dazzling gown for the prince\u2019s ball, even if her daughters did inherit her big feet and sharp tongue.</p><p>Harriet, Duchess of Berrow, realized soon after her husband died that there are glamorous widows, and then there are widows who live in shoes with too many children, like poor Loveday Billing. There are widows who dance all night with younger men, and then there are dowdy widows who are offered only pinched smiles.</p> <p>Harriet had no illusions about what kind of widow she was. She was the kind who lived in a shoe, and never mind the fact that she had no children and her estate was much larger than a shoe.</p><p>Her husband had been dead for two years and no younger\u2014or older\u2014men were lining up to ask her to dance. Most of her acquaintances still got a tragic sheen in their eyes and promptly moved away after greeting her, as if sadness was catching.</p><p>Apparently, if one\u2019s husband committed suicide, one automatically became the unappealing type of widow.</p><p>Partly it was her fault. Here she was at the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s impromptu costume ball\u2014but was she dressing as a glamorous character? Or even an evil one?</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d her friend Jemma (the aforesaid Duchess of Beaumont) asked.</p><p>\u201cA nursery rhyme character. Can you guess which one?\u201d Harriet was wearing a motherly nightgown of plain cotton that her maid had recruited from the housekeeper. Underneath she had three petticoats, as well as four woolen stockings in her bodice. Just to show off a bit, she arched her back.</p> <p>\u201cA nursery rhyme character with big breasts,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cVery big breasts. Very very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherly breasts,\u201d Harriet prompted.</p><p>\u201cActually you don\u2019t look motherly as much as wildly curvaceous. The problem will be if one of our houseguests lures you into a corner and attempts a cheerful grope. Wasn\u2019t there some nursery rhyme about lighting the way to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not on my way to bed,\u201d Harriet said, somewhat deflated. \u201cAnd no one ever tries to grope me. What character are you?\u201d</p><p>Jemma\u2019s gown was made of a clear pale pink that looked wonderful with the dark gold color of her unpowdered hair. There were small silk poppies sewn all over her skirts, and poppies tucked in her hair. She managed to look elegant and yet untamed, all at once.</p><p>\u201cTitania, Queen of the Fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mother Goose. Which fairly sums up the difference between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about!\u201d Jemma scolded, wrapping an arm around Harriet. \u201cLook at you, darling. You are far too young and fresh to be Mother Goose!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo one will know who I am,\u201d Harriet said, pulling away from Jemma and sitting on the bed. \u201cThey\u2019ll think I\u2019m a fat white ghost.\u201d</p><p>Jemma started laughing. \u201cThe ghost of a murdered cook. No, all you need is a clue to your Mother Goose status, and people will admire the cleverness of your costume. Wait until you see Lord Pladget as Henry VIII: he has a hearth rug tied around his middle and he looks as big as a barn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already look as big as a barn, at least on top.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA goose!\u201d Jemma said. \u201cOf course, you need a goose and I know just the one!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>Two minutes later, Jemma was back. With a goose.</p><p>\u201cIs that real?\u201d Harriet asked warily.</p><p>\u201cIn a matter of speaking. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s a little stiff. It usually flies along the wall in the south parlor. My mother-in-law has a morbid attitude toward decorating that involved arranging all kinds of dead animals on the walls. You can use the poor goose tonight, darling, and then we\u2019ll set him free to fly to a better place, if you understand me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet took the goose in her hands rather dubiously. It was stuffed so that its neck stayed stiff, as if it were in flight.</p><p>\u201cJust tuck it under your arm,\u201d Jemma said. Harriet stood up and tried it. \u201cNot like that. Here, turn his head upright so he looks like a friend whispering in your ear.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stared down at the bird\u2019s glossy eyes. \u201cThis is not a friendly goose.\u201d It looked ready to lunge from her hands and peck someone.</p><p>\u201cThere is no such thing as a friendly goose,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI must go see how Isidore is coming with her costume. I checked on her earlier and her maids were frantically tearing apart two dresses. She says she\u2019s going to be a queen, but I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s going to enter the ballroom wrapped in a handkerchief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Isidore go by her title of Duchess of Cosway?\u201d Harriet asked. \u201cLast night she was announced as Lady Isidore Del\u2019Fino.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever met the duke. Her husband, I mean,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cOr if she did, it was for five minutes years ago. So she uses her own title, although for tonight she\u2019s the Queen of Palmyra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had told me that you were planning a Twelfth Night costume party,\u201d Harriet said, putting the goose down, \u201cI could have been a queen as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently queens don\u2019t wear much clothing, so you\u2019ll definitely be more comfortable this way. And I\u2019m sorry about not warning you, darling, but it\u2019s so much fun doing it last minute. You should see people rushing about the house looking for costumes. The butler is going mad! It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d</p><p>And with that, Jemma sailed out of the room leaving Harriet with the goose.</p><p>It was absurd to feel so sorry for herself. Every time she walked into Judge Truder\u2019s court she heard of people whose lives were far more desperate. Why just last month there was a girl who stole half a jar of mustard and six oranges. Truder had actually woken up and wanted to give the poor child hard labor, fool that he was.</p><p>But she, Harriet, had no need to steal oranges. She was a duchess; she was still relatively young; she was healthy...</p><p>She was lonely.</p><p>A tear splashed on the duck and she absently smoothed his feathers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t really want to be a queen, either of fairies or Palmyra, wherever that was. She just wanted a husband.</p><p>Someone to sit with her of an evening, just like Loveday said.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Another chapter in Which Breasts Play a Not-insignificant Role</p><p>Z enobia, Queen of Palmyra, threw back her head and laughed. Her bodice gaped, precariously clinging to the slope of her breasts. The dapper man before her twirled on his toes, one hand up in the air, like a gypsy dancer at Bartholomew Fair. Zenobia laughed again, and flung both hands in the air in imitation of him.</p><p>The Queen of Palmyra\u2019s corset, if one existed, was thoroughly inadequate.</p><p>It crossed Harriet\u2019s mind that a true friend would alert Zenobia\u2014more commonly known as Isidore\u2014that her breasts were about to make an appearance on the ballroom floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But Harriet was tucked in a chair at the side of the ballroom, and Isidore had her eyes fixed on the man she was seducing, though seducing wasn\u2019t quite the appropriate word. Harriet had the idea that Isidore was chaste. Just bored. And Harriet couldn\u2019t possibly catch her attention. She felt invisible; she certainly seemed to be invisible to most of the men in the room.</p><p>Widows dressed as Mother Goose were not as much in demand as half-naked queens, no matter how much stuffing their bodices contained. What little cloth existed in Isidore\u2019s bodice was thickly embroidered with peacock feathers, the eyes picked out in jewels.</p><p>In short, peacock eyes were more popular than goose eyes. Lord Beesby, for example, didn\u2019t seem to be able to take his eyes off of Isidore\u2019s bodice, whereas Harriet\u2019s goose put men off. It was lying beside her, head drooping off the chair so that its beady eyes stared at the floor.</p><p>Isidore twirled again, hands in the air. A lock of hair fell from her elaborate arrangement. The dancers nearby paused in their own steps, entranced by the sway of her hips. There was something so un-English about Isidore\u2019s curves, her scarlet lips, the way she was smiling at Beesby as if he were the king himself. It had to be her Italian ancestry. Most Englishwomen looked\u2014and felt\u2014like Harriet herself: dumpy. Maternal.</p> <p>Though she, Harriet, had no reason to feel maternal, given her lack of children. At this point, the only man likely to approach her would be called Georgie Porgie.</p><p>Harriet bit her lip. She\u2019d welcome Georgie Porgie. Who knew it was just as humiliating to sit out dances when one is widowed, as when one first entered the marriage market? Yet another one of life\u2019s charming surprises.</p><p>Lord Beesby was dancing as he had never danced before. One hand still in the air like a gypsy king, he capered and pranced before his partner, his knees rising higher and higher. He reminded Harriet of nothing so much as her beloved spaniel, Mrs. Custard. If Beesby had a tail, he\u2019d be wagging it with pure bliss. He was rapt, enchanted, in love. According to the pattern of the dance, he should have long ago moved to another partner, but he and Isidore had\u2014scandalously\u2014eschewed exchanging partners, and the dance had continued without them.</p><p>Suddenly, out of the corner of her eye, Harriet caught a glimpse of an irate-looking Lady Beesby making her way toward the couple. Isidore\u2019s bodice was at the very point of disaster. Harriet jumped to her feet, caught Isidore\u2019s eye, and jerked her head in the direction of Lady Beesby.</p><p>Isidore flashed one look at the matron heading toward her, drew back, and shouted, \u201cLord Beesby, you do me wrong!\u201d</p> <p>Caught in a dream, Lord Beesby didn\u2019t hear and circled blissfully, one more time.</p><p>Isidore bellowed something else; Lord Beesby started blinking and stopped short in the midst of a turn. Isidore\u2019s hand flashed out and she slapped him.</p><p>The entire ballroom went stone silent. \u201cYou led me to believe that you found me attractive!\u201d Isidore shrieked, with all the bravado of an Italian opera singer. \u201cHow dare you spurn me after presenting me with such temptation!\u201d</p><p>Jemma appeared from nowhere and wrapped an arm around Isidore\u2019s waist. \u201cAlas, Lord Beesby is a man of high moral fiber,\u201d she said, with magnificent emphasis.</p><p>\u201cOh, how shall I recover!\u201d Isidore cried, casting a drooping hand to her brow.</p><p>Jemma swept her off the dance floor. Harriet barely stopped herself from applauding.</p> <p>Lord Beesby was still standing there, mouth agape, when his wife reached his side. Harriet thought she looked at him with a measure of new respect. It was one thing to have one\u2019s husband making a fool of himself on the dance floor with a gorgeous young woman. It was another to have that same husband spurn the wench in a public arena.</p><p>Lady Beesby even smiled at her husband, which had to be the first such affectionate gesture in days. Perhaps years. Then she spun on her heel and marched off the dance floor, her smaller, bemused husband trailing after her. It reminded Harriet of when her fat sow Rebecca would suddenly march off in indignation. Rebecca generally trailed at least one piglet behind her. Or\u2014Harriet stopped.</p><p>Her thoughts were made up of spaniels and piglets. She was so tedious that she bored herself. She was countrified, tedious, and melancholic.</p><p>She could feel her eyes getting dangerously hot. But she was tired of tears. Benjamin had died over two years ago. She\u2019d wept when he died, and after. Wept more than she thought it was possible for a human body to cry. Wept, she realized now, from a mixture of grief and rage and mortification.</p><p>But her husband was gone, and she was still here.</p><p>Dressing in Mother Goose costumes wouldn\u2019t bring him back. Sitting like a mouse at the side of the ballroom wouldn\u2019t bring him back. Nothing would bring him back.</p><p>Yet what could she do? Widows were supposed to be dignified. Not only that, but she was a duchess. Given that Benjamin\u2019s nephew, the current Duke of Berrow, was only eleven years old and still at Eton, she wasn\u2019t even a dowager duchess. She was a duchess and a widow and a twenty-seven-year-old woman: and which of those three terms was the most depressing she couldn\u2019t even decide.</p><p>She swallowed hard. Could she bear to spend the rest of her life growing paler, as her hair faded and her shoulders stooped? Would she merely watch other women seduce and entice, while she mused about fat piglets and loyal spaniels? A dog, no matter how loyal, is only a dog.</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t spend the rest of her life clinging to the sides of ballrooms, dressed as the mother she wasn\u2019t and never would be.</p><p>She had to do something. Change her life! Start thinking about\u2014</p><p>About\u2014</p><p>Pleasure.</p><p>The word popped into her mind unexpectedly and stayed there, with all the gracious coolness of a drop of cool rain on a blistering day. Isidore was obviously enjoying herself, flirting with Beesby. He loved their dance.</p><p>Pleasure.</p><p>She could think about pleasure.</p><p>Her pleasure.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>In Which the Geography of Pleasure is Dissected</p><p>H arriet found the Duchess of Beaumont and the Duchess of Cosway\u2014i.e, Jemma and Isidore\u2014in a small parlor after a dismaying search of other rooms. Every alcove held a pair of heads, male and female. Every settee featured people paired off like robins in spring. Or, since it was a costume party, like a sailor and the Queen of Sheba.</p><p>She pasted a cheery Mother Goose type of smile on her face and kept saying mindless things like \u201cOh, very sorry! Right then, I\u2019ll just\u2014just move along, shall I?\u201d The sailor didn\u2019t even look up when she walked into the yellow salon. His head bent over the Queen of Sheba\u2019s with such tenderness and possession that Harriet felt as if her heart would break in two.</p><p>She and Benjamin never...of course not. They had been a married couple, hadn\u2019t they? Married couples didn\u2019t kiss at balls.</p><p>But had Benjamin ever kissed her like that? He used to kiss her in a brisk, affectionate manner. The way she kissed her spaniel.</p><p>\u201cYou saved me!\u201d Isidore cried when Harriet finally located Jemma and Isidore in a small sitting room. \u201cLady Beesby would have eaten me for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDarling, come and sit beside me; I\u2019m feeling blue,\u201d Jemma said, peering around the side of her chair. They were seated around the fire.</p><p>Harriet rounded the little circle and halted. Her least favorite acquaintance in the world, the Duke of Villiers, lay on a settee just to the left of the hearth. He was recovering from an infection caused by a dueling wound, and his face was angular and pale. Even so, one look at him made her feel every inch an unattractive, dumpy widow. His dressing gown was made of Italian silk, dark lavender embroidered with a delicate border of black tulips. It was exquisite, unexpected, and utterly beautiful. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI apologize, Your Grace,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you had left your chambers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was threatening to rise to my feet and dance the sara-band,\u201d he said, in his slightly drawling accent, \u201cso my dragonish valet finally allowed me to be near the festivities, if not part of them.\u201d</p><p>Harriet sat down stiffly, promising herself that she could leave within five minutes. She could plead a headache, she could say the fire was too hot for her, she could say that she had promised to meet someone in the ballroom...Anything to get away from Villiers.</p><p>\u201cAs you entered, Harriet,\u201d Isidore announced, \u201cI was just saying that I have decided to create a scandal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPoor Lady Beesby,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>Isidore laughed. \u201cNot with Beesby. That was just entertainment. No, I mean to create a true scandal. The kind of scandal that will force my husband to return to England.\u201d Harriet suddenly noticed that Isidore had a very firm jaw.</p><p>\u201cI hate to use my misbegotten history as an example,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cbut my husband never found my scandals an adequate reason to travel from England to France. And your husband is somewhere in the Far East, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Harriet silently agreed. Propping up a drunken judge had caused her to see any number of cases involving scandals caused by women. Often their husbands didn\u2019t bother to travel to the next county to rescue them. But then, dukes and duchesses never showed up in the shire court of the Berrow duchy and presumably the duke cared for his reputation.</p><p>\u201cI pity Cosway,\u201d Villiers said languidly. \u201cJemma, have you a chess set in this parlor?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. And you know that the doctor told you to stay away from chess. You need to recover from those fevers, not exacerbate your tired brain by thinking up intricate plays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife without chess is paltry,\u201d Villiers growled. \u201cNot worth living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin would have agreed with you,\u201d Harriet said, before she thought. Her husband had killed himself after losing a game of chess.</p><p>To Villiers.</p><p>There was a drop of silence in the room, a moment in which no one breathed. Then Jemma said, \u201cWe all wish Benjamin were here to play chess with us.\u201d</p><p>Villiers turned his face to the fire and said nothing, but Harriet felt a rush of acute shame, along with the memory of his stammering apology. Villiers had been dying, literally burning up with a fever, and he\u2019d come all the way to Jemma\u2019s house just to apologize to her for winning the game that led to Benjamin\u2019s suicide.</p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t referring to his\u2014his death,\u201d Harriet scrambled into words. \u201cMerely that, if a doctor had told Benjamin that he couldn\u2019t play chess\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a whole month,\u201d Villiers put in.</p><p>\u201cPoor Benjamin would have been enraged. Crazed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be rather crazed myself, I think,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cThat tyrannical Scottish surgeon of yours could at least allow us to continue our match,\u201d Villiers growled. \u201cOne move a day...how difficult could that be for my festering brain to handle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly can\u2019t play chess for a month?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so terrible,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou can read books. Though not books about chess, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA month,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>There was a world of leaden boredom and misery in his voice, so much so that Harriet couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to find other interests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen, wine, and song,\u201d Isidore suggested. \u201cClassic male occupations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful women, preferably mermaids, are supposed to sing while you quaff wine,\u201d Harriet pointed out, rather liking the image of the Duke of Villiers surrounded by sirens. If she were a siren, she would try to sink his vessel.</p><p>\u201cIf you know of any mermaids, do send them my direction,\u201d Villiers said, closing his eyes. \u201cRight now I am far too tired to pursue a woman, fish tail or no.\u201d</p><p>He did look white. Given that Harriet loathed him, she was feeling provokingly sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cI know! I can use you in my scheme,\u201d Isidore exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Villiers stated, not opening his eyes. \u201cI never join schemes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pity,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI am quite sure that the news that his duchess was frolicking with the infamous Duke of Villiers would summon my ne\u2019er-do-well husband. Cosway\u2019s solicitor last indicated that he was somewhere in Ethiopia. Apparently he\u2019s discovered the source of the Blue Nile. And aren\u2019t we all happy for him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if the duke returns to defend your reputation, poor Villiers would have to fight another duel,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYour husband probably fights off cannibal tribes over his morning cup of tea, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in no shape to emulate the cannibal hordes,\u201d Villiers said, ladling his voice with such a layer of dramatic gloom that they all started laughing.</p><p>\u201cThen I need someone with your reputation,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Harriet exclaimed. \u201cAre you really hoping that a scandal will make your husband return?\u201d</p><p>Isidore looked at her, one eyebrow raised, her lips curved in a hard little smile. \u201cCan you think of one single reason why I shouldn\u2019t try? I am married to a man whom I have no memory of meeting. He shows no concern for my whereabouts, and has never answered a single communication I sent to him, though I know he receives my letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely mail goes astray between here and the Blue Nile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOccasionally I receive a note from his solicitors in London responding to something in a private letter I wrote to him. I am tired of this situation. I am married to the Duke of Cosway and I want to be a real duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy does Cosway stay away from England?\u201d Villiers asked, opening his eyes. \u201cAre you so very terrifying?\u201d He peered at her in an interested kind of way.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to him?\u201d Harriet asked, at the same moment.</p><p>\u201cHe is an explorer,\u201d Isidore said with withering scorn. \u201cCan you see me on a camel, trotting around looking for the Blue Nile?\u201d</p><p>Harriet couldn\u2019t help grinning. She herself was a sturdy type who probably could\u2014if she had to\u2014clamber up onto a camel. Isidore, on the other hand, looked as exotic and delicate as an orchid.</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t his mother summon him?\u201d Jemma asked.</p><p>\u201cShe pleads failure,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cAnd says that nothing will bring him back home, that he is the most stubborn of her children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met Lady Cosway several times,\u201d Jemma remarked. \u201cIf she put her foot down, the King of England would bow to her will. I\u2019d back her over her son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just what I think. I\u2019m trusting her to gauge the scandal and force him to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has it been since he was in England?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cEighteen years. Eighteen! I could divorce him on some sort of grounds, I suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNon-consummation would be a possibility,\u201d Villiers noted.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m not stupid. It is a great deal better to be a duchess than not to be a duchess. I\u2019ve lived on the Continent. I visited Jemma in Paris, and spent a great deal of time in my favorite of all cities, Venice. But now I want my life as an adult woman to begin. And I can\u2019t do it while caught in this half-life!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet blinked at her. It sounded as if Isidore were voicing the same things she had just been thinking to herself.</p><p>\u201cTo be brutally honest,\u201d Isidore continued, \u201cI\u2019m tired of sleeping alone. If Cosway turns out to be a horrible sort of man with whom I don\u2019t want to spend time, well, then I might leave him and return to Italy. But at least I won\u2019t have this talismanic virginity any longer. And I might have a child.\u201d</p><p>Harriet choked, and even Villiers opened his eyes. \u201cDid I hear the word virgin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsidore, you are being deliberately provoking,\u201d Jemma said, handing her a small ruby glass of cordial. \u201cYou are trying to shock us. I assure you that I am horrifically shocked, so you can relent now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVirginity is a woman\u2019s most valuable possession,\u201d Villiers said, looking not in the least shocked.</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Jemma said briskly. \u201cSince we\u2019re all being so remarkably intimate, I don\u2019t mind pointing out that a virgin without a brain is a useless creature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but a virgin with a brain is beyond the price of rubies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have beauty too, I might point out,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cVanity, thy name is woman,\u201d Villiers said. But he was smiling. \u201cI gather you intend to impress upon your husband the possibility that you might birth a cuckoo to inherit his dukedom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore to the point,\u201d Jemma put in, \u201cimpress it upon his mother. Because if Cosway were interested in his estate, he would have come home years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou truly mean to lose your virginity?\u201d Harriet asked. It was so fascinating to see another woman face loneliness\u2014and do it with all the courage that she, Harriet, lacked. Isidore wouldn\u2019t sit around on the side of a ballroom weeping onto a stuffed goose.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind yet,\u201d Isidore said airily. \u201cI shall make that decision based on how long it takes my husband to return. I just need a potent kind of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn order to father your child?\u201d Villiers asked. \u201cMay I say that this is a fascinating conversation? I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever seen adultery planned with such ruthless lack of emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer he were potent in terms of scandal,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cSomeone like you, Villiers. If I were flirting with you, the news would travel to Africa by the end of the month. Harriet, you must know who\u2019s the most scandalous man in England besides Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Villiers isn\u2019t truly scandalous,\u201d Harriet said.</p> <p>Villiers opened his eyes. \u201cYou surprise me, Your Grace. Truly, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why. You never really step beyond the bounds of the commonplace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have children out of wedlock,\u201d Villiers said, looking slightly wounded.</p><p>\u201cWhat nobleman doesn\u2019t?\u201d Harriet retorted.</p><p>\u201cI am lowered by a sudden sense of my own inadequacies,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cNot truly scandalous. Commonplace. My pride is dashed to the ground.\u201d</p><p>Harriet ignored him. \u201cThere are no interesting men in the ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse and worse,\u201d Villiers mumbled.</p><p>\u201cThen who is the most scandalous man in England, to your mind?\u201d Isidore asked.</p> <p>\u201cLord Strange, of course,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cLord Strange?\u201d Isidore asked, knitting her brow. \u201cSurely a lord is part of the ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot Strange,\u201d Villiers said, sipping a glass of water. \u201cStrange is the richest man in England, give or take a shilling or two. At some point the king gave him a title. After all, he keeps rescuing the English economy. Strange could certainly afford to pay for a dukedom if he wished, but he told me that the only reason he accepted the title was because he liked the sound of Lord Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s odd, very intelligent, and truly scandalous,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cNot like the men who claim to be rakes in London but really just trot around after opera singers\u2014\u201d</p><p>Villiers groaned.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s mad for architecture, by all accounts, and has built his own replica of the leaning tower of Pisa,\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the original,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cSurely Strange didn\u2019t gain his interesting reputation by copying defective Italian architecture?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis reputation stems from the motley collection of loose people with whom he lives,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cActors and actresses,\u201d Villiers put in. \u201cThose who work the streets, and those who work the court. Inventors. Scientists. Strange boasts that every interesting person in the country passes through his estate at some point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI no sooner read about someone powerful in government, or at one of the universities, but the gossip columns note that he\u2019s visiting Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did he come by all his money?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cIs he a merchant of some kind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, his father was a perfectly respectable baronet,\u201d Villiers answered, \u201cwith a beaky head, like an old eagle. There was some sort of problem with the family years ago. Could be his mother flew the coop. Or a sister. Perhaps an aunt? At any rate, Strange is a gentleman born and bred, but you\u2019ll never seen him in the normal haunts. He goes where he wishes, while hosting an endless house party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to pay him a visit,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI bought a gorgeous little chess queen that he had sold to a curiosity shop. He promised me the whole set if I gained the courage, as he put it, to pay him a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI shall travel there at once!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but\u2014\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Isidore interrupted. \u201cI wish to make a scandal, and this man appears ideally suited to create one for me. I shall brush shoulders with all those light-skirts and theater people and have an excellent time doing so. And meanwhile I shall flirt madly with my host, thereby creating a scandal that will burn its way straight to my husband\u2019s ears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning to flirt with Strange himself?\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYour reputation could be ruined throughout England, merely by walking through the doors at Fonthill, let alone by flirting with Strange. No one flirts with Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth not?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cIs he hideous? I flirt with everyone! Unless\u2014\u201d she wrinkled her nose \u201c\u2014is he shorter than Lord Beesby? There are certain physiques in which I cannot feign interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, he\u2019s actually quite good-looking,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cThen I shall be the first to flirt with him. In a very public way, naturally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t flirt,\u201d Harriet explained. \u201cFrom what I understand, he beds women but doesn\u2019t toy with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe shall flirt with me,\u201d Isidore announced. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to meet the man who couldn\u2019t be taught to flirt. All one has to do is lead him to think that bedding is a possibility and voil\u00e0!\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed. \u201cI\u2019d love to see your lessons!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you must come with me,\u201d Isidore said, grinning at her.</p><p>\u201cI? I could never do such a thing. You couldn\u2019t really mean to visit Fonthill. It\u2019s just not done. Not done by\u2014by us, I mean.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUs?\u201d Isidore said scornfully. \u201cUs is short foolish men like Beesby, and tall, uncaring men like my husband. What do I care for us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is useful to have a good reputation,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know?\u201d Isidore demanded. \u201cYou left your husband years ago, Jemma. Left him in England and went to Paris\u2014and don\u2019t tell me that you were tending to your reputation all those years! Not when you had parties that even Marie Antoinette hesitated to visit\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThough she always did,\u201d Jemma put in.</p> <p>\u201cBut you have skirted the edges of propriety for years\u2014yes, and well beyond propriety,\u201d Isidore stated. \u201cAnd now you say there is a place in England which you dare not visit? Why? What could happen to you there? Will you be struck by a great desire for an actor and have an affaire with a man from a different class?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Isidore was just gaining her stride. \u201cBecause that is what you are really talking about!\u201d she said, her Italian accent increasing. \u201cYou, all of you, are saying that Strange is scandalous and not one of us because he is a mere baronet\u2019s son. Because he, unlike all of us, is not a duke or a duchess!\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked around. Until that moment she had not realized that they were all duchesses, except for Villiers, who was a duke.</p><p>\u201cApparently, we live in such rarefied atmosphere that we cannot flirt with men who do not have a ducal crest on their carriage doors,\u201d Isidore said scathingly. \u201cYou, Jemma, you who set Paris on its ears with your parties of half-dressed satyrs, you cavil at the idea of Strange because he is not a duke!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe problem is more complicated than you present it, Isidore,\u201d Jemma replied. \u201cIf a man flirts with a duchess, he flirts with her rank. When they feign affection, if you don\u2019t see the foot-licking behind it, you are a fool. No man ever forgets your rank at the moment he kisses you\u2014if your rank is the highest in the land.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will never truly be able to forget your rank either,\u201d Jemma said remorselessly, \u201cunless you are in a room like this one, in which we share the title. The scandal caused by your flirtation will undoubtedly be greater due to Lord Strange\u2019s low birth, but it will temper your pleasure. At any rate, I cannot accompany you. I am done with scandal-broths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Isidore demanded.</p><p>\u201cMy husband requested it of me. Beaumont has many responsibilities in the House of Lords, and it is not helpful when his wife makes herself a byword on the street. And believe me, Isidore, anyone who visits Fonthill will be a byword.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cA byword is precisely what I wish to be. I shall write my mother-in-law immediately and tell her of my plans, and then I\u2019ll write Cosway\u2019s solicitor, and tell him to send me funds at Strange\u2019s house.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn my experience, when a woman has decided to lose her virginity, one can\u2019t stop the impulse,\u201d Villiers said, grinning. \u201cIt would be like trying to dam\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t finish that sentence,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been invited to Strange\u2019s and was planning to travel there after this party,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cbut I can\u2019t take you with me. That is, not unless I put together a party. Or you find a chaperone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave up my chaperone two years ago,\u201d Isidore snapped. \u201cWhen I turned twenty-one and there was no husband in sight, I let my aunt return to Wales. I shall travel alone.\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked at Jemma. \u201cPlease tell your fiery friend that she cannot arrive at Strange\u2019s house unaccompanied and\u2014I might add\u2014uninvited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a duchess, even if I don\u2019t use the title,\u201d Isidore said instantly. \u201cShow me the house that will deny entrance to the Duchess of Cosway!\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrange doesn\u2019t like titles,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to be admitted as Lady Del\u2019Fino.\u201d</p><p>Jemma shook her head. \u201cI cannot accompany you, Isidore. I really can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll take her,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>She heard the words in her own ears with that queer double sense one gets when one hasn\u2019t thought out a comment. It just sprang from her lips.</p><p>There was a moment of dead silence. All three turned to look at her.</p><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>And: \u201cYou mustn\u2019t take Isidore\u2019s starts so seriously,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cShe\u2019ll forget about this scheme of hers by tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Isidore stated.</p><p>\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIf the Duke of Villiers accompanies the two of us we won\u2019t be turned away.\u201d</p><p>Villiers gave a short laugh. \u201cYou must be as feverish as I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t go, darling, because you are not a wastrel like myself,\u201d Jemma said, \u201cnor yet a wastrel-in-training like Isidore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI may not be a wastrel,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not really anything else, either. No one recognizes me, because I\u2019ve lived in the country for so long. Like Isidore, I am a duchess without a duke. But unlike you, no one\u2019s career would be diminished by the tarnishing of my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows you!\u201d Jemma said, horrified. \u201cYou are our own, darling Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a dumpy widow who lived in the country during my marriage and thereafter,\u201d Harriet said flatly. \u201cMy husband committed suicide, and those of the ton who don\u2019t blame me for his death are morbidly sorry for me. No one will pay the faintest attention to whether I go to Strange\u2019s house or not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey don\u2019t blame you for Benjamin\u2019s suicide,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThey blame me. And God knows, they\u2019re right to do it.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a little half-smile. \u201cIt was his life\u2014and his decision. There\u2019s no one to blame.\u201d</p><p>To her shock, he reached out his hand. And she took it. There was no need to say anything else. His hand was surprisingly comforting for someone as sharp-tongued and uncomfortable as she considered Villiers to be.</p><p>\u201cHow long ago did your husband take his life?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cAnd please forgive me for not knowing the answer; I have only been in this country for a few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo and a half years ago,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI am well out of mourning and can attend whatever party I wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I would welcome your company,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine either of you at Fonthill,\u201d Jemma exclaimed. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, Lord Strange\u2019s household is one long bacchanalian orgy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSplendid!\u201d Isidore said immediately. To Harriet\u2019s mind, she looked ready to throw herself straight into the fray.</p><p>Jemma shook her head. \u201cHarriet isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe certainly isn\u2019t dressed for an orgy,\u201d Villiers interjected.</p><p>Harriet looked down at herself. She\u2019d forgotten she was dressed as Mother Goose. But why shouldn\u2019t she be part of an orgy? \u201cI want to go. I am dressed in a nightgown; I\u2019m half way to the bedchamber already.\u201d</p><p>There was a wry smile in Villiers\u2019s eyes.</p><p>\u201cWe can both wear our costumes. I\u2019ll announce myself as an actress.\u201d Isidore had a wicked grin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers was shaking his head. \u201cEveryone dresses like that at Lord Strange\u2019s house and they don\u2019t bother with explanations. He owns the Drury Lane theater, so his house is haunted by actors. I do think it\u2019s a good idea to go in costume,\u201d he said to Harriet. \u201cAnd under a false name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like Isidore\u2019s dress? I couldn\u2019t.\u201d She couldn\u2019t wear a scrap of fabric that barely covered her breasts.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cMore of a disguise than that. As I said, Strange is not fond of titles and he wouldn\u2019t welcome a duchess\u2014or two\u2014on his doorstep.\u201d</p><p>Harriet felt a stab of humiliation. Naturally Villiers didn\u2019t want to see her in a scanty costume like Isidore\u2019s. \u201cWhat are you suggesting? I go as a man?\u201d</p> <p>It was a joke. The word flew from her lips but\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou couldn\u2019t be so brave,\u201d Isidore said laughing.</p><p>\u201cLady Cosway need offer no proof of her courage,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cPlease recall that she just carried a goose into the ballroom while wearing a nightgown. One doubts Saint George exhibited such steel while setting out to fight the dragon. Yet I am not certain...\u201d His eyes rested thoughtfully on her chest.</p><p>Raising her chin, Harriet reached inside her voluminous sleeves and pulled out a rolled woolen stocking. And another. A third and fourth.</p><p>Then she flattened the fabric against her chest. \u201cI think,\u201d she said coolly, \u201cthat I shall look very well as a man.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThe idea has possibilities.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>In Which Sin &amp; Silver Boxes are Itemized and Explained</p><p>January 7, 1784 Fonthill Lord Strange\u2019s Country Estate</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like his blue hair powder,\u201d Eugenia Strange observed. \u201cPapa, are you listening to me? Today his hair is all covered with red powder, and yesterday it was blue. I think he looks better in red. Do you agree, Papa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Justinian Strange, known to his closest friends as Jem, let his eight-year-old daughter\u2019s words flow by him as he frowned down at the architectural drawing on his desk.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know what Augusta did to him, Papa? She locked him in the closet. She said that she was tormented by being surrounded by foolish men and she only allowed him out of the closet when he promised to have her coach relined in yellow silk. It\u2019s going to cost two hundred pounds. But she says that her diamond earrings cost three hundred pounds, and those were given to her by Mr. Cornelys. I asked if she locked him in the closet as well, but she didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect not,\u201d Jem said, looking up from the drawing he had spent the afternoon creating. \u201cEugenia, what do you think of the idea of putting this false floor in the ballroom? It\u2019s quite ingenious, you see.\u201d</p><p>His daughter came around the table and stood at his shoulder. \u201cThis mechanism would cause the platform to rise, Papa?\u201d she said, putting her finger in precisely the place.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because it would be striking,\u201d he said, rather lamely. \u201cThe table would rise suddenly in the air when it was time for supper.\u201d</p><p>But his daughter shook her head. \u201cStriking is not a good reason, Papa. Striking is why Mr. Hodes is wearing blue hair powder, and I assure you that is not a good decision.\u201d</p><p>He drew her little figure against him. \u201cYou\u2019re my Sensibility,\u201d he said into her curls. \u201cDid you spend time with your governess today?\u201d</p> <p>Eugenia didn\u2019t answer, but said, \u201cPapa, did you know that Mrs. Mahon brought fourteen silver filigreed boxes with her? She carries them everywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s the new lead from The Beggar\u2019s Opera, isn\u2019t she? I haven\u2019t met her yet. Whatever does Mrs. Mahon keep inside her fourteen boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove notes. I believe that she has had fourteen protectors, which is a great many. Miss Linnet told me that when she was playing at the Hyde Park Theater a prince gave her ten pairs of diamond earrings, one a night for ten nights. I should very much prefer diamonds to silver boxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA prudent observation,\u201d Jem said, pushing back in his chair. \u201cA box is worth a few pounds, Eugenia, but a diamond might be very expensive. Though I trust you shall never have a protector. I\u2019ll give you any earrings you wish.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia had her mother\u2019s turned-up little nose and sweet brown eyes, but other than that she looked just like him, which meant that she had an awkward face for a child. He glanced at himself in the mirror. He looked the same as always: pale, too gaunt. Clever, he supposed. The kind of hawkish cheekbones he had looked acceptable on a man in his thirties, but rather odd on a young girl. One had to hope that she would grow into them. Or out of them.</p><p>In fact, she looked rather odd today in other respects as well. \u201cWhat are you wearing?\u201d he asked, peering at her.</p><p>\u201cMy riding costume. But I put a silk petticoat underneath it, because I like the way the dark serge looks against this pink. Look, Papa.\u201d She twirled, and sure enough, there was a light flutter at the bottom of her somber habit. \u201cIt makes me feel more festive to be in pink. And I pinned these roses here and the scarf breaks the color, you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did your governess think of that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen each other today. She\u2019s in love, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know. Who is she in love with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, for a long period of time she was in love with you, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Jem blinked. \u201cWith me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she has seen too many plays. She was convinced that you would discover her and I would stop being a motherless child. She\u2019s always saying that I\u2019m a motherless child, and no matter how many times I point out that not having known a mother, I feel no lack of one, she doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Jem could sympathize with the governess. Eugenia\u2019s practical nature had deflated many a dream, including that of a spectacular false floor.</p><p>\u201cBut she finally realized that you weren\u2019t going to notice her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do notice her,\u201d Jem protested. \u201cDon\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t notice when she left for ten days, Papa. What color is her hair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Warren\u2019s hair?\u201d He paused.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever really seen her, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I have, Eugenia!\u201d She was making him feel guilty now. \u201cI hired her, didn\u2019t I? And we\u2019ve had several conversations about your progress in French and mathematics.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe hates mathematics. She has to learn it with me, you know. And she\u2019s not very good at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that she left for ten days?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought I could use a rest from schooling,\u201d Eugenia said serenely. \u201cI would have told you eventually, Papa, but she came back again. And now she is in love with a footman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA much more suitable choice than myself,\u201d Jem said. \u201cWhich footman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe one with beetling back brows,\u201d Eugenia said, leaning against his shoulder.</p><p>Jem pulled her onto his lap and she sat there, long legs dangling almost to the floor, but still as light as a feather. When she was a baby, she seemed so frail that he had been afraid her bones were like a bird\u2019s, with air in the middle. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWill you ever fall in love, Papa?\u201d Eugenia asked, resting her head back against his shoulder so she could look up at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in love with you, poppet,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s enough for one man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe house is full of beautiful women,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cI suppose so.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany of them would like it if you fell in love with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, these kinds of things can\u2019t be arranged on demand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMama would have liked it if you fell in love.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cHow could you possibly know, given that your mother died before you knew her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe and I are very similar,\u201d Eugenia said without hesitation. \u201cShe would like precisely what I like. And I think you would be happier if you had someone of your own, Papa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFalling in love is merely a way of getting something you desire,\u201d Jem told her. \u201cLike a silver box. If I want an ornament, I\u2019ll buy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Mahon probably can\u2019t afford to buy silver boxes,\u201d Eugenia observed. \u201cShe has a beautiful muff, but her shoes are quite shabby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA perfect case in point. She falls in love in order to get herself silver boxes. Luckily, I can afford all the silver boxes I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more to love than that,\u201d Eugenia said, wiggling happily. There was nothing that Eugenia Strange loved more than a lively discussion in which she bent her wits and argumentative skills against those of her papa. \u201cYou are focusing on finances, which is a weakness of yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat should I focus on?\u201d Jem asked cautiously. While he had early on established his child-rearing practices as promoting a clear-headed sensibility in his daughter, he wasn\u2019t sure that he wanted her clarity to include bedroom matters. Not at this age. And certainly not if he had to explain them.</p><p>\u201cLove is a matter of the heart,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cShakespeare says that nothing should stand between true lovers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe agreed that you wouldn\u2019t quote Shakespeare to me for at least a month,\u201d Jem pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t quote. I merely condensed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain that Mrs. Mahon is talking about that kind of love,\u201d he said, more cautiously still.</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, Mrs. Mahon is a concubine. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say that she occasionally plays the concubine,\u201d Eugenia said promptly.</p><p>\u201cWaa\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see her as a character in a play. There\u2019s an old play called Cupid\u2019s Revenge in the library, and a very naughty woman named Bacha says in Act One that she means to \u2018embrace sin as it were a friend, and run to meet it.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Jem started thinking about some suggestions he might give Eugenia\u2019s governess as regards reading materials the next time he saw her.</p><p>But Eugenia didn\u2019t even pause for breath. \u201cMrs. Mahon is embracing sin as a friend. Because really, what else can she do? She must eat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd get more silver boxes,\u201d Jem said, unable to resist.</p><p>\u201cLove is not about sin, precisely,\u201d Eugenia told him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s definitely not about silver boxes. To think about love, we need to consider my governess, in love with the beetle-browed footman. Because love is blind, Papa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a quote! We said no quotes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an aphorism,\u201d she corrected him. \u201cIt happens to have been repeated in many plays, but its provenance is unknown.\u201d</p><p>The good news was that the governess was obviously earning her salary, since his daughter was nimbly using words like provenance. The bad news...\u201cThe only time I ever fell in love was with your mother, poppet. And that only occurred because my parents forced the marriage. So you\u2019ll have to discard the idea of dancing at my wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou simply haven\u2019t met the right woman,\u201d his daughter told him.</p><p>\u201cAs you said, the house is full of beautiful women. Loads of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeauty is not everything, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked down at his daughter\u2019s oddly angular little face. \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to fall in love. It is my observation that only people who wish to fall in love do so. A case in point: your governess developed an affection for me, but transferred it promptly to a hairy footman when the opportunity presented itself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat makes a great deal of sense,\u201d his daughter said, after a moment.</p><p>It was a sad reflection on his life, Jem thought, that he was most thrilled by praise from an eight-year-old.</p><p>\u201cHowever,\u201d Eugenia said, rallying, \u201cperhaps you simply don\u2019t know what you want. That\u2019s a common state of mankind. While the playwright George Chapman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to quote him,\u201d she complained. \u201cI was merely summarizing his argument.\u201d</p><p>Jem shuddered. Who would have thought that his household would be invaded by a child whose prodigious memory had nothing better to do than memorize large swaths of drama? Obviously it was his fault for inviting actors to rehearse their plays at Fonthill. Parenthood was full of these traps, it seemed to him. An obvious decision\u2014have the actors out to Fonthill so he needn\u2019t travel to London for their performances\u2014became fraught with complications once it intersected with Eugenia.</p><p>Meanwhile she hopped off his knee. \u201cI shall devote myself to finding you a mate,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mate!\u201d She paused at the door and looked back at him, a beloved, enchanting, awkward little combination of himself and Sally. \u201cUnless you would like to reconsider the question of my governess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want a wife at all, Eugenia.\u201d</p><p>But she was gone.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>In Which Masculinity is Described and Detailed</p><p>January 7, 1784 The Country Seat of the Duke of Beaumont Overheard at Tea</p><p>\u201cT he key to being male,\u201d the Duke of Villiers said, \u201cis to think like a male. It\u2019s really quite simple.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I would have described it,\u201d Isidore said, laughing. \u201cSimple.\u201d</p><p>Villiers cast her a look. \u201cRibaldry aside, if a person looks male, everyone assumes he is male. If a bystander appears doubtful, say you\u2019re going to take a piss. Men never expect women to know that word. Or say something about your pole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy what?\u201d Harriet asked, and then felt herself turn pink. \u201cOh, of course. I can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d better stuff your breeches in front,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cThereby aligning yourself with the larger part of English males,\u201d Jemma put in.</p><p>\u201cThis is all so vulgar,\u201d Harriet complained.</p><p>\u201cMen are vulgar,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIf you are naturally rarefied and delicate in your thinking, then do not put on a pair of breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can be vulgar,\u201d Harriet said instantly.</p><p>\u201cIf you can manage vulgarity, you\u2019re half way to being male. Men are direct while discussing bedroom matters. We never say that a couple dances in the sheets, or any of those euphemisms women employ. Good old Anglo-Saxon words prevail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about yourself most of the time,\u201d Jemma suggested. \u201cFor a man there is no nobler topic than himself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut,\u201d Harriet said confusedly, \u201cthere won\u2019t really be a myself, if you see what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Villiers eyed her. \u201cLived your life in the country. You\u2019d better be my second nephew Cope. He\u2019s an odd duck who is never seen in town. He has a doting mother: that explains the effeminacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Harriet began and realized the absurdity of what she was saying. \u201cI suppose I will be a trifle effeminate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to figure out how to walk like a man. I can get you fitted up with clothes,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cbut walking is important. Can you smoke?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely not. But I shall enjoy the clothing. I loathe wearing panniers. I\u2019m always bumping into doorways, not to mention people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about your hair?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cIf you cut your hair now, you\u2019ll never be able to wear it high again.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t wear it high now.\u201d She gestured toward her modest arrangement of curls and puffs. \u201cMost of this was added by my maid this morning. My own hair barely reaches my shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery clever,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI keep meaning to try a hair piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt you could do it successfully,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYour hair is such a beautiful gold color. But mine is dull brown, and it\u2019s easy to match.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour hair is not dull!\u201d</p><p>Harriet shrugged. \u201cWho would know, what with the hot iron and crimping and powdering? I shall positively relish being male if it means I could stop trying to straighten my hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen do not straighten nor curl their hair,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>\u201cSome do,\u201d Isidore put in. \u201cI am quite certain that Saint Albans curls his hair. And he wears lip color as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do this, you\u2019re going to do it right. And that means you\u2019ll be my creation.\u201d</p> <p>Jemma laughed. \u201cCreated in Villiers\u2019s image: you\u2019re going to be a huge success, Harriet!\u201d</p><p>Harriet bit her lip. The idea of being Villiers\u2019s creation, after the time when she tried to seduce him and he rejected her, was mortifying.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one remembering that night. In the depths of his black eyes there was a mocking spark that said: you can\u2019t do it. After all, when she kissed him in the carriage, he had done something so shocking that she actually slapped him. He knew her to be a conservative, tiresome country woman.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need to go to these extremes,\u201d he said now. \u201cWe could simply dress you as Isidore\u2019s elderly aunt from the country. You\u2019d make a fine chaperone and no one would question you.\u201d</p><p>The anger in Harriet\u2019s chest felt like fire. She had played the fool when she tried to seduce Villiers, and he had been right to scorn her. Benjamin had been his closest friend, and she had kissed him in a misguided impulse to make Benjamin notice his wife.</p><p>But she was no elderly aunt from the country.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t think I\u2019ll have the slightest problem playing a man,\u201d she said. \u201cI shall merely remember to rearrange my breeches in front at least once an hour, thereby drawing attention to the padding I carefully placed there in the morning, and I\u2019ll blend in perfectly.\u201d She let her eyes slide below his waist.</p><p>\u201cA low blow,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cLow indeed!\u201d Isidore crowed.</p><p>\u201cLucky I brought my tailor with me,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou need everything from boots to periwigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can be measured for boots and I\u2019ll send to London for them,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI must return to Berrow for quarter sessions before I can travel to Fonthill,\u201d Harriet said with a frown.</p><p>Villiers raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cA sot rules the shire court in my village,\u201d Harriet told him. \u201cSo we abide by the old customs. He sleeps off the brandy of the night before and I make the rulings. Otherwise he simply gives everyone hard labor, no matter the offense or the truth of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the current duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s eleven years old, and at Eton,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cYou must know of his mother, Lady Brewyn,\u201d Jemma put in. \u201cShe is currently living in Paris with a man twenty years her junior. A cheerful woman, by all accounts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking care of the estate for my nephew,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cand that includes the shire court, at least until he is of age or the current judge is replaced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall wait for you to return from the quarter sessions,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cMeanwhile, I\u2019ll send a letter to my husband declaring my visit to Strange. I\u2019m sure it takes a while to return from Africa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am immensely amused by this scheme,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing better than an occasional act of folly,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou would be the better for it yourself, Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that His Grace lies there recovering from a duel suggests that acts of folly are second nature,\u201d Harriet said gently.</p><p>Then she smiled at the narrowed eyes of Villiers\u2014and the amused eyes of Jemma.</p><p>She felt like a new Harriet.</p><p>Not a widow.</p><p>Not tedious.</p><p>A wild Harriet, a Harriet who engaged in folly, a Harriet who saw life as a challenge, not a failure.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Justice By Duchess, Part Two</p><p>February 1, 1784 Shire Court The Duchy of Berrow Honorable Reginald Truder, presiding</p><p>\u201cI f I understand you correctly, Mr. Burch, the defendant pretended to be a barber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then he stole my fish!\u201d Mr. Burch said, keeping his eyes imploringly on the duchess. He\u2019d heard as how she was the only one who saw to it that justice was done.</p><p>\u201cYour fish,\u201d the duchess said.</p><p>\u201cWhat fish? What fish?\u201d barked the judge. He had deeply flushed cheeks and a beak of a nose. He looked more like a convict with a headache rather than a judge.</p><p>\u201cIt was the fish that he pretended the haberdasher sent to my wife,\u201d Mr. Burch said. He skewed his eyes toward the duchess again. Anyone could tell that she was the only one really listening; the judge was swilling out of a flask again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the fish,\u201d Mr. Burch continued. \u201cFirst he pretended to be a barber and gained entrance to my house. Then he stole a silver cup that my wife had sent over from the silversmith, by pretending that he\u2019d come to deliver the fish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it wasn\u2019t your fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it was\u2014I suppose it was his fish. He came back and took the fish anyway, telling my wife that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHard labor,\u201d the judge stated, glaring around the court.</p><p>The duchess put a hand on his arm. She spoke quietly, but Tom Burch still heard her. \u201cI\u2019m just getting to the bottom of it, Reginald.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like fish,\u201d he said.</p><p>She patted him again and said, \u201cSo we can discount the theft of the fish, Mr. Burch, because the defendant sent you the fish, and then took it back again. But that was a stratagem to allow him to gain access to your house and steal your silver cup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was caught with it!\u201d Mr. Burch said triumphantly. \u201cCaught red-handed!

The colonies are at war, remember? We don\u2019t transport people there anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen drop him in the sea offshore,\u201d the judge said. \u201cHe can swim over to them tarnishing Americans, most of \u2019em transported from this county anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo weeks hard labor,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cAnd Mr. Sibble, the only reason you\u2019re not facing imprisonment this time is because the cup was recovered.

But life is not a game, Mr. Sibble.\u201d</p> <p>There was a moment of silence in the court.</p><p>\u201cIf you appear again in this shire court, you will face imprisonment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor life,\u201d the judge added thirstily.</p><p>The constable hauled Sibble away, and the duchess turned to Mr. Burch. \u201cIt sounds as if you\u2019ve had a distressing time of it, Mr. Burch. I want to commend you on your restraint in the face of these indignities.\u201d</p><p>Tom Burch stood up taller. Everyone had been hooting, saying he was a fool because of losing his silver cup due to a fish. But the Duchess of Berrow thought he\u2019d showed restraint.</p><p>He put on his hat and marched out of the court. She wasn\u2019t a real judge, of course. But she was what they\u2019d got in Berrow, and it was better than nothing.</p> <p>Everyone nodded to him on the way out.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>In Which Strange Guests Arrive at Lord Strange\u2019s House</p><p>February 5, 1784 Fonthill Lord Strange\u2019s Country Estate</p><p>L ord Strange never managed to quite ignore his butler, although he frequently tried. Povy felt the need to make announcements three or four times a day, and although Jem had frequently pointed out that he had no interest in household matters, the butler persisted in informing him.</p><p>So Jem didn\u2019t look up when he heard Povy\u2019s tread in the hallway, and merely reminded himself to install a latch on the inside of the door as the butler came to a halt before his desk.</p><p>\u201cVisitors have arrived, my lord. Perhaps you might wish to greet them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll greet them this evening, as usual.\u201d He\u2019d woken up in the middle of the night with two ideas simultaneously: one for a bridge suspension system, and the other for a madrigal. He had the bridge drawn in charcoal, and the madrigal in four parts and on the whole, the madrigal was the success. The bridge looked very pretty, but he rather thought the weight-bearing beams might be overburdened. Perhaps if he lowered the arch itself...</p> <p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers has arrived,\u201d Povy announced.</p><p>\u201cHe likes the velvet suite, doesn\u2019t he? Relishes all that frivolous splendor. Tell him I\u2019ll see him at supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is accompanied by the Duchess of Cosway.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked up. \u201cWho the hell is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, the Duchess of Cosway is some sixty years of age and lives a retired life in Colchester.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Jem said, grinning. \u201cI gather that Villiers\u2019s companion is not an antique countrywoman?\u201d</p><p>Povy coughed. \u201cIt is remotely possible that the young woman in question is the wife of the current Duke of Cosway, son of the aforementioned duchess. I understand that he contracted marriage at a very early age, but since he left the country thereafter, Debrett\u2019s does not credit the marriage as having reached full sovereignty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot consummated, in other words,\u201d Jem said, tracing the line under the bridge again.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you or don\u2019t you think this young woman is the bride-to-be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut equally possible that Villiers has brought a fancy piece with him, gusseted up like a Christmas lamb. I will greet the supposed duchess at supper as well, Povy. Put Villiers and the young woman in adjoining rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, your lordship. They are accompanied by a young man whom the duke introduced as a relative, Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever heard of him either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is quite young,\u201d Povy said. It was evident in his tone that Povy considered the young man too young for the exuberant nature of a Strange house party.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not our problem, Povy. Has my new secretary, Miss DesJardins, settled in yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe young Frenchwoman seems quite comfortable, my lord. She is planning an entertainment for tomorrow. Something called a Tahitian Feast of Venus.\u201d</p><p>Jem started smiling. \u201cI knew she would liven up our entertainments. They\u2019ve been deadly dull lately. Tahitian as in the country of Tahiti?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy sense would be that there is little connection, except perhaps that the land of Tahiti is a very warm country, which encourages lack of clothing,\u201d Povy said repressively. \u201cMiss DesJardins has requested that the fires in the South Ballroom be lit to their highest capacity and kept there.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cYou might want to encourage the Duke of Villiers to confine his relative to his quarters tomorrow. Miss DesJardins is talking of twelve virgins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwelve?\u201d Jem said, barking with laughter again. \u201cShe must be trafficking in miracles. There isn\u2019t one in the house!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMr. Cope...\u201d Povy began.</p><p>Jem narrowed his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThe lad has a remarkably innocent face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInnocence is a time of life, not an irrevocable blot.\u201d</p><p>But Povy had known his master for many years, and he gave him a stern look. \u201cMr. Cope is not prepared for the Feast of Venus.\u201d</p><p>Jem got up with a sigh. \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll come down. I might as well assess this child for myself. What a fool Villiers is, to bring an innocent to my house. Povy, you do remember Wilkinson, don\u2019t you? He had an innocent face, but my word!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very different kind of look in Wilkinson\u2019s face,\u201d Povy said.</p><p>Jem hated to leave his work, but he paid Povy a prince\u2019s ransom just to know this sort of thing. His house sometimes shook from sins collected under its roof, but the one thing he could not and would not tolerate was the defilement of innocence. No young woman played a Tahitian virgin in his house unless she did it for pleasure. And no Mr. Cope was going to lose his wide-eyed purity unless he wished to.</p><p>Though honestly, he couldn\u2019t remember the last young man whom he thought needed shielding. Villiers\u2019s young relative was probably straining at the leash.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t there a time of life when you would have lusted to see a feast of Tahitian virgins, Povy?\u201d he asked, leaving the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Povy said repressively.</p><p>That seemed to answer that, so Jem continued down the stairs.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later he entered the small Rose Salon without being announced, paused for a moment to survey his visitors, and then swore under his breath. Povy was an intelligent, canny miracle and he should never have doubted him.</p><p>There was only one word for Mr. Cope: adorable. He had curly brown hair, pulled into a simple pigtail at his neck, with just a dusting of powder. He wore a beautiful coat; he could hardly be Villiers\u2019s relative without exhibiting a fine sense of style. But his eyes gave him away. They were exquisite, and not just because of their color and a fringe of lash that could have graced a princess. They were\u2014fresh.</p> <p>Jem shot Villiers a look through narrowed eyes. There was something peculiar about this. For one thing, Villiers wasn\u2019t sleeping with the woman he\u2019d dragged along with him, the supposed Duchess of Cosway, the duchess who didn\u2019t exist. She was a pretty piece, all right, as glittering and sultry as a peacock, but Villiers was talking to her without the faintest desire in his eye.</p><p>On the other hand, Jem wasn\u2019t sure that Villiers could feel desire for anyone, not if he were as ill as he looked. The man had to have lost three stone.</p><p>Mr. Cope was standing close to Villiers, with his eyes as round as saucers, staring at a statue Jem had shipped from Crete on an impulse. That kiss between Mars and Venus was on the risqu\u00e9 side. Of course, they were married (mythologically speaking). But the whole question of marital virtue was somewhat offset by the fact that Mars was wearing a helmet\u2014but nothing else.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d Jem said, walking forward.</p><p>The duke turned around and swept him a bow. Even gaunt as Villiers was, he looked every inch of duke.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019d better get you in bed,\u201d Jem said by way of greeting. He\u2019d heard Villiers was ill, but hadn\u2019t realized how close he came to death. It gave him a queer feeling, so Jem said roughly, \u201cYou look like hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m better than I was. But I\u2019m not supposed to play chess, so I\u2019m relying on you and your dubious charms to entertain me, Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to entertain yourself,\u201d Jem said, turning to the so-called duchess and bowing. \u201cGood morning, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Instantly he saw that she was a duchess. A rather gaudy one, in an Italian style, but he knew instantly that he was looking at the Duchess of Cosway. Or perhaps the future Duchess of Cosway was the proper terminology.</p><p>It was a miracle that she managed to curtsy, given that her traveling dress appeared to have been sewed onto her body.</p><p>\u201cYou do me too much honor,\u201d Jem said with patent insincerity. This was not the sort of guest he enjoyed. He disliked the way that titles, especially the higher-up ones, seemed to give their holders the right to behave like despicable fools. She would be fussy, and shocked, and likely stamp out in high dudgeon in a day or so.</p> <p>But then she smiled at him, a lush armful of warm Italian skin and sweet ruby mouth, and he changed his mind. There was something wicked about that mouth, a hint of a kiss or a kiss-to-be-taken hanging in the corner.</p><p>She may be a virgin, but she didn\u2019t look shockable.</p><p>Mr. Cope, on the other hand, was so new-fledged that he bobbed his bow like a schoolboy.</p><p>Jem was rarely shocked by life, but he was conscious of a little surprise now. In the course of throwing his house open to anyone he (and Povy) deemed interesting, he had seen all sorts of desire. Very little of it interested him\u2014and none of it surprised him.</p><p>But he was surprised now. Surprised by a little surge of interest in himself\u2014shamefully\u2014for Mr. Cope. For a stripling with big eyes and not even a sign of a beard. For a male. For God\u2019s sake, Jem thought with disgust. If this is getting old, I want nothing to do with it.</p><p>And he made a mental note to stay far away from Cope.</p><p>\u201cJust how old is that youth you\u2019ve brought along?\u201d he managed to ask Villiers sotto voce, a few moments later.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-two,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI know he looks like a cherub, but don\u2019t be fooled, Strange.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hardened reprobate. Plays the innocent because it pulls the ladies. Wait til you see him with them. They fall over him screaming. Fall backwards, really. He\u2019s a nice lad, though, and doesn\u2019t take advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry another one,\u201d Jem said, his voice hardening. \u201cThis house may be a byword, Villiers, but I\u2019ll thank you to pack him up and send him home to his mother.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s eyes narrowed dangerously, but Jem had never backed down to any duke\u2019s desires, and he wouldn\u2019t now. Especially to one of the few men in England whom he thought of as being of his own weight intellectually.</p><p>\u201cI dislike the idea that my house is being treated as some sort of proving ground for innocents.\u201d</p><p>There was a thread of anger\u2014and an odd strain of amusement\u2014in Villiers\u2019s voice. \u201cAll right, he\u2019s not a rakehell. Far from it. But he is twenty-two. And he\u2019s got as much right as anyone else to a full life. Surely you\u2019d be the first to say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean? What\u2019s his life been up til now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis mother is eccentric,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe lives in the country and has kept him close by her side.\u201d</p><p>Jem glanced over at Cope. He was standing with the duchess as they examined the intertwined bodies of Venus and Mars. The marble cleverly blended into one piece during the crucial encounter. The corner of his mouth quirked as he saw Mr. Cope point to the relevant spot.</p><p>Villiers followed his gaze. \u201cHe\u2019s a willing learner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you rescue him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething of the sort. I promised him a look at life that wouldn\u2019t hurt him. He\u2019s twenty-two, and\u2014I hardly need to say it\u2014a virgin. I could have taken him to a brothel in London, but I didn\u2019t want that dewy look of his dashed when he had to hand over coins to the lass of his choice.\u201d</p><p>Jem didn\u2019t like the reasoning. Yet he couldn\u2019t deny but that it made sense. If he had a son, he wouldn\u2019t want him in a brothel either.</p><p>\u201cThe same diseases are to be found here as elsewhere,\u201d he said, a warning in his voice.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll trust you to steer him the right direction, Strange.\u201d Villiers made a sour face. \u201cThe trip took more out of me than I expected. My Scottish devil of a doctor told me not to travel, but I overruled him. And now I think he was likely right.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s face was a pallid white, with deep bruises under his eyes. Jem jerked his head at Povy. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay in bed,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ll watch over your fledgling. And what of that duchess? Or should I say, half-duchess? Am I to watch over her as well?\u201d</p><p>Villiers gave him a faint smile. \u201cYou might want to warn your guests she\u2019s in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA wild one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma had a Twelfth Night party\u2014do you know the Duchess of Beaumont?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI met her once. Dared her to come visit, but she didn\u2019t have the backbone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr perhaps the desire,\u201d Villiers said mildly. \u201cNot everyone thinks that an invitation to your house is a ticket to Paradise, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you succumbed.\u201d And he meant it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThe duchess had all the married men at Jemma\u2019s party running in little circles around her.

He didn\u2019t want sympathy. \u201cYou deserved every moment, playing the fool with a rapier. We\u2019re too old for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not allowed to play chess,\u201d Villiers said, sounding as if he were announcing a ritual castration.</p><p>\u201cSays who?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDr. Treglown, the Scottish devil who saved my life. I was in and out of a fever for months, and apparently I did a lot of raving about chess. He says I have to take a break and rest my brain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, so a visit to the house of tarnished angels is a perfect convalescence. Though I still don\u2019t quite understand why you dragged along those two, I\u2019ll take care of them for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut them in adjoining chambers,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked at him. \u201cI thought it was impossible to shock you,\u201d he observed. \u201cI\u2019m off to bed, if you please.\u201d</p><p>Povy ushered him away and Jem stood for a moment, staring at the odd couple still looking at the statue. They were no longer examining the salacious point at which female marble blended into male. Instead, Mr. Cope was running his finger down the arch of Venus\u2019s neck.</p><p>It was one of Jem\u2019s favorite aspects of the statue. Venus had her head thrown back, her face a mixture of desire, joy, and despair. The genius who sculpted it had captured, to Jem\u2019s mind, the joy\u2014and the grief\u2014of marriage. Venus\u2019s head fell back, her body ravished by a pleasure she couldn\u2019t control and somewhat resented.</p><p>Jem wrenched his eyes away from Mr. Cope\u2019s slender finger. Really, it was time he took a mistress again.</p><p>He really meant it: If this oddness was part of growing old, he wanted nothing to do with it.</p> <p>Chapter Eight</p><p>The Definition of Marital Success</p><p>The same day Before dinner</p><p>H arriet couldn\u2019t stop giggling, once she was alone in her bedchamber. She\u2019d done it! She\u2019d really done it! She had bowed to Lord Strange, and murmured something in as gruff a voice as she could manage, and he had believed her to be male. She didn\u2019t see even a flicker of disbelief in his eyes.</p><p>The first moment she saw him, she thought the jig was up. She always considered Villiers rather terrifyingly intelligent, with his heavy-lidded eyes and sardonic comments.</p><p>But Villiers was nothing compared to Strange. Strange had a lean face that had seen use, but the sardonic lines by his mouth only emphasized the beauty of his bones, the banked sensuality of his eyes, the long body that reminded her of the coiled energy of a greyhound. Put together with the fierce intelligence in his eyes, and the charm...God, he had charm.</p><p>But it was his intelligence that made him frightening. No wonder Villiers had called him a genius. He looked like one. And yet\u2014he hadn\u2019t seen through her disguise!</p><p>She dropped to the bed, and froze for a moment before she realized that the odd feeling in her legs was due to her breeches.</p> <p>She lay back and swung her legs into the air. It was utterly bizarre to see her legs in the open like this. She never looked at herself in a glass unless she was wearing a corset, camisole, panniers, petticoats, and a gown on top. Somewhere under there were her legs, one had to suppose.</p><p>But now, wearing this ridiculous male attire, they were exposed. Thanks to Villiers, who had ordered her an array of clothing fit for a young prince, her breeches were closely shaped to her leg, ending at the knee. They buttoned on the outside, and had a closure in the front that made her laugh. Even her knees were entirely visible, clad in pale, violet-colored stockings.</p><p>Actually, her legs looked shapely and strong. The truth was that while Harriet always felt smothered in women\u2019s clothing, she was starting to think that she looked just right in breeches. Her body was a kind built for endurance, with muscles in her legs that came from the way she walked for miles after breakfast.</p><p>Benjamin never liked that habit. He preferred to see her reclining on a couch, waiting to hear about his latest chess match. Not strolling over to see how the sow was faring with her new piglets. \u201cThat\u2019s not duchess\u2019s work,\u201d he would tell her. But then he would laugh. Benjamin was a great laugher. He never truly hated her penchant for walking. Nor her legs.</p><p>Though come to think of it, her husband had likely never seen her legs this clearly.</p><p>The adjoining door opened and Harriet sat up so fast that her head spun.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just me,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I should have knocked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo come in,\u201d Harriet said, lying back again. \u201cI\u2019m admiring my breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are lovely,\u201d Isidore said, wandering into the room. \u201cBut if I were playing the man I would want oval-shaped knee buckles. Oh\u2014and perhaps knee ribbands.\u201d</p><p>Harriet wrinkled her nose. \u201cToo feminine. I have to look as masculine as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u2018The odd thing is, Harriet, that you do look masculine. I mean that you look perfectly feminine and delectable in a gown, but there\u2019s something, oh, out-doors-ish about you at the moment. I really wouldn\u2019t guess that you were a woman in a man\u2019s costume. I wonder if I could get away with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Your features are far too delicate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are yours,\u201d Isidore persisted. \u201cYou have a little pointed chin, and those big eyes. How on earth did you get your brows to look so dark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers\u2019s valet drew them on,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHis name is Finchley, and he\u2019s going to help me dress when necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt adds a masculine touch,\u201d Isidore said. She peered closer. \u201cDid he do something to your chin as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put some dots here and there that are supposed to make me look as if I have a beard coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess successful,\u201d Isidore announced. \u201cThough it looks as if you might have spots, which would make sense if you\u2019re a very young man.\u201d</p><p>Harriet decided to forego the nearly-beard spots in the future.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to wear tonight?\u201d Isidore enquired. \u201cI was so disappointed that there weren\u2019t any Paphians languishing around the entranceway, weren\u2019t you? I mean, there was that statue, but given that the bottom half was all one blob of marble, you couldn\u2019t really see the relevant bits.\u201d</p><p>Harriet thought the relevant bit was the look on Venus\u2019s face, but she didn\u2019t say so. Isidore, after all, was a virgin. Which brought her to something she wanted to say. She propped herself up on her elbow.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t really thinking of bedding someone, are you, Isidore?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might,\u201d Isidore said, pinching her cheek to make it a bit pinker. \u201cIf there is someone truly delectable. Let\u2019s face it: since I\u2019m here, ruining my reputation, I might as well have fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Harriet said, catching Isidore\u2019s eye. \u201cI\u2019ve been married before, and I know what I\u2019m talking about. Please don\u2019t do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Isidore turned around, hands on her hips, and there was a flash of genuine rage in her eyes. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me that my husband has been parading around foreign parts like some sort of eunuch.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEunuch?\u201d Harriet said, before she realized what Isidore was talking about.</p><p>Isidore gave her a wry smile. \u201cThe truth is that you are far more innocent than I am, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps about some things, but I know marriage. I understand it. Unfair though it may be, your husband will be sorely disappointed if he finds you are not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he interrupts his travels long enough to return and discover the state of my body,\u201d Isidore pointed out. \u201cAt this rate I\u2019ll be a withered virgin of eighty.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet shook her head. \u201cI think your instinct is right, and the dowager duchess will force her son to return. But in the longer sense, what you really want is a successful marriage. Chastity is a very good way to start it on the right foot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one is chaste in their marriages these days,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cLook at Jemma.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma was entirely faithful to Beaumont until she interrupted him making love to his mistress. And I believe she was chaste for years when she first moved to Paris, and was waiting for him to fetch her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he didn\u2019t fetch her, did he? She was his virgin bride, and he didn\u2019t give a damn. Which just shows that your rosy idea of marriage is far from the reality of things.\u201d</p><p>Harriet didn\u2019t think anyone who had survived her own particular marriage could have a rosy view. \u201cJemma gave it her best possible try. If you come to the marriage with experience, you risk not having a chance at success. And then you might wish that you had.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on how you classify success,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI define a successful marriage as one in which people live together without too much acrimony, long enough to have children. I would like that. A successful marriage is not necessarily one in which there is no scandal. I would judge Beaumont and Jemma to have a very successful marriage, for instance, although she disappoints me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow so?\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s lip curled. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell her, but it\u2019s paltry the way she has bowed to her husband\u2019s demands. If she wants to play chess with Strange, she should have accompanied us. I am not one to accede to foolish commands.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked up at the ceiling. It was impossible to explain the dance of will and compromise that had been her experience of marriage.</p><p>\u201cWas your marriage a success?\u201d Isidore asked, uncannily echoing Harriet\u2019s own thoughts.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s maid, Lucille, pushed open the door. \u201cI need to get you into pantaloons for this evening, Your Grace,\u201d she said, looking faintly harassed. \u201cMr. Finchley, the duke\u2019s valet, has given me a list of what you should wear. He\u2019ll be stopping by later to arrange your cravat.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you!\u201d Isidore said, nipping back into her own chamber. Leaving Harriet with her question. Was your marriage a success?</p><p>She and Benjamin had no children. Her mother-in-law saw it as a utter failure on those grounds alone.</p><p>Then her husband committed suicide. That fact would make most of London unhesitatingly condemn her marriage as a failure. Surely a good wife, a beloved wife, would be enough to keep a man from shooting himself.</p><p>But...</p><p>Life was so much more complex than markers of that type. Was your marriage a success?</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered to the empty air.</p><p>I loved Benjamin. And he loved me.</p><p>He didn\u2019t love me enough to live. But he loved me. Surely that was the definition of marital success?</p> <p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Of Mathematical Angles and Men in Flesh-colored Silk</p><p>J em was unable to focus on his structural drawings when he returned to his study, and so spent a grueling three hours with one of his secretaries, the one in charge of foreign investments. He agreed to sell a grove of Italian olive trees, confirmed the purchase of two Flemish brigantines (to be used to haul cotton from the East Indies to his cotton mills), signed a sharp letter addressed to the House of Lords complaining of increasing privateer action, and approved expenditures of twelve hundred pounds in the next year towards armor-plating his trading vessels.</p><p>He finally retreated to his chamber with a headache. After a quick bath, he pulled on some clothing and went to the nursery.</p><p>The west wing of the house was, as always, locked away from the greater house. At two o\u2019clock every afternoon, all doors leading that wing were locked and guarded, forestalling the possibility that a drunken guest might wander toward the nursery in a state of disarray or worse.</p><p>As he approached, the footman standing at the door bowed and unlocked the door. He nodded at him, and then remembered Eugenia\u2019s comment. Did he really not observe people? The footman had a rather shaggy peruke, a bovine look, sweet eyes.</p><p>\u201cIs your name Roberts?\u201d he asked, knowing it wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJames, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJames,\u201d he said, committing it to memory. James: the bovine footman with the bedraggled peruke.</p><p>Eugenia was sitting in front of the fire, skirts spread out on all sides. \u201cMay I come downstairs?\u201d she asked, jumping to her feet. \u201cLook, Papa!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said automatically, coming over to look. \u201cWhat are you drawing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ciphering,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much fun, Papa. I learned it in this book. If you take an angle here, and add that outside one together, and divide it by this, it ends up at 360. And it does that over and over. Isn\u2019t that fascinating? I\u2019m trying to figure out what else comes to 360.\u201d</p><p>Jem squatted down. She was working on the same angles he\u2019d been playing with as bridge supports. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting,\u201d he told her. \u201cHere\u2019s another fun thing. You take a five-sided shape.\u201d He quickly drew it on her foolscap. \u201cNow extend all the angles. What do you think the sum of all five of these outside angles will be?\u201d</p><p>\u201c360?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood guess. Try it out and see.\u201d</p><p>She bent her head over the paper, clumsily moving the brass protractor into place.</p><p>Jem made a mental note to have a protractor made to her measure. \u201cWhere\u2019s your governess, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told her she could go have her supper downstairs,\u201d Eugenia said absently. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like angles. She\u2019ll be back upstairs in a while. She\u2019s reading me Chapman\u2019s Homer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Iliad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe finished that. It\u2019s the Odyssey, and I like it much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are frightening sometimes, Eugenia. Do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you say so, Papa,\u201d Eugenia replied, with complete unconcern in her voice.</p><p>He walked out wondering, once again, whether he ought to have\u2014or ought to now\u2014provide a playmate for his daughter. She never showed any signs of loneliness, but surely children were supposed to play, not sit around splicing angles for fun. But then, she seemed happy.</p><p>And, in truth, providing a playmate, an appropriate playmate, would mean sending Eugenia away, to school or to a relative. Parents of a properly brought up little gentlewoman would never allow their daughter to visit Fonthill.</p><p>The idea of sending her away was impossible, and he shook it off. Still...it was a nagging thought. Eugenia was the dearest person in the world to him. Why was he raising her here? A better man would turn himself into a model of ethical standards, dismiss all his guests and half of the servants, and replace them with puritanical types with pinched noses and pure souls. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The problem was that he didn\u2019t value moral qualities as he should. In fact, he thought they were damned boring.</p><p>It was a conundrum and made him wish that Sally hadn\u2019t died. If he had a good woman around Fonthill, it would all be easier. Women were so good at lecturing. Sally could lecture him into obedience, and he would complain to the fellows behind her back, and that would be that.</p><p>The picture of English marriage.</p><p>The real problem was that he was free to please himself. Pleasure was vulgar\u2014and generally wicked\u2014but so interesting.</p> <p>As he entered his study, Povy came forward to give him his nightly report. Jem threw himself into an armchair and gratefully took the glass of wine handed him by a footman.</p><p>It was his indulgence and (if he admitted it) one of his passions. He drank sparingly. But he began most evenings with a small glass of the very best wine. He raised an eyebrow at Povy.</p><p>\u201cA French claret from Bertin du Rocheret. I will serve it with the beef. The menu tonight: turtle Madeira soup, followed by relev\u00e9 de poisson, or salmon in champagne. To be followed by roast beef, lamp chops, capons with a b\u00e9chamel sauce, and a plate of roast goslings with pur\u00e9ed apples.\u201d</p><p>Jem nodded.</p><p>Povy turned to another piece of foolscap, though he had it memorized. \u201cSome comments on a few guests. Mrs. Sandhurst left this morning, sending you her most fervent gratitude. She wished to speak to you herself, but I indicated that it wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p> <p>Jem raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed, I believe that she returns to London to seek consultation with an accoucheur; the child is hardly imminent, but naturally she will need to inform Mr. Sandhurst of the event.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr not,\u201d Jem said. \u201cDid she leave Troubridge behind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Povy said. \u201cTroubridge declared himself desol\u00e9, but he spent the day hunting with one of the Graces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo far this sounds terribly tedious.\u201d</p><p>Povy turned the page. \u201cMiss Moll Davis and Mr. Cooling are practicing their performance of The Five Hours\u2019 Adventure. Monsieur Batelier, Sir Carteret, and Mr. Pedley stay on.\u201d He looked up. \u201cI believe that Sir Carteret may be drawing Mr. Pedley into an unlikely and improvident endeavor, something to do with the Committee of Tangier.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s of age,\u201d Jem said. \u201cAre the Oxford scholars still here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there was a most lively discussion of glass-making at breakfast, and then they all repaired to the dairy, which has been temporarily transformed into a glass-blowing studio. They are trying the effect of adding lead oxide in combination with a touch of copper. The Spanish ambassador was much taken by the idea, and has spent the day with them in the dairy, though he will be at the Game tonight, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Jem said, feeling a spark of interest. \u201cI shall stop by the creamery tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you know, the commissioner of the navy brought in three wagonloads of prize goods last week; the Duke of Wintersall wrote with the request that he bring the commissioner to the Game in the near future. I took the liberty of replying in the affirmative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Jem said. These days the Game\u2014the heart of his house party\u2014tended to populate itself.</p><p>\u201cTonight is a simple dinner, with a mere thirty-three to sit,\u201d Povy said, turning the page. \u201cYour valet has laid out your flowered tabby vest and the coat with gold lace at the wrists.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems rather grand,\u201d Jem said, watching the wine swirl in his glass.</p><p>\u201cWe have a duke and a duchess in the house,\u201d Povy said with mild reproach. \u201cAlthough His Grace the Duke of Villiers is feeling poorly and won\u2019t join us. He doesn\u2019t have a fever, but is much pulled. I asked the cook to make him an eau de poulet rafraichissant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChicken tea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the unwell, there is nothing better,\u201d Povy said. \u201cBeetroot leaves, yellow lettuce and chicken, skimmed of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are a miracle of knowledge, Povy.\u201d</p><p>Povy put aside his book and Jem finished his wine. At the end of their evening talks, Povy generally added a few valuable particulars about his guests, tips that he had not committed to paper. But tonight he hesitated.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you are undecided about something,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cI am not entirely comfortable with Mr. Cope\u2019s presence at Fonthill. Your Grace has always ensured that no innocence is besmirched under your roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI share your concern,\u201d Jem said, swallowing the last few drops, \u201cbut I promised Villiers I would look out for him, and I will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe that he might find himself an object of interest to many,\u201d Povy said.</p><p>Jem raised his eyes. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat particular kind of near-feminine beauty will find many admirers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall watch my little chicken carefully then,\u201d Jem murmured. \u201cDamn Villiers for bringing him here anyway.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cVilliers seems to want his ward introduced to the pleasures of female company, but...\u201d</p><p>Povy didn\u2019t blink an eye. \u201cIt may be that Mr. Cope has another inclination.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ensure that he makes his own choices,\u201d Jem said, hating the fact that even the slightest hint of desire had crossed his mind when he saw this Cope. It was enough to make him dislike the man, but that was unfair.</p><p>\u201cThe Duchess of Cosway\u2019s reasons for visiting Fonthill were initially unclear to me,\u201d Povy said, with just a hint of frustration in his voice.</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me, Povy, you do. I thought nothing in the human heart was unclear to you.\u201d</p><p>Povy allowed himself a small smile. \u201cHowever, I now surmise that she intends to create a scandal, thus drawing her husband back to this country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Jem nodded. \u201cIt will probably work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe sent out some twenty letters this afternoon, asking me to frank all of them for you. Since she could easily have had her traveling companion, the Duke of Villiers, frank those letters, I gather she wanted your stamp on the letters, thus establishing her residence at Fonthill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, the scandal-broth brewing in this house ought to be good for something,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIs that it, Povy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA final thought about your new secretary, Miss Caroline DesJardins. I am slightly worried that her ideas may be too outr\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the entertainment tomorrow night, she is employing several footmen\u2014those with the better physiques\u2014as \u2018primitive men.\u2019\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what does that entail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFlesh-colored silk with a small apron of fig leaves embroidered on the front.\u201d</p><p>Jem barked with laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe silk is sewn to fit the body with the utmost exactitude,\u201d Povy said a bit gloomily. \u201cThe effect is indelicate, to say the least.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall look forward to it,\u201d Jem said, chuckling. \u201cNo, I think that Miss DesJardins is a welcome addition to the household, Povy. I loved her stories of the f\u00eates she designed in Paris for the Duchess of Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>Povy bowed and retired. Jem made his way upstairs to put on the suit with gold lace at the wrists (for he never disobeyed Povy), thinking all the time of wild French designers and errant duchesses. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Ten</p><p>In Which Plans are Made for Lord Strange\u2019s Enticement</p><p>H arriet looked at herself in the glass and felt as if she\u2019d drunk too much champagne. Staring back at her was a beautiful young man. Really. Beautiful. He was wearing a velvet jacket of a dark lilac, over which spilled the finest cream-colored lace. Little epaulets at the shoulders gave him form, and the jacket laced in the front in a manner which (incidentally) concealed the so-called man\u2019s breasts.</p><p>But what Harriet kept staring at was her face. She never felt beautiful as a woman. She always felt overpowered by the huge hair styles demanded by fashion, by her panniers and multiple petticoats, by the way her corset pushed up her breasts and made them seem plumper than they were in truth.</p> <p>But in a simple pair of pantaloons and a velvet jacket, with her hair pulled back in a ribbon, you could see her face.</p><p>Harriet just kept looking at it. Without all those powdered curls towering over her forehead, her face looked both delicate and strong. Her mouth was actually quite a nice shape, though she shouldn\u2019t be the one to say so. The way the valet had colored her eyebrows showed that their arch was a graceful wing that emphasized her eyes. She\u2019d always liked her eye color, but thought they looked faded to the same tired brown as the rest of her. But now they picked up the color of her coat, and her eyes seemed almost purple. Exotic. Utterly unlike her in every way.</p><p>The only problem was...her rear. Harriet turned around and peered back there again.</p><p>She could hardly believe that she was even contemplating walking through the door like this. Her breeches fit her body like a glove. That was one thing from the front, but when she craned her neck to see her behind, she felt palpitations coming on. Her bottom...her bottom was exposed. Very exposed.</p><p>It was round. She had a very round bottom, as it turned out. Who knew that? With all the petticoats, and panniers, she\u2019d never given her bottom a second glance. But there it was.</p> <p>She tried to think about men\u2019s bottoms but couldn\u2019t remember that she\u2019d ever seen any that were quite as\u2014as curvy as hers appeared to be.</p><p>Would everyone know the moment she walked into the dining room? If they discovered her secret, she\u2019d have to go back to wearing a huge wig and panniers. The very idea struck ice to her backbone. She couldn\u2019t do that yet. Not when she felt beautiful and powerful and free\u2014for the first time in her life.</p><p>Harriet pulled back her shoulders. If anyone suggested she was a woman, she would deny it with her last breath. She hesitated for one moment, wondering whether to add a bit more padding down there, in front.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t bring an image of the front of a man\u2019s breeches to mind either. Had she ever really looked at a man\u2019s body?</p><p>Apparently not. Likely it was better to be discreet about the size of her pizzle, then, at least until she had a chance to investigate male breeches.</p><p>She marched out of her room, hesitating when she reached the top of the stairs and realized that Lord Strange was lounging at the bottom, almost as if he were waiting for her.</p> <p>Of course he wasn\u2019t waiting for her. He probably greeted all his guests there. He had remarkably broad shoulders for a man who was so lean through the hips. What she\u2019d really like to see was his bottom, but he was leaning against the railing, staring intently at a sheet of foolscap.</p><p>She walked down the stairs as solidly as she could, squaring her shoulders. At the bottom, she swept an acceptable bow, flourishing a hand before her forward knee, just as Villiers had taught her.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, my lord,\u201d she said, deepening her voice.</p><p>Lord Strange looked up. \u201cMr. Cope.\u201d He folded the sheet.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll point the direction to your drawing room, I\u2019ll join your other guests.\u201d She could hear a clatter of laughter and voices coming from the other end of the corridor.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll escort you,\u201d he said, looking irritated for some reason. But he didn\u2019t look as if he suspected her of being a woman, so Harriet felt a surge of triumph. She automatically reached out to take his arm, and then quickly dropped her hand. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t see her error as he was tucking the paper away in his waistcoat pocket.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you studying?\u201d she asked, moving to the side so that their shoulders wouldn\u2019t touch.</p><p>\u201cAn auction catalogue I just received from London. A man named Bullock is selling off his collection of hummingbirds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat a lovely name, hummingbirds,\u201d Harriet said, before realizing that men didn\u2019t use the word lovely. \u201cI mean, the name is enjoyable...the hum and so on.\u201d She sounded like a fool.</p><p>\u201cHummingbirds are small birds from the Americas,\u201d Lord Strange replied, ignoring her stupid comment about hums. \u201cI am curious about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many are there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo hundred and thirty-two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat many birds! Dead?\u201d</p><p>He glanced at her. \u201cQuite dead. Stuffed.\u201d</p><p>She managed not to shudder. Men liked to kill things and stuff them. Even Benjamin had given up the chess board now and then to tramp around the woods with a gun over his shoulder. \u201cExcellent!\u201d She said as heartily as she could. \u201cI love to shoot partridge myself.\u201d</p><p>The sardonic lines by his mouth deepened. He was probably laughing at her, but he didn\u2019t say anything. They reached the door of the salon, and a footman whisked it open. He stopped her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers asked me to look after you. I shall endeavor to note your whereabouts, but I must ask you to seek me out if anything happens that seems uncomfortably novel.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was practically dancing on her toes, she was so anxious to see something novel, uncomfortable or not. \u201cThank you, Lord Strange,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease\u2014\u201d and she gestured toward the door.</p><p>After a lifetime of sailing through doors ahead of men, she wanted him to go first. So that she could examine his bottom.</p><p>He shot her a look, and there was something curious there, something she didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cDon\u2019t play the fool too exuberantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall endeavor to do otherwise,\u201d she said, giving it a chilly emphasis.</p><p>\u201cExcellent.\u201d He turned away and walked through the doors, only to disappoint.</p><p>His coat fell lower than his bottom. True, it was a glorious coat. The sleeves were pricked out in a faint tracing of metallic embroidery. His sleeves ended in lace, lace of a dull gold color. The combination gave him the dark brilliance of a pirate king, Harriet thought with a thrill.</p><p>He was everything she would have thought a man of his reputation to be: dangerous, sullen-looking, probably tired from all the degenerate orgies in which he\u2019d participated. He looked like someone who never found himself surprised. Even the sensual line of his mouth signaled he had experienced all the pleasures life had to offer.</p><p>It was really a shame that his coat fell so low. His breeches were quite as tight as hers, but of an even finer fabric, and his legs were far more muscular. In fact, her muscles were feeble compared to those defined in his legs. It was fascinating. How could she not have noticed men\u2019s legs before?</p><p>He turned around, eyes indifferent. \u201cCome on, then. Villiers says that you need to turn into a man, and my house is certainly the place to do it.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. \u201cHe said\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Lord Strange shrugged. \u201cNothing embarrassing about that. We were all urchins at some point.\u201d He eyed her from head to toe. \u201cI know all about your mother and how close she kept you. The fact you\u2019ve had no male companionship shows in the way you walk. And talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re old friends.\u201d</p><p>Harriet gulped.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll help you,\u201d he said, turning away. \u201cTomorrow. Tonight, try not to get yourself over your head. Do you have a French letter?\u201d</p><p>Harriet blinked at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA French letter,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cTell me you know what that is?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and he made a sound, half a groan, half a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you tomorrow. Tonight, try and keep yourself out of anyone\u2019s bed, do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she managed.</p> <p>\u201cDamned if you don\u2019t stand like a woman,\u201d he said, sounding appalled.</p><p>She pulled her shoulders back. \u201cBetter,\u201d he said grudgingly. \u201cDo you know how to fence?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you how to fence tomorrow. You need to move like a man, not like a molly. Maybe having a weapon in your hand will help.\u201d He looked rather unconvinced. \u201cAnd for God\u2019s sake, remember that men don\u2019t smile at each other the way you\u2019re doing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Harriet said, the smile dropping from her face. It was a fake one anyway, since she was getting more than a tad annoyed by Strange\u2019s arrogance.</p><p>\u201cYou look like a lounger,\u201d he growled at her.</p> <p>She blinked.</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><p>She put her hands on her hips and then dropped them when he gave her a disgusted look.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, you just are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could at least clarify your criticism.\u201d</p><p>His jaw set. \u201cLet\u2019s just put it this way: nature gave you a raw deal. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of deal? What are you saying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour lashes are too long,\u201d he said, leaning toward her. \u201cAnd your\u2014your\u2014\u201d He waved at her figure. \u201cYou just don\u2019t have the physique of a man.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet was conscious of a bubble of laughter inside her chest, but she put on a look of furious dignity. \u201cI assure you that nature has given me everything I need to play a man\u2019s role.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that,\u201d he said, sounding horrified.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harriet said. And then, to prove her point, she deliberately adjusted the button-placket on her breeches, as she\u2019d seen men do hundreds of times.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss it tomorrow,\u201d he said, stepping back. \u201cVilliers asked me to help and I will. But it\u2019s going to be a hell of a task. I suppose we might as well start by introducing you to a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage on my own.\u201d</p><p>He snorted, and then turned away, eyes searching the crowd. They didn\u2019t look like the cluster of degenerates Jemma had described. In fact, they didn\u2019t look very different from the people who attended Jemma\u2019s Twelfth Night ball. Of course, they weren\u2019t wearing costumes, though there was a young lady off to the side who appeared to be dressed as a shepherdess. No shepherdess on Harriet\u2019s lands wore her gown open to the waist.</p><p>Strange followed her glance. \u201cGood choice,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve picked out a lady who would likely be quite happy to usher you into the throes of manhood. And I believe she might even do it without giving you a disease. Just don\u2019t look so eager, for God\u2019s sake. No woman wants to bed a man who pants at her hem.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swallowed. This was going a bit faster than she had anticipated.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d He strode off, and she followed, to find herself bowing before the young shepherdess a moment later. She had strawberry red hair and breasts that burst from her costume. In fact, she was just the kind of woman who normally made Harriet feel miserably inconspicuous.</p><p>\u201cMay I introduce Miss Nell Gale?\u201d Strange said. \u201cMiss Gale, Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>Normally a woman like Miss Gale would get terribly nervous talking to a duchess. Yet if she happened to actually look at Harriet, she would instantly label her a woman who was neither a challenge nor a confidant. Then Miss Gale would curtsy, rather clumsily, and flutter away to laugh with more interesting women, the kind who knew scandal.</p><p>But Mr. Cope, it seemed, was not as intimidating as a duchess, and certainly more interesting. Harriet guessed this because Miss Gale\u2014or Nell, as she quickly asked to be called\u2014immediately did a complicated little maneuver with her hip that made her chest jiggle in a startling manner.</p><p>Strange drifted away a few minutes later, and Harriet found herself chattering to Nell about her shepherdess costume, which was for a play she was rehearsing.</p><p>It was surprisingly fun. Nell had a wonderful gift: Harriet found herself convulsed with laughter by the way she imitated a stuffy matron\u2019s distress when her dog peed on the Lord Chancellor\u2019s robes. They both accepted glasses of wine, and before long were seated cozily in a couch at the side of the room.</p><p>Harriet was so entertained that she almost forgot she was dressed as a man, except when she crossed her legs. That was so much fun she kept crossing and uncrossing until Nell asked her if she had a strained ankle.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harriet said, remembering again to deepen her voice.</p><p>\u201cI expect you\u2019re nervous, it being your first night here,\u201d Nell said encouragingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not nearly as bad as I thought before I came. I thought there would be an orgy before my very eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHum,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cSo did I, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, being a man, you\u2019re probably looking forward to that,\u201d Nell said, dimpling in the most delightful manner.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d Harriet ventured.</p><p>\u201cI believe we must be the same age,\u201d Nell said. \u201cOr perhaps I\u2019m a bit older. I shall be your tutor, for I can see that you aren\u2019t quite ready for this life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking whether I\u2019m a courtesan, I\u2019m not,\u201d Nell said readily. \u201cI\u2019m an actress. Lord Strange owns the Hyde Park Theater, and he likes to have final rehearsals at Fonthill. And just so you know, Lord Strange doesn\u2019t allow true ladybirds in his house. People do get up to all sorts of naughtiness\u2014\u201d she lowered her voice \u201c\u2014but there\u2019s no exchange of money, if you see the difference.\u201d</p><p>Harriet did. \u201cWhat does your family think of your visit here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much of a family,\u201d Nell said, dimpling. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that I\u2019m a good girl, do you, Harry?\u201d For she had promptly discarded \u201cMr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>Harriet couldn\u2019t help smiling. She\u2019d never met anyone like Nell before, anyone so cheerfully sinful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve no need to be a courtesan,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI\u2019m a very good actress. I\u2019d never want a man to support me; they\u2019re an erratic bunch. I don\u2019t mind telling you, since I can see that you\u2019ve yet to come to London, that I mean to be a lead actress some day. But even now I earn a pretty penny.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Harriet said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one man here whom I truly have a fancy for,\u201d she said, leaning confidentially close.</p><p>Harriet breathed a little sigh of relief. She wasn\u2019t sure that she was ready to fend off Nell. She had the distinct impression that if Nell decided to join someone in bed, that man would have little choice in the matter.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Strange. But he\u2019s impossible to approach. I\u2019m sure I could make him love me. You saw how he looked at me, and how he brought you over to me directly. I think he has a secret affection for me, but he doesn\u2019t know how to express it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think he can\u2019t express himself?\u201d Harriet asked dubiously. Strange struck her as the kind of man who would know exactly how to express any emotion he wished. In fact, the very idea of Strange expressing desire made her feel a little weak behind the knees. He would look at a woman and she would\u2014she would\u2014</p> <p>\u201cI think he desires me, if that doesn\u2019t shock you too much, young Harry,\u201d Nell was chattering. \u201cBut I\u2019m young and beautiful, and he\u2019s old, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow old is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty-two,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI looked him up in this book full of birthdays and he\u2019s thirty-two. Really old. He has a daughter, you know, though I\u2019ve never seen her. I\u2019ve heard she\u2019s absolutely brilliant and speaks in mathematical equations.\u201d</p><p>Strange was five years older than Harriet. Which did not feel old. Quite the contrary.</p><p>\u201cThe problem is that he doesn\u2019t have much to do with women,\u201d Nell was saying. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching him for the last week, ever since we came here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe never has anything to do with women?\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI thought he was notorious for his liaisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe is, but I can\u2019t understand why. Well, you only have to look at him to know that he\u2019s had lovers,\u201d Nell said. She had an utterly blunt way of talking that Harriet found enchanting. No woman in the ton ever spoke like this.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps he does have a lover,\u201d Harriet suggested. \u201cLook at him now.\u201d Strange was dancing with an older woman. She was beautiful in a terrifying sort of way.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Cummingworth,\u201d Nell said, with a curled lip. \u201cShe\u2019s ancient. She\u2019d fall into a dead faint if he\u2019d even give her an interested look, but he won\u2019t. Look at his face. He\u2019s listening, but he doesn\u2019t give a damn. He looks like that quite a lot of the time.\u201d</p><p>It was true. \u201cHow peculiar,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHow long has his wife been dead?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight years. She died in childbirth. He can hardly be mourning her. Besides, everyone knows that he had an affaire with Corisande de Grammont.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNow Lady Feddrington?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. She never comes here any more, but apparently before she got married she was so desperately in love with Strange that she threatened to throw herself off a bridge if he didn\u2019t sleep with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe slept with her. But he said afterwards that if anyone forced him to spend a second night with her, he would be the one to jump off a bridge.\u201d Nell gave a little shiver. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge. I know\u2014I just know\u2014that if I could have him in my bed for one night, I could make him love me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet thought Nell was an adorable, funny actress. And she thought that if Strange ever found himself in Nell\u2019s bed, he would be bored.</p><p>How she knew that, she couldn\u2019t quite say.</p><p>\u201cI wonder who that is,\u201d Nell said sharply.</p><p>Harriet looked up, to find that Isidore was in Strange\u2019s arms. Compared to Nell, Isidore was like a vivid flame. Nell was pretty; Isidore was beautiful. And more: Isidore had a wild intelligence about her that made watchers think she was about to throw off her clothing, do something daring, kiss the man before her.</p> <p>Harriet felt a pang of envy. She herself wouldn\u2019t have a chance interesting a man like Strange, and yet how could he resist Isidore? He couldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cJust look at the way she\u2019s smiling at him!\u201d Nell said. \u201cShe\u2019ll discover soon enough that Strange isn\u2019t taken in by such obvious maneuvers. He\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s hair was piled in towering curls above her head, and if Harriet\u2019s face looked overpowered by that kind of hair, Isidore\u2019s just looked more beautiful. It was as if a queen had entered the room and chosen her consort.</p><p>Everyone was watching them. All eyes saw how Strange smiled back, the way she had him laughing by a moment later.</p><p>Harriet sighed inside. Of course, Isidore said that she meant to flirt with Strange. And Isidore had yet to meet the man whom she couldn\u2019t entice.</p><p>It seemed Strange was just as much a man as the rest of them.</p><p>She glanced sideways at Nell. Poor Nell...her mouth had turned into a hard, glum little line.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to take him before I even get a chance,\u201d Nell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. I know I could make him laugh. I was planning on sending him a letter. But I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get the letter to him. You only have to look at Mr. Povy to know that he doesn\u2019t deliver a lady\u2019s letters. But mine would be different! I could truly make him fall in love with me, not like those others, who just want him because he\u2019s so rich.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cI don\u2019t even care that he\u2019s rich.\u201d</p><p>Harriet patted her arm.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way he moves,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but I just can\u2019t stop watching him. And the way he looks amused, mocking, as if the world were happening only for his entertainment. He\u2019s inaccessible, you know? I want to make him come to fire, wake up, look at me. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s teaching me how to fence tomorrow,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cLucky you,\u201d Nell said longingly. \u201cI\u2019d love to see him with a sword in his hand.\u201d</p><p>Harriet thought that was a double entendre, but she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>On the dance floor, Strange was bowing before Isidore. She turned away from him as if he didn\u2019t exist, straight into the arms of another man. That was pure Isidore. She never, ever let the man in her sights know that she was interested in him.</p><p>Strange actually stood still for a moment. His face was unreadable.</p><p>\u201cLook at that,\u201d Nell said, her fingers gripping Harriet\u2019s arm painfully. \u201cShe left. Maybe she\u2019s not interested after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dancing with Lord Winnamore now,\u201d Nell said. \u201cHe\u2019s a rou\u00e9, if you know what that means. Why, I heard that he took three of the Graces to bed at the same time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Graces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA musical troupe,\u201d Nell said, wrinkling her nose. \u201cThere are eight of them. I have to admit that they sing very well. But they spend most of their time on their backs. You\u2019re fencing with Strange tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cThen you could give him a letter from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>The fingers on her arm tightened. \u201cYou will, won\u2019t you? I\u2019ll stay up all night and write it, and put it under your door tomorrow morning. Won\u2019t you? Please? As a friend?\u201d</p><p>Were they friends?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do something for you in return,\u201d Nell said. She dropped Harriet\u2019s arm and pulled back. \u201cAre you interested in women?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet was so startled that her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such an innocent,\u201d Nell said, shaking her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a fair question, Harry. You have a look about you that is very attractive to certain men.\u201d</p><p>Harriet gulped. \u201cI do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose that means you do like women?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, definitely!\u201d Harriet babbled. \u201cDefinitely. Of course. All the time.\u201d</p><p>Nell laughed, but it was a nice laugh. \u201cI\u2019ll do something for you too, Harry. You get my letter to Strange\u2014and make sure he reads it\u2014and I\u2019ll introduce you to one of the Graces. A friendly Grace, if you take my meaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Harriet said hastily. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to bring the letter. What sort of thing do you plan to write?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to visit my room,\u201d Nell said, brightening up. \u201cMen like women to be very straightforward about these things.\u201d</p><p>Harriet shot a look at Strange. He was dancing with a young woman who was smiling at him lavishly. She was exquisitely dressed in a cream gown embroidered with flowers, worn with an overskirt of puckered gauze in a ruby color. The flowers shimmered under the gauze. Harriet felt a stab of pure feminine longing.</p> <p>\u201cI can see what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d Nell said, giggling. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly afford her. That\u2019s Sophia Grafton. She\u2019s monstrously extravagant. I heard that she sometimes visits the mercer and pays thirty or forty guineas for a coat of winter silk, and then purchases two or three more. And she doesn\u2019t even wear the extras, just gives them to her maids. She has four maids, just for herself. Can you imagine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said there weren\u2019t ladybirds at Fonthill?\u201d Harriet asked dubiously.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you want to be strict about the label,\u201d Nell said. \u201cBut you\u2019d never win Sophia Grafton with a simple offer of money, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. At the moment she is accompanied by Lord Childe. See, he\u2019s over there on the side of the room, talking to one of the Graces.\u201d</p><p>The Grace in question had a blowsy, huge hair style with six or seven jeweled combs stuck in at various angles.</p><p>\u201cI expect Sophia Grafton would drop Childe like a scorched potato if Strange showed any interest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s my point,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that a simple letter inviting him to your bed will be sufficient. Surely Miss Grafton has also issued such an invitation, in writing or otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>Nell looked offended. \u201cI hardly compare myself to Sophia Grafton! Why, she has to be twenty-six if she\u2019s a day. I\u2019m sure she has wrinkles around her eyes. Just look at her. She\u2019s the sort who lies around on a couch all day long and sighs. Not very much fun in the bedchamber, if you\u2019ll excuse the familiarity, Harry.\u201d</p><p>Harriet saw exactly what she meant. \u201cBut I still think that Lord Strange has received many an invitation. You need to intrigue him somehow. Make yourself stand out.\u201d</p><p>Nell was silent for a moment. \u201cI know! I could paint myself all over with gold and stick pearls on my body. Lord Strange\u2019s new secretary is a Frenchwoman, and she was telling me that Frenchwomen sometimes do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d Harry said dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI could have myself brought to his room in the guise of a statue,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAnd then the statue could come to life! And do such things as he would never forget!\u201d She was grinning. \u201cIt would be positively Shakespearean. Shakespeare wrote a play where a statue comes to life, you know.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was starting to feel very affectionate toward Nell. She\u2019d never met anyone like her. \u201cJust what sort of things do you have in mind?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><p>But she\u2019d forgotten that she was dressed as a man, and Nell burst out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to discover those from some other woman, Harry my dear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think gold paint sounds sticky and uncomfortable,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAnd while you may be thinking that I have little experience, Nell, that is not the case.\u201d</p> <p>Nell hooted. \u201cYou\u2019re a regular rakehell, Harry! I can tell it just by looking at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy point is that it doesn\u2019t sound very comfortable to be made love to if you have pearls glued to your body. Nor yet to kiss gold paint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kisses?\u201d Nell said, horrified.</p><p>\u201cI suppose your lips won\u2019t be painted,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cbut I doubt that Strange would kiss you anywhere else.\u201d</p><p>Nell pouted. \u201cI may be planning to make it a night Strange won\u2019t forget, but I certainly didn\u2019t plan on skipping my own pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWrite a letter that will intrigue him,\u201d Harriet suggested. \u201cKeep him guessing about who you are. Perhaps with a riddle, or something of that nature.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA riddle?\u201d Nell asked. \u201cThe only riddle I know has to do with a chicken and an egg and I forget what all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen perhaps not a riddle, but how about a poem, some sort of verse that he can\u2019t understand immediately?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not very good at poetry,\u201d Nell said dubiously. \u201cI can read and write, you know. But poetry might be a little...\u201d She looked at Harriet. \u201cYou could write a poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is your seduction, Nell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would never know. And I think you\u2019re right. Look at him now.\u201d</p><p>Strange was still dancing with Sophia Grafton.</p><p>\u201cHe looks bored,\u201d Nell said. \u201cEven if Sophia pasted herself all over with pearls, he\u2019d still be bored.\u201d</p><p>Harriet had to agree. Strange looked like a man who had bedded many a woman and lost interest in it, pearls or no. She had thought she had no interest in bed too, ever since Benjamin died. But now she couldn\u2019t help looking at Strange\u2019s muscles and wondering...</p><p>\u201cI hope you\u2019re looking at Sophia with that look in your eyes,\u201d Nell said. \u201cBecause otherwise you are truly unlucky. I never heard a peep about Strange being a molly, if you don\u2019t mind my bluntness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you really don\u2019t think I can afford her?\u201d Harriet asked, making herself sound wistful.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Nell said. \u201cNot unless your father owns forty flour mills, or something of that nature.\u201d</p><p>Harriet shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThen don\u2019t even look at her again,\u201d Nell advised. \u201cThink about her wrinkles. Meanwhile you can plan the letter we\u2019re writing Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cWe, or rather you,\u201d Nell said. \u201cThe more I think about it, the better your suggestion is, Harry. Of course you should write the letter, because you can make it intriguing and intelligent and mysterious. Whereas I would just ask him to pay me a visit. Which,\u201d she added, \u201cworks for most men, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it does,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut I can\u2019t write your letter, Nell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you can. If you do, I\u2019ll introduce you to my favorite Grace. Her name is Kitty and she\u2019s lovely. If she were an actress I would be hideously jealous of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the Graces are not actresses?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I don\u2019t enquire too much about what they do in their performances.\u201d Nell grinned. \u201cThey pose for gentlemen\u2019s paintings. If you have enough money, you can have all of them pose for you at once.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNaked?\u201d Harriet squeaked.</p><p>Nell giggled. \u201cHow else?\u201d</p><p>How else indeed? It was fascinating to see how much more open relations between men and women seemed to be in Lord Strange\u2019s world.</p><p>\u201cI believe they employ some gauze scarves here and there. But I am going to get you\u2014\u201d Nell paused impressively \u201c\u2014a private showing with Kitty. She generally plays Erato...do you know what she inspires?\u201d</p> <p>Harriet shook her head.</p><p>\u201cErotic poetry,\u201d Nell said cheerfully. \u201cApparently she knows realms of it and can recite in three different languages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cErotic poetry. You need to send him snippets of verse. He\u2019ll be intrigued by it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot if he thinks I\u2019m Kitty, he won\u2019t. Kitty would be lovely for you, but she\u2019s a bit of a giggler. I don\u2019t think Strange\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can make that clear,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut don\u2019t you see how well this will work? You can send him a verse or two a day for a time, and then fix a place to meet. Then you can do all those things you won\u2019t tell me about, and you won\u2019t need letters any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are wonderful, Harry!\u201d Nell said. \u201cWonderful! And it\u2019s so useful that you know about that kind of poetry. I suppose it\u2019s because you\u2019re a man. No one ever writes me poetry.\u201d She looked rather wistful.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never read any,\u201d Harriet said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cOh. Never mind,\u201d Nell said, patting Harriet\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll ask Kitty to share some of her books with you. I think she travels with them all the time. You can pick something out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you pick the poem?\u201d Harriet asked.</p> <p>\u201cToo busy,\u201d Nell said quickly. \u201cWe have to rehearse first thing in the morning, you know. In fact, I\u2019d better go to bed. I\u2019ll ask Kitty to bring you a book of verse this very evening. In your bedchamber. So think about that, Harry. And you will deliver my letter in the morning, won\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>And with that she pressed a kiss on Harriet\u2019s cheek and left.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>\u201cYet Still She Lies, and to Him Cries, \u2018Once More!\u2019\u201d</p><p>K itty turned out to be a lovely little person with pale gold hair with a faintly brassy tone that suggested it didn\u2019t come from nature. She had the air of someone with no ambitions to be a lady, but a good many ambitions to enjoy herself.</p><p>She appeared at the door of Harriet\u2019s room, thankfully before Harriet had disrobed. \u201cNell told me as how you did her a favor,\u201d Kitty said with an enchanting giggle. \u201cDo you mind if I sit down? I\u2019m that tired from all the dancing.\u201d</p><p>She sat down\u2014on Harriet\u2019s bed.</p><p>Harriet backed up so that she was against the door. \u201cIt is very kind of you to lend me a book.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of my favorites. Gentlemen like me to read it out loud. You do know that I\u2019m the muse of erotic poetry, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Harriet blinked. Did Kitty really think she was a muse?</p><p>Kitty was busy ruffling through the book. \u201cWould you like me to read you a poem?\u201d She looked up with a mischievous smile. \u201cIt would be absolutely free, of course. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve had to read for a gentleman for whom I personally could not feel a bit of attraction.\u201d</p><p>Her smile broadened, and Harriet realized with a little burst of panic that apparently Kitty had no problem feeling attraction for Mr. Cope.</p><p>\u201cThis is a funny one,\u201d Kitty crowed. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a man\u2019s yard. Listen to this line: \u2018It is a pen with a hole in the top, to write between her two-leaved book.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that clever?\u201d She laughed merrily. \u201cTwo-leaved book!\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled stiffly.</p><p>\u201cIt is a dwarf in height and length, and yet a giant in his strength,\u201d Kitty read. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve really come to know something of men. I know if a man is a dwarf.\u201d She got up and drifted toward Harriet. \u201cMr. Cope, you don\u2019t mind if I call you Harry, do you?\u201d She stopped just in front of Harriet and ran a hand along her cheek. \u201cYour skin is so smooth; it\u2019s as if you never had a beard at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUmph,\u201d Harriet said, moving quickly away. \u201cThat\u2019s a very humorous piece of verse, Miss Kitty.\u201d</p><p>She followed. \u201cWhat I was saying, Harry, is that I can tell when a man is a dwarf, and you\u2019re more along the lines of a giant, wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>Less padding in the front was definitely called for.</p><p>Harriet turned around and cleared her throat to say something, but there was a brisk knock on the door. She swung around to find Lord Strange in the doorway.</p><p>He looked from Kitty to Harriet, and then raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou surprise me, Mr. Cope. You truly do.\u201d</p><p>Kitty dimpled at him. \u201cI was just lending Harry a book to read, Lord Strange. From my special library.\u201d</p><p>A flash of something crossed Strange\u2019s eyes, but Harriet was too embarrassed by the fact that her face was growing hot to interpret it. Did men blush? She couldn\u2019t remember seeing a man blush, but Harry Cope was definitely turning red.</p><p>A second later Strange had Kitty by the arm and was escorting her from the room, telling her that she needed her beauty sleep.</p><p>Then he put his head back in the chamber. \u201cDon\u2019t invite women to your room until you can control your blushes\u2014though that\u2019s not as bad as losing control of your timing, if you understand me. I\u2019ll see you in the morning. We are going riding.\u201d</p><p>Harriet would have been angry at his high-handedness, except that she was so grateful to have Kitty removed. She had the distinct impression that Kitty was about to make a grab at her supposed pen and try to get her to write. One had to think that her visitor would be surprised to find herself holding a rolled-up woolen stocking.</p><p>Lucille helped Harriet take off her tight jacket and the roll of cotton bands that kept her breasts trapped. Finally Harriet climbed into a steaming tub of water with a grateful sigh. \u201cLucille, would you give me that book of verse on my bed?\u201d she called.</p><p>Lucille was darting around the room, grumbling to herself. She wasn\u2019t used to \u201cdoing\u201d for two young women, let alone one who was dressing as a man, but they could hardly have brought along a separate lady\u2019s maid for Mr. Cope.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYou take care of Isidore. I\u2019ll ring for someone to take away the water.\u201d</p><p>Lucille whipped around, hand on her hip. \u201cAnd how will you do that, Your Grace? One look at you in that nightgown of yours, and the footmen will know what\u2019s up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite plain,\u201d Harriet protested. \u201cIt could easily be a man\u2019s gown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the design, it\u2019s what you can see of your legs when you stand in it,\u201d Lucille said, exasperated.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI am sorry to be so much work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just run over to the other chamber and take out her night clothes,\u201d Lucille decided. \u201cHere, you read your book and then I\u2019ll wash your hair later. That\u2019s the one blessing about all this foolishness. Your hair is so short that it doesn\u2019t take me more than a minute to wash.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She handed over the book.</p><p>Harriet skipped over the poem marked \u201cA Man\u2019s Yard.\u201d She couldn\u2019t see Strange being intrigued by a bawdy poem about a man\u2019s pole, no matter how cleverly it rhymed.</p><p>The following page was a song called \u201cWalking in a Meadow Green.\u201d It seemed there were lots of primroses in that meadow, but also a lass and a lad lying together.</p><p>Fine, except...</p> <p>The lad performed once...the lass wanted more. Harriet could hardly believe what she was reading. \u201cYet still she lies, and to him cries, \u2018Once More!\u2019\u201d</p><p>It was like reading about a different world than the one she had inhabited during her marriage. In fact, the contrast made her smile. What on earth would Benjamin have done if she lay under him and cried, \u201cOnce more!\u201d She couldn\u2019t even imagine it.</p><p>And...why would she say that? The way she\u2019d always understood it, it was men who wanted to make love over and over.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that marital intimacies were unpleasant. She always enjoyed it. She loved being with Benjamin, and every time she could pry him away from the chess board felt like a personal victory.</p><p>She shook away that thought and turned the page again, to find another poem about a penis, and then a third. She was starting to think that men mostly wanted to hear songs about their own accoutrements, when she finally found a song for a woman\u2019s voice. \u201cHis lips like the ruby, his cheeks like the rose, He tempts all fair maids wherever he goes.\u201d</p> <p>Strange certainly didn\u2019t have cheeks like a rose, but he did seem to be tempting all the maidens. Not that Nell was a maiden, of course. And neither was Harriet. It was just...for some reason, she couldn\u2019t stop looking at him if he was in the room.</p><p>Earlier, when he suddenly appeared in the door of her bedchamber, her heart had started beating so quickly that she thought it might be visible. Even his voice seemed deeper, huskier, than other men\u2019s were. That wicked voice, combined with the stark intelligence in his eyes...</p><p>As far as Harriet went, put the voice and eyes together and it was far more tempting than a man with cheeks like a rose.</p><p>She kept reading. What the lass said she wanted to do to\u2014and with\u2014her lover made Harriet\u2019s heart start beating fast again.</p><p>No wonder Villiers thought she was a tiresome old woman when he touched her\u2014and she slapped him. According to these verses, women kissed men everywhere and they returned the favor. All he\u2019d done was touch her.</p><p>Still, the song was unlikely to tempt Strange. All this bawdy, silly talk about women\u2019s and men\u2019s privates was fun, but she thought of the look on his face when he danced with Sophia Grafton and shook her head.</p> <p>It would have to be a great deal more sophisticated than this. More enticing. More erotic.</p><p>If she were writing the letter for herself...</p><p>The very thought made her whole body prickle.</p><p>If she were writing a letter to entice Strange, she would pitch it toward his intelligence. Make it intriguing, rather than erotic. She could picture him opening her letter, puzzling over it.</p><p>She would make him wait. He was a man who\u2019d had too many things\u2014women\u2014given to him too easily. She would lead him on a dance of temptation and desire. She would\u2014</p><p>Harriet snapped out of her daydream. What on earth was she thinking? She was at Strange\u2019s party dressed as a man! Not to mention the fact that she was a staid duchess, even though she didn\u2019t feel like it at the moment. She had no business falling into salacious fantasies about her host, no matter how much she...</p><p>She went to sleep with rhyming words in her head: delight and night. Even, salaciously: little and prickle.</p><p>She went to sleep smiling.</p> <p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>In Which Manhood is Achieved...Albeit With Some Discomfort</p><p>February 6, 1784</p><p>H arriet dreamed that she was dancing. She was wearing her male clothing, which meant that she could move far more gracefully than in skirts and hoops. She was dancing with Benjamin, so she said to him: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever ask me to ride on your prickle?\u201d</p><p>He laughed at that, and said, \u201cWhat? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><p>She was trying to explain when he slipped away with a friendly wave, walked through the doors to the balcony outside the ballroom.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m coming too. I want to talk. I want\u2014\u201d</p><p>A hand gave her shoulder a brisk shake. She opened her eyes, looked up, and uttered a little scream.</p><p>\u201cTime to get up, youngster,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cYip,\u201d Harriet managed, and pulled the quilt to her neck.</p><p>\u201cI exercise in the morning, so if I\u2019m going to teach you fencing, I\u2019d rather do it now. But I thought we could go for a ride first.\u201d He turned around and walked to the windows, throwing open the curtains. \u201cWhere\u2019s your valet? Do you always sleep away the morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Harriet stammered.</p><p>\u201cAlmost six on a gorgeous cold morning. It\u2019s a woman\u2019s trick to sleep away the morning, Cope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014right,\u201d Harriet said, remembering to lower her voice.</p><p>\u201cYour valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers has been kind enough to share his man with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Villiers couldn\u2019t pick up an extra manservant for you? I\u2019m sure I could find\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Harriet said hastily. \u201cReally. I have a valet at home but he broke his arm and couldn\u2019t attend me so this is just for a short period of time and it\u2019s not an inconvenience to the duke.\u201d</p><p>Strange shrugged and walked to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll see you downstairs in ten minutes. We\u2019re missing the light.\u201d</p><p>Light? Light? What on earth was he talking about? Harriet pushed back the covers and shivered. It was February, after all, and a quick look out the window showed bundles of snow and a lowering, gray dawn. She fled through the door into Isidore\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cIsidore! Wake up! Strange is taking me riding.\u201d</p><p>Isidore sat up for a moment, stared at her, fell back down and rolled over, pillow on her head. Harriet pulled Isidore\u2019s bell cord to summon Lucille.</p><p>Lucille bundled her into a pair of buckram breeches that buttoned tightly at the knees, and then a riding coat. \u201cWhy are the jacket flaps buttoned back like that?\u201d Harriet asked, craning to see her rear in the glass. At least her bottom would not be in evidence. Last night she kept edging around the corners of the room so that no one saw her from behind.</p><p>\u201cSo you can flip them up when you sit on the saddle,\u201d Lucille said. She was wrestling with a pair of boot garters. Suddenly she looked up. \u201cOh, Your Grace, you\u2019re going to have to sit astride!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI did it as a girl once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks perilously dangerous to me. What\u2019s to stop you from sliding right off the end of the horse? All right, I\u2019m ready for you to put these boots on.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stamped into the boots. They were heavy, with a turned-over top. \u201cNow these garters,\u201d Lucille muttered to herself, \u201cthey fix to the boot and then pass round the leg over the breeches, like this. I think.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked in the mirror. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Lucille said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what Finchley, Villiers\u2019s valet, said to do. He\u2019s a terribly knowledgeable man, you know.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, I might as well go downstairs,\u201d Harriet said. She had her hair tied back, but no powder.</p><p>\u201cYour hat!\u201d Lucille said. She opened the wardrobe and then hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m sure he said the bicorne for horseback. Or perhaps a round hat.\u201d</p><p>The round hat had a brim that stuck out all around, and a little cockade on the side. Harriet thought it looked stupid, but she grabbed it and jammed it down on her head. \u201cI have to go or Strange will come up and find you here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he walked straight into your bedchamber,\u201d Lucille muttered. \u201cYou\u2019re that fortunate he didn\u2019t know it on the instant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople see what they expect to see,\u201d Harriet said, reassuring herself as much as Lucille.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s perishing cold outside. Just look at the frost flowers on the windows. Here, I\u2019ll put another cravat over that black one. No one will know the difference, and at least it will keep your neck warm.\u201d</p><p>Harriet had to make a conscious effort to pick up her feet since her boots thumped so loudly on the wooden stairs that she felt as if she were waking the whole house. Given that she had stolen off to her room around eleven in the evening, when most of the party appeared to be just starting to enjoy themselves, she would feel truly guilty to wake them.</p><p>Strange was at the bottom of the stairs. In the morning light his hair gleamed the color of dark mahogany. She was overcome by a giddy sense of exactly how much fun she was having.</p><p>He glanced up and said, \u201cI might as well have been waiting for a woman to dress, Cope.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood morning to you too, my lord,\u201d she said. The butler was waiting with their coats. When she had struggled into her great coat (Villiers\u2019s tailor had padded her shoulders so that she looked more manly), Strange eyed her from head to foot.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look warm enough,\u201d he said brusquely. \u201cAnd you\u2019re as pale as Villiers. We\u2019ll work up a sweat soon enough.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled rather weakly and strode through the door. Outdoors the air was as cold as liquid ice, catching the back of her throat and emerging from her mouth in great puffs of steam.</p><p>Groomsmen were holding the reins of stamping horses. Strange\u2019s mount threw up his head in greeting. Strange said over his shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t get your nose out of joint, youngster. I gave you a filly, rather than a gelding, but that\u2019s not meant as a comment on your horsemanship. She\u2019s got a beautiful stride.\u201d</p><p>A lad with a shock of white-blond hair and freckles on his nose was holding Harriet\u2019s horse. Harriet walked over and held out her hand so the filly could blow warm air into her palm. Then she pulled on her gloves.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Strange snapped.</p> <p>He must be irritable by nature, Harriet decided. She checked the belly strap of the horse as she watched Strange swing into the saddle. She\u2019d seen countless men mount horses, but she never expected to ride astride herself.</p><p>Finally Harriet put her left boot into the stirrup and flung herself into the air.</p><p>Plop! She landed on the saddle and gathered the reins as if she expected to find herself there.</p><p>Strange started down the driveway without looking back, so Harriet signaled to the boy to let her horse go. He stepped aside but then said in a low voice, \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse the presumption, sir, grip with your knees.\u201d</p><p>Harriet nodded in a dignified sort of way, and let her horse start picking her way down the icy path. The sun was up, and Strange was right about the light. At this hour it had a peculiar, dancing clarity that edged every blade of glass with silver. Ice crackled under her mount\u2019s feet, and hung in great dripping rows from the fence beside the road.</p><p>\u201cWe can let them gallop at the end of this road,\u201d Strange shouted over his shoulder.</p><p>Gallop? When she was growing up, her mother considered horse-riding unladylike. Horses were regarded as little more than moving sofas. Riding excursions tended to be ambling trips through the woods to a picnic spot, with a groomsman leading each horse to ensure that it didn\u2019t startle. Certainly, there had been no wild gallops down icy roads.</p><p>She slowed her horse even further, but the end of the road arrived anyway. She found her host prancing about on a caracoling horse. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Cope,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re riding like a maiden aunt.\u201d</p> <p>She scowled at him and he cocked an eyebrow. \u201cTetchy about getting up so early? Worse and worse. I\u2019m not sure I can teach you to be a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou sound as if you belong to some sort of exclusive club,\u201d she retorted. \u201cAs far as I can see, the definition of a man has nothing to do with whether he thinks it\u2019s masculine to be out breathing ice and clopping around on a dangerously slick road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFear is not manly,\u201d he told her, with an insufferably condescending look on his face.</p><p>\u201cThe list grows more and more interesting,\u201d she said, intent on distracting him so that she could avoid galloping off down the lane. \u201cMen get up at dawn, feel no fear, and\u2014what was that you told me last night?\u2014stay away from women\u2019s hemlines.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re at a disadvantage,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cAs you already indicated.\u201d Harriet put her nose in the air. \u201cI find your rudeness insufferable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at you!\u201d he erupted. \u201cYou look exactly like a\u2014well\u2014you probably don\u2019t know the word, so I won\u2019t use it. But you\u2019ll never find a woman at this rate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty seemed to have no questions about my manliness,\u201d Harriet pointed out. \u201cShe said I was very handsome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are handsome,\u201d he said, and then made a funny strangled sound in his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2014look at your hair!\u201d</p><p>Harriet frowned at him. \u201cI\u2019m wearing a hat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has golden streaks in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike a woman\u2019s hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, yours has streaks too,\u201d she retorted. \u201cIt looks just like mahogany.\u201d</p><p>For some reason his face froze with horror. He spun his horse around and said, \u201cBloody hell!\u201d And the next moment he was pounding away down the road.</p><p>Harriet let out a little snort of laughter. Strange was cracked. But her horse was straining at the reins, so she gripped with her knees just as the stableboy told her. It felt odd, but perhaps it would keep her in the saddle.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said to her mount. \u201cGo, then.\u201d She loosed the reins.</p><p>She would have screamed, but the icy air blowing in her face stole her breath. She would have stopped, but pulling on the reins did nothing. Her horse was intent on catching up with Strange and clearly considered its rider an afterthought. She would have fallen off except she couldn\u2019t loosen her knees from pure terror. So she held on the reins and screamed silently. Her hat flew off. Her ears froze.</p><p>The horse seemed to eat up the ground with its long legs\u2014and every time it lurched forward, she flew into the air and then came down with a crash. Ow! Ow! Ow!</p><p>Through narrowed eyes streaming with tears from the cold, she saw that somehow she was catching up with that devil, Strange. A moment later, her horse actually started to pass him, except that Strange bent over and shouted at his horse until it drew ahead again.</p><p>At the end of the road she drooped over the horse\u2019s neck, panting. She didn\u2019t even look at Strange. If he dared to say something about her being a poor rider, she\u2019d\u2014she\u2019d\u2014kill him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But when she finally looked over, he didn\u2019t have that sarcastic sneer any longer. \u201cYou\u2019re not a bad rider,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something. I had no idea that Bess had it in her.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him.</p><p>He was looking pleased with himself. \u201cWe\u2019ll go back now\u2014but we shouldn\u2019t gallop again, I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s too cold out here for the horses to be sweating this much.\u201d</p><p>Thank God, Harriet thought.</p> <p>He talked all the way back to the house about manly things like fencing moves and boxing matches. She ignored him and thought about whether she had suffered irrevocable damage to her most tender parts, her female parts. She was very fond of that part of her body and didn\u2019t want it battered to pieces. She couldn\u2019t feel anything between her legs at the moment. It was all numb.</p><p>By the time they arrived home, she was regaining sensation\u2014and those sensations were not pleasant.</p><p>Strange jumped off his horse and threw the reins to the groomsman. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in the portrait gallery in ten minutes, Cope,\u201d he bellowed.</p><p>\u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d she said.</p><p>He frowned at her. His plan seemed to involve keeping her in motion for the next twelve hours.</p> <p>\u201cI want breakfast.\u201d</p><p>His face cleared. \u201cRight. Beef and beer, that\u2019ll do the trick.\u201d He went into the house without waiting for an answer.</p><p>Beer? Beer for breakfast? He must be insane.</p><p>The freckled stableboy was standing at her side. He had a nice face, so she gave up her attempts at dignity. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can get off of this animal,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He looked around, but the other groomsman had led Strange\u2019s horse away and there was no one to be seen but a footman huddled just inside the front door, waiting for her.</p><p>\u201cSwing your right leg over, miss,\u201d he said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>He grinned at her. \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><p>She swung her right leg over and squealed. \u201cOuch!\u201d And: \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Strange must not have looked closely at your riding,\u201d he said. \u201cYou ride just the way my sisters do. The trick is to grip your knees and keep yourself a little above the saddle. Brace your boots in the stirrups.\u201d</p><p>He reached up and pulled her off the horse. Harriet looked around hastily, but the footman at the door had retreated indoors and there was no one to see.</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI\u2019d give you a tip, but I couldn\u2019t figure out where to put my money since I can\u2019t carry a knotting bag.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cGentleman have pockets sewn into their garments. You\u2019ll find them. I\u2019m just happy you didn\u2019t sail into the air and land on your rump.\u201d He looked a bit uneasy. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive the familiarity, miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d she said, smiling at him, \u201cI\u2019ll forgive a great deal from the man who just told me how to avoid such a bone-jarring ride. What\u2019s your name?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNick. I\u2019ll make sure that I come tomorrow morning as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you!\u201d she whispered fervently, and started to limp toward the house.</p><p>Though tomorrow was a moot point. She\u2019d be lucky to walk again.</p><p>And if she ever did ride again\u2014no more padding in front! She surreptitiously adjusted her breeches.</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>A Chapter in Which the Delights of Swordplay and Manhood are Confused</p><p>J em waited in the entry until Cope finally walked back into the house. Probably Villiers\u2019s proteg\u00e9 was out there caressing his mount\u2019s nose or some such frippery. Cope finally entered and handed over his greatcoat to Povy. He seemed to be a little stiff.</p><p>Good. He needed muscle. If Cope had more muscle, he would lose that effeminate look.</p><p>\u201cBeef,\u201d he said, striding off to the breakfast room. \u201cCome on, Cope.\u201d</p><p>The butler stopped him. \u201cLord Strange, if you cared to eat in your private dining room, Miss Eugenia would be very pleased to join you.\u201d</p><p>Jem allowed very few of his male guests to meet Eugenia\u2014but Cope was far from a rakehell. He was practically the girlish playmate he thought of finding for his daughter.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he said, reversing direction and heading up the stairs. He stopped halfway when Cope hadn\u2019t followed him. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d</p><p>Cope glanced up at him. \u201cDid you say something, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re having breakfast in my private dining room.\u201d</p><p>The man had the impudence to grin at him. \u201cThat must have been my invitation. So sorry I didn\u2019t hear it before.\u201d</p><p>Jem ground his teeth. Cope practically coo\u2019ed his little retort.</p><p>He should go upstairs right now and tell Villiers that there was no way he could turn a moon-calf into a bull. But Cope was walking up the stairs. And the odd thing was that Jem actually liked him.</p><p>He liked the stickler way that Cope made it through that ride, even though he was obviously one of the least experienced riders ever put on the surface of the earth. He didn\u2019t complain, though. And he didn\u2019t look too sissy in a riding jacket. He looked delicate in some lights, but he had a good strong chin. The real problem was his eyes. What man had eyes of burned velvet brown?</p><p>Swallowing an oath, he turned around and went back up the stairs.</p><p>Just when had he ever wasted time thinking about a man\u2019s eyes? He was truly losing his mind.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wash my face and hands in my chamber,\u201d Cope said. \u201cWhere shall I join you?\u201d</p><p>Jem rolled his eyes. Washing. \u201cEnd of the corridor to your right,\u201d he barked.</p><p>In the end he went to his own chamber and washed his face too, though he was plagued by the idea that his guest\u2019s overfastidious habits would be contagious in more than one sense. He strode into his private dining room to find Eugenia there.</p><p>She ran over to give him a hug. It was pure Sally, that hug. His wife used to think that if people would just be kinder and nicer to each other, all problems could be solved.</p><p>\u201cRemember when you used to carry me around on your shoulders, Papa?\u201d Eugenia asked, scooting into her chair.</p><p>\u201cYes. We\u2019re going to be joined by a gentleman named Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hardly ever get to meet a gentleman,\u201d Eugenia said, her eyes shining. \u201cThere was that Oxford professor, the one who was an expert in water rats. Is Mr. Cope a scientist?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that I know of,\u201d Jem said. A footman offered a huge slab of red meat, so rare it practically quivered. He gestured toward the empty spot. \u201cOur guest is starving. Give him a large piece.\u201d He himself took just a sliver. He didn\u2019t need red blood, the way Cope did, and he preferred eggs.</p><p>\u201cSo what does he do?\u201d Eugenia asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Jem said. \u201cMost men don\u2019t do anything.\u201d</p><p>Her brows knit. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a man, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost women do less than nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to do less than nothing,\u201d she observed, accurate as always.</p><p>\u201cI mean that they create busywork for themselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are very cynical, Papa. From what I have observed, many women work hard, all day long. For example, my chambermaid\u2019s name is Hannah. She works from the very moment of dawn until after dark. Did you know that there are nine separate stages to washing lace, Papa? Imagine how long that takes. A great many of my dresses are edged in lace. And your shirts too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean the chambermaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are women, Papa. And they work very very hard, I assure you. I think the laundry maids work the hardest. They have to heat all the water in a copper holding. And I do like clean clothes, Papa. Sometimes I feel guilty about that.\u201d</p><p>It was moments like this when Jem really wished that Sally hadn\u2019t died. \u201cI suppose I didn\u2019t mean women. I meant ladies. Ladies often don\u2019t work terribly hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t met very many,\u201d Eugenia said thoughtfully. She accepted a toast finger with marmalade. And then: \u201cPapa, have I ever met a lady?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYour governess is a lady. And Mrs. Patton is a lady. She visited last year, do you remember?\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Cope entered. \u201cMy daughter, Eugenia,\u201d Jem said brusquely. \u201cEugenia, this is Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>Jem rather liked the way that Cope eyed the quivering beef on his plate.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already eaten twice that amount,\u201d he told him unrepentantly. \u201cIt\u2019ll do you good. With eggs to follow.\u201d He gestured to a footman, who promptly placed two yellow eggs on Cope\u2019s plate.</p><p>The man wasn\u2019t a lily-liver. He clearly didn\u2019t like what was before him, but he took up a knife and fork and attacked it anyway.</p> <p>Eugenia behaved very properly and waited to be spoken to.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I know little about the interests of small girls,\u201d Cope said to her. \u201cWhat kind of things do you do with your day?\u201d</p><p>That, of course, was all the invitation Eugenia needed. She reeled into a discussion of mathematical angles, her curiosity cabinet, her collection of tradesmens\u2019 cards. \u201cBut what I like best of all is reading plays,\u201d she finished. \u201cPapa owns the Hyde Park Theater, and he causes the company to perform their dress rehearsal here, so I see everything before it goes to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see you are a theatrical family,\u201d Cope said politely enough.</p><p>The comment poked at Jem\u2019s conscience. He probably shouldn\u2019t have actors around Eugenia, not to mention the fact that he should be screening her reading material. When he inherited the theater from his father, inviting the actors to rehearse at Fonthill had been a careless decision when his attention was focused elsewhere, probably on the Game. It had turned into a tradition before he knew it.</p><p>\u201cBeer for both of us,\u201d he told the footman, who promptly poured a great foaming tankard for Cope.</p> <p>Jem took a deep swallow. He wasn\u2019t a proponent of beer, in truth. After a good decade of hard drinking and hard living, he\u2019d stopped drinking almost entirely when he realized that Eugenia was a person rather than a squalling nuisance off in the nursery.</p><p>Cope sipped his tankard. That was another thing he\u2019d have to teach him, Jem thought, adding it to an ever-growing mental list. No sipping. Men don\u2019t sip.</p><p>\u201cPapa won\u2019t let me quote plays anymore,\u201d Eugenia was telling Cope.</p><p>Cope raised an eyebrow. \u201cIs it the act of quotation that\u2019s banned, or the plays?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer governess was concerned that she was forgetting normal speech. Everything she said was in blank verse and written by another person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not correct, Papa,\u201d Eugenia said with great dignity. \u201cIt\u2019s merely that I love to memorize, and there are so many moments when a quotation comes to mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t only the fact that she spoke almost entirely in blank verse,\u201d Jem told Cope. \u201cIt was the selections she chose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like old plays the best,\u201d Eugenia said.</p> <p>\u201cOld bawdy plays,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re funny!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forbade her reading for a month after she asked me what it meant to have sweet violet beds, pressed to death with maidenheads.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Cope said.</p><p>Jem saw with some satisfaction his utter inability to answer that particular question reflected in Cope\u2019s face. He pushed away from the table. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a fencing lesson now, poppet. You\u2019d better go back to the nursery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease let me come,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI\u2019m so lonely by myself.\u201d She looked truly distraught, except that Jem had known her long enough to instantly recognize every dramatic scene she had in her repertoire.</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Cope said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all alone in the nursery,\u201d Eugenia said, clasping her hands and getting into her stride. She tried fluttering her lashes at Cope, but he just looked bemused.</p><p>Jem snorted, but on the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to be alone with Cope. God forbid he should find himself in another discussion of hair color. Not that it was Cope\u2019s fault exactly, but he just seemed to bring out a side of Jem that\u2014that\u2014</p><p>Didn\u2019t exist.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he barked. \u201cYou can watch us if you stay out of the way.\u201d</p><p>He led the way to the portrait galley in the east wing, listening with half an ear to the lively discussion behind him. Just as Villiers had described, it appeared that Cope had hardly even visited London, and so hadn\u2019t seen any current plays. But like Eugenia, he\u2019d read quite a few. Eugenia was breaking the rules and quoting a line here or there, but Jem didn\u2019t feel like scolding her in front of a stranger.</p><p>Though Cope was quickly turning into something other than a stranger.</p><p>A few years ago, Jem had had all the portraits in the gallery taken down and put in the attics somewhere. They weren\u2019t of his relatives, anyway, just moldering old courtiers who came along with the house.</p><p>Instead the long corridor was lined with glass cases stuffed with curiosities. Some things still interested him, and others he\u2019d ceased to care much about. But he liked the idea of collecting them all in one room\u2014and the portrait gallery was the only space large enough for a stuffed ibis, not to mention the crown of an African prince, featuring orange-, blue-, and green-tipped plumage.</p><p>Eugenia pulled Cope over to the display cabinets. Jem leaned against a wall to watch. He hadn\u2019t let a male guest put a finger on Eugenia since she turned five, but there was something about Cope that told him clear as a bell that the man was no danger to a little girl. He might be unable to perform with one of the Graces when it came down to it, though Jem hoped for his sake that wasn\u2019t the case. He might even turn out to be a molly.</p><p>Jem had had plenty of men of that persuasion visit the house over the years, and he knew well enough that sin has nothing to do with the gender of a bed-partner.</p><p>Cope was nothing to worry about, not with those eyes. So he turned away as Eugenia pulled Cope from case to case, pointing out the supposed unicorn\u2019s horn and the white swamp-hen from Australia.</p><p>Povy had the practice rapiers laid out. Jem pulled off his jacket and boots, tested the steel, and made some practice forays.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do this, shall we?\u201d he finally called.</p><p>It turned out that Cope had trouble pulling his own boots off. Jem didn\u2019t curl his lip too much, merely noting the obvious: a man should be able to valet himself.</p><p>Cope didn\u2019t reply, just wrenched at his boots until one came off. Eugenia came to help, squealing with giggles as she tried to pull off the other boot, so finally Jem had to take over, to his disgust. He tossed the boot to the side of the room.</p><p>\u201cCoat off,\u201d he called. \u201cWaistcoat too.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cope took off his coat, but then got very obstinate about his waistcoat and claimed it was cold in the gallery.</p><p>\u201cAre you cold, Eugenia?\u201d Jem asked.</p><p>\u201cNot at all, Papa,\u201d she said promptly.</p><p>He turned to Cope.</p> <p>\u201cHer lips are bluish,\u201d the man pointed out. \u201cProbably she would turn herself into a block of ice for the pleasure of your company, but I am not so taken with it myself.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked closer at his daughter and cursed. He flung open the door and bellowed for a footman to bring Eugenia\u2019s pelisse, mittens, and hat. Of course, it was a trifle chilly in the gallery, but they were planning on exercise.</p><p>\u201cRun around,\u201d he barked at Eugenia. \u201cKeep warm or it\u2019s back to the nursery with you.\u201d</p><p>Then he turned to Cope. \u201cThe key to fighting with a rapier is to twist your wrist. As you parry a blow, a twist of your wrist will send the rapier sliding past the opponent\u2019s blade and into his body.\u201d</p><p>He eyed Cope. \u201cWiden your legs. And hold your rapier in your right hand. You\u2019re going to have to rely on wit rather than strength.\u201d He took him through the first three basic moves. Then:</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s have a match,\u201d he said. \u201cPovy didn\u2019t provide rapier caps, so try not to injure me.\u201d He laughed.</p><p>Cope looked startled, but Jem was already circling him. He could feel frustration surging through his veins\u2014the frustration that had been building since the moment he caught himself looking at Cope.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s fault, by God. But the blood was beating through Jem\u2019s body and he wanted to fight.</p><p>Eugenia clapped and cheered, and Cope started circling too. Jem could see the sudden wariness in his eyes. Suddenly he no longer looked like a child holding a rapier, but like an alert man, smelling danger.</p><p>Good.</p><p>It was all part of becoming a man, Jem told himself. Not that he planned to draw blood or anything.</p> <p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to parry,\u201d he announced. \u201cSee how my left arm has tensed? You need to watch every motion of your opponent\u2019s body because it will tell you what he\u2019s about to do before he does it.\u201d Slowly Jem started a sweeping attack, a demi-volte.</p><p>Rather surprisingly, Cope didn\u2019t fall back, but swung his rapier up and actually managed to deflect the blow before his rapier spun out of his hand and fell to the ground.</p><p>Jem barked with laughter. \u201cNot bad!\u201d</p><p>Cope straightened from picking up his rapier. His color was high and his eyes looked furious. \u201cYou struck hard!\u201d he accused.</p><p>\u201cNo point in babying you,\u201d Jem said, grinning. He started to circle again. \u201cSome day you might grow up and meet someone on a dueling field at dawn. I\u2019ll do exactly the same approach again. Try parrying it on the horizontal, rather than the vertical.\u201d</p><p>Cope backed up, his lips tightly pressed together. Already he looked less effeminate, Jem thought with satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d he called. \u201cWatch my left shoulder. You can actually judge the type of blow once you get more experienced. The moment my left shoulder tenses, you should be assessing what and where I\u2019m planning to strike.\u201d Again he launched into a swirling, driven demi-volte.</p><p>This time Cope managed to get his rapier horizontal rather than vertical, and he didn\u2019t drop his blade, though the blow knocked his arm almost to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, but you\u2019re weak,\u201d Jem commented.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a very nice comment, Papa,\u201d Eugenia said.</p><p>He blinked and turned around. \u201cStay well away from the fight, poppet. I\u2019m afraid that Mr. Cope\u2019s blade might fly from his hand again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Cope said, catching his breath.</p><p>Jem narrowed his eyes. \u201cI can watch out for my child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may be able to watch, but I can\u2019t guarantee that I can hold onto my rapier, given the forcefulness with which you are conducting this...tutorial.\u201d</p><p>Well, who would have thought? The little chicken was turning into a rooster. Jem turned to Eugenia, but she forestalled him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go behind the cabinet, Papa. I can see through, but a rapier could never reach me.\u201d She ran behind a tall glass cabinet.</p><p>Jem tossed his blade slightly until he had the right grip. \u201cMr. Cope?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne more time,\u201d Cope said rather grimly. \u201cMy shoulder won\u2019t take much more of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll play again tomorrow morning, and the next,\u201d Jem said cheerfully. \u201cIn a week or two you\u2019ll be on the attack yourself.\u201d Then, seeing how low to the ground Cope held the blade, he added: \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><p>Cope\u2019s jaw tightened and he raised the blade.</p><p>\u201cSame again,\u201d Jem said. \u201cWatch my shoulder.\u201d</p><p>This time, as he came in a swirling attack from above, Cope\u2019s blade fell smoothly into the proper horizontal position, slid along his blade and damned if he didn\u2019t pink him.</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Jem said, dropping his rapier.</p><p>Cope put down his own blade in a very unhurried manner. \u201cHow unfortunate,\u201d he said, coming over and peering at the small trickle of blood coming from Jem\u2019s arm. \u201cPerhaps we should have waited for rapier caps.\u201d</p><p>Jem growled.</p><p>Cope was grinning; he was definitely grinning. \u201cA mere twist of the wrist, I think you described it.\u201d Then he turned to Eugenia. \u201cShall we escort your father downstairs? He needs the attention of his valet.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia was bending over Jem\u2019s arm. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite all right, Papa. Look, it\u2019s already stopped bleeding. You must be careful, though, Mr. Cope. My father is not as young as you are.\u201d</p><p>Wonderful. Now Jem felt prehistoric.</p><p>He stode to the door, Eugenia skipping before him. \u201cI\u2019ll go back upstairs now, Papa,\u201d she said, trotting away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll visit before supper,\u201d he called after her.</p><p>\u201cOh, Lord Strange,\u201d Cope said from behind him. \u201cIf you will allow me, I am the bearer of a letter for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Cope handed over a folded piece of foolscap. Jem opened it and then waved it in the air to dispense with the burst of perfume. \u201cMy God, it\u2019s a poem. Anonymous too. Who gave it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t say,\u201d Cope replied.</p><p>He had laughing eyes. For a moment, Jem found himself grinning in response, before he pulled himself together and turned back to the letter.</p><p>He read it out loud:</p><p>\u201cThe dark is my delight,</p><p>So \u2019tis the nightingale\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>He turned the page over. \u201cThat\u2019s it? Two lines?\u201d</p><p>He caught himself, about to ask Cope if he wrote it. He? If Cope wrote such a thing he wanted nothing to do with it. Besides, obviously Cope didn\u2019t write it. The paper was drenched in perfume, and Cope actually had a clean smell, a bit like soap.</p><p>He was so angry at himself for knowing what Cope smelled like that he stalked out of the room without another word.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Friendship in an Unexpected Place</p><p>\u201cS o have you been regaled by dancing girls yet?\u201d Villiers was reclining in bed, looking as haggard as it was possible for someone so beautiful to look.</p><p>Harriet sat down. \u201cIt\u2019s been a grave disappointment, but no one performed at breakfast.

More importantly, how is manhood treating you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing a man is exhausting,\u201d Harriet said with some feeling. \u201cMy rear hurts from riding, and my arm hurts from rapier play, and all my other muscles are sympathetically twanging as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather that Strange took my dictate to turn you into a man seriously. You\u2019d better watch out; he\u2019s likely to introduce you to a demi-rep this evening. Part of the training.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you to laugh,\u201d Harriet said. Then she put on a lofty air. \u201cAs it happens, I already have a lady friend interested in my company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo! How I wish I could get out of this damned bed. Promise me you won\u2019t dismiss her, at least until I see you being wooed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fully intend to avoid her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat won\u2019t be easy,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cStrange\u2019s house parties are surprisingly large and yet intimate. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d visit me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked up. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have every reason to hate me.\u201d He said it without any particular inflection. But there was much unspoken: the evening when he rejected her advances and dropped her out of his carriage in the middle of London, the fact that her husband committed suicide after losing to him at chess.</p> <p>\u201cI did hate you.\u201d It was strangely restful to admit it. \u201cI spent a great deal of time brooding over revenge. It was easier to hate you than to accept that Benjamin chose to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChose to leave is an odd way of talking about suicide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow else would you describe it?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. He really had amazing eyes, black as pitch.</p><p>\u201cYou think suicide is cowardly,\u201d she said when he didn\u2019t speak immediately.</p><p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI thought that at first too. I raged at Benjamin the first year: for being such a coward, for not loving me enough, for caring so much about chess that he gave his life for it, for being such a fool. But then I started to think that cowardice is just a point of view.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe counterpoint to courage?\u201d His eyes were sympathetic but unconvinced.</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. Benjamin cared most in the world for chess. I hated that fact while we were married, but it was true. Though he was always amiable, and was certainly fond of me in his own way.\u201d</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t say anything. Harriet made herself continue. \u201cBut chess was his passion. And while he was very good at it, he wasn\u2019t the best. So let\u2019s imagine that he had been that wildly in love with me\u2014Don\u2019t laugh!\u201d she said fiercely.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow, surprised. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest impulse to laugh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he had been madly in love with me, or some other woman, and had killed himself because he failed to win her, would you call him a coward?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMerely a fool,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps.\u201d Harriet couldn\u2019t think where this argument was taking her. \u201cBut not a coward,\u201d she persisted.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have to be a grand passion, a love so great it was intolerable to live without the other person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, and everyone would have felt the grief along with him. Whereas if a person commits suicide for love of something other than a woman, no one shares their grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI count myself lucky to have escaped such a passion,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI can picture it, but I haven\u2019t been afflicted by it. Have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d Harriet stopped. \u201cI loved Benjamin. He was the first man to pay me any attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen he\u2019s not quite the fool I thought,\u201d Villiers said, more gently.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeedn\u2019t what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGive me that practiced flummery you\u2019re so good at. We both know who I am, and exactly how attractive I am to men. Not to mention the fact that I am now wearing breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cNor your breeches. Your derri\u00e8re is a pleasure even for me to behold and believe me, my wish to bed a woman is at an lifetime low.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never wished to bed me,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI actually did,\u201d Villiers said thoughtfully. \u201cWhen you kissed me, years ago, I was quite happy to reciprocate. But the fact that Benjamin was my friend leaped into my mind and I admit it took the pleasure out of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I did that,\u201d Harriet said miserably. \u201cI would have loathed myself if I had been unfaithful. I really did love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRage, I expect,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cDid you try to seduce anyone else, or was I your only foray?\u201d</p><p>She felt herself flushing. \u201cYou were my only try at adultery, though the fact doesn\u2019t reduce my shame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am the more honored,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. I chose you because you were Benjamin\u2019s closest friend and I wanted so bitterly for him to notice me. To put me before a chess match, even just one time.\u201d</p><p>Villiers nodded. But his silence said what she knew: even had she slept with Benjamin\u2019s friend, it wouldn\u2019t have meant she was loved above chess. Or even accounted above a good win at the game.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d she said brightly, \u201cthis is a dismal topic. When do you think that you might be able to rise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA day or two,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI wish I were better. I\u2019m worried that you will be discovered long before you wish to be. Are you quite sure you wish to stay here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love being in these breeches,\u201d Harriet said, looking at them affectionately. \u201cAnd not because my derri\u00e8re shows to advantage, but because it makes me feel free. It is very nice not to be Benjamin\u2019s widow for a time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it so terrible?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cEveryone loved Benjamin. He was always cheerful, always friendly, always ready with a kind word or a loan, if it came to that. That was easy, because he didn\u2019t care deeply for people or money. Only for chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an illness,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>She stood up and grinned, looking down at him. \u201cNo chess for a month. I count it as my revenge.\u201d</p><p>He groaned. \u201cI\u2019m reading.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot chess books, I hope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe History of Tom Jones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Tom Jones? A politician?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a novel, not a real history. So far he\u2019s a naughty sort who has stolen a duck and seems doomed to be hanged. Given the length of the novel, I shall be surprised if he escapes the scaffold. Do go amuse yourself. Strange\u2019s house parties exist for that sole purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is enormously fun to be male,\u201d Harriet agreed. \u201cYou can have no idea. Unless you tried to be female.\u201d</p><p>His heavy lidded eyes lowered a bit. \u201cI\u2019d rather not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, Strange\u2019s party is not so different from any other house party, beyond the fact that I can\u2019t name everyone\u2019s lineage. Should any dancing girls appear, I\u2019ll send you a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd will you pay me a visit and tell me how your manliness develops?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet smiled faintly. \u201cSaving you from the high moral tone of that book?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least tell me how it goes with the young lady who desires your further acquaintance. I am like to die of boredom here without\u2014\u201d He stopped.</p><p>\u201cWithout chess,\u201d Harriet filled in. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. I\u2019m used to men who can\u2019t stop thinking about the white queen. At least you haven\u2019t acquired a wife, only to slight her for every chess match within three counties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have tried,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cYou were briefly engaged to Jemma\u2019s ward, weren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe threw me over for Jemma\u2019s brother. Then I thought I was making inroads on a certain Miss Tatlock, but she threw me over for my heir.\u201d The mockery in his heavy-lidded eyes almost made her laugh, despite herself. \u201cDo you suppose that there\u2019s something intrinsically wrong with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA chess malady. The irrevocable inability to make a woman believe that he will love her more than the chess game. No woman wants to be ranked below a set of toys, Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Well, Mr. Cope, go forth and be wooed.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p> <p>The Tahitian Feast of Venus</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can make it downstairs,\u201d Harriet moaned. \u201cEverything hurts! I can\u2019t lift my arm. My bottom is in excruciating pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly go to the Feast of Venus by myself,\u201d Isidore said, looking a little panicked.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Isidore,\u201d Harriet said, laughing. \u201cYou look a bit nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only Villiers would get up from his sickbed! I think he\u2019s malingering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. He looked played out, and he\u2019s not the sort to lie down if he didn\u2019t have to. What are you worried about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLucille said that there is to be a dance performed by six virgins this evening. Apparently there were supposed to be twelve, but they couldn\u2019t locate another six girls who would agree to the label.\u201d</p><p>Harriet snorted. \u201cIt sounds dissolute enough that Strange will enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say that? Don\u2019t you like him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a typical male: arrogant, irrational, and rather snappish. He likes to make me feel like a fool. You should have seen how chagrined he was when I managed to prick him with the sword, though it was entirely his fault for insisting we didn\u2019t need rapier caps. At any rate, what\u2019s frightened you about the six virgins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe obvious,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cA French demi-rep put on some sort of impromptu performance here last month that involved a visiting sugar baron from the Americas. I am not ready to witness that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeither am I,\u201d Harriet said, pulling out a cravat so that Villiers\u2019s man could tie it for her. \u201cIf it looks as if the six virgins have found close friends, we\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should just eat in our room tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this the brave Isidore, who wanted to create a scandal large enough to bring the Duke of Cosway back from deepest Africa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to create a scandal and another to see six virgins losing their status.\u201d</p><p>Harriet couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI thought you were so sophisticated. Frighteningly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI put on a good show,\u201d Isidore said, with her lightning quick smile. \u201cBut in fact, I\u2019m a good daughter to my Catholic mother. She was very protective. I love to flirt but that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise I\u2019ll drag you out of the room if it looks as if the entertainment is turning salacious. I\u2019ll probably need you to rescue me, anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy? Is there a man after you?\u201d Isidore said. \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t have mentioned this, Harriet, but I have a funny feeling about Lord Strange.\u201d She lowered his voice. \u201cHe looks at you in such a way...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHe finds me incredibly irritating, but Villiers told him to look after me, so he has to do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Isidore said dubiously. \u201cAre you following what I\u2019m saying, Harriet? He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy problem is Kitty,\u201d Harriet interrupted.</p><p>\u201cKitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the Graces. Have you met them?\u201d</p><p>Isidore wrinkled her nose. \u201cI met Caliope. She has the biggest breasts I have ever seen, and she wears such a rigid corset that they swell up around her chin.\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed.</p><p>\u201cTruly! She must have a very short neck. What\u2019s Kitty like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery pretty, rather sweet, and\u2014and interested.\u201d</p><p>Isidore started hooting with laughter. \u201cYou have a suitor!\u201d</p><p>Harriet stood up, wincing from all her sore muscles, and looked at herself in the glass. Tonight she was wearing black silk breeches with a scarlet waistcoat marked with a border of embroidered silver chains. \u201cDo you think I look too gaudy? Finchley says that I can\u2019t possibly dress all in one color, though I think that the Duke of Fletcher looks wonderful when he does it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one wears a plain suit, except for Fletcher,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI like the embroidery on your waistcoat. It marks you as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Villiers, which is important. No one could think that Villiers would sneak a woman into Strange\u2019s house in disguise. What coat will you wear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVelvet,\u201d Harriet said, turning to the table where it was laid out. \u201cScarlet. I\u2019m a scarlet woman, in every sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely embroidery around the buttonholes,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI do wonder how I\u2019d look as a man. You look utterly delicious, Harriet. I\u2019m not at all surprised that Kitty is chasing you.\u201d</p><p>Harriet pulled on the scarlet coat and then glanced at herself. Even sore in every muscle, she looked\u2014well\u2014good.</p><p>Isidore appeared at her shoulder. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be insulted, but I think you make a lovely boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not insulted,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cJust sad that I can\u2019t dress like this at all times. I\u2019ve always disliked my hair, but I love it pulled back in a simple queue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could dress like this. It\u2019s merely a matter of eschewing ruffled and ribboned gowns for a more masculine style. You could set a new fashion!\u201d</p><p>Harriet shook her head but she couldn\u2019t stop herself from smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s just so ironic. I feel beautiful, for the first time in my life. But no one of the right sex is interested in me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to scare off Kitty by telling her you are mine and only mine? We should probably go downstairs now, Harriet. That gong went off at least an hour ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can manage Kitty,\u201d Harriet said, loving the fact that she didn\u2019t have to pick up a knotting bag or a shawl, but could just stroll from the room.</p><p>Povy was outside the ballroom doors when they arrived. \u201cThe entertainment is about to begin,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf you would be so kind as to stand in the back, I\u2019ll seat you shortly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Harriet said, remembering at the last minute to allow Isidore to walk through the door before her. As Duchess of Berrow, she was used to taking precedence over almost every woman below the level of nobility: it was hard to remember that a male always followed a female, with no regard for rank. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The company was assembled on rows of gilt chairs facing a raised platform stage, so Harriet and Isidore moved to stand behind the last row. One side of the ballroom was lined with tall narrow windows looking onto a formal garden. It was undoubtedly quite handsome in the summer, but at the moment it was a few degrees above arctic, due to a draft stealing under the windows.</p><p>On the stage a young woman glared furiously at the heavens. She flung out her arm and cried: \u201cBright star of Venus, fallen down on the earth, how may I reverently worship thee enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must be freezing,\u201d Isidore remarked, drawing her shawl closer around her shoulders.</p><p>The actress was wearing a gown made of twists of gauze, sewn all over with glittering bits of glass. Her hair was free and strung with glass beads.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lovely costume,\u201d Harriet whispered back. \u201cLook how her hair glitters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt shimmers with every shiver,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>Another woman appeared, wearing a crown and a scanty toga-like costume. \u201cHere be Venus of the sky. Ask me your request, fair maiden.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to be at least a little bit shocked,\u201d Isidore hissed. \u201cThis is like a bad masque at Court.\u201d</p><p>Harriet felt a pluck on her sleeve and turned to find Kitty beaming at her. \u201cCome join us,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI saved you a seat.\u201d</p> <p>Lord Strange appeared from nowhere and began speaking to Isidore. He didn\u2019t even greet Harriet, and when she glanced at them, he didn\u2019t raise his eyes.</p><p>Though obviously he knew she was standing there. Fine.</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d she said, interrupting whatever Strange was saying. Isidore was laughing and there wasn\u2019t a trace of worry on her face any more.</p><p>Strange was one of those men who made everyone in his vicinity fade away. He was standing there looking a bit tired, but burning with fierce intensity and she felt like\u2014</p><p>How ridiculous.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the duchess,\u201d Strange said, not bothering to greet Harriet properly. \u201cShe can join me in the front row. You trot off with the lovely Miss Kitty.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet ground her teeth. \u201cIf the ballet of the six virgins grows too risqu\u00e9, Isidore will not be comfortable in the front row.\u201d</p><p>Strange gave Isidore a wicked little half-smile. \u201cI\u2019ll leave it entirely up to her,\u201d he murmured in such an intimate way that Harriet felt her face grow a little hot. Not surprisingly, Isidore kissed Harriet goodbye with indecent haste.</p><p>\u201cYou go with your friend,\u201d she said brightly.</p><p>Kitty had returned to her seat and was beckoning in an extremely unsubtle manner.</p><p>\u201cWhat a lucky young man you are,\u201d Strange murmured. He took Isidore\u2019s arm. \u201cI fancy Mr. Cope will occupy himself this evening, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Isidore smiled at him. \u201cI don\u2019t use the title. Please, you must call me Isidore.\u201d</p><p>Harriet forced herself to walk away without looking back. Strange wasn\u2019t for her. By all appearances, he was interested in Isidore, which was good for Isidore\u2019s plan.</p><p>She felt a tinge of sympathy when she realized that her seat turned out to be next to Nell. Poor Nell, in love with Strange and soon to be disappointed, it seemed.</p> <p>\u201cDid you give him a letter from me?\u201d Nell whispered eagerly.</p><p>On the stage, Venus seemed to be rather angry about something. \u201cI fear the sparkling majesty that issues from your most imperial eyes,\u201d the maiden said, falling to her knees.</p><p>\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Harriet whispered back.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he say? Is he coming to my bed tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nell\u2019s eyes were shining the way Kitty\u2019s did when she looked at Harriet. Both Nell and Kitty had woefully misplaced affections. At the moment, for example, Kitty was almost leaning on Harriet\u2019s shoulder, although she was pretending to be interested in the histrionic acting on the stage.</p><p>\u201cI tried to be more subtle,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI sent him the first two lines of a poem, and I\u2019ll give him two more tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Nell looked unconvinced. \u201cWhat did the poem say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark is my delight,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>When Nell smiled, her whole face transformed from an almost plain collection of features to something truly enchanting. \u201cLovely!\u201d she said. Then she leaned over and whispered in her ear. \u201cI told Kitty that you were the heir to a coal mine, so be sure and act like it.\u201d</p><p>Harriet goggled at her. \u201cYou what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that you needed it,\u201d Nell said, smothering a giggle. \u201cShe\u2019s got a stupendous attraction to you.\u201d She bent over and whispered in Harriet\u2019s ear. \u201cShe says you\u2019re a gentleman of voluptuous beauty. Voluptuous! What a word to use for a man.\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s heart sank. She wasn\u2019t voluptuous even in female clothing. At that very moment Kitty\u2019s hand crept onto Harriet\u2019s knee. Harriet nearly jumped out of her seat and whipped her head around, only to meet Kitty\u2019s naughty little smile.</p><p>She picked up Kitty\u2019s hand and moved it firmly off her knee; Kitty pouted but didn\u2019t say anything, so Harriet looked straight ahead and pretended to be following the performance.</p><p>Venus was gone, replaced by two more shivering, wailing virgins...Who knew that Lord Strange\u2019s disreputable house parties were so tedious?</p><p>Isidore and Lord Strange left after ten minutes, but Harriet didn\u2019t think it had anything to do with the six mournful virgins. More likely, Isidore was bored.</p><p>She was bored.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d she whispered to Kitty, when the six virgins had been joined by six extremely scantily clad young men. Harriet fancied she could see their goose-bumps from her seat.</p><p>\u201cI think there might be a more interesting part coming,\u201d Kitty whispered back. She hadn\u2019t taken her eyes off the stage since the male actors appeared.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow,\u201d Harriet said firmly.</p><p>She escaped just as one of the virgins collapsed into her male counterpart\u2019s arms. Harriet could only be glad that at least they would be able to share a little warmth.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>The Leaning Brothel of Fonthill</p><p>February 7, 1784</p><p>H e walked into her room the next morning with hardly a knock on the door, but Harriet was ready this time. She was up and dressed, casually seated in an armchair reading, as though she hadn\u2019t flung herself there two seconds before.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Strange said, coming up short.</p><p>She rose, smiling, as if men strode into her bedchamber regularly. \u201cAre you ready to go, sir?\u201d she asked, ignoring the fact that her bottom throbbed like a pincushion at the very thought of a saddle.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he barked.</p><p>He looked angry again. Obviously, something about her made him peevish. Harriet thought about ill manners all the way down the staircase. Benjamin used to feel free to be very ill-mannered as well.</p><p>But she had been trained that a lady should never exert her moods over other people. And she had adhered to that plan for years, never snapping at the people who obliquely blamed her for Benjamin\u2019s suicide, no matter how pestilently rude she felt they were being.</p><p>Strange leapt onto his horse with a sort of boyish enthusiasm that she found attractive, despite herself.</p><p>Or perhaps it was the way the muscles in his legs bulged when he settled on the horse.</p><p>That was one thing about attending a party notorious for its illicit liaisons: the atmosphere lent itself to frank assessments of bodily charms. There was a great deal about Lord Strange that Harriet found attractive. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When they reached the beginning of the road, Strange rose slightly in his stirrups, bringing his horse to a trot. Harriet eyed him from behind, and revised her opinion. What she felt went beyond attraction.</p><p>She felt almost helpless in the face of the desire she felt. It was...ravenous. As if she would do anything to caress him, to touch him.</p><p>And never mind the fact that he thought she was an effeminate male whose company he could hardly stand.</p><p>She gathered up her reins and urged her horse to a trot. Not to put too fine a point on it, the first blow of the saddle as the horse started trotting made her want to scream. But she wedged her boots into the stirrups and tried to hover above the saddle. It worked\u2014kind of. It was much better once her horse lengthened her stride and started galloping. She bounced along in opposite rhythm to the horse and it wasn\u2019t nearly as painful.</p> <p>In fact, she actually found herself leaning over the horse\u2019s neck and beginning to enjoy herself, barring the icy wind whistling in her teeth and squealing in her ears.</p><p>Strange waited for her at the end of the road. Harriet pulled up her horse, her chest heaving.</p><p>\u201cBetter,\u201d he said. He wheeled his horse and started back the way he came.</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Harriet muttered, staring after him. Didn\u2019t he say yesterday that the horses needed to walk after a gallop? Finally she took out after him. If she paused even for a moment, the cold ate at her bones. The ground whirled by at her feet, frozen clods of brown earth flying from the horse\u2019s hooves, thin ice cracking.</p><p>It felt wonderful.</p> <p>Her heart was pounding, blood thumping through her veins. She suddenly realized that she hadn\u2019t felt this alive in\u2014oh\u2014years.</p><p>Since Benjamin died, perhaps before Benjamin died. It was as if she had been living in cotton wool, and suddenly the wooly blanket lifted and the world flared out around her, brilliant, full of life, color, and movement. A jay started out from a bush; she caught the tail of a rabbit bounding under a hedgerow.</p><p>At the entrance to Strange\u2019s drive, she hauled on the reins. Her mare had enjoyed the run, and slowed to a walk with a few graceless, stiff-legged movements that jolted every one of Harriet\u2019s bruises. But she was too interested in Strange\u2019s house to do more than wince.</p><p>It was the first time she\u2019d really looked at it. It was a child\u2019s drawing of a country house, a castle and a house in one. Part of it gleamed in proper Portland stone, but the bit to the right looked like the left-over parts of a medieval castle without a turret.</p><p>Then there was a wing extending to the left that sprawled low to the ground, with greenhouses sprouting from it like spokes on a wheel. And finally there was a tower-like affair that must be the famous reproduction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa\u2014except she didn\u2019t think the famous Italian tower leaned quite this much. It was made of brick, with a little brass peaked hat on top.</p><p>It looked dangerous.</p> <p>A smoky voice said, \u201cYou\u2019re frowning at my tower. Would you like to see it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really did design that?\u201d</p><p>For the first time since she\u2019d met him, Strange\u2019s eyes lit up with something more than lazy appreciation or sarcasm.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take a look.\u201d And without waiting for an answer, he directed his horse through the archway.</p><p>Harriet shook her freezing fingers and picked up the reins.</p><p>Up close, the tower was made of bricks, with a wooden door. It leaned in an alarming fashion. In fact, it didn\u2019t exactly lean: it toppled. It looked like a tree forced out over the edge of a cliff by repeated winter storms. It looked like a drunk man falling to the ground.</p><p>It looked, in short, like certain death.</p><p>Strange was already off his horse and unlocking the door when Harriet arrived.</p> <p>\u201cCome on,\u201d he said over his shoulder, disappearing inside.</p><p>Harriet looked down. She had never dismounted without assistance. Ladies didn\u2019t. And Nick, her favorite groom, who had boosted her into place with plenty of whispered bits of advice that morning, was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Grunting a little from her sore muscles, she pulled her right boot out of the stirrup and tried to slide to the ground.</p><p>She ended up falling with a wallop onto the frozen ground just as Strange came back into the doorway.</p><p>She quickly scrambled to her feet.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the worst horseman I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d he said, in a not unfriendly tone of voice. \u201cAnd yet you ride quite well in a neck-or-nothing sort of way. Didn\u2019t your mother let you on a horse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy\u2014\u201d Harriet said, before remembering that Villiers had given her a sickly mother in the country. \u201cMy mother is afraid of horseflesh,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat shall I do with the reins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust put them down. My horses are extremely well trained. You see how my horse is simply waiting for me? Yours will do the same.\u201d</p><p>Harriet put the reins down and stepped back. Her horse, being no fool, instantly decided that she would rather be in the nice snug stables, and set off in that direction.</p><p>In a hurry.</p><p>Harriet didn\u2019t see any need to comment on it, so she walked past Strange, leaving him muttering some interesting curse words behind her.</p><p>She stopped short inside the tower. It was one round room, and rather than having floors, the ceiling simply receded and receded, so Harriet felt dizzy when she looked up and saw the roof veering off to the left.</p><p>The room was hung with great swaths of watered apricot silk. It had only two pieces of furniture: a large bed hung with matching gauze, and a solid oak desk piled with papers. It looked like an odd cross between a Turkish harem and the chambers of a solicitor.</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting?\u201d Strange said, appearing next to her. \u201cI pressured the vector to the most extreme that it could manage in terms of weight-bearing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like looking up a crooked chimney pipe,\u201d Harriet said, ignoring the bed and looking upward again.</p><p>\u201cIf you calculate the angles, Cope, you\u2019ll see that I achieve around a sixty-three-percent lean by fifty percent of the extension. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Harriet said bluntly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dangerous. I calculated the weight of the bricks very carefully against the slant of the tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure you did. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not dangerous,\u201d he said in a controlled voice that told her other sensible souls had pointed out the same thing. \u201cThe servants don\u2019t like to come near, and so I allow them their foibles. But any educated man has to recognize that the science of engineering dictates exactly what a building can and cannot do, in terms of angles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo windows?\u201d Harriet enquired.</p><p>\u201cThey altered the weight-bearing properties of the bricks.\u201d</p><p>In other words, Harriet translated, the whole thing would have collapsed into a pile of dust.</p><p>\u201cThe tower in Pisa has been standing since the 1170s,\u201d Strange said. He strode over and struck a flint to light a lantern hanging from a little hook. It cast a golden light over his shoulders that served to remind Harriet how cold she was.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t say anything to affirm his brilliance in tower-building, he added: \u201cIn the summer, Eugenia and I often picnic here.\u201d</p><p>She swung around from examining a couple of bricks she was sure were about to crumble into each other. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour daughter should never be in this tower. Ever. It\u2019s one thing if you want to put your own life at risk\u2014\u201d and mine, she added silently \u201c\u2014but your daughter should not come within a hundred feet of this building.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her with a scowl. \u201cVilliers tells me that you spent your life so far under the wing of your mother. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, Cope, but if you want to be a goer, you\u2019ll have to stop parroting your mother.\u201d He imitated her voice. \u201cIt\u2019s too cold. It\u2019s too dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it makes you more dashing to put a child in danger? How interesting that you don\u2019t force the servants to risk their lives in your creation. I really should make notes. To wit: manhood, achieved by risking nurslings but not underlings.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are an ass,\u201d he bit out.</p><p>Harriet felt a thrill. No man had ever called her an ass. No doubt Benjamin thought she was an ass, but he would never say such a thing to a lady.</p><p>\u201cYou too,\u201d she said cordially. He seemed shocked at the broad smile she gave him. \u201cDon\u2019t ever allow your daughter in this tower, or near it, again. You love her too much. Why risk a broken heart?\u201d</p><p>She caught his eye just long enough to make sure her words sank in and then stepped back out into the frosty air.</p><p>\u201cOne final point,\u201d she said. \u201cThat room is kitted up like a brothel. While it\u2019s enterprising of you to recreate that charming atmosphere on your own grounds, why on earth would you introduce your child to it?\u201d</p> <p>A look of pure rage crossed his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not a brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you pick those hangings yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2014\u201d He bit the words off.</p><p>\u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said, enjoying herself enormously. \u201cYou asked for help from a London firm whose last employment was in a courtesan\u2019s boudoir.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMiss Bessie LaMott arranged for the hangings,\u201d he said through gritted teeth. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t think of it as a brothel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect Bessie just reproduced the environment she knew best,\u201d Harriet said kindly.</p><p>He strode over to his horse and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ride behind me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet took a look at his lean, muscled body and felt a qualm that had nothing to do with being a man, and everything to do with being a woman. \u201cI can walk. I feel much warmer, just from being out of the wind for a bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. Eugenia will be waiting to watch our fencing lesson.\u201d From his tone, he couldn\u2019t wait to face her with a sword in his hand. Strange swung into his saddle and then looked at her. \u201cI suppose you can\u2019t get up without assistance.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to want to touch her, which was a little hurtful. But Harriet was starting to shiver all over, so she just shook her head.</p><p>He stuck out his hand. She went over to him, put her hand in his, and then looked up. \u201cWhat next?\u201d</p><p>He was staring down at their hands. Her hand was engulfed in his, of course. \u201cWhat next?\u201d she repeated. \u201cShould you take your foot out of the stirrup so I can get up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d he said.</p><p>He gave a great heave. She flew through the air and landed just behind his saddle with a muffled shriek. The horse\u2019s rump sloped backward, so she edged forward until she was actually sitting on the raised end of his saddle. It caused her to be plastered against his back, but at least there she had a chance of staying on the horse.</p><p>\u201cLet go of my shoulders!\u201d he said irritably.</p><p>\u201cI clutched them in an effort to stop myself flying into the next county,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cYou scream like a woman,\u201d he said, obviously disgusted.</p><p>She had the impulse to pinch him hard, but she controlled it. The horse didn\u2019t even seem to notice her weight. He was prancing, eager to return to the stables. \u201cYou left your horse standing in the cold after a run,\u201d she said pointedly.</p><p>\u201cI was just thinking the same thing,\u201d he said, his voice rueful. \u201cHorses, servants, children. I\u2019m afraid that I get excited by this sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTowers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe engineering that goes into them. The calculations. The other day I figured out how we could put a false floor in the ballroom.\u201d</p><p>Harriet let a moment go by before she asked the obvious. \u201cAnd the false floor would be good for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a banquet table,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been interesting, but I\u2019m afraid that Eugenia has your hard-headed approach. I threw the calculations away.\u201d</p><p>He was terrifyingly likeable when he was rueful and in love with his crazed engineering feats.</p><p>\u201cDo you have to sit so close to me?\u201d he asked, with an edge in his voice that made her forget that she ever liked him.</p><p>\u201cHow exactly do you think that I\u2019m supposed to sit behind you, on the saddle, without being close?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry moving backwards,\u201d he said, very unfriendly. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice space of the horse\u2019s rear to sit on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it,\u201d Harriet said, enjoying herself. So he didn\u2019t like her because she was too effeminate? Rank prejudice. Why, her mother\u2019s curate, Mr. Periwinkle, was remarkably effeminate. He smelled like a flower and believed that life was always better with a cup of tea. Lord Strange probably wouldn\u2019t want to shake his hand.</p><p>She snuggled closer. It was good for him to feel uncomfortable. In fact, she would be grinning except her face was too frozen to move. It would be good for Lord Strange if he had to get to know someone\u2014a man\u2014who was a little different than he was.</p><p>The man was set in his ways. Obsessed with manliness. Mr. Periwinkle enjoyed arranging dried flowers. And he gave lovely sermons about the lilies of the field. Everyone adored him.</p><p>The horse started climbing the hill toward the front of the house. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I put my arms around you, do you?\u201d she shouted against the wind.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>So she just put her arms around his waist.</p><p>His body stiffened.</p><p>Her grin died a moment later. Strange\u2019s body was large and fierce and male, in a way that played fiddlesticks with her pleasure in Mr. Periwinkle\u2019s company.</p><p>She could feel coiled muscle and steel, even through his greatcoat. It was dangerous to have her hands on him. It felt like nothing she\u2019d experienced before. It felt heady, warm, crazed. It made her think about the bawdy songs in Kitty\u2019s book, the ones that talked about a woman folding a man in her arms and kissing him over and over.</p><p>It must be the influence of Strange\u2019s degenerate household, with Kitty and Nell and all the rest of them pursuing their desires without the slightest concern for consequences, or reputation, or society. If she weren\u2019t a duchess...</p><p>If she were just Mr. Cope, young Harry who had no last responsibilities and no history, she would throw away caution.</p><p>She would...</p><p>The horse stopped in the courtyard and Strange was off the horse so fast that she slid forward onto the saddle, into the space left by his warm body. He looked up at her, his eyebrow cocked disdainfully.</p><p>She looked back at him steadily until the scorn faded in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you still wish to fence?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d He turned away, and Nick came running toward her.</p><p>\u201cI was that worried when your horse came home alone, miss,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m all right. It was Strange\u2019s fault; he told me to drop the reins because his horses were so perfectly trained that they would stay in place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there\u2019s some that will do it,\u201d the boy said fairly. \u201cBut not many in this weather. So you didn\u2019t fall off, then?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, and your tips helped. I think I know how to manage a gallop, though trotting is a terrible thing to endure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we could get up really early one morning and I could show you how to manage a trot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d hate to get you up so early,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m already up. But night may be better. That way you wouldn\u2019t be riding with me, and then with Lord Strange. He might notice. But we should start with mounting a horse. It\u2019s a miracle he hasn\u2019t seen the way you climb your mount like a rocky hillside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps even tonight?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for you in the stables. There\u2019s generally no one around so it should be safe.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a quick smile. \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><p>Strange was waiting for her at the door. \u201cYou\u2019re very friendly with that stable boy.\u201d His tone was unfriendly again.</p><p>\u201cHis name is Nick, and I like him,\u201d she said, walking past Strange to get into the warmth.</p><p>\u201cYou like him?\u201d Strange said.</p><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cHe\u2019s nice.\u201d But the only thing on her mind was how to get warm without losing her manhood. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, I\u2019m going to take a piss.\u201d She managed to walk half the way up the stairs, but then broke into a run. When she got to her chamber she dashed across the room and dove under the quilt, leaving only her boots sticking off the bed.</p> <p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Lucille exclaimed, coming over. \u201cAre you all right? Are you ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCold,\u201d Harriet said with chattering teeth. \u201cSo cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk,\u201d Lucille clucked. She ran over and got another quilt and piled it on top of Harriet. \u201cYou\u2019ll be catching your death, riding around on a morning like this. Why, the Duchess of Cosway isn\u2019t even out of her bed yet. She\u2019s just breakfasting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can have my hot chocolate,\u201d Isidore said, appearing in the doorway. \u201cHave you been pounding around on freezing roadways for hours?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe-ess,\u201d Harriet said from under the covers. \u201cMy horse went home alone and I had to ride behind Strange and it was so cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSit up and drink this chocolate,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cThe cup is nice and hot.\u201d</p><p>Harriet finally did, gratefully curling her fingers around the mug.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s next in the life of a gentleman?\u201d Isidore asked.</p> <p>\u201cFencing again,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cFighting with rapiers. He makes me take my jacket off and it\u2019s bloody cold up there in those galleries. The man must have cold blood, like a reptile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarriet!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard you swear. I think all this masculinity is rubbing off on you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like riding,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine, Isidore. It\u2019s all different with men. You know how we perch in the side-saddle and then pick our way down the road?\u201d</p><p>Isidore nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t often bother, but I know how.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen just fling themselves into the saddle and pound down the road\u2014so fast the wind blows their hair directly back. They don\u2019t wear a wig because it wouldn\u2019t stay on. They just go. It\u2019s sweaty and tiring, but afterwards you feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWatch out,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cYou\u2019ll end up dressing like this forever. You know, everyone always says that Lord Findleshanks is really a woman. Did you ever look at him closely? He does look like a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a beard,\u201d Harriet pointed out.</p><p>\u201cSo did my grandmother.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swung out of bed. \u201cI have to meet Strange for fencing practice. Ouch!\u201d She rubbed her bottom.</p><p>\u201cI am going back to my bed,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cStrange lent me a book of poetry.\u201d She paused for a moment. \u201cDo you still dislike him?\u201d</p><p>Harriet shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s acceptable. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he\u2019s interesting,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cReally interesting.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked at her. \u201cYou are married, Isidore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so anyone would notice,\u201d Isidore said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about Strange,\u201d Isidore said. Harriet noticed with a pulse of alarm that her eyes were almost dreamy\u2014and Isidore never looked dreamy. \u201cHe walks into the room and everyone notices. I like being with a man like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he is the host,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure he really knows who some of his guests are. Have you noticed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPovy reads him a list of his new guests every night,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cLucille told me about it.\u201d</p><p>Lucille popped her head in from the adjoining room. \u201cDo you need me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Lord Strange know who his guests are?\u201d Isidore asked. \u201cYou said that Povy is in charge of informing him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, Strange does and doesn\u2019t,\u201d Lucille said. \u201cHe may hear about them, but that doesn\u2019t mean he always knows who they are, if you see what I mean. This is a big house. That run of scientists in the east wing, for example. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t know all of them.\u201d</p><p>There was a short knock on the door, a knock that Harriet was getting to know. Isidore gave a shriek as it opened. Harriet turned and looked at her through Strange\u2019s eyes.</p><p>Isidore was in dishabille, a sweep of curling black hair matching her eyelashes. Her nightgown was everything Harriet\u2019s wasn\u2019t. It could never be mistaken for a man\u2019s.</p><p>A smile of greeting appeared in Isidore\u2019s eyes for one second, before she gave another little shriek (entirely unnecessary, to Harriet\u2019s mind) and disappeared into the room next door, slamming the connecting door.</p><p>Harriet had never realized that a woman\u2019s legs could be seen straight through the thin lawn of a nightgown.</p><p>Strange didn\u2019t seem to be ravaged by desire, but what did she know? He had an eyebrow raised. \u201cAn early morning visitor, Cope? You constantly surprise me,\u201d he said. His voice was unfriendly again.</p><p>But this time he had a reason. It probably looked as if she was intruding on the woman he had selected for an affaire, given his flirtation with Isidore the previous night.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cFriends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, friends.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence while Harriet thought desperately. \u201cShe\u2019s my\u2014my mother\u2019s goddaughter. I\u2019ve known her for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor years. How lucky.\u201d There was something inscrutable in his face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWhen my mother was ill, Isidore was often the only person who visited for months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready for breakfast? I instructed the staff to put out a side of red beef for you and a good tankard of ale, of course. And Eugenia is eager to watch our lesson.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet groaned inwardly. The beef she could manage, barely, but she truly disliked the beer.</p><p>This time the fencing lesson went much better. Without saying a word, Strange put caps on the rapiers, which made Harriet feel more comfortable. She managed to keep a hand on her blade and even parried a pass in tierce.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you the prise de fer next,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>He walked behind her and reached around her body to hold her sword. \u201cLook,\u201d he said, \u201ctilt your wrist like this, put your right foot at an angle.\u201d He nudged her leg to get it into the right position.</p> <p>Surely he didn\u2019t have to have his arms around her to demonstrate this move? His hand brushed Harriet\u2019s breast. Of course, her breasts were firmly wrapped in bandages, so there was nothing feminine for him to discover.</p><p>Still, she jumped away and turned, rapier on the ready. The truth was that every time he touched her, Harriet felt heat rushing up and down her body.</p><p>Eugenia sat behind a glass cabinet and called out instructions. Harriet couldn\u2019t help turning around and smiling at her, for all Strange insisted that she keep her attention on the rapier.</p><p>Eugenia was a strange little girl, with a huge mop of undisciplined hair and an old-fashioned quality about her. To all appearances, she had never played with a child her own age, and it showed. She spoke with all the quaint rhythm of the plays she loved to read.</p><p>Just when Harriet started to get tired, Strange said that they should try a match again. She leaned against the cabinet next to her and tried to catch her breath. \u201cAre you sure, sir?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou are injured from yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSir?\u201d he said. \u201cYou drew blood yesterday; I think we might as well be on intimate terms. I like to be called Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your given name is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBuried in the mists of time,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your given name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarry,\u201d Harriet said. Suddenly this was all making her nervous. Strange\u2014or Jem\u2014kept coming up behind her, pulling her arms into the right angles. It made her knees weak. Having his lean, muscular body, clad only in thin breeches and a white shirt, touch hers made her skin flare. She kept beating back an all-over body blush.</p><p>This was so dangerous.</p><p>Strange\u2014or Jem\u2014strode into position in the middle of the room.</p> <p>\u201cEugenia, you stay behind the case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Papa,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind, but I\u2019m going to cheer for Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Strange said, shifting his rapier from hand to hand. Harriet couldn\u2019t help it. She looked at the muscles in his legs and nearly groaned\u2014and it wasn\u2019t all her sore muscles this time. \u201cCome on, Harry. Feeling a touch of fear?\u201d</p><p>She walked forward and fell into a defensive position. Strange began circling her, his eyes fixed on her face, a little smile curling the corner of his lips.</p><p>\u201cDown with him, Harry!\u201d Eugenia called excitedly. \u201cDown with him, down with him!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI only know one attack,\u201d Harriet complained. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really fair.\u201d</p><p>Strange tensed his shoulder, and Harriet raised her rapier to blunt his attack. Unfortunately he spun in a circle and came in from the opposite direction. His blade stopped a hair\u2019s breadth from her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cNot fair,\u201d she grumbled, falling back a step. \u201cYou\u2019ve never described such a move.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did watch my shoulder,\u201d he said, starting to circle again. \u201cYou\u2019re not a total loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you must have some sort of hunter\u2019s obsession,\u201d she said, turning to keep always in front of him. \u201cAre you one of those men who spend hours loping through the woods with dead creatures slung over your shoulder?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy, Harry,\u201d he said softly, \u201cyou\u2019re surprising me again. I thought you were an avid hunter. I\u2019m sure you told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumph,\u201d Harriet said. Her arm was tired, and the rapier felt as if it weighed at least three stone. It was taking everything she had just to keep it to waist level. She had to try to attack. So without thinking about it very much she just stabbed forward.</p><p>His sword blocked hers instantly, moving so fast that she didn\u2019t even see it. The shock of the two swords coming together went right through her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cTo him again,\u201d called Eugenia. \u201cCut him in the leg, Harry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe quiet, you bloodthirsty child,\u201d Strange said. He had turned his head to Eugenia, so Harriet took advantage and raised her rapier to his throat, stopping an inch from his skin.</p><p>\u201cHa!\u201d she said.</p><p>He turned his head to look at her. \u201cFoul play, Harry?\u201d</p><p>There was something in his eyes...she let the rapier fall. Could Isidore be right? Could it be that Strange was interested in her\u2014as a man? \u201cI\u2019m finished for today,\u201d she said, turning around to sheath her rapier.</p><p>When she straightened, she glanced back at Strange to find that he was staring at her bottom.</p><p>A little shiver ran through her. This was not good. It was one thing for Kitty to be leaning up against her, and another for a man like Strange to be thinking...whatever he was thinking.</p><p>\u201cI think you should just aim that sword a little lower and stab him in the leg,\u201d Eugenia said, running up to her.</p><p>\u201cYou are bloodthirsty,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cThat\u2019s your father you\u2019re making into my pincushion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have another letter for me?\u201d Strange asked.</p><p>She handed it over and he ripped it open, waving it in the air.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you could ask my secret correspondent to be a little less generous with her perfume?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Harriet said. She\u2019d used Isidore\u2019s best French perfume.</p><p>\u201cMy music\u2019s in the night,\u201d Strange read aloud, \u201cSo is the nightingale\u2019s. Nice. Brief yet evocative. And it rhymes with yesterday\u2019s delight and night.\u201d</p><p>Harriet shot Strange a look. \u201cYour letters are hardly suitable reading for a young girl.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that entirely. \u201cSo, Harry, do you have any sense what my mystery correspondent wants from me?\u201d</p><p>Harriet frowned at him. \u201cI have no idea,\u201d she said, thinking his question as unsuitable for Eugenia\u2019s ears as was the poem.</p><p>\u201cShe wants your company, Papa,\u201d Eugenia said.</p><p>Strange grinned at her. \u201cI agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a love poem,\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cOr something along those lines,\u201d Strange agreed.</p><p>\u201cI think she wants to meet you at night,\u201d Eugenia persisted.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Harriet said brightly, \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll have to wait until the poem is complete to find out precisely what the poetess requests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLove,\u201d Eugenia said flatly. \u201cMy governess was in love with Papa for a long time, but she finally gave up. He\u2019s not easy to catch. Do you want to see the calculations I did last night, Harry? I stayed up til really late but I figured out all the angles on my dollhouse roof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow late?\u201d Harriet said, before she thought.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pitiful,\u201d Strange said. \u201cI can hear your mother speaking every time you open your mouth. It may be impossible to turn you into a man, Harry, if you don\u2019t mind me pointing it out. Eugenia is perfectly capable of taking care of herself.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see your calculations,\u201d Harriet said to Eugenia, ignoring him. He was a fool to let his eight-year-old daughter stay up half the night parsing calculations but at least that explained the odd gray shadows under Eugenia\u2019s eyes. She almost looked ill.</p><p>Eugenia reached up and took her hand and even though Harriet was longing for a bath and a nap, she let herself be drawn past the barrier of the footman into the locked wing of the house.</p><p>\u201cWho lives here besides you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Eugenia said blithely. \u201cThat is, there\u2019s always a maid with me, of course. Papa likes to keep me safe, so there\u2019s always a footman on guard.\u201d</p> <p>But when they got to the nursery, it was deserted.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your maid?\u201d Harriet said, looking around. The fire was burning low.</p><p>\u201cShe must have gone downstairs for a bit,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cMy governess will probably be here any moment. She\u2019s in love with one of the footmen, so I always know where she is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKissing the footman, of course,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cThey kiss in the knife closet on the second floor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow on earth do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet nodded. Then she squatted down, suppressing a groan over her cramped muscles, and allowed Eugenia to show her the angle of every wall and roof on her three-story dollhouse.</p><p>\u201cDid you demonstrate all the angles for your father?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cPapa? No, Papa designed my house, so he knows the angles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean, did you figure out the angles because it will make him happy?\u201d</p> <p>Eugenia looked at her with the clear, surprised eyes of childhood. \u201cWhy would that make him happy? It makes me happy.\u201d</p><p>Harriet, put in her place, began to sort out the tiny furniture that was toppled this way and that within the house.</p><p>\u201cDo you have a cat?\u201d Eugenia asked, sitting down next to her.</p><p>\u201cI have a dog,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHe is a silly old spaniel named Mrs. Custard. Do you have a pet?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know very much about animals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing much to know. You feed them; they love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they need to run outside. And I\u2019m in my room so often. It wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must go outside, don\u2019t you? A dog would be happy to be inside with you and then go outside for some exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Eugenia frowned down at her little house. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want an animal locked in my room. He might start to hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he wouldn\u2019t! If my spaniel, Mrs. Custard, were here, you\u2019d see how much he would love it. He would curl up in front of the fire and be perfectly happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, he might be cold. I\u2019ll add another log to the fire,\u201d Eugenia said, getting up.</p><p>\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Harriet said, hurrying after her. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do that yourself, are you?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia cast her a pitying look. \u201cOf course I am, Harry. You do know how to feed a fire, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI leave it to the footmen,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t be doing it either. What if your skirts caught a spark?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey never do,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI\u2019m very careful.\u201d And before Harriet could stop her she picked up a small log and tossed it on the fire. A huge burst of sparks sprang into the air and slid up the chimney. \u201cI like it when that happens,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to speak to your father,\u201d Harriet said, pulling on the bell cord. \u201cWhere are your governess and the maid? What if there was a fire in this room, Eugenia?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do sound like a mother!\u201d Eugenia said, giggling. \u201cPapa never worries the way you do. I\u2019d run out of the room, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the hallway is locked,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIs there another exit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the only way out, but the footman is always there. Or do you mean a secret passage?\u201d Eugenia\u2019s face lit up. \u201cI never thought of that.\u201d She instantly started walking around the room and peering at the wainscoting. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she added, pulling at a carved knob on the elaborate fireplace, \u201cI have a plan for escape in case I need it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia nodded toward the window. \u201cI\u2019ll go out that window. There\u2019s a huge oak tree there, and I\u2019m sure I could scramble down without any problem.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked out the window. The oak tree was a good two feet away and she wasn\u2019t sure that even she would be able to jump to it.</p><p>\u201cYou look so fidgety,\u201d Eugenia said, giving up her search for a secret door. \u201cTell me more about Mrs. Custard, please. That\u2019s a strange name for a boy dog.\u201d</p><p>So Harriet did.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>In Which Harriet Finds Herself Shocked</p><p>D inner that night was a formal affair. Rather to Harriet\u2019s surprise, she found that she was seated toward the head of the table, with Isidore between herself and Strange. Kitty was to Harriet\u2019s left.</p><p>\u201cHow are you?\u201d Kitty whispered with an effusive smile. \u201cDid you have a good day? We practiced for our next performance. We\u2019re going to sing madrigals for a bishop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadrigals for a bishop?\u201d Harriet said, spreading her napkin in her lap.</p><p>Kitty started giggling madly, so much so that she couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>There was something about being dressed in men\u2019s clothes that made Harriet far less patient, she was discovering.</p><p>\u201cHe wants us dressed as little angels,\u201d Kitty finally managed to say.</p><p>\u201cAngels singing before a bishop. I suppose it makes sense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut wait until you see our costumes,\u201d Kitty said. \u201cIt must be very warm in Heaven, if you understand me.\u201d</p><p>She gave Harriet her practiced, naughty smile.</p><p>Harriet smiled back, rather more stiffly. \u201cDo you have wings?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, really lovely ones, made of real feathers. Lord Strange has a French secretary who helped with the costumes. The wings are so soft and pretty. At one point we take them off and actually lie down on them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLie down?\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>Kitty leaned closer. \u201cI could give you a private rehearsal if you wished, Harry. I couldn\u2019t sing a madrigal without three of us, but I could sing another love song.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say rehearsal?\u201d Strange said from the head of the table. \u201cAre you discussing the angel performance? I would love to see that.\u201d</p><p>She instantly gave him the same dimpled smile that she had just bestowed on Harriet. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to include you, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsidore,\u201d Strange said, turning to her with a touch on her arm, \u201cwould you be interested in seeing a private concert given by an angel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Isidore said, but Harriet could tell from her voice that she didn\u2019t like the idea.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I already have an appointment after supper,\u201d Harriet said quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d Strange said, looking at her from under his lids. \u201cNow who could that be with?\u201d He looked down the long, glittering table, lined with people more beautiful than noble. \u201cNell, perhaps?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet gave him a cool little smile. \u201cThere are so many people in your house that it\u2019s difficult to enumerate one\u2019s acquaintances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter your appointment, then,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI stay up quite late and I\u2019ll warrant Kitty does as well. Shall we say eleven o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><p>All the stable boy mentioned was learning how to trot. And mount. How long could that take?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure Kitty will want to stay up so late,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIt sounds as if she had a strenuous day\u2019s exercise.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s not so strenuous,\u201d Kitty said with a giggle. \u201cI spent a great deal of it on my back.\u201d</p><p>The little line between Isidore\u2019s brow deepened. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I couldn\u2019t possibly join you at that hour,\u201d she said, politely enough. \u201cI\u2019m quite exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity,\u201d Strange said. He stopped looking at Harriet and gave Isidore a lavish smile. \u201cIt won\u2019t be nearly as enjoyable without you.\u201d</p><p>Harriet had a sudden, shocking realization. If Strange ever gave her that kind of smile, she would lose her composure. She might even beg him to take her to bed.</p><p>\u201cEleven o\u2019clock,\u201d Kitty said. \u201cWould you like more angels than just myself? I\u2019m sure\u2014\u201d she oogled Strange \u201c\u2014any number of Graces would love to perform tonight, Lord Strange. To sing madrigals, we need three.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think all we need tonight is you,\u201d Strange said smoothly.</p><p>Kitty erupted into giggles.</p><p>A thought occurred to Harriet. Something about what Kitty might be thinking. Her mouth fell open and at that same moment, Isidore\u2019s fingers dug into her arm.</p><p>\u201cI need to speak to you. At once!\u201d she hissed.</p><p>Strange was standing up, signaling a general move away from the table. He paused just for a moment. \u201cMy guests await, and you, Mr. Cope, have an appointment...Shall we say eleven o\u2019clock in the library? Mr. Povy can direct you.\u201d Without waiting for a response, he walked away.</p><p>Isidore\u2019s grip strengthened. \u201cHarriet!\u201d</p> <p>Harriet turned to Kitty, wanting to say something. But there was a deep excitement and\u2014yes\u2014enjoyment in Kitty\u2019s eyes that stopped the words in her mouth. Kitty was perfectly happy with the idea of Mr. Cope, Lord Strange, and one solitary angel. Harriet swallowed.</p><p>\u201cEleven o\u2019clock!\u201d Kitty said, trotting away.</p><p>Isidore dragged Harriet to the side of the room. \u201cDo you have any idea what Kitty is planning to do tonight, Harriet? Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just figured it out!\u201d Harriet said, panic making her head reel. \u201cI had no idea!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must stay in your room,\u201d Isidore stated. \u201cBetter: you can sleep with me in case Strange walks straight into your bedchamber.\u201d She looked around, but almost everyone had left the dining room. \u201cHarriet, this is a\u2014a degenerate house! These people are\u2014are\u2014they are doing things\u2014\u201d</p><p>Harriet couldn\u2019t help laughing a little. \u201cIsidore, you knew that. Why do you think that Jemma said she wouldn\u2019t come here, even though she\u2019d hosted all sorts of shocking parties in Paris? Her Paris events roused scandals because someone\u2019s costume was a bit risqu\u00e9, or a married woman paraded around with someone else\u2019s husband. Strange\u2019s reputation\u2014and his house parties\u2014are on a totally different scale.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand the reality of it. It makes me feel unclean to even be here! Where is Villiers? I thought he was supposed to protect us. Harriet, what are you going to do?\u201d Isidore\u2019s eyes were bright and alarmed.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to engage in any sort of hankypanky with an angel,\u201d Harriet said, practically. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about that. I\u2019ll figure something out. Perhaps I\u2019ll claim to be ill and just leave Strange and Kitty together.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh!\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI don\u2019t like him at all now, Harriet. I don\u2019t like it here. Two men and one woman.\u201d She shuddered. \u201cSo far I\u2019ve been bored to tears by half-clothed virgins and invited to hear madrigals sung by angels. I find the mixture of culture and nudity tedious. But you\u2019re having fun with Strange, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to do with Strange,\u201d Harriet said, though she was lying. It was Strange. Half her pleasure, perhaps more, came from the time she spent with him, fencing with rapiers, fencing with words. Of course, it wasn\u2019t a real attraction. The pleasure had to be coming from the fact it was all so illicit to hunger for a man who didn\u2019t even think of her as a woman.</p><p>Not that she would ever consider going to that library to meet Strange\u2014and Kitty.</p><p>Not even to see Strange unclothed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s because of how much fun I\u2019m having in male clothing,\u201d she told Isidore. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so free before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to be this free,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI\u2019m turning more and more staid by the moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can lend you my breeches,\u201d Harriet suggested. And then: \u201cI forgot my appointment!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat appointment?\u201d Isidore exclaimed. \u201cNot another appointment with a woman, surely?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s at the stables,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cA very nice stableboy is going to teach me how to mount a horse properly. I keep almost falling off the other side.\u201d</p><p>Isidore rolled her eyes. \u201cI am going to bed. I think I may announce a case of infectious red spots tomorrow. Anything to keep the Graces out of my bedchamber. And Strange. I certainly don\u2019t want him bursting in on me while I\u2019m in my nightgown again. I hardly had my hair brushed.\u201d</p><p>Harriet watched her climb the stairs, thinking about just how much she\u2019d like Strange to visit her bedchamber, if he knew she was a woman.</p><p>She wouldn\u2019t care if her hair were brushed. She would just\u2014</p><p>She wrenched her mind away. That was foolishness.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Harriet\u2019s Shock, Part Two</p><p>T wo minutes later she was walking into the warm stable. It smelled of clean horses, leather, and manure. The horses poked their heads over their stalls and whickered for a carrot.</p><p>\u201cGood evening, Nick!\u201d she said, as the boy appeared around the end of the stable. \u201cThis is so very kind of you. You must be exhausted after a day\u2019s labor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me good deed for the day, miss,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother would never forgive me if I let you be discovered.\u201d He hesitated.</p><p>Harriet smiled at him. \u201cYou very likely want to give me a warning about Lord Strange\u2019s establishment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnyone can tell, miss,\u201d he burst out, \u201cthat you\u2019re not the usual sort of woman who stays at the house. It\u2019s not the place for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a widow,\u201d she said. \u201cI promise you that I\u2019m not shocked, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried is one thing,\u201d he said stubbornly. \u201cBut you\u2019re a lady, and ladies don\u2019t have a place here.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling at that. She knew quite well that Isidore would agree with him. \u201cI promise you I won\u2019t stay even a moment if my disguise is uncovered,\u201d she said. \u201cWould that make you feel better?\u201d</p><p>Then she leaned to kiss his cheek because he was\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But whatever thought she had flew from her head as the door at the end opened, letting in a swirl of snow and wind. She leapt back.</p><p>Strange stood in the door for a second, and then walked forward, throwing the door shut behind him. He pulled off his gloves, one by one, with a silent precision that contained as much threat as a tiger\u2019s slavering yowl.</p><p>\u201cGood evening,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI thought you were with your guests, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had the suspicion that I should watch you,\u201d he said. He turned his eyes onto young Nick. \u201cOff to your quarters, boy.\u201d</p> <p>Nick hesitated, throwing a worried glance at Harriet. She brought out the coin she saved for him. \u201cI\u2019m most grateful to you for your tutelage, Nick. Thank you. And I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ll\u2014\u201d he said, but stopped. Obviously, he needed the position, and she could see chivalry and terror warring in his face.</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d Strange said. There was something flat in his tone that made the boy turn and flee.</p><p>Harriet turned to face Strange. He\u2019d been irritable with her before, but now there was true rage burning in his eyes. He slapped his gloves into the palm of his hand with a noise like a gunshot.</p><p>\u201cIs there some way that I can help you?\u201d Harriet asked.</p> <p>\u201cDo you know, I thought the opposite?\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that I should watch over you, to make sure that you weren\u2019t beguiled by one of the scum that sometime float around the house. But I didn\u2019t realize that you would be a predator.\u201d</p><p>Harriet blinked at him. \u201cPredator? I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. But I take umbrage at the insult, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou take umbrage,\u201d he sneered. \u201cI catch you kissing my stable boy, a good boy, and giving him money, and you take umbrage?\u201d</p><p>She frowned at him. \u201cHe was helping me\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sort of help isn\u2019t allowed in my house,\u201d he said, and his voice was as chill as a frozen knife. \u201cNever. Under any circumstances. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA simple yes or no is enough. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>Harriet stood there for a moment trying to figure out if she did understand. The only possibility that came to mind was\u2014</p><p>Her mouth fell open and she could feel her eyes growing round. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t\u2014you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She spluttered. \u201cYou degenerate beast!\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of panting silence in the stable, and suddenly Strange threw back his head and started to laugh. The noise of it rang in the rafters and made the horses prick up their ears.</p><p>\u201cYou are a fiend,\u201d Harriet said, moving to walk past him. \u201cYour mind is as black as a privy. I\u2019ll leave these premises tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>He caught her arm, still laughing. \u201cI\u2019m not a fiend, Harry. I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cNo one but the most dissipated rascal could have such a thought in his head.\u201d She jerked her arm away.</p><p>He was still grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s your face,\u201d he said, sounding utterly unrepentant.</p> <p>\u201cMy face!\u201d she said, feeling her cheeks go red. \u201cThere is nothing in my face that would lead anyone to that conclusion. You, sir, are just as much a hell-hound as they say of you, and I was a fool to come near your estate. I\u2019ll leave tonight!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see,\u201d he said, grabbing her arm again, \u201cI was just trying to protect young Nick? You\u2019re damned beautiful for a man, Harry. It made me suspicious, and I shouldn\u2019t have been. You can\u2019t help the way you\u2019re born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe very fact the thought came into your mind\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m an adult. I run a house party that makes no pretenses to follow the rules of decent society. Of course I thought of it. Among other things, I\u2019m the father of a lovely little girl. I have to think about such things.\u201d</p><p>Harriet shuddered. \u201cI pity you, then. Because my father and mother never worried about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, they must have,\u201d Strange said. \u201cNot worry about you? With that beauty you have? The way your eyes look, so innocent and that brown-violet color?\u201d His mouth curled up. \u201cThey worried about you, young Harry. It\u2019s to your mother\u2019s credit that you never encountered this sort of ugliness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you have, it\u2019s because you live a licentious life,\u201d Harriet said, feeling as if the moorings of her rage were slipping away from her. A moment ago she was about to leave the estate, and now he was looking at her, and there was a shadow of something on his face that made her feel odd. It was almost sadness, but how was that possible?</p><p>\u201cQuite likely,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have such people around you,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t have to have such invidious thoughts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would always have that kind of thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI pity you, then,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the friends who enter my home. I know their strengths and their weaknesses. I need not fear them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one knows what\u2019s in another man\u2019s heart. The greatest evil often lies under the prettiest face.\u201d</p><p>Something went across his eyes that was pure pain, but he shook it away, and the laughter was there again. \u201cNow, you must forgive me, young Harry. Really you must. You see, I did think I knew you. And my rage was all the greater because I suddenly thought I\u2019d made a mistake.\u201d</p><p>Harriet smiled, a bit stiffly. \u201cIt\u2019s quite all right.\u201d</p><p>His charm was a potent weapon. He walked back to the house, talking of inconsequentials. But Harriet felt faintly nauseated. This was not the house for her, not a place where Strange clearly expected that sort of thing might happen to little Nick. She needed to leave. And what\u2019s more, she would take Nick with her. She could easily employ him on her estate. She had about sixty people there, and not a single lecher that Nick needed to fear.</p><p>When they entered the house she started toward the stairs, but Strange stopped her with a hand on her arm. \u201cSurely you haven\u2019t forgotten Kitty?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the two of you can entertain each other,\u201d Harriet said, not impolitely. \u201cWill you give her my excuses, please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you can go upstairs and instruct your man to pack your bags?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated. It seemed so bald. And yet, why prevaricate? \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is no place for me.\u201d</p><p>He dropped her arm. \u201cOf course, I cannot stop you. Will you bid Villiers goodbye tonight or tomorrow morning? I was bid to his room this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I will join you and make my farewell,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I do thank you for your hospitality, my lord. It\u2019s not your fault that I am more na\u00efve than I thought. I belong at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the country? Do you live in the country, Harry?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI thought it was a boring existence, but now I am changing my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish you would change your mind about Kitty. How often does one get to see an angel perform?\u201d</p><p>Harriet didn\u2019t bother to answer that. He walked up the stairs beside her.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s chamber was hung with blue velvet and had the lush atmosphere that Harriet imagined one would find in a courtesan\u2019s drawing room. Villiers was lying on a settee next to the fire, wearing a dressing gown of rich black embroidered with pearl.

What on earth inspired such a diatribe?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no need to go into particulars,\u201d Harriet said stiffly.</p><p>\u201cI have an uncommonly pretty stable boy,\u201d Strange said, ignoring her. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I assassinated your prot\u00e9g\u00e9\u2019s character by jumping to the conclusion that Harry was interested in an intimate relationship with the boy. To do myself justice, he was kissing him. Such a neophyte as I am, I\u2019ve never seen a man kiss a man, except in France, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kiss men often,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cJust to make them flustered. Remind me to kiss you on our next meeting, Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall look forward to it,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cYou really should forgive him,\u201d Villiers said to Harriet. \u201cThe man lives in the country. How does he know how civilized people behave to each other?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut he suggested\u2014\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>Villiers lifted his hand. \u201cJust so. One abhors to mention these things, dear Harry, but that does not make them disappear. Strange is right to look out for his people, stable boys and all.\u201d</p><p>If put that way, Harriet had to agree.</p><p>\u201cThe proper thing to do in this circumstance,\u201d Villiers continued, \u201cis to tell Strange that if he plays the fool with you again you\u2019ll pummel him so hard that he\u2019ll fart crackers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFart crackers,\u201d Harriet said, laughing despite herself. \u201cYou mean fire-crackers? Right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike to see you try,\u201d Strange said.</p> <p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t leave tonight,\u201d Villiers added. \u201cI was sadly brought down by the journey here, but this afternoon I felt the first glimmer of hope that I might actually be able to emerge from this damned velvet nest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you liked this suite,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cInexorably vulgar,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBlue velvet. Paugh!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am learning so much tonight,\u201d Strange said. \u201cBut here\u2019s another little problem for you to solve, Strange. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met the Graces. They\u2019re a lovely troupe of young women. If you\u2019d like to paint them, they\u2019re agreeable. If you\u2019d like them to sing or dance or otherwise inspire you, they\u2019re capable of doing that too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019m not up to being inspired, but I grieve at my loss, truly I grieve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the moment they are rehearsing an inspiring performance of madrigals to be sung while dressed as angels,\u201d Strange said.</p><p>\u201cA performance designed for a bishop,\u201d Harriet added.</p><p>\u201cDear me, how lucky the Episcopancy is sometimes,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cNothing half so thrilling ever comes my way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d Strange said. \u201cOne of the Graces, a lovely young thing by the name of Kitty, has offered a private performance to myself and Cope. That is, I believe she meant to offer it just to Harry, but I elbowed my way into the party.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUngracious,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYou are growing more countrified by the moment, Strange. Don\u2019t ever do that if one of the young ladies offers me a private performance. I should be forced to run you through. Miss Kitty agreed to perform for both of you, did she? An enterprising young woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Strange said. \u201cNow, it occurs to me that perhaps young Harry here is not ready for some of the more exuberant aspects of Kitty\u2019s likely performance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile in Rome, do as the Romans,\u201d Villiers said cheerfully.</p><p>Harriet blinked at him. He couldn\u2019t possibly be suggesting that she...</p><p>\u201cCum in Roman, esit as il Romani,\u201d Strange said, in what Harriet presumed to be Latin. And then, disastrously, he turned to Harriet and asked her a question, again in Latin.</p><p>Harriet panicked. She didn\u2019t understand a word of it, and yet of course as a young gentleman she ought to. Every gentleman understood Latin.</p><p>Villiers smoothly cut into the conversation with a Latin remark of his own. Whatever he said, it seemed to shut up Strange. He nodded sharply. There was an odd, wild light in his eyes that made Harriet a bit nervous, but at least he didn\u2019t keep talking in Latin or expect her to say anything in reply.</p><p>Harriet shot Villiers a quick glance. She didn\u2019t dare look pleading in front of Strange, but obviously she had to avoid Kitty somehow. Because it was clear that what Kitty and Strange had in mind\u2014whatever that was exactly\u2014was nothing she wanted to join.</p><p>\u201cI have just affirmed to my friend Strange that I certainly want you, young Harry, to come into your manhood,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cYou did,\u201d Strange said. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet...\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Strange said. They smiled at each other.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s skin was so white it looked blue. Some might call him haggard due his thinness, and yet somehow his loss of flesh just emphasized his masculinity. He looked like a fierce lion, temporarily caged, beaten and starved, but still deeply dangerous. Wild at the core.</p><p>Strange was entirely different: lean but muscled. He had the look of someone who had walked through hell\u2014or a lot of brandy\u2014and come out the other side wiser, tougher, and with his sense of humor intact.</p><p>The sardonic lines by the sides of his mouth deepened every time he looked at her and she finally knew the name to put on that emotion: laughter. She was dying to know what they said to each other in Latin, and yet she couldn\u2019t ask.</p><p>\u201cWell, Harry,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWould you like to handle young Kitty alone?\u201d He was daring her. She saw it in his eyes, the spark of delight there in the fact that he was putting her on the spot.</p><p>Villiers had told her that men were straightforward and use Anglo-Saxon words. Was fornicate an Anglo-Saxon word? It was the only one that came to mind, and it sounded too pedantic.</p><p>She raised her chin. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to meeting Kitty,\u201d she said. \u201cPrivately.\u201d She turned to Strange with a show of deference. \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, my lord.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all,\u201d Strange said promptly, that strange laughing light in his eyes again. \u201cI think you and Miss Kitty will have a truly delightful time in private, and I would just be in the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cCouldn\u2019t I watch?\u201d he asked. \u201cI have a room with a hidden peep-hole.\u201d</p><p>She blinked but there was laughter in his voice. She was beginning to tell when he was serious and when he was laughing.</p><p>\u201cStop taking the piss out of my ward,\u201d Villiers said, his voice sounding more tired than it had a moment ago. \u201cThe day you need to get pleasure by watching another couple perform is my last visit here.\u201d</p><p>Strange laughed. \u201cYou never know. I could whisper encouragement to Harry through the arras.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSome things are instinctive,\u201d Villiers said, his words blurring together.</p><p>Harriet stood up. \u201cIt would be most ungracious of me to keep Kitty waiting. Where did you fix our appointment, my lord?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were going to call me Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I right in thinking you told Kitty your library? If you\u2019ll forgive me, I\u2019ll join her. I am naturally quite eager.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNaturally,\u201d Strange drawled. \u201cWhat young man wouldn\u2019t be? Kitty is so nubile, so luscious, so charming in every way. I do wish you the best of evenings.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>In the Company of Angels</p><p>K itty\u2019s angel costume was fashioned from a few twists of cloth and a pair of feathery wings. If angels looked like this, men were going to find Heaven a very interesting place.</p><p>Harriet\u2019s heart sank. Obviously, she was going to have to expose her own gender in order to get out of the room without disrobing. And she wasn\u2019t ready.</p> <p>She loved being taken for a man, being given steak to eat for breakfast, being told to pummel someone until he farted crackers.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go home and have docile conversations with the vicar. She didn\u2019t want to get on a side-saddle and ride decorously over a field or two before her hip started aching from the unbalanced effect of the saddle.</p><p>She definitely didn\u2019t want to spend two hours staring glumly into a mirror while her maid dressed her hair into an arrangement that included a ship in full sail.</p><p>She closed the door behind her, but before she could say a word, Kitty flew across the room in a burst of giggles. Harriet recoiled for a moment, thinking she was about to be kissed, but it turned out that Kitty simply wished to loosen Harriet\u2019s cravat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Lord Strange can\u2019t be here,\u201d Harriet said, holding on to her cravat rather desperately.</p><p>Kitty bounded around Harriet, turning the key in the door, and giggling all the time.</p> <p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Harriet said to herself, quietly.</p><p>Then Kitty came back and stood before her. \u201cNow, Harry,\u201d she said. \u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling.\u201d</p><p>Harriet felt pure, unadulterated panic. \u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re a little scared. Everyone has a first time. And of course it\u2019s a bit more difficult for a man, given as he has to perform. But I\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>It had to be said. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Harriet began.</p><p>But Kitty was giggling again. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me this isn\u2019t your first time, Harry, because I\u2019d hate to call you a fraud this early in our acquaintance!\u201d</p><p>\u201cA fraud?\u201d Harriet repeated faintly.</p><p>Kitty had a look in her eye that made Harriet want to dash for the hills, so she took a deep breath and steeled herself. Goodbye breeches, goodbye wild morning rides, goodbye fencing...</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a man,\u201d she said clearly.</p><p>\u201cWell, not yet,\u201d Kitty squealed. She reached for Harriet\u2019s hand, but Harriet fell back a step.</p><p>\u201cI truly mean what I say. I\u2019m not a man.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence in the room. Harriet could hear the embarrassed thumping of her heart in approximate rhythm with the grandfather clock.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a man?\u201d Kitty asked. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Harriet shook her head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how did that happen?\u201d Kitty asked. \u201cWas it a childhood accident? Or something worse?\u201d</p><p>Harriet blinked\u2014and then she suddenly realized she had been offered the perfect escape. \u201cChildhood accident,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bring myself to tell you, because I find you so beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d Kitty breathed. \u201cYou poor thing.\u201d Her eyes lost the luminous, excited tint they held, and began glowing with sympathy. \u201cIt must be so embarrassing for you to tell me. Of course you don\u2019t want anyone to know.\u201d Her eyes widened. \u201cNo wonder you didn\u2019t want Lord Strange to join us!\u201d</p><p>Harriet heaved a deep sigh. \u201cYou can have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a eunuch in the Queen\u2019s Revels company,\u201d Kitty offered. \u201cHe sings all the high parts. I\u2019ve never met him, but everyone says his voice is beautiful. You know, this all makes sense now. Your voice is very high.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt never changed,\u201d Harriet admitted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it wouldn\u2019t. Is there anything I can do?\u201d Kitty looked trepidacious but willing.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing anyone can do. It\u2019s all just too, too humiliating.\u201d For a moment Harriet thought she\u2019d gone too far, but of course Kitty was used to people dramatizing themselves, and she didn\u2019t even blink.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have a drink,\u201d she said, patting Harriet on the shoulder. \u201cBrandy is a great help when it comes to humiliation. Why, there was the time when I was auditioning to be in the chorus at the Drury Lane theater, and the manager asked me if I could play the part of an ape. He wanted a private audition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth did he mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoll around on the floor, head over heels, in some sort of gymnastic feat.\u201d She walked over to the sideboard and poured two hefty doses of brandy and brought them back. \u201cHere, Harry, this is for your health. You never know. Maybe you\u2019ll regain capacity when you\u2019re a bit bigger. Anyone can tell that you have a nice package there. It\u2019s just a dirty shame that it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Harriet said, silently blessing the wool stocking tucked down her breeches that formed her \u201cpackage.\u201d They sat down on the couch, and Harriet said, \u201cSo the manager wanted you to be a gymnast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrivate performance,\u201d Kitty said. \u201cUnclothed.\u201d</p><p>Harriet choked.</p><p>\u201cHead over heels, around and around the stage. He offered me quite a lot of money for it. But I don\u2019t do that sort of thing.\u201d She made a prim mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s being naughty for the pleasure of it, if you see what I mean. And then there\u2019s just plain naughtiness, as my mother would say.\u201d</p><p>Harriet drank some more. This was definitely the most interesting period of her life. There could be no comparison to the turgid conversations she\u2019d generally had at balls. \u201cIs your mother still alive?\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cOf course. She\u2019s one of the principal dancers with Prince George\u2019s troupe, down in Brighton. She always laid down the rules for me. I do a private performance now and then, but only for my own pleasure. If you do such things for money, you become hard and bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Harriet asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cYou are a young one, aren\u2019t you? For one thing, you\u2019ll probably get an illness and then you\u2019ll look back and regret making yourself sick for twelve pence. Or whatever the sum happened to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut couldn\u2019t you get an illness anyway?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy on earth not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s a different sort of thing,\u201d Kitty said, rather obscurely. \u201cAnd if you start doing things only for money, well, then you\u2019re not enjoying yourself, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect not,\u201d Harriet said. She was starting to think that whatever she and Benjamin had done in their marital bedchamber had little to do with Kitty\u2019s idea of enjoyment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t even talk of this to you,\u201d Kitty said, looking stricken. \u201cYou being unable to take pleasure, I mean.

I\u2019ve always liked the number four.\u201d</p><p>There was something about Kitty\u2019s reasoning methods that made Harriet\u2019s head spin. \u201cBut what if you don\u2019t care for the fourth man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like most people,\u201d Kitty said cheerfully. \u201cSomeone like you would be perfect. Except...\u201d she paused delicately.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harriet said, finishing her glass of brandy. \u201cI see exactly what you mean.\u201d</p><p>After a second glass of brandy, Harriet pulled off her peruke and loosened her cravat. Then Kitty took that cravat and illustrated an interesting way to tie someone to the bedpost (or any other handy pole, she explained earnestly), using just one wrist and the cravat.</p> <p>Kitty didn\u2019t handle her third glass of brandy all that well, although she insisted on drinking it. She turned quite pink and it was hard to make out what she was saying between bursts of giggles.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Harriet said, hauling Kitty into a standing position. \u201cWe need to find something to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can just ring for the butler. You can simply ring that bell and anything\u2014\u201d Kitty waved her arm wildly \u201c\u2014anything will be delivered right to you. You can\u2019t imagine what we all asked for our first two days here. I demanded champagne for breakfast!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they brought it to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Kitty said, toppling to the side. \u201cPerhaps I should eat something. I was so excited about the evening that I didn\u2019t really eat supper.\u201d</p><p>Harriet steered her toward the door. Once in the hallway, Kitty remembered that she was planning to marry the next man who asked her and started speculating about his age. And the size of his member.</p> <p>Harriet cleared her throat. She was certainly learning a great deal that evening, never having seriously considered such a question before. But she was also feeling slightly dizzy.</p><p>Povy took one look at them and then tucked Kitty under his arm.</p><p>He snapped his fingers at a footman. \u201cFetch Lord Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you needn\u2019t\u2014you mustn\u2019t,\u201d Harriet protested.</p><p>\u201cHis lordship likes to be informed of all events,\u201d Mr. Povy said, gliding across the corridor with Kitty in tow, as if a drunken young woman dressed as an angel was all in a day\u2019s work.</p><p>Which it probably was, Harriet had to realize.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d Kitty called. \u201cHarry!\u201d</p><p>Harriet reluctantly followed them into the sitting room.</p> <p>\u201cStrange is coming here, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Kitty said, fixing her eye on Povy.</p><p>Povy said, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t say, miss. He might come if he\u2019s free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect he\u2019ll ask me to marry him, and I think I\u2019ll accept. Unless you wish to ask me, Harry.\u201d She appeared to have forgotten the manifest reason why Harry (or Harriet) couldn\u2019t engage in marriage.</p><p>The main thought that went through Harriet\u2019s mind was utterly surprising and fiercely violent. She pushed the thought away. It was none of her business whom Jem Strange asked to marry. Though he would never ask Kitty, any more than she herself would.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, I won\u2019t ask you to marry me at this time,\u201d she told Kitty.</p><p>Povy deposited Kitty on a chair. \u201cHot buttered eggs,\u201d he told the footman. \u201cHot tea, and I should think some salmon sandwiches as well.\u201d</p><p>Harriet sat down as well.</p><p>Of course Jem appeared a moment later.</p><p>\u201cAh, it is Mr. Cope,\u201d he said genially. \u201cI wondered, when the footman reported that a young lady was the worse for drink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019d think so,\u201d Harriet said, looking up at him, finally, because there was nowhere else to look.</p><p>\u201cOur Kitty does not usually drink to excess,\u201d he said, bending over to peer at his guest. \u201cIt must have been a great disappointment that sent her into such a pit of despair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really couldn\u2019t say,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI believe that she expects you to ask her to marry her, perhaps even tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet another disappointment in play,\u201d Jem murmured. \u201cDear me, the poor girl seems to have gone to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should go upstairs,\u201d Harriet said, not moving. There was a strange excitement racing through her veins.</p><p>Jem looked at her. \u201cAnd waste buttered eggs? I love buttered eggs. When they are cooked correctly, they are silky, and my cook makes them excellently.\u201d</p><p>He could make a salad of straw sound delicious, Harriet thought. Two minutes later, a footman had picked up Kitty and carried her off.</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk,\u201d Jem said, sitting himself in Kitty\u2019s chair. \u201cYoung women can\u2019t drink like men, you know. They\u2019re apt to topple off to sleep before they even think of taking their wings off. I suppose that\u2019s what happened to the two of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cThat describes it perfectly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever disappoint a woman, Harry,\u201d Jem said. There was a glint of amusement in his eyes that said\u2014said what?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about the lines of verse you keep handing me,\u201d he continued. \u201cI suppose you\u2019ll have another two lines for me tomorrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect so,\u201d Harriet said, a bit cautiously. \u201cIt depends on whether I am given another missive for you, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe dark is my delight,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then that business about the nightingale singing at night. You know, it almost sounds like a theatrical song, that kind that appeared in old plays.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Povy opened the door and placed a silver tray in front of them. \u201cButtered eggs,\u201d he announced. \u201cExtra butter, as your lordship prefers. Hot tea with lemon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rest we can see to for ourselves,\u201d Jem said amiably, but with an unmistakable tone of dismissal.</p><p>He wants to be alone with me, Harriet thought with a thrill. He wants to be\u2014alone. With me or with Harry?</p><p>Obviously with Harry, since he didn\u2019t know Harriet existed.</p><p>\u201cWhat were you working on today?\u201d she asked, biting into a piece of toast.</p><p>\u201cLetters,\u201d he said. \u201cMy lord chancellor tells me that the King is quite distraught over a debt to the King of Denmark. But since I advised two years ago that it was best to avoid giving any funds to the Guinny Company backed by Denmark, which they choose to ignore, I feel the privy-counselors will have to solve this debacle on their own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you exchanged correspondence with the lord chancellor,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cMoney,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIf you have a great deal of it, it precipitates you into conversations in which you would prefer not to participate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith the lord chancellor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the King. My guess is that the King will remove the first lord of the treasury by the end of the week. The only thing of interest I did today was unpack a box of curiosities sent to me by a man in London.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat was among them?\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cA salamander,\u201d Jem said. \u201cAnd a squirrel shaped like a fish. There\u2019s a piece of wood from the cross of Christ, which I utterly discount because it\u2019s the fortieth such piece I\u2019ve been offered, and that number alone is enough wood to put a good wall on a privy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy did you buy it then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was part of the lot,\u201d Jem said. \u201cMonsieur Bonnier de la Moson died last year, and his collection is being sold off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHow exactly can you make use of a squirrel shaped like a fish?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t make use of it. Knowledge is my ultimate end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds very grand,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAnd yet knowledge generally has some use.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot this kind,\u201d Jem said cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019m a feckless sort. I like to examine anything strange or unlikely very, very closely.\u201d There was a light in his eye that suddenly made Harriet wonder exactly how he found her strange.</p><p>\u201cEverything out of the common run of things is valuable in its own right,\u201d Jem said. \u201cPeople, after all, are so similar. The majority of them bore me to tears.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet finished a bite of buttered egg. It sang to her mouth, if silky eggs had a voice. \u201cIn that case,\u201d she said, \u201cwhy on earth do you always have a houseful of guests? Either you find them boring, in which case you should send them all home, or you actually enjoy them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but the people you find here are not in the common run.\u201d</p><p>Harriet thought about that a while. \u201cI don\u2019t agree,\u201d she said finally. \u201cI have been enjoying myself enormously. But while it is true that Kitty is rather more forthcoming about her particular ambitions, she strikes me as similar to many young ladies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKitty is no lady,\u201d Jem pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet she is akin to most of them. There\u2019s a wistful look in her eyes, you know. I think she will marry the next man who asks her\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must remind myself to hold my tongue,\u201d Jem murmured.</p> <p>\u201cShe will marry,\u201d Harriet said firmly, \u201cand then she will have a great many children. And while she will likely have fond memories of being one of the Graces, and perhaps even keep a feather or two as a memento, she will have any number of delightful, noisy children and be very happy. In fact, I would guess that she\u2019ll never think about her past as a wild young angel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re remarkably cynical for such a young sprig,\u201d Jem observed.</p><p>Harriet snorted. \u201cCynicism is not the provenance of the elderly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd what is it brewed from, then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, boredom,\u201d she said lightly. \u201cWhen one is bored, one tends to spend an inordinate amount of time analyzing one\u2019s neighbors. That\u2019s why I would suggest that there is no great difference between your salacious guests and the run of the ton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey burn more brightly. Gentlewomen are tediously attached to concepts of marriage and fidelity, even as they carry on affaires.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre they? There seems to be just as much anxiety here as I find in the ton,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cTake Nell, for instance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNell appears to have something of a fascination for me,\u201d Jem said. \u201cShe caught me in the corridor the other day and I thought she was going to leap on me like a ravening lion.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no accounting for tastes,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cMy point is that Nell appears deliciously free of society\u2019s pressures. But secretly I believe she\u2019s rather desperate to marry you, rather than merely bed you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid to ask about my true desires.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth but he raised his hand. \u201cI truly mean it. I don\u2019t wish to know. Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s different,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has a passion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. When a person has a passion, his life is different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd have you a passion?\u201d He asked it quietly enough, but the question rang in Harriet\u2019s ears.</p><p>Had she a passion? Had she some reason for living that would make a mockery of Benjamin\u2019s wish to kill himself? He killed himself because he wasn\u2019t the very best at chess. That was a passion, if you wish.</p><p>\u201cNot a true passion. And you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m lucky,\u201d Jem said, finishing the last of the toast. \u201cI have several. In fact, I am somewhat burdened with passions. I love creating things, like my rash tower. I love learning about odd things in nature, like squirrel fish. And I am very fond of watching how money moves through markets, which has been useful for my pocketbook.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIf one of those things fails to please, you can turn to another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need to find something, obviously. Harry, you need a passion.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>More Buttered Eggs</p><p>W hen Harriet finally made it upstairs, she found Nell sitting on her bed. She suppressed a groan at the sight of her.</p><p>Nell leapt to her feet. \u201cIt\u2019s working!\u201d she cried.</p><p>\u201cWhat is working?\u201d Harriet said, dropping into a chair. The warm glow of cognac had faded away, leaving her bone-tired.</p><p>\u201cStrange is beginning to notice me. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re doing it, Harry, but it\u2019s working!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met in the corridor, and he grabbed me by the shoulders, looked into my face very seriously, and said, \u2018Isn\u2019t your family name Gale?\u2019\u201d</p><p>She stopped.</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d Harriet prompted.</p><p>\u201cThat was it. I leaned toward him a bit, in case he wanted to give me a kiss, but he set off down the corridor again. Still, his interest is definitely piqued. And now I have an idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harriet asked, smothering a yawn.</p><p>\u201cI think I might marry him.\u201d</p><p>Harriet couldn\u2019t stop a little laugh. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Nell was not the sort to be easily put off. \u201cStrange needs a wife. Obviously he is deeply attracted to me, and only waiting for the right moment to approach. If I play this correctly, he\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow will you play it?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll refuse to bed him,\u201d Nell said. \u201cOnly the first request, of course. And I need you to change the poem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn what manner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo signify matrimony, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t see how to do that,\u201d Harriet said dubiously. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking about nights and delight. How can I turn that to marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do it,\u201d Nell said encouragingly. \u201cUnless you think I should just let him come up with the proposal himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a better plan,\u201d Harriet said with some relief. \u201cThe poem is already written. The last couplet will rhyme Nightingale and Nell Gale, obviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t say I think much of that rhyme.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never said I was a poet,\u201d Harriet retorted.</p><p>Nell bounded from her chair and bent to give Harriet a kiss. \u201cYou are my knight in shining armor. I\u2019m so grateful to you!\u201d And she was gone.</p><p>Harriet stayed where she was, staring at her booted toes. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Benjamin was such a passionate man that she had faded into his shadow during their years of marriage. It was only when she wore men\u2019s breeches that she was able to parry and fence with a person like Strange. Normally someone so beautiful would make her tongue-tied. He would look at her with indifference, and she would mumble and walk away.</p><p>It was only in breeches and stockings, with her legs exposed for the whole world to see, that she had courage.</p><p>A passion...</p><p>Beyond a passion for wearing breeches.</p> <p>The word slid into her mind with the cool sound of steel. If I were allowed to have any passion I wished, Harriet thought, I would have one for the art of the rapier. Jem had started her lessons in order, he said, to give her a weapon, to make her a man.</p><p>It worked. She felt powerful with that thin, dangerous blade in hand. She felt like the kind of person who should be listened to. Her blood sang with the beauty of matching her opponent\u2019s swirling movements with her own. It was a complex sort of mathematical thinking that she understood.</p><p>She got up and grabbed her rapier again, exhaustion forgotten. Pushing aside the chair so she had a good space, she began to practice the moves he taught her. Attack, parry, feint, thrust. Jem\u2019s voice sounded in her head. The straightest path between two points is with your tip, not the side of your blade. She pretended she had an opponent opposite her, coming in with a swirling keen blade. She practiced her move against him over and over and over again. Watching the silver gleam of his blade, seeing it cut the air, bringing her own up to meet it.</p><p>Blocking is a move of last resort. Evade the blade.</p><p>She practiced that, over and over, imagining the angle of the blade, the position of the body, jumping to the side so that his invisible rapier slashed through space rather than her body.</p> <p>By the time she bent over, clutching a stitch in her side, panting, sweat dripping from her brow, the house was deadly quiet. It had to be the middle of the night.</p><p>Yet somewhere she could hear\u2014</p><p>Could it be a cat calling? It sounded like a cry. Harriet wiped her face and put down her rapier. Her shirt was a bit damp around the collar.</p><p>It was extraordinary how different it was to be a man rather than a woman. She never sweated in her woman\u2019s clothes. Now her heart was thumping, and her blood was racing. It made her want to laugh.</p><p>Without bothering to pull her boots back on, she opened the door so she could hear the noise more clearly. That was no cat. She started running.</p><p>Eugenia, the third floor, the locked door.</p> <p>Harriet flew up the stairs, came to the huge oak door that barred Eugenia\u2019s wing from the rest of the house.</p><p>She could hear her clearly now, little thumps from her fists beating on the door, and calls drowned by sobs.</p><p>\u201cEugenia!\u201d she called. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><p>There was a rush of words, but she couldn\u2019t understand. So she raised her voice to a shriek. \u201cIs there a fire?\u201d</p><p>A little voice said, close to the keyhole. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire in my bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d Harriet said, her head starting to swim. \u201cWhere\u2019s the footman? Where is he?\u201d</p><p>She heard sobs. \u201cI don\u2019t know where he is. I\u2019ve been hammering for ages and no one came, and it\u2019s cold and dark, and my governess...\u201d She couldn\u2019t hear the rest.</p><p>\u201cIs there a lot of smoke?\u201d Harriet asked in her sternest voice.</p> <p>She only heard sobs and something she couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cEugenia, I need you to listen to me. Put your ear to the keyhole. Is there smoke in the corridor?\u201d</p><p>Silence. Then: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Harriet said, her mind racing. \u201cNow, did you pull the bell cord in your chamber?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgot,\u201d Eugenia said, her voice catching in a sob. \u201cI was frightened and I ran out of there and I don\u2019t want to go back!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cCan you see the fire?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia sounded a little puzzled. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen stay right where you are,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cDon\u2019t move. If the fire comes, stay low. I\u2019ll be back in one minute, Eugenia. Will you be all right until then?\u201d She felt the door anxiously. It was chill, without the glow of a fire\u2019s warmth. Surely the blaze wouldn\u2019t swell into the hall immediately. \u201cEugenia! Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cBut, Harry\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust wait,\u201d Harriet said sharply.</p><p>She turned around. She was on the third-floor corridor, and bedchamber doors stretched on either side of her. Without hesitating she pushed open the door closest to her, and felt for the bell cord. She couldn\u2019t find it so she ran to the windows and threw open the drapes.</p><p>She heard a confused murmur from the bed but didn\u2019t even glance that way, just ran back to the door. She could see the cord in the light cast by the moon. It was on the opposite side of the door from where she thought. She rang it, rang again, rang a third time, as hard as she could.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this all about?\u201d came a male voice from the bed.</p><p>She looked over to find a man who looked like a walrus with a nightcap on. \u201cFire in the west wing, sir,\u201d she said, hauled on the rope again and ran out into the corridor and back to the door. \u201cAll right, Eugenia?\u201d she said, steadying her voice.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it here,\u201d Eugenia said, and the sob in her voice made Harriet\u2019s heart stop. \u201cIt\u2019s dark and I\u2019m all alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill your father,\u201d Harriet said between her teeth.</p><p>\u201cI want Papa,\u201d Eugenia said, starting to cry again. \u201cI want Papa!\u201d</p><p>There was no key. Of course, there wouldn\u2019t be a key since Jem wanted to make sure that degenerates didn\u2019t find their way into the west wing.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t your father\u2019s bedchamber in the west wing as well?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not he-here,\u201d Eugenia hiccupped. \u201cI went to his room and he\u2019s not here.\u201d</p><p>Harriet ran to the top of the stairs and looked frantically down the long flight of steps.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d Eugenia called. \u201cDon\u2019t go anywhere, Harry. Please don\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, putting her hand on the thick wood as if she could caress Eugenia\u2019s face through it. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing me a song,\u201d Eugenia said.</p><p>Harriet thought madly.</p><p>\u201cDo you know any songs? My papa doesn\u2019t know a single song. He says it\u2019s because he\u2019s a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I know some,\u201d Harriet said. But her mind was blank and all she could think of was the smell of smoke. She knew nothing about children\u2019s songs. Finally she thought of one song that her music instructor had drummed into her head, years ago when she was about to make her debut and expected to perform.</p><p>\u201cDrink to me only with thine eyes,\u201d she sang, \u201cAnd I will pledge with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d came a sharp little voice. But it sounded less frightened.</p><p>\u201cIt means that the singer admires the eyes of his beloved, the person he loves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Do you know any other songs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, then.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYet leave a kiss but in the cup, and I\u2019ll not ask for wine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you leave a kiss in a cup?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question,\u201d Harriet said. But she didn\u2019t answer, just kept singing. \u201cThe kiss that from the soul doth rise, requires a draught divine. Yet might I of Jove\u2019s nectar sup, I would not change for thine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t nectar what bees eat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade any of that for a kiss either. What\u2019s a draught?\u201d</p><p>But Harriet finally heard feet coming up the stairs and jumped to her feet. It was a footman, so tired that his face was white.</p><p>\u201cFire!\u201d Harriet bellowed. \u201cThere\u2019s a fire in the west wing and Miss Eugenia is alone in there.\u201d</p><p>He stared at her for a second and then wheeled and tore down the stairs.</p> <p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Eugenia said, through the door.</p><p>\u201cYes, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Harriet said firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing the key and I shall have you out of there in exactly one minute. You\u2019re going to be fine, Eugenia. We\u2019ll get the fire out, and then we\u2019ll find your father and murder him.\u201d</p><p>He must be in the wrong bed, she realized. Of course he was. A man like that had a mistress, though she hadn\u2019t realized it, with her monumental na\u00efvet\u00e9. He was snug in a bed, likely with one of the Graces.</p><p>\u201cBut Harry,\u201d Eugenia was saying, \u201cthe fire is in my room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worrying about that,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cDo you know, Harry, you sound like a girl when you sing?\u201d</p><p>Harriet cleared her throat. The whole subterfuge was ridiculous. She opened her mouth, but just then there was the sound of pounding footsteps and a crowd of footmen burst up the last flight of stairs, led by Povy, carrying a great brass key.</p><p>\u201cGive it to me!\u201d Harriet demanded.</p><p>Povy handed her the key.</p><p>She stuck the key in the lock, threw open the door, scooped up the small huddled figure in her arms and threw herself backwards, holding Eugenia.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Povy was saying. \u201cThank\u2014\u201d His voice died. He was looking down the corridor. There it was, dim in the light of one lamp burning by the door. There wasn\u2019t a wisp of smoke. There wasn\u2019t even a\u2014</p><p>\u201cEugenia,\u201d Harriet said, putting the girl on her feet. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me that there was a fire?\u201d</p> <p>Eugenia sniffed. \u201cThere was,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s always a fire in my room.\u201d</p><p>Doors were opening down the corridor behind her. She could hear little squeaks of dismay.</p><p>\u201cA fire,\u201d the walrus gentleman suddenly roared at Harriet\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIn the other wing.\u201d He gave the impression of having too many teeth.</p><p>There was an answering little shriek from the assembled company in the corridor. Povy jerked his head and a footman ran into the west wing.</p><p>Harriet knelt down in front of Eugenia. \u201cYou were crying. You were afraid.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia sniffed again and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWas your bedchamber on fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cBut I\u2014I woke up alone.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked up at Povy. She felt as if she were learning to breathe all over again. \u201cWhere is the footman who is stationed here? And where is Miss Eugenia\u2019s governess or maid? Who sleeps with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will certainly inquire in the morning,\u201d Povy said. \u201cI will inquire as to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will inquire now,\u201d Harriet snapped, standing up. Every inch of her had transmuted from being genial Harry Cope to being a duchess, a woman who had run the duchy estate, not to mention Judge Truder\u2019s court, for years. \u201cI suggest you discover the whereabouts of these people immediately, Povy. And you might\u2014\u201d her tone was withering \u201c\u2014you might wish to inform Lord Strange, if you can find where he bedded himself, what happened tonight.\u201d</p><p>Povy pulled himself upright. \u201cI will do that, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall take Miss Eugenia to my chamber.\u201d She looked down the corridor at the huddled folk. They looked a great deal less glamorous this late at night. \u201cThere is no fire,\u201d she stated. \u201cGo back to bed, if you please. We are sorry to have disturbed your rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTea?\u201d Povy asked rather desperately. \u201cButtered eggs?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough buttered eggs,\u201d Harriet said, at precisely the same moment that Eugenia said, \u201cYes, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, buttered eggs,\u201d Harriet said. She took Eugenia\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019d like to know exactly what frightened you, but let\u2019s wait until we wash your face.\u201d</p><p>They went down the stairs in silence. Harriet\u2019s heart was still racing. She felt ill, an aftermath of shock and excitement.</p><p>They walked into Harriet\u2019s chamber and she looked with some disbelief at the chair still pushed to the side, at her boots and rapier.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you thought there was a fire,\u201d Eugenia said, perching on the edge of the bed. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to give you that impression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cDid you have a bad dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cThat wouldn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019m not a baby, you know. I would go back to sleep. It was the rat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRat!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eugenia said, nodding. \u201cIt ran across my bed and I woke up and there it was, looking at me. Right in the face. It was all black with a horrid pink tail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt must have been a dream,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cA rat would never do such a thing. They\u2019re afraid of people. You were dreaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the difference between a dream and a rat, Harry. The rat bit me. A dream would never do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe rat bit you? Where?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight here.\u201d She held out her right hand. Sure enough, just above her thumb there were four sharp puncture marks, the skin swelling around them.</p><p>\u201cOh, no,\u201d Harriet breathed. She scooped Eugenia up and ran over to the water basin, poured some water from the pitcher and thrust Eugenia\u2019s hand into the water. \u201cSoap,\u201d she said. \u201cSoap.\u201d Her heart was thumping again.</p><p>\u201cRight there,\u201d Eugenia said, pointing to the ball of soap.</p><p>Harriet soaped and soaped.</p><p>\u201cHe wasn\u2019t a very dirty rat,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI mean, he frightened me. And I didn\u2019t want to stay in the room with him. But he had a nice white spot on his stomach, as if he had a fancy waistcoat on. He was a clean rat, as rats go.\u201d</p><p>Harriet groaned and scrubbed harder. \u201cHow many rats have you seen?\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Harriet swung around, ready to scream at Jem. But apparently they hadn\u2019t been able to root him out of whatever bed he was nesting in, because it was Povy with yet more buttered eggs. He set them down on the little table next to the armchair. A footman carried in another armchair.</p><p>\u201cYum!\u201d Eugenia said, slipping her hand out from Harriet\u2019s and shaking water drops all over the floor. \u201cI\u2019m so hungry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather Lord Strange is nowhere to be found,\u201d Harriet stated. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Povy bowed. \u201cI have not had success, Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you checked every bedchamber?\u201d Her tone was only slightly acid.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cNaturally not. I cannot inconvenience our guests in that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo so,\u201d she snapped.</p> <p>\u201cLord Strange will be quite angry,\u201d Povy said.</p><p>She fixed him with a look. \u201cLord Strange will have other things to worry about.

Rats are another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect the rat was hungry,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI went to bed without my supper because I was naughty.\u201d She ate another large bite of egg.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fell into a rage,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI do that, and it is a great fault. My governess was so angry at me that she left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd she didn\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, so I didn\u2019t get supper. But I knew I wouldn\u2019t. I am never supposed to have supper if I am impertinent. And sometimes I just feel impertinent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe all do,\u201d Harriet said, feeling the rage bubbling inside of her. \u201cI think you should still be given supper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know the way I ought to behave,\u201d Eugenia explained. \u201cBut I just can\u2019t get there. My governess wanted me to practice my French. But I very much wanted to do my calculations instead. And I couldn\u2019t pay attention; I just couldn\u2019t. And then I snapped at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you rude?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cFrightfully so,\u201d Eugenia said cheerfully, starting on the toast. \u201cYou know, Harry, your hair is standing straight up in parts.\u201d</p><p>Harriet put a hand to her head and discovered that her hair had fallen out of the tie at her neck and was curling wildly around her head. \u201cIt\u2019s that sort of hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt makes you look like a girl,\u201d Eugenia observed. \u201cYou would make a very pretty girl.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was inordinately pleased by that compliment.</p> <p>\u201cAre you a girl?\u201d Eugenia asked, with that remarkable straightforwardness employed by children.</p><p>Harriet nodded.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Eugenia promised. \u201cI wish I was going to be as pretty as you are. But I\u2019m not. I\u2019m reconciled to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you saying?\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy papa says that the worst thing you can do is fib to someone just to protect his feelings,\u201d Eugenia said, her gray eyes very earnest. \u201cMy hair is peculiar and I have a big nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have very curly hair,\u201d Harriet agreed. \u201cSo do I. But your nose is not big, and you have lovely eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am used to it,\u201d Eugenia said serenely. \u201cPapa is very rich, so I shall marry whomever I wish. I shall buy him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harriet said, rather taken aback.</p><p>\u201cAre you rich?\u201d Eugenia asked. \u201cIt makes things quite pleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harriet said after a moment. \u201cI suppose I am. I haven\u2019t thought about it much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? You could buy yourself a husband, you know. I can tell you how to do it, as Papa told me all about it. You go to London and post how much money you have on a pillar in St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. That\u2019s a very big place and you can find everything from a horse trainer to a wife there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIs your father planning to buy himself a wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved my mama very much,\u201d Eugenia said. She was starting to look a little sleepy. \u201cHe didn\u2019t buy her, though. She bought him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep in my bed until your father comes to find you?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia stumbled her way to the bed and fell asleep the moment her head touched the pillows.</p><p>Harriet stood for a moment and gently touched Eugenia\u2019s hair. It hadn\u2019t been brushed before bed. Which made sense given that the governess had stormed from the room before supper and didn\u2019t come back, not even to wash Eugenia\u2019s face. But shouldn\u2019t Jem have visited his daughter to say goodnight?</p><p>She swallowed. If life had been kind enough to give her a child...</p><p>\u201cI could have a passion for you,\u201d she whispered. If Eugenia were hers, she could have felt as fiercely about her as Benjamin had for chess.</p><p>It was a bleak thought, and just made her feel more tired. So she stumbled back to the armchair and sat down. She finally fell asleep thinking of calculations and children.</p><p>When she woke again, from a dream in which a very clean, intelligent rat was doing calculations on a scrap of paper, it was dawn. Her neck was stiff from sleeping in a chair. She stumbled to a standing position and then fell into her bed next to Eugenia, fully clothed.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Of Rats and Their Ability to Change Their Spots</p><p>S he opened her eyes to find him there, hanging over her, such painful anxiety in his eyes that she forgave him, although his sins were unforgivable.</p><p>\u201cIs she badly frightened?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>It was the first time that she\u2019d seen the almost physical glow of intelligence and confidence that surrounded Jem Strange diminished. She felt an instant wish to bring it back.</p><p>And quelled the emotion by remembering what an ass he was, sleeping God knows where.</p><p>\u201cIt could have been a fire,\u201d she said sharply, swinging her legs over the side of the bed.</p><p>He had no wig. Of course not: he and his mistress likely didn\u2019t close their eyes for a moment.</p><p>If he ever came to her bed, she wouldn\u2019t sleep all night.</p><p>\u201cGod,\u201d he said, running his hands through his hair. It sounded like a prayer. Harriet felt another wash of sympathy and choked it back down.</p><p>\u201cShe would have died,\u201d she said, her voice steely hard, chill, logical. \u201cNo governess. She\u2019d had no supper. No one washed her face. A rat woke her from sleep and bit her on the hand. I expect he thought she smelled like a buttered crumpet. Did you know that you had rats?\u201d</p><p>He wheeled and stared at her, his eyes huge, the shadow of his lashes falling on his cheek. \u201cDid I know I had rats?\u201d he said, sounding almost dazed. \u201cNo. I suppose I should have known. I thought we had mice. Eugenia told me that she heard scurrying and little squeaks and I told her that old houses have mice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRat-bite fever,\u201d she said, bringing her worst fear to the surface, but unable to say more than just the name of the disease.</p><p>\u201cWhich hand was bitten?\u201d He moved to the side of the bed. Eugenia was sleeping in a tangle of dark hair. She was smiling a little, the tips of her lips turned up.</p><p>\u201cThe right,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>He picked it up. The four puncture wounds were a little swollen. \u201cGod,\u201d he said. Again it sounded like a prayer.</p><p>\u201cWhen a man on my estate died of the fever, it came on a fortnight after the bite.

That made sense, didn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Harriet nodded.</p> <p>\u201cBut then I picked her up and she had this odd face, with all that corkscrew hair going on\u2014\u201d He stopped. \u201cYou look a bit like her. I couldn\u2019t send her away. I had the wet nurse here. Later I should have sent her to Sally\u2019s aunt, where she\u2019d be safe and with other women, but I couldn\u2019t. Idiot!\u201d he cried, clutching his head.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that terrible,\u201d Harriet said, speaking against every instinct she had. She simply couldn\u2019t bear the bleak look on his face.</p><p>\u201cI know what I have to do. She must go live somewhere else, away from this place and its dangers.\u201d</p><p>Harriet cleared her throat. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you be less drastic? Why not simply invite people whom you trust to the house so that you can unlock the nursery wing? And get rid of the rats. It seems simple to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSimple! You don\u2019t know how easy death is. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s like a door. A person simply walks through it, and she\u2019s lost to you forever.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs it happens, I have lost someone very dear to me,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did my best to keep him safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I am doing!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy inviting her for picnics in that leaning tower?\u201d she burst out. \u201cBy filling your house with people whom you yourself don\u2019t trust not to be dangerous? By locking her in, and not even bothering to check on her before you go to bed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t go to bed,\u201d he said. His voice grated. \u201cYou\u2019re right about everything else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that you didn\u2019t go to bed is just part and parcel of the truth of it,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps you should send her away. A father who spends the night gallivanting rather than bothering to check on his daughter obviously has no time for her.\u201d</p><p>He put his head back in his hands. She felt that alarming sweep of vertigo again, as if she would do anything to make him stop looking so stricken.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a terrible father. My father was no father at all, but I thought I could improve on the model.\u201d He straightened up again and his face shocked her, with such black shadows under his eyes that it looked as if he\u2019d been punched. \u201cHubris. I should have known. Men in my family can\u2019t be decent parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d she said sharply. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a terrible father. You simply need to be less careless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a disreputable bunch. Villiers did you no great service by bringing you here. I\u2019ll have to send her away.\u201d His voice was as bleak as midwinter.</p><p>Harriet swallowed. \u201cShe loves you,\u201d she said, faintly. \u201cDon\u2019t send her away. Just change your life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI let her be bit by a rat,\u201d he said, turning around again. \u201cThis house is, metaphorically at least, full of rats. And I, like they, have no idea how to turn into a more civilized version of myself. I am no quiet country squire, Harry Cope.\u201d Then: \u201cIs it rage that makes your eyes that color?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger has no particular color,\u201d Harriet said. She was trying to work through what he just said. Could it be that Jem allowed this house party to continue because he considered himself reprehensible? Flawed beyond the ability to change?</p> <p>\u201cYour eyes are the most peculiar color,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes they\u2019re brown, and sometimes they take on a violet tinge. When you disapprove of something they\u2014what am I saying?\u201d</p><p>Harriet was wondering the same thing. What sort of man stayed up all night making love to his mistress and then praised a man\u2019s eyes?</p><p>He turned away again and gently pulled the coverlet from Eugenia.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you wish to leave your daughter here until she wakes up? I can go to another bedchamber,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cShe\u2019s so exhausted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo are you. I\u2019ll take her with me,\u201d he said, and scooped Eugenia into his arms. She murmured something and turned her face against his chest. Her long thin legs fell from his arms like a crane\u2019s legs.</p><p>\u201cWe owe you huge thanks,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou owe me nothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf nothing else, another lesson at the rapier.\u201d His eyes swept around the room, seeing the rapier cast to the side, the rug bundled away.</p><p>\u201cI find I love the sport,\u201d Harriet admitted.</p><p>\u201cIn the afternoon. You have to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Lay Me Down and Roll Me to a Whore. Or Not.</p><p>February 8, 1784</p><p>S he woke without finding Jem standing over her, for a change. The room was utterly silent except for the song of a bird on the branch outside her window. Then there was a rustle of paper and she raised her head to see Isidore sitting by the fire, reading a book.</p><p>She sat up and stretched.</p><p>Isidore glanced over and said, \u201cYou will likely shriek when you see your hair; I\u2019m just warning you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve lived with this hair my whole life. My maid tames it by binding it back when it\u2019s wet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems you had an exciting night,\u201d Isidore said, putting her book aside. \u201cWill you please tell me what happened? I\u2019ve heard of an invasion of rats and a fire and a missing host. It sounds like a bad play. Except for the rat part. That has a dismaying touch of reality to it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was a rat, in Strange\u2019s daughter\u2019s bedchamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI can\u2019t abide rats. I stayed in an inn that was infested with them. We were eating dinner and then realized that three or four of them were dancing under the table nearby. They weren\u2019t in the least afraid of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought there was a fire, but there wasn\u2019t. And Lord Strange couldn\u2019t be located. He wasn\u2019t in his bed.\u201d The words made Harriet\u2019s chest feel hard, as if it was filled with small, hard stones.</p><p>\u201cI wonder who he\u2019s bedding,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cI suppose he has a mistress. There are a great many women here, you know. I keep encountering women in the ladies\u2019 salon whom I never saw before.\u201d</p><p>Harriet didn\u2019t say anything. It was horrifying to discover that she still wanted Jem, even knowing that he had a lover.</p><p>\u201cYou are an odd female,\u201d Isidore said rather obscurely, picking up her book again.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMachiavelli\u2019s little book called The Prince. It\u2019s all about how Italian princes keep their power. My mother said that a distant relative is mentioned in here somewhere, and so I thought I would read it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas your relative a prince?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, as I understand it, he was an underling with a sideline in poisons,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cMy family is full of people with various talents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy family is full of people of tedious virtue.\u201d</p><p>Isidore turned a page in her book, but looked up. \u201cTedious virtue?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I am a long-lost relative.

And a swath of gold hair that towered above her shoulders.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEveryone\u2019s hair towers,\u201d Harriet said moodily. She was not looking forward to returning to the duchy and dressing her hair once more. \u201cLook at Jemma. She once told me that she had fifteen bows affixed to her hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot like this.

I gather they are attached in some fashion to a theater he owns in London. This troupe is a group of boisterous lads who have no place in a formal sitting room. They weren\u2019t even properly dressed. And yet he was trying to pretend they belonged there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did they think of the sitting room?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey were delighted by the ale,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cAnd they complimented him on the bubble-and-squeak served at dinner. I was not offered that dish, to the best of my knowledge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s rather admirable,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Isidore asked baldly.</p><p>\u201cBecause he doesn\u2019t decide who his guests should be simply on what kind of family they come from or what position they hold in society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why not open a hotel? I myself have never stayed in a hotel, due to my mother-in-law\u2019s fixed conviction that ladies don\u2019t belong in paying establishments. But I was forcefully reminded of a hotel last night. Or perhaps a brothel, to call a spade a spade. I saw a great deal of glee resulting from Strange\u2019s free food, together with a certain thirsty appreciation of the Graces.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen would you like to leave?\u201d Harriet asked, knowing precisely where this conversation was heading.</p><p>\u201cDo you think tomorrow morning would show an unbecoming eagerness? Everyone at breakfast was cheerfully comparing rat bite stories they knew. I don\u2019t want to acquire such intimate knowledge of the animal kingdom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould we wait another day?\u201d Harriet asked. \u201cI have engaged to deliver notes to Strange on the behalf of Nell, and I should do the last couplet tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am so staid compared to you. You\u2019re actually engaged in wooing Strange, albeit for another woman. It sounds Shakespearean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps I should inform Nell that Strange has a mistress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think that she would care?\u201d There was a snap in Isidore\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Harriet admitted.</p><p>\u201cI do not care for the slip-shod manner in which these people conduct their social affairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not so different from Jemma,\u201d Harriet said defensively. \u201cAt least, from what we heard of Jemma\u2019s affaires when she was living in Paris.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a world of difference. Yes, Jemma had a liaison or two. But she didn\u2019t have this careless, pleasure-for-the-sake-of-it attitude. You know, Harriet, I never think much about my husband, Cosway. Why would I? I don\u2019t know the man. But now I realize that if he is like Strange I simply won\u2019t be able to countenance it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike Strange?\u201d Harriet\u2019s heart thumped. To have a husband like Strange...with that wild beauty of his, with the way he smiled, with the lean muscles, the laughter in his eyes, the pure brilliance...</p><p>\u201cExactly. Never knowing whose bed he might be in. I suppose Strange will take up Nell on her offer. I gather it is for a night\u2019s pleasure and not marriage.\u201d Her tone was scathing.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cThough she has ambitions to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll never marry her. No man would marry a woman who allowed him to bed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t say that for certain,\u201d Harriet protested. \u201cI know of many ladies whose first child came with suspicious haste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter the marriage had been arranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in all cases,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cWell,\u201d Isidore said, \u201cas I said, I\u2019m becoming hidebound. I\u2019m turning into one of those fierce old duchesses who thinks everyone is immoral.\u201d She hunched her shoulders. \u201cI simply don\u2019t enjoy this kind of gathering. I was approached last night\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbout the brandied apricots?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the jugglers. They became very drunk at some point. I was sitting at the side of the room with one of the Graces discussing French letters\u2014in which I have no interest, Harriet, I assure you\u2014and a couple of them came over, looked at us and said, \u2018I am very drunk, lay me down and roll me to a whore.\u2019 My companion thought this was remarkably funny. She giggled and giggled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Isidore, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they started comparing us. One of them said I looked like a virgin, and the Grace giggled at that. Then the other laughed and told me to lie down and he would feese me. Do you know what that means, Harriet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said that he would lie with me tonight, and his friend could have me tomorrow. And do you know, I think the Grace was a little peeved? She wanted those drunken fools to desire her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Isidore,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cThat\u2019s awful! How did you get away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe drunker one grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet. I was so stupid, I couldn\u2019t think of anything to say or do.\u201d</p><p>Harriet wound an arm around Isidore\u2019s shoulders.</p><p>\u201cLuckily he fell down. He just lay there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere was Strange?\u201d</p><p>Isidore shrugged. \u201cMr. Povy appeared and they swore at him and said he was full of fleas. Povy didn\u2019t seem too bothered by this, and he got two footmen to drag them away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll in a day\u2019s work,\u201d Harriet said dismally.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d Isidore stated.</p><p>Harriet gave her a hug. \u201cWe\u2019ll go tomorrow morning. I\u2019ll give Strange the rest of the poem in one fell swoop. You ask Lucille to pack our things, and we\u2019ll be off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know you\u2019re enjoying being a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt couldn\u2019t last forever.\u201d</p><p>It was like everything else in life. Nothing lasted forever.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Of Ladies, Amazons, Whoremongers, and Prickles</p><p>H arriet copied out the last lines of Nell\u2019s poem for Strange and perfumed the stationery before taking her bath. She sat in the hot water for a long while, thinking over the last week. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She was changed forever\u2014but that wasn\u2019t necessarily bad. She couldn\u2019t stay a man. But she could change her life. Never again would she sit for two hours while her maid built her hair into a towering set of false curls. She would never wear ruffles again either. A mantua maker could fashion her comfortable clothing, fit to the body, though made for a woman. She might even bribe Villiers\u2019s tailor into making her a gown or two.</p><p>And she would continue to learn how to fight with the rapier, even though women never did such a thing.</p><p>Finally, and this was crucial, she would like to have a child. A child meant a husband. It meant going to London and attending the balls she loathed.</p><p>Surely she could find a man who was interesting and intelligent. The picture in her mind was alarmingly familiar, clever and pale, but she threw that thought away. Strange was part of this bizarre, wonderful little interlude. And that was all.</p> <p>She pulled on her breeches for the last time, helped Lucille wind strips of cloth around her breasts, pulled a white shirt over her head. Then she walked into the portrait gallery and looked for Eugenia.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not here,\u201d a deep voice said from the corner. Jem was leaning over a glass case. The top was up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked, coming to join him.</p><p>\u201cRemoving this chess set.\u201d</p><p>He was taking them out, one by one, and placing them on top of the cabinet. They were carved little pieces of fantasia, each piece with its own expression.</p> <p>\u201cLook at the black queen,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cShe looks as angry as my cook when the fish is off.\u201d The black queen had her hands on her hips. She had a fantastic headdress, made of a delicate ball carved with openings, inside of which was another ball, and inside that another.</p><p>Jem looked at her over his shoulder, his dark eyes faintly smiling. \u201cI hardly know the look on my cook\u2019s face at the best of times. Now I think of it, there\u2019s a chef down in my kitchens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, this is what my cook looks like at the worst of times,\u201d Harriet said. The black queen\u2019s lip was curled, and she appeared to have just stamped her foot. \u201cWhy are you removing them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sending them to London,\u201d Jem said. \u201cI\u2019ll give them to the Duchess of Beaumont. She once expressed interest in them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? They\u2019re so beautiful. My\u2014\u201d Harriet bit back the words. Benjamin would have loved the set, but Mr. Cope had no husband, dead or otherwise.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d give them to you, but they\u2019re cursed.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet laughed.</p><p>\u201cI bought them from a Moroccan prince visiting London,\u201d Jem said, as if he didn\u2019t hear her laugh. \u201cHe told me that anyone who owns the set will never be happy in love. He called it an anger board.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s absurd,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI thought so too, but I broke up the set by selling the white queen, just in case,\u201d Jem said. \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve decided to get rid of the whole set. I\u2019ve seen a lot of queer things and I\u2019ve learned not to trust my own sense of reality.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven the way your tower stays upright,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>All the little pieces were out of the case now. The kings had their fists in the air and seemed to be screaming war cries. The bishops had odd masks pushed up over their heads. The look on their faces would make one shiver. She picked up a pawn, only to find that he was carrying a lance that poked her in the hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave these for Povy to pack up,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t send them to Jemma,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cSell them instead.\u201d</p> <p>He turned around. \u201cSo you believe in the curse?\u201d</p><p>When Jem smiled it did something to her stomach. Her much-vaunted commonsense told her to run. Her heart told her to smile back. Maybe even lie back.</p><p>The company must be addling her brain. Before long she\u2019d be sending men bits of erotic poetry. Which reminded her, so she pulled the perfumed sheet of paper out of her pocket.</p><p>\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Jem said. He was getting ready for their match, pulling off his jacket, rolling his sleeves up muscled arms. All this male beauty was bound up in the sense of freedom she\u2019d had this week\u2014but that was a mirage, not real life.</p><p>She could find a gentleman to marry. Anyone who wanted children, and had a decent personality.</p><p>Jem raised an eyebrow when he read the full verse.</p><p>My body is but little,</p><p>So is the nightingale\u2019s</p><p>I love to sleep against prickle</p><p>So doth the nightingale.</p><p>And if you\u2019d like to know my name,</p><p>You\u2019ll find me wearing a veil\u2014</p><p>And nothing else!</p><p>\u201cA veil sounds ominously like a proposal of marriage,\u201d he said, tossing the sheet away.</p><p>\u201cIt believe the word offers a clue to your correspondent\u2019s name,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine who that might be.\u201d</p><p>He knew who it was. He knew Nell\u2019s last name was Gale. But he was pulling off his boots, not looking up.</p><p>\u201cDo you receive many letters of this sort?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNo. I fancy the cleverness of it is to your credit. I do receive many propositions, generally more boldly phrased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, eyebrow raised. \u201cYou may not credit this, Harry, being as you\u2019re a prettier man than most of the women out there, but women do find me attractive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not pretty!\u201d Harriet protested.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, you are,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cJust look at the effect you had on poor Kitty. And it\u2019s not as if she hasn\u2019t had many to choose from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t write me any letters.\u201d</p><p>The way he looked at her made her feel like a fool and a king at the same time. And a woman, through and through.</p><p>You\u2019re a man, Harriet told herself. Remember you\u2019re a man.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how good Kitty is with her letters,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIf you\u2019d like, I could help her. The way you helped my little nightingale come up with rhyming words.\u201d</p><p>Harriet opened her mouth to deny it and then sighed. \u201cWell, aren\u2019t you the least bit tempted? That\u2019s the first poetry I\u2019ve written in years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy the nightingale? No. But I\u2019m shocked by you. Who would have thought you knew words like prickle? Or could employ them so...usefully?\u201d</p><p>Harriet felt herself growing a little pink. \u201cI know all sorts of words.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to give me a vocabulary lesson one of these days,\u201d Jem said dryly. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could use instruction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely your mistress could do that service for you,\u201d Harriet said, before she caught back the words.</p><p>His answer came a few heartbeats too late, after she\u2019d had time to think about what a fool she was. \u201cI don\u2019t have one,\u201d he said.</p><p>Harriet had her masculinity firmly in grip now. \u201cEvery gentleman has a bit of muslin,\u201d she said. \u201cYou needn\u2019t lie to me, Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall me Jem,\u201d he said with emphasis. \u201cMy name is Jem. No mistress. I had one for a while a few years ago, but she wanted to meet Eugenia. That wasn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas Eugenia recovered from last night?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. Her governess has been dismissed, and so has the footman who was supposed to be at her door. Povy discovered they were spending the night together in a knife closet, of all places. Are you ready to fence, Mr. Cope?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It seemed to Harriet that Jem\u2019s eyes gleamed when he said Mr. Cope, as if he relished the sound of it, but she said nothing. Just went to the side of the room and hauled off her boots. For once, it was warm in the gallery when she stripped off her coat.</p><p>\u201cDid you see that I had a brazier brought in?\u201d he called to her.</p><p>Sure enough, a fat iron-wrought pot sat to the side, radiating heat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m trying to keep Eugenia warm. But then she decided not to join us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood,\u201d Harriet said rather absently. She had just realized that she had a blister on her right palm from practicing so long the previous night. It hurt to grasp the rapier.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jem said instantly.</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said, gripping her weapon. \u201cEn garde, sir.\u201d</p><p>He fell into position, that long muscled body such an elegant pleasure to look at that Harriet made herself turn her head.</p><p>\u201cNever turn your eyes from your opponent,\u201d he said sharply.</p> <p>Obediently, she looked again. \u201cI\u2019ll show you an envelopment today,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWatch me.\u201d</p><p>He held his rapier in his right hand, brought it up in a graceful looping arch, swung it around, slid it under, and lunged forward.</p><p>\u201cAgain,\u201d she said, memorizing the way his arm came up, the way his other arm flew out in balance, keeping his body in perfect symmetry.</p><p>He did it again.</p><p>\u201cLike this?\u201d She tried it but knew something was wrong. Her arm went too high and then came down at a sharp angle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re terrifyingly good at this,\u201d he remarked. \u201cI didn\u2019t get that far for hours when I first learned.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t believe that, but her voice died in her throat. He was behind her again, reaching around her body to show her where to begin the motion, his long muscular arm lying against hers. She swallowed. His body touched hers, like a flash of fire, like a promise forgotten, and her whole body flamed in response.</p><p>\u201cNow you try,\u201d he said, coming in front of her again. He looked utterly unmoved. Well, of course he did: he thought he was teaching Harry Cope how to fence! The thought steadied Harriet. At least Jem could have no idea how his touch made her tremble. It was a humiliating secret\u2014but it was a secret.</p><p>She tried the move. Tried it again while his keen eyes watched her. He stopped her, showed her again, demonstrating what she\u2019d done wrong. After twenty minutes, she\u2019d forgotten that his touch made her heart race. She was too possessed by the idea of reproducing the exact movements he was showing her. And twenty minutes after that\u2014she had it.</p><p>\u201cPerfect!\u201d he said, his eyes smiling at her.</p><p>Just like that, her body turned liquid, longing, female. Everything about her felt female: soft, curved, luxurious.</p><p>\u201cWhat an odd expression you have on your face,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I pull off my shirt, do you, Harry? I seem to have become quite heated with all this exercise.\u201d</p><p>He had the kind of body that Harriet had only seen on laboring men. Not noblemen. Noblemen had slightly sagging physiques like Benjamin, the bodies of men who spent the evenings drinking copious amounts of brandy and playing chess.</p><p>Not Lord Strange.</p> <p>Not Jem.</p><p>He looked as if he belonged in the golden light of a wheat field, swinging a scythe overhead. His chest looked powerful. Useful, as if a woman could throw herself there and\u2014</p><p>Useful? Was she losing her mind?</p><p>\u201cHarry?\u201d Jem asked with a look of concern. \u201cAre you all right? Let me see that hand.\u201d</p><p>He walked over and unfortunately the effect of his naked chest near hers sucked all the air out of her lungs and Harriet couldn\u2019t even protest as he uncurled her fingers. All right, she had a blister. But who would have thought she would be so affected by a muscled male body?</p><p>The very thought made her face burn. If she didn\u2019t watch out, she\u2019d end up hanging over the rail and watching her own men scythe the fields. Like a hungry old maid.</p><p>Unless, a traitorous little voice in the back of her mind said, unless you\u2014</p><p>\u201cThis is quite a blister you have forming,\u201d Jem said. \u201cWe need to wrap it up and keep it clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019d better go do that,\u201d she said with relief, skipping back a step. If she was losing her mind and turning into a bawdy widow out of a ballad, she would prefer to do it in the privacy of her bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cNo need,\u201d he said. He went out to the corridor and bawled \u201cPovy, water! Soap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t hear you,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cOf course he will. You sit there and watch me while I show you the next move.\u201d</p><p>Watch him? It was like some sort of torture, but not torture that Harriet ever dreamed of. Whatever this emotion was, it wasn\u2019t one that belonged to Harriet. Plain, country Harriet didn\u2019t feel surges of longing that practically brought her to her knees.</p><p>It was humiliating.</p><p>It was exhilarating.</p><p>Jem swung the rapier above his head like some sort of conquering warrior. She could see him in a Viking\u2019s leather breeches, scarred from many a fight on his longboat, his hair blowing in the ocean wind...</p><p>Her eyes were glazing over so she pulled herself back to the move he was showing her. It was an impossibly dizzingly series of deft movements, darting forward and back.</p><p>\u201cAre you watching, Harry?\u201d he shouted at her. He raised those golden shoulders again, and Harriet slowly nodded her head. She was watching.</p><p>\u201cWant to try it yourself?\u201d he said, pausing.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and her voice didn\u2019t even sound like her own voice. It sounded lethargic and sweet, like a trickle of honey.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and his mouth opened, but thankfully the door opened and Povy bustled in. \u201cA bowl of water, my lord, and dish of soap. May I enquire as to the injury?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust a blister, Povy,\u201d Strange said. \u201cI can take care of it myself.\u201d</p><p>He was still standing in the middle of the gallery floor, looking as if he didn\u2019t even know that God had given him the kind of body that women dream of. Well, not that Harriet had ever dreamed of a man\u2019s body, because she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She\u2019d dreamed of love. Of affection and kisses. Once she\u2019d married Benjamin, those dreams had clarified: she\u2019d started imagining a man who would look interested when she spoke to him, who would show concern if she were ill, or sad, or just plain tired.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t think about the bed. Well, perhaps only a little bit. If Benjamin won an important game, he was always happy and smiling, and generally he would come to her bed. They would make love, and then he would tell her the entire game, playing the moves out on her breasts as if she was a chess board. Sometimes they wouldn\u2019t even finish consummating the act before he started recounting his triumphs.</p><p>\u201cHis development was slow,\u201d Benjamin would say, rearing over her with a little grunt. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t find a good square for his Queen\u2019s Bishop\u201d\u2014grunt\u2014\u201cI made sure his bishop never got to King\u2019s Knight Two.\u201d Grunt.</p><p>The memory made her feel a great deal cooler.</p><p>Jem was a much prettier package than her late husband. He even seemed to listen to her\u2014but he thought she was a man. And if he knew she was a woman, would he be teaching her fencing?</p><p>Not likely. Or, as Harry Cope might say, \u201cNot damned likely.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Povy left and Jem said, \u201cNow we\u2019ll clean your blister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can do it by myself,\u201d Harriet said.

There was a dancing light in his eyes, a deep sense of laughter that made her treacherous heart thump.</p><p>\u201cLooking for bandages.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Flick! His rapier sang through the air and one of the buttons on her shirt skittered away across the floor.</p><p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>Flick!</p><p>Harriet put her hands on her hips and gave him a ferocious scowl. \u201cJust what do you think you\u2019re doing? If you\u2019re planning on cutting up my shirt, I volunteer yours instead!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t do that,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cMy shirts are specially woven for me in the Caucasus mountains by three-legged goats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me. Nevertheless, my shirt is not bandage-making material, for all it\u2019s made of English linen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSoft, white, easily cut,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy\u2014\u201d</p><p>And with one flicker of his rapier, he cut a slash down the front of her shirt.</p><p>Quick as she could, Harriet clutched together the two sides. \u201cHow dare you!\u201d she shouted furiously. \u201cNo one unclothes me without my express permission. Are you mad?\u201d</p><p>He had two responses to that. First he threw back his head and laughed. And then, rather more ominously, he turned the key in the lock.</p><p>Harriet fell back a step, suddenly remembering that she was Mr. Harry Cope, and that apparently Jem had decided to broaden his horizons by\u2014by\u2014she could hardly think. This couldn\u2019t be happening. Why, she was certain he was just joking.</p><p>Jem prowled toward her, silent in his stockings, a flicker in his eyes telling her that he was still laughing, inside. Apparently this situation made him feel happy.</p><p>Harriet waited one more step and then made a break for the door.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even feel the slash that separated her shirt in the back. She only felt the swish of cool air and then the billowing of her shirt. She shrieked, the enraged shriek of a female Viking and swung around into fighting position, wishing she had her rapier in hand.</p> <p>\u201cHow dare you destroy my clothing!\u201d</p><p>But he was laughing at her again. \u201cYou\u2019re such a very odd man, Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business,\u201d she retorted, stepping back one step so that she was almost within reach of the key. \u201cYou, sir, are a wanton reprobate. I know what you\u2019re thinking and I assure you that I have no interest in\u2014in being the object of your interest. You may wish to broaden your horizons, but I, sir, do not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Harry,\u201d he said softly, his gray eyes gleaming with something like excitement, something like joy, something that\u2014that she didn\u2019t know how to identify. \u201cI\u2019ve decided that I truly love men. Shamefully, I never joined those they call mollys. Now I see the error of my ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can do whatever you wish, but not with me,\u201d Harriet managed. She had her hand on the key, but she kept her eyes on him, not knowing what would happen to her poor shirt if she turned around once more. As it was she could feel cool air all over her shoulders, though the bandages protected her breasts.</p><p>\u201cBut I only want you,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cWomen are so boring,\u201d he said softly, his thumb rubbing the line of her jaw. She jerked her head away. \u201cI had no idea how arousing it was to fence with someone...with you. It made up my mind. I never thought I was that sort of man, but for you, with you, I\u2019m going into new territory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot with me,\u201d she said though clenched teeth. \u201cI\u2019m not interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t be the Prince Charming who will lead me into a whole new world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she spat. She had her hand on the key, but there was something in his eyes that made her stop. He had a rapier in his hand and he was menacing her with God knows what kind of obscene behavior and yet her heart was fluttering like a debutante\u2019s at her first compliment.</p><p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m dropping my weapon,\u201d Jem said. \u201cThe one that doesn\u2019t matter, anyway.\u201d</p><p>It happened very fast. He reached out a hand and wrenched.</p><p>The English linen failed her, fell into two pieces and off her shoulders as if it were nothing more than a rag.</p><p>Heat flashed through her body like a gift.</p><p>\u201cWhat have we here?\u201d he asked, desire making his voice husky. Those long fingers curled around the top layer of her bandage. Before she could stop herself, her hand came up and covered his.</p><p>\u201cBandages,\u201d he said quietly. His gray eyes drifted over her, claiming her, knowing her. Suddenly he fell back a step. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me! I\u2019ll never get to broaden my horizons now, will I?\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open and then she saw the lines by his mouth deepen and realized with a giddy wave of pleasure that she, Harriet, knew what Lord Strange was feeling, even if no one else did.</p><p>He was laughing.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cMmmmm,\u201d he said. \u201cI always knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d she said, shivering, trying to ignore the touch of those clever long fingers as he unrolled the cotton from her breasts, around and around.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like the best present I never had,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cWhen did you find out?\u201d she persisted, trying to stave off nervousness. What if he expected more than she had under those bandages? Someone more endowed?</p><p>\u201cI guessed in the stables,\u201d he said, grinning at her. \u201cAnd Villiers confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers!\u201d she cried. He unwound another circle and then she realized. \u201cThe Latin!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLatin,\u201d he agreed. But he didn\u2019t sound interested. His eyes very dark, very intent, he gently took away the very last winding of bandage.</p><p>When Benjamin first saw her breasts, on their wedding night, he said that they were small but that small was just as good as large, and he hoped she agreed. She had agreed, because she was just grateful to discover that he wasn\u2019t disappointed. Harriet looked down at herself, trying to see her breasts through Jem\u2019s eyes.</p><p>They were small. But they were perfectly shaped, like teardrops, Benjamin had said. It made her feel odd to even think of Benjamin, so she banished his name from her mind.</p><p>\u201cIt must be my birthday indeed,\u201d Jem said softly. And then he reached out for her.</p><p>She thought he would take her breasts in his hands and rub them. That was what Benjamin would have done.</p><p>But Jem didn\u2019t touch her breasts. He pulled her against him and his tongue curled into her mouth at the same moment. Harriet went rigid with surprise. Benjamin kissed her. Of course he did.</p><p>But he never\u2014</p><p>Sensations raced through her body as his tongue played a lazy game with hers. He was tasting her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she managed.</p><p>He looked down at her. \u201cKissing you.\u201d He took her mouth again, cupping her face in his hands, and she was ready this time and melted toward him. But he licked her lips, as if she were a delicious sweet, savored her, finally came to her like an old friend, like a cool drink.</p><p>That kiss...</p><p>The kiss changed Harriet. She could feel it, changing her sinews and her bones, changing the essence of who Harriet was: a sad, tidy little widow from the country. But with that kiss singing in her bones, she wanted to dance. It raced through her blood and made her want to scream.</p> <p>She kissed him back.</p><p>And this time it was he who pulled back, breathing heavily. \u201cDamn, Harry,\u201d he said, whispering it, his voice a silken rasp in her ears. \u201cTell me\u2014not that I\u2019m fooling myself that it will make a damn bit of difference\u2014tell me you\u2019re not a virgin.\u201d</p><p>She cocked up a corner of her mouth.</p><p>He kissed her again, hard, and she could taste his gratitude. She felt it too. It hadn\u2019t been fun, being a virgin. In the first few months of marriage, she used to stay at balls and musicales until she had black circles under eyes, until Benjamin was tottering with drink. She challenged him to teach her chess and would listen for hours, prompting him to replay master moves with her, all to avoid the bedroom.</p><p>Because it hurt.</p> <p>Even once it did get better, there had never been anything like the fierce desire that burned along her legs now, when Jem hadn\u2019t even touched her.</p><p>So she pulled his head down to her and threw herself into learning the new sport, the kind of kissing that\u2019s done with tongues and wet mouths and intimacy.</p><p>\u201cIt feels as if we\u2019re talking,\u201d she murmured some time later.</p><p>\u201cWe are,\u201d he said, kissing her sweetly. And then hard, fierce, so that she trembled, felt all female, every inch soft and desirous.</p><p>And still he didn\u2019t touch her.</p><p>\u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not a virgin, Harry, you sure as hell haven\u2019t had much experience kissing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a fast learner.\u201d She brushed her lips over his. How dare a man have that full lower lip? It tantalized her.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, \u201cI just want to understand the rules.\u201d</p><p>This was pure Jem.</p><p>\u201cUseful knowledge?\u201d she said with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cNo back talk from you, young Harry,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is your name, by the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarriet.\u201d</p><p>She saw the name settle in his mind, grow into a smile. \u201cI like it,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI like Harry better.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re a virgin kisser,\u201d he said, \u201cbut not a virgin otherwise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI kissed before! Many times. Just not\u2014not that kind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat kind?\u201d</p><p>She had to show him what kind she meant, and they got distracted. Still he didn\u2019t touch her, though, so she brazenly pulled him close and put her body against his. He was speed and muscle and smooth skin. And she felt soft and curvy and delicious.</p><p>More so than ever in her life. More so than her wedding day, than her wedding night.</p><p>\u201cHarriet,\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cHarry to you.\u201d She wiggled against him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m curious about the amount of experience you\u2019ve had. That is,\u201d he gasped a little as she managed to rub against something that was making a lump in his breeches. And it wasn\u2019t a rolled-up sock either. \u201cThat is, are we talking about once or twice in a hay loft? I\u2019m just wondering\u2014\u201d</p><p>He broke off, probably because she was tired of him not touching her and it occurred to her that no one said there was a law that she shouldn\u2019t touch him. So she cupped him there.</p><p>\u201cI was married for years,\u201d she told him, loving the hardness, even through his breeches, the strangled noise he made in his throat, the way his hips arched a little toward her. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t know about men.\u201d</p><p>He froze. \u201cStill married? Because I am absurdly old-fashioned...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? You, the owner of a house known for its affaires?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cLuckily, I\u2019m a widow.\u201d She ran her hand down the front of his breeches again.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he managed. \u201cExcellent. I mean, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about your loss.\u201d And with that his hands came down from the door and slid down her back, leaving a trail of fire. \u201cYou are a beautiful woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew you were beautiful. I thought you were the prettiest boy I ever met. But then when I realized you were a woman I knew you were the most beautiful woman I ever met.\u201d</p><p>It was so ridiculous that Harriet didn\u2019t even listen. Besides, he was stroking her, dragging his fingers over her flesh in little circles and movements that made her shiver and gasp. Especially when he finally made his slow way to her breasts. He didn\u2019t grab them with endearing, if puppish enthusiasm, the kind of caress she was used to.</p><p>Instead he stroked them with his fingertips as if she were made out of glass, as if her skin were the most delicate silk in the world. His fingers sang across her skin.</p><p>Just like that, she lost the strength in her knees, but his arm was there to hold her up. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he murmured, \u201cbut I have to have a taste.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u201d</p><p>And then she was on the ground, being gently laid backwards on a little pile of discarded clothing: her ruined shirt, their jackets, his shirt. When his mouth touched her breast, it was as sleek and fiery as his fingers.</p><p>She moaned, head back, her fingers burrowing into his thick hair and pulling it free from its ribbon.</p><p>He paid her no mind, kissing her over and over, lips brushing her bare skin until the caress was too much, until she started feeling as if she might start begging soon, crying.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d she gasped, pulling him up.</p><p>He laughed down at her. \u201cMarried, and still so quick to draw?\u201d</p><p>She arched backward and said, \u201cPlease. Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long were you married?\u201d he asked, not touching her.</p><p>\u201cYears,\u201d she said impatiently.</p><p>\u201cYears with no child?\u201d</p><p>And she knew what he was saying. It was only a pulse of sadness: a second that passed. \u201cNo need for a French letter,\u201d she said, making her voice cheerful.</p><p>So he came to her, braced above her, hair falling forward like silk around her face.</p><p>Harriet was used to making love: to the dry pull at the beginning that sometimes stung and hurt a little, giving way to a warming friction, to the delight of it. To the way a man\u2019s body felt in her arms, hot and slightly sweaty.</p><p>This was entirely different.</p><p>For one thing\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure about this,\u201d she gasped. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnything for a lady,\u201d he said, leaning down to capture her lips again.</p><p>But she raised her neck and peered down between their bodies instead. She was right.</p><p>\u201cUm, Jem?\u201d</p><p>He managed to capture her in a kiss so fierce and sweet that she almost didn\u2019t notice what he was doing with his hips, but her body did.</p><p>\u201cStop,\u201d she ordered. \u201cWait!\u201d She was feeling\u2014she wasn\u2019t even sure what she was feeling.</p><p>She peered down there again. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLast time I checked,\u201d Jem said, \u201cit was my favorite body part. Happiest body part. Dare I say it\u2014my best body part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d She shut her mouth. What she was thinking was disloyal. But still...she peeked again. It had to be twice the size of Benjamin\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not sure...\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will,\u201d he said. He did a little hip dance that made her gasp. \u201cPlease, can we try?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p> <p>There was no dryness, no pinch, no pain.</p><p>He came all the way inside her and then stopped.</p><p>\u201cWe fit,\u201d she said, rather dazed. \u201cWe fit like puzzle pieces.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked a little agonized. \u201cYou\u2019re small,\u201d he said. His voice was hoarse.</p><p>\u201cI know. My breasts are small too.\u201d She smoothed her hands over his shoulder muscles.</p> <p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he gasped. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem.\u201d</p><p>And he thrust deeply. This was Harriet\u2019s favorite part of making love: this part. It made her feel adored. Important. She wiggled a little, getting herself set to be a proper bed for him, a lifting platform for his work. The man\u2019s part seemed like work; Benjamin\u2019s face always turned a light purple color. \u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said.</p><p>Jem\u2019s face wasn\u2019t purple. He was looking down at her, eyebrow raised. \u201cI\u2019m getting some very strange ideas about your marriage, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>He really felt wonderful. She could feel her whole body relaxing, accepting, drawing him in. \u201cHmmm,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we could discuss it later?\u201d</p><p>His chest was covered with muscles and just a dusting of hair. He was rubbing his lips against her forehead, which meant his chest kept brushing over her nipples.</p><p>Jem paused for a moment the way he used to when he was a young buck who couldn\u2019t always control himself. There was a problem here.</p> <p>His lovely Harry may be a widow, but she didn\u2019t know how to make love. She looked about as engaged as a mattress, though she was giving him an adorable smile.</p><p>It would break his heart if she turned out to be one of the women who couldn\u2019t experience pleasure. Back in his wild days, before he married Sally, he\u2019d found himself in a few beds like that.</p><p>He used to do his best\u2014and he knew quite well that his best was about the best there was\u2014and if it didn\u2019t work, he gave up, took his own pleasure, thanked his partner warmly, and walked away.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to walk away this time. Harriet\u2019s round little body was female in every respect, all cream and silk. He wanted it. He wanted her to writhe in his arms. And damn it, he was going to make sure that happened.</p><p>It was painful, but he withdrew from the sweetest, tightest channel he\u2019d had the pleasure to visit.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d she said, blinking at him.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t nearly where she needed to be. Not nearly.</p><p>He gave her a sleepy smile, the kind an alligator gives its victim before he gobbles him up. \u201cI decided I\u2019m hungry.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet looked totally confused. Her husband must have had a member the size of peapod, and the technique to go along with it.</p><p>He reached down and licked her on her cheek, which was as smooth and delicate as the side of a peach. A man! How on earth was he ever so stupid as to think she was a man?</p><p>It was shaming. He ran his tongue along the side of her jaw. Harriet had a strong jaw. Maybe that was it. She didn\u2019t have a receding jaw like so many ladies did, the kind who sat around and clucked over their embroideries. She had the jaw of a woman who knew her mind, who fought with a sword and did a damn good job, who\u2014</p><p>He forgot where that was going because he had reached her lips. They were lush and rose-colored. He gave himself another two-second lecture about his own stupidity, and then let their kiss turn wild.</p><p>Just so she understood from the beginning, he took control of her mouth, and plunged into her, claiming her, naming her, making sure she knew she was a woman. No man. His woman.</p><p>The thought was dim in the back of his mind, but he knew it anyway. He hadn\u2019t waited eight years, ever since Sally died, just to find himself another lover.</p><p>Whoever Harriet was, his own little widow, she was his now.</p><p>He pulled back, propped himself on one elbow, and moved to her breast. Claimed it. Now she was responding. Her hands started moving restlessly over his shoulder, clutching him, sliding over his chest and down his back. She even touched the curve of his arse but pulled back instantly, as if she\u2019d been stung.</p><p>In a flash he knew what the problem was. Harry had done a pretty good job of being a man. But she\u2019d been trained to act like a lady and talk like a lady\u2014and make love like a lady.</p><p>Though she wasn\u2019t one.</p><p>She was an Amazon warrior at the heart, a woman who would meet a man on her own terms and demand what she wanted.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>\u201cWh-what?\u201d</p><p>Those wide pansy-brown eyes of hers were starting to look a little dazed, which was a good thing. His Harriet thought too much. What she needed was to be shocked.</p><p>And he was just the man to do it, Jem thought with a grin.</p><p>\u201cNow, Harry,\u201d he said, making his voice into a drawl, \u201cyou know what sort of man I am, don\u2019t you?\u201d Just so she had a vague idea, he started rubbing her nipple with his thumb. Like the sweet little angel that she was, her back arched a little.</p><p>But that annoying brain of hers was obviously still working, because she opened her eyes again, and said, \u201cI know what kind of man you want everyone to think you are, Jem. I\u2019m not so sure about the real you.\u201d</p><p>Obviously she wasn\u2019t quite at the mindless stage she needed to be at yet. \u201cI\u2019m a libertine,\u201d he told her, pulling back so that her body was before him like a delicious meal. Then he bent down and kissed her breast until he could hear soft pants. She liked little bites, so he moved to the other breast and gave it some special treatment. She was twisting under him now.</p><p>\u201cDebauched. A whoremonger. A voluptuary,\u201d he told her.</p><p>But he underestimated her, because those eyes of hers popped open and she said, \u201cNonsense. You\u2019ve never slept with a whore in your life.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth and then he realized that given his extreme dislike of exchanges of coin for intimacy, he could hardly win that argument.</p><p>Instead he went for the kind of argument he knew best. The kind he knew he could win. \u201cWe voluptuaries want everything when we make love,\u201d he said, moving down her body. \u201cOpen your legs, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She was peering down at him, desire warring with alarm. \u201cDo you want to\u2014to look at me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. You\u2019re so pink and soft down there\u201d\u2014he pushed her legs open\u2014\u201cI wish you could see what I\u2019m seeing. Sleek little leaves like rose petals. And the sweetest little door that a man ever saw.\u201d In fact, it was getting hard to speak because his body wasn\u2019t used to all this wanton talk, and thought action would be a good idea.</p><p>Instead he pushed her legs wider and went for the kiss that turned every woman into an Amazon.</p><p>Naturally, Harriet was more resistant than some. Sally, for example, had just sighed and said, \u201cThank God,\u201d and laid back.</p><p>But Harriet had her legs out of his way and was scrambling to her knees before he managed to catch her. \u201cNow, Harriet,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019re simply going to have to go along with my depraved desires.

He kept up the gentle rub over her nipple, and he could tell she was a breast woman.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of such a thing,\u201d she said suspiciously. But he could see her eyes going soft again.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t expect that making love to me would be the same as to\u2014to that country squire you married,\u201d he said.</p><p>She opened her eyes and he knew he\u2019d nailed her husband. Of course he was a country squire. It was the only thing that made sense. She hadn\u2019t been sheltered by some overprotective mama\u2014it had been a hidebound country squire instead. Maybe he was one of those gentleman farmers.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you have different demands,\u201d she said, looking down her own body dubiously. \u201cI just don\u2019t think\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think,\u201d he said. Then he planted himself between her legs and started to give her little bites on her thighs.</p> <p>Just like that, Harriet started making soft sounds. His erection was pulsing against the floor, begging him, but by then he\u2019d reached her core, his tongue sliding over her sweetness, driving her to arch her hips again and again.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t being too incoherent now, though words kept flying from her lips. \u201cNo,\u201d and \u201cYes,\u201d and \u201cJem,\u201d and a few things he couldn\u2019t understand.</p><p>\u201cI love the way you taste,\u201d he told her, just in case she didn\u2019t know that by now. \u201cYou taste like sugar and spice and lemon\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLemon soap,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>He took another few minutes on a particularly delicate spot, just to punish her for having been rational enough to mention lemon soap.</p><p>Then he stopped. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d he asked, keeping his tone innocent.</p> <p>She raised her head, eyes wild. He knew those eyes and loved them: that was the look of a woman who was about to strike a man.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he said innocently, \u201cdid I lose track of what I was doing?\u201d</p><p>She had her fingers in his hair, and she was panting.</p><p>All good.</p><p>A few minutes later, he raised his head again. \u201cLemon soap?\u201d</p><p>She looked down at him, dazed. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help grinning. He let his fingers play a bit, though he knew it wasn\u2019t the same. She writhed under him.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cSay kiss me,\u201d he commanded. His Amazon needed to put things into words, to own them.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she sobbed, \u201ckiss me, please.\u201d A lady to the end.</p><p>So he bent his head again and this time he let his fingers wander everywhere, because those \u201cNo\u2019s\u201d just kept being swallowed up by \u201cYes\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>And then he finally took her home.</p><p>It took all he had not to slip into her. But he coaxed her and commanded her and ignored her protests until she started curling her toes, and uttering little screams.</p><p>And he had her...she cried again and again, and her sweet body curled toward him, convulsing with pleasure.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, sweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cGo...go!\u201d</p><p>Harriet stared at the ceiling of the picture gallery. It was far away, and seemed to be swinging slightly. It was as if the whole world had tilted a bit on its axis and dropped her off the side.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Jem was above her again, arms braced. \u201cWould you mind if we made love now?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him, unable to form words.</p><p>He nudged his hips toward her. A strangled sound came from her throat. Her knees slid up of their own volition.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a yes,\u201d he said. And then he stroked forward, hard.</p><p>It was unlike anything she\u2019d ever experienced before. The pleasure she\u2019d just experienced was in her bones, but it turned instantly into a clinging kind of joyful fire. She lifted her hips toward him without even realizing what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Jem said, his voice deep.</p><p>He was the most beautiful man in the world to her. She started running her fingers over his cheekbones, over those fierce, intelligent eyes, over his strong jaw. Down to his shoulders, hips, the muscles responsible for her little cascades of shivers.</p><p>He thrust again, and like magic, her hips rose to meet him.</p><p>And again. \u201cDo you see how?\u201d he said. His teeth seemed to be clenched. His face didn\u2019t look purple, but there were little beads of sweat on his forehead. And his shoulders.</p><p>She tasted them\u2014they tasted like salt, clean salt and Jem.</p><p>He kept stroking forward, long and strong, and she couldn\u2019t keep her mind on her exploration of his body. She was starting to feel unmoored, as if her whole attention had narrowed to the fire caused by his movements. Long after Benjamin would have collapsed onto her, Jem just kept going, smooth, indomitable, as if he would never stop.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t breathe. All she could do was follow him into the storm, her fingers clenched on his shoulders, little cries coming from her throat.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cThat\u2019s it, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>Her hands slid from his shoulders, clenched onto his arse. It was smooth under her fingers, muscled and strong. She could feel his body as if it were her own, throbbing, plunging, thrusting deep into her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even hear Jem because her world shattered and flew, remade itself into a different place, a place in which a kind of deep pleasure was possible that she never imagined.</p><p>Could never have imagined.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>The Scandal! A Woman in Breeches</p><p>D inner was an odd affair. Jem wasn\u2019t expected to join the company, but he suddenly appeared.</p><p>Harriet choked.</p><p>Povy flew into a flurry of activity, rushing to get a chair and put it at the head of the table.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry so much, Povy,\u201d Jem said. \u201cI\u2019ll slip in next to the Duchess of Cosway. If you don\u2019t mind, Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>Harriet hastily moved her chair to the left and allowed Povy to slip a chair between herself and Isidore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upsetting our dinner symmetry, I know, and I do apologize for my late arrival,\u201d Jem said, smiling around the table. \u201cI simply couldn\u2019t resist the chance to speak with the duchess.\u201d</p><p>To her left, Nell was excitedly pinching Harriet\u2019s arm. \u201cDoes he know?\u201d she whispered shrilly into Harriet\u2019s ear.</p><p>Jem sat down and his leg instantly pressed against hers. Harriet snatched up her napkin. Jem accepted a plate of food and began talking to Isidore, on his right.</p><p>Nell pinched Harriet again. \u201cDid you give him the entire poem? That must be why he came down to supper. He almost never joins the company for supper!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did give him the rest of the poem,\u201d Harriet whispered back.</p><p>Nell took a deep breath and clasped her hands together. \u201cI am going to marry him, you know. I\u2019ve quite made up my mind.\u201d</p><p>Harriet discovered that she no longer felt this wish was as humorous as she thought a few days ago. \u201cReally,\u201d she said, a bit coldly. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe must not be certain who wrote the note.

I can\u2019t arrange your liaisons.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already have,\u201d Nell said, her eyes sparkling with deep excitement. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t charge Strange a thing.

She froze. Of course, Nell couldn\u2019t see. No one could. He had hooked the tablecloth over his arm.</p><p>His fingers...those fingers...her skin was instantly on fire. He was smiling at Isidore as he slid his fingers up, toward the crotch of her breeches.</p><p>\u201cHarry!\u201d Nell hissed.</p><p>Harriet cleared her throat. Jem finished his sentence and turned toward her. \u201cMy dear Mr. Cope,\u201d he said. \u201cI truly apologize for not greeting you.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet inclined her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to have you join us, Lord Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI always chase pleasure whenever I can,\u201d he said carelessly. \u201cNow tell me, Mr. Cope, what is your given name?\u201d</p><p>Harriet narrowed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cYour first name?\u201d he prompted. \u201cOnly the most hidebound of friends address each other in formalities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted to introduce you to the author of that poetry that has so intrigued and delighted you,\u201d she said, ignoring his question.</p><p>\u201cAh, Miss Gale. What a surprise this is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNell,\u201d she said, dimpling at him. \u201cI certainly hope it was not an unpleasant surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot in the least,\u201d he said, giving her one of his most charming smiles. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose that you know Mr. Cope\u2019s given name, do you? He\u2019s far too stuffy to share it with all us.\u201d</p><p>Nell had a little frown that indicated she wasn\u2019t very interested in his question. \u201cIt\u2019s Harry,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHarry! Oh no, no, no,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Harriet asked with an edge of unfriendliness. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfectly good name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has no moral tone,\u201d Jem announced. \u201cNone at all. You couldn\u2019t be a judge with that name. Nor a bishop either. It would even be difficult for a parish priest. Now if you called yourself Harold, which likely is your true name, it would all be different.\u201d</p><p>He paused but Harriet wasn\u2019t going to encourage his silliness and kept silent. Nell leaned forward so that her bodice gaped open and said, \u201cHow would it be different, Lord Strange?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must call me Jem.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet thought uncharitably that Nell appeared on the edge of a joyful apoplexy.</p><p>\u201cNow if young Harry here would adopt his true name, Harold, he would quickly find a high moral tone was issuing from his mouth on all subjects. He could publish his remarks in Gentleman\u2019s Magazine, for example. They tell the most awful lies about women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>\u201cApparently some dissolute women have begun shaking hands,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI\u2019ve been guilty of that myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t approve, do we, Harold?\u201d Jem asked.</p><p>\u201cMy name is Harry, not Harold!\u201d Harriet snapped. \u201cAnd I think Miss Nell should shake hands with whomever she pleases.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne never knows where those hands might have been,\u201d Jem said, inching his fingers an inch higher.</p><p>She should stop him. She should, except the most delicious languor was creeping over her.</p><p>Earlier, after a bath, she had decided the whole episode that afternoon was like some sort of lovely dream, as unrepeatable as it was unacceptable.</p><p>But now her body was sending her signals that it would be happy to repeat every moment of it.</p><p>\u201cI shan\u2019t ever shake hands again,\u201d Nell said. \u201cWhat else do they say in that magazine, Jem?\u201d</p><p>She breathed his name as if they were already in bed together. It rolled off her tongue with visions of bridal finery and wedding nights, Harriet thought sourly.</p><p>\u201cThe author is practically virulent on the subject of women,\u201d Jem said. \u201cImagine. He says that women are carrying pistols.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Grandison put one in her knotting bag and it went off and shot a great hole in her drawing room carpet,\u201d Nell said. \u201cSo that is true as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis one must be an exaggeration. The author actually claims that some women have given up the sidesaddle for riding astride and\u2014who could believe this?\u2014are wearing breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBreeches look dreadfully uncomfortable,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI think that claim is rather unlikely, don\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d</p><p>Harry\u2014or Harriet\u2014couldn\u2019t think all that well, as Jem\u2019s thumb had taken up a rhythm that was making her feel rather faint. \u201cI agree,\u201d she managed.</p><p>\u201cBut breeches are so convenient,\u201d Jem coo\u2019d. He was obviously enjoying himself hugely. \u201cA woman\u2019s costume is impossible, what with her panniers, her petticoats, her stays...\u201d</p><p>Nell was giggling madly again. \u201cHow well you know us!\u201d she shrilled.</p><p>Jem leaned across Harry toward Nell, which allowed him to rub even harder. Harriet gasped and jumped in her seat.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t allow me to bother you, Cope,\u201d Jem said. \u201cI just want to make a point to Nell. Why do you suppose that women wear all that clothing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be attractive,\u201d Nell said promptly. She cast a quick look down at her gown in a manner that suggested she felt that she looked very attractive indeed.</p><p>\u201cBut think how attractive they\u2019d be if they merely wore breeches. Just think how a man\u2019s eyes would be able to feast on their limbs, on the curve of their\u2014I\u2019m not shocking you, am I, Nell?\u201d</p><p>Hardly. Nell\u2019s eyes were fixed on him the way a baby chick looks at its mother. It was Harriet who could feel herself turning pinker and pinker.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me,\u201d she said, scrambling backward and standing up. Jem\u2019s hand fell away. Her knees felt a bit weak.</p><p>\u201cAre you done eating?\u201d Jem asked.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said. \u201cAbsolutely finished.\u201d She was babbling, and tried to pull herself together. \u201cWhat I mean to say is that I shall accompany the Duchess of Cosway back to London tomorrow, so I should probably supervise the packing of my clothing.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked at her quickly, and she realized she\u2019d forgotten to tell him.</p><p>Nell scrambled into the chair that she had vacated. \u201cOh dear Harry,\u201d she cooed, smiling at Harriet. \u201cI wish you a wonderful trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d Jem said, his eyes rather unfriendly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see you here again,\u201d Nell said, taking on the role of the mistress of the manor.</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jem said, and he turned back to Nell with a smile.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>The Intoxicating Air of Fonthill</p><p>H arriet walked up the stairs thinking about three people she had to say farewell to: Eugenia, Villiers, and Jem. It was astonishing how differently she felt about Villiers than a mere month ago, when she hated him with a vengeance. Last year she had talked Jemma into shaming him at chess; she had spent hours wishing he would die of a loathsome disease. She was intent on revenge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And now...</p><p>Now he was the only person in the world other than herself who had apparently loved Benjamin.

She walked over and threw herself into the armchair opposite him and stretched out her legs.</p><p>\u201cNicely done,\u201d he said, eyeing her. \u201cThere is a certain lanky freedom about your legs that certainly bespeaks the male. How is it with the young woman who woos you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, I had to disclose a sad fact to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you had no equipment to pleasure her with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she tell everyone you\u2019re a woman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, she thinks I\u2019m a eunuch.\u201d</p> <p>His smile was delighted. \u201cA eunuch! How in the bloody hell did you supposedly come to that sorry state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe left it vague,\u201d Harriet said, grinning back at him. \u201cAn accident or some such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome such! Most men spend a good part of their waking hours making sure that no such accident comes near their privates.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe wept for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSlayer of a young lady\u2019s heart,\u201d Villiers said with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ve loosed a monster on Strange\u2019s household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t appear at supper at all,\u201d Harriet reported.</p> <p>\u201cPining in her room, unable to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that,\u201d Harriet said, picturing Kitty\u2019s abundant flesh. \u201cBut she may have taken consolation elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny other exciting events?\u201d he enquired.</p><p>\u201cDo you remember that I was wooing Lord Strange on behalf of Nell?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith poetry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I introduced her as the author of the said poetry and left them together at the table.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will come to nothing. Strange never dabbles,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cNow I am a dabbler. It took me a few years to understand that though he surrounds himself with beautiful women who could certainly be labeled loose, he never takes advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow odd,\u201d Harriet said.</p> <p>\u201cHe was wild to a fault after coming down from Oxford,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWe were there together and I had some adventures of my own, but nothing like Jem. He was in a fair way to getting the title of the worst rakehell yet to grace London; he belonged to every one of the various clubs that delighted in women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere you also a member of those clubs?\u201d Harriet asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a chess man,\u201d Villiers said, shrugging. \u201cI find an unadorned array of female breasts tiresome, if you\u2019ll forgive my bluntness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure I would feel the same about the more interesting parts of males. Although,\u201d she added, \u201cI might gawk for a few nights first.\u201d</p><p>He snorted. \u201cYou surprise me. Did you show this side of yourself to Benjamin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think it would have interested him?\u201d</p><p>He was silent. \u201cNo. He must have been a dreadful spouse, now I think it over. Do you suppose I shall be as bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do wish to marry someday,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd foolish though it may seem, I would like it to be a happy marriage. So please, give me some advice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t ever recount a chess game to a woman when you\u2019re in bed together, no matter how splendidly you performed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy goal in bed is always splendid performance,\u201d Villiers murmured.</p><p>Harriet rolled her eyes. \u201cPretend that chess is not your life\u2019s breath and blood, the reason for living\u2014\u201d She broke off. \u201cIt won\u2019t work, you know. Perhaps you could find someone like Jemma, someone who likes chess too. Then the two of you could sit together and mumble, \u2018Bishop to King\u2019s Four,\u2019 when you\u2019re too old for other activities.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to fascinate Jemma,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then I found an odd qualm in me about Beaumont, since we were old friends. The end of my sorry tale is that I heroically refused Jemma\u2019s advances, then changed my mind and found myself wounded by her brother before I had a chance to impress her with my charms. I intend to make another foray when I am completely well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll probably enjoy a recital of chess moves,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut if you wish to marry\u2014and I believe that is what you said\u2014you need someone else. Jemma is surprisingly married, more so all the time. But I came to tell you that we leave tomorrow morning. Isidore has discovered she is not nearly as prone to dissolute behavior as she believed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true of many ladies,\u201d Villiers observed. \u201cWhereas you, on the other hand, look to have happily settled into life as a rake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d Harriet admitted. \u201cI loathe panniers, powder, wigs, and all the rest of it. I haven\u2019t been so happy in years.\u201d</p><p>Villiers narrowed his eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s something different about you\u2014\u201d he sat up. \u201cI believe you have succumbed to the intoxicating air of the Strange household. Someone has discovered your true sex.\u201d</p><p>She smiled faintly but said nothing, just stood up to leave. She gave him her best bow, the one that ended with a flourish of her right hand.</p><p>\u201cNot bad,\u201d Villiers said. And then: \u201cAre you certain you wish to leave with Isidore? You\u2019re quite welcome to stay as my ward, you know. I should be on my feet tomorrow, if all continues well.\u201d</p><p>But Harriet was sure. There was nothing real about what had happened at Fonthill, with Jem. It was deliriously wonderful. It taught her things about men and women and her body. But her life was at home, not dressed up in breeches.</p><p>\u201cThis has been a wonderful few days,\u201d she said, meaning it. \u201cI was able to finally bury Benjamin, if that makes sense.\u201d</p><p>He inclined his head. \u201cAnd you\u2019re quite certain you wish to leave whomever it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite certain,\u201d she said steadily. \u201cI must return to real life.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cI will never dress myself as Mother Goose again.\u201d</p><p>There was an answering smile in his eyes.</p><p>She left.</p><p>Eugenia was building a castle out of pasteboard when Harriet made her way through the footman standing guard and into the nursery. She dropped to the floor next to the castle. It was remarkably good. The walls were cut with fair precision, and glued together. Eugenia had drawn little blocks to represent bricks. And there was a tower and battlements.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWhat comes next? And how\u2019s your rat bite?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s you! I was hoping you would visit. Look what I\u2019m making.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA castle,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI made the castle before,\u201d Eugenia said impatiently. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to have a battle, so I\u2019m making the soldiers now.\u201d</p><p>She was cutting out little men and placing them around the battlements. \u201cI was going to have the Saracens attack, but I changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn army of dogs?\u201d Harriet said, seeing what was arranged outside the castle.</p><p>\u201cRats!\u201d Eugenia said proudly. \u201cSee their tails? It\u2019s hard to cut out tails. I had to set up a hospital for all the wounded rats because my scissors kept slipping.\u201d Sure enough, there was a careful little pile of mangled rats off to the side. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHow\u2019s the bite?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>Eugenia held out her hand. \u201cAlmost gone, see?\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, the puncture wounds looked as if they were healing nicely.</p><p>\u201cI have to go home tomorrow morning,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI came to say goodbye.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy governess went home too. And the footman. People are always going home.\u201d She turned back to the rat she was cutting out and her hair swung before her face.</p><p>Harriet gently brushed it back. \u201cWould you like to pay me a visit, if your father agrees?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never leave Fonthill,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cPapa doesn\u2019t really let me out of these rooms, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true!\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHe just worries about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he brings all the actors here, because he doesn\u2019t want me to go to London to the theater,\u201d Eugenia said, still not looking. \u201cHe says someone might steal me, because we have too much money. He won\u2019t allow me to visit you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll ask him,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut you don\u2019t really think that your father wants you in your rooms all the time, do you? He merely worries about your safety.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia gave her a little crooked smile. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. One of the maids said that our house is full of monsters. When I was little, I believed that, but now I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMonsters!\u201d Harriet exclaimed. \u201cWere you afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but now I\u2019m more afraid of rats,\u201d Eugenia said. Her face brightened. \u201cBut Papa is going to get me a puppy\u2014the kind of puppy who can kill a rat! And it can live with me here, in the west wing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will speak to your father tomorrow morning. I promise you that, Eugenia. There are no monsters in this house. I will ask him to let you run free occasionally. And pay me a visit.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia hopped to her feet and dropped into a curtsy.</p> <p>\u201cIf you would do that, Harry, I would be tremendously grateful.\u201d</p><p>Harriet bowed to her, but the simple kind, with no flourishes. And then she kissed her goodbye.</p><p>And finally she gave her a hug.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>In Which Harriet Joins The Game. Finally.</p><p>H e caught up with her as she was walking down the corridor, away from Eugenia\u2019s room.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been looking everywhere for you,\u201d he said without preface. \u201cCome on, it\u2019s time for the Game to begin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGame? What game?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrimero. It\u2019s perfect for you.\u201d</p><p>Harriet trotted a little to keep up. \u201cPerfect how? I need to pack.\u201d</p><p>He just glanced over his shoulder and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been holding the Game almost every night for the last seven years. You\u2019re the first woman ever invited.\u201d</p><p>Harriet ran a little faster.</p><p>She walked into a study on the second floor to find that there were two tables set up\u2014and Villiers was seated at one of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat a pleasure,\u201d he murmured, as she sat down beside him. He looked at Strange and the corner of his mouth quirked into a smile. \u201cSometimes you actually show signs of common sense, Strange.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked around. The room was hung with dark silk. Four or five men stood next to the fire. The room held no furniture other than two small square tables and a number of comfortable chairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be invited to join Strange\u2019s Game,\u201d Villiers said to her. \u201cWe all refer to it with a capital G, in case you\u2019re wondering. And it\u2019s a point of honor to mention the Game to no one except a man who has participated, so I had to leave you in the dark.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where does the honor come in?\u201d Harriet saw that the most interesting of the Cambridge professors was there, and the man who played the lead at the Hyde Park Theater. He had told her the other night that he hated Hamlet, and then explained all its stupidities so that Harriet felt she would never enjoy it again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s famous. Some nights there are four people, and sometimes eight. No one dares complain if they are excluded for a night\u2014or forever. But I\u2019ve known people to stay at Fonthill for weeks, longing for just one shot at the Game.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked around again. Povy was handing out small glasses of ruby-colored liquor. There was a happy buzz in the room. \u201cDo we play for money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHigh stakes,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cVery. Does that bother you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin always said it was paltry to play for money rather than for love of the game.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCards,\u201d Villiers observed, \u201care different from chess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of game is primero?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a game of power. Of bluffing and lying.\u201d He said nothing more. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he murmured a moment later. \u201cIt seems that your arrival has occasioned some interest.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to find a wolfish man staring at her. \u201cYoung Cope, is it?\u201d he barked.</p><p>She rose and bowed. \u201cIndeed, sir, you have the advantage of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Skipwith.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Skipwith,\u201d came Villiers\u2019s measured tone, \u201cis the senior man in Parliament on the question of the Irish Resolutions. You do well to meet him, lad.\u201d</p><p>Harriet bowed again. Skipwith eyed her from head to foot, seeming to pause, narrow-eyed, when it came to her legs. Harriet held her breath.</p><p>But Skipwith turned away with a snort, and Harriet sat back down.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s decided you\u2019re a molly,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cWhat does that mean? I keep hearing the term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man who prefers to sleep with other men, rather than women. They are sometimes effeminate in their presentation. Skipwith is quite conservative in his thinking.\u201d</p><p>Harriet uncrossed her legs and stretched them out in front of her in a careless, manly fashion.</p><p>Villiers eyed her. \u201cYou might wish to belch,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to be enjoying yourself,\u201d Harriet retorted.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the funny thing about coming near death,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI am finding life to be a great deal more tolerable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to Fonthill to join the Game, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Harriet said. It had puzzled her why Villiers had decided to come to Strange\u2019s house party. He seemed to have no interest in the various women being offered, nor had he showed any interest in scientific experiment or dramatic productions, the two forms of entertainment.</p><p>\u201cOne cannot live by chess alone. Ah, there you are, Strange. And Lord Castlemaine. How splendid that you join us. Do you know Mr. Cope?\u201d</p><p>Harriet stood up and made a leg to Castlemaine. He was a youngish man with a close-clipped beard and a pair of spectacles.</p><p>\u201cCastlemaine is one of the top men at the Exchange,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cThe Financial Exchange?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>Castlemaine had a slow, toothy grin. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you are up to your neck in this business between the king and the pursers,\u201d Jem said, dropping into a seat.</p><p>Castlemaine pursed his lips. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there will be certain charges made to the crown that His Majesty will not be happy with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case, His Majesty must provide the victuals.\u201d</p><p>Castlemaine glanced at Jem. \u201cIs that your word on the subject, Lord Strange?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Jem said, rapidly passing out cards. \u201cNow, Cope, in the game of primero each man has two cards. You may look at yours.\u201d</p><p>Harriet looked. She had two queens, which struck her as a very nice hand.</p><p>\u201cWe shall go about the table. Your choice is to pass, in which case you must discard and draw. Stake, by putting some money down, or bid,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI, for instance, will bid one hundred pounds with a forty-seven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has forty-seven?\u201d Harriet asked, confused.</p> <p>\u201cNo one,\u201d Jem put in. \u201cVilliers wants you to think that he has it.\u201d</p><p>It took a few minutes to catch the rhythm of the game, but quickly thereafter Harriet realized that the bets were much larger than she had realized. For example, Castlemaine staked, and unless she was mistaken, what he put down was the right to provision the pursers. For all England.</p><p>Villiers raised an eyebrow, but passed.</p><p>Jem bid a huge amount of money against the contract and it was Harriet\u2019s turn again. She looked at her hand. She was starting to know Jem\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t have all those points he was pretending to have. So she could win. But\u2014but provisioning the pursers? She knew nothing of pursers. On the other hand, it was clearly a lucrative contract. And perhaps they would play again.</p><p>She won.</p> <p>\u201cYou throw your heart into the game in a reckless fashion, Cope,\u201d said Castlemaine, looking slightly displeased.</p><p>Villiers leaned forward. \u201cCope is young but not foolhardy, Castlemaine, and there is play to go this evening. Perhaps more importantly, his estate could certainly manage the pursers, many times over. He is my relative.\u201d</p><p>And so it continued, with laughter and the occasional bawdy insult. From what Harriet could hear of the other table, the play\u2014and the bets\u2014were the same. Large. Powerful.</p><p>They took a break between hands and she leaned toward Jem. \u201cThis Game...\u201d</p><p>\u201cCentrally important to the governing of England,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so much more interesting than hanging about in Parliament and getting hoarse shouting at each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what if someone wins who\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take that provisions contract off you next round. Castlemaine knows I mean to have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that legal?\u201d Harriet asked.</p><p>Jem looked surprised. \u201cWhy in the bloody hell wouldn\u2019t it be? Of course it is.\u201d</p><p>Another hand. Harriet was starting to enjoy herself. All the hours she\u2019d spent in Judge Truder\u2019s court, reading the eyes of men who were accused of crimes\u2014and the eyes of those doing the accusing\u2014were coming in very handy. She knew when Jem was lying. Within two hands, she knew Castlemaine well enough to guess whether he had a good hand, and though Villiers was tricky, she managed to beat him as well.</p><p>But now Villiers was looking tired. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to call it a night, gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>The provisions contract was still in Harriet\u2019s hands, and she\u2019d won four hundred pounds from Castlemaine as well. \u201cDoes the money actually come from you?\u201d she asked frankly.</p><p>\u201cDiscretionary funds from the Crown,\u201d Castlemaine said. \u201cThe king would love to attend the Game himself, but that wouldn\u2019t be effective. I\u2019ll post back immediately tomorrow morning and tell him the outcome. I admit that he\u2019ll likely be surprised to hear that such a young gentleman has taken over the provisions contract, but given what I\u2019ve seen of your play, I have no doubt but that it\u2019s in good hands.\u201d</p><p>Harriet thought with a little shudder about the king\u2019s reaction to hearing that the Duchess of Berrow now owned the contract. \u201cPray do not write him yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the king stage his own Game?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cDifficult to beat a king resoundingly,\u201d Jem said. \u201cEspecially an irascible one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never knew there was a Game like this,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always a Game, behind every government,\u201d Jem said. \u201cSometimes it happens in the king\u2019s own bedchamber, and sometimes in an anteroom. And sometimes at Fonthill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOften at Fonthill, it seems,\u201d Harriet remarked.</p><p>He bowed, and went to speak to his other guests.</p><p>So she left.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Leaving the Audience Forever</p><p>H arriet couldn\u2019t sleep. Even though she didn\u2019t care to admit it to herself, she had thought Jem would come to her bed. She was leaving the next morning...Didn\u2019t he want to make love again?</p><p>And yet how could she call it making love?</p><p>She finally got herself to sleep by making a list of all the wonderful things she would do with Eugenia during her visit, from finding kittens (there were always kittens in the barn), to having tea with the Froibles\u2019s little girls, to playing dress-up with all those Elizabethan gowns in the attic.</p><p>Harriet was having a wonderful dream, one of the best of her life. She was on her back, boneless, and Jem was kissing every inch of her. His mouth was open and his tongue was caressing her, soothing her until she craved more, until she was murmuring with\u2014</p><p>Until she woke up.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d she gasped. Her nightgown was up to her armpits. He was sprawled out next to her, stark naked. \u201cHow did you get into my room?\u201d</p><p>He stopped kissing her ribs just long enough to say, \u201cI walked in.\u201d</p><p>It was such a laconic, Jem-like thing to say that her heart thumped. His fingers were trailing up her ankle.</p><p>\u201cAnd now,\u201d Harriet said, with a little squeak\u2014</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk. I need to talk to you about Eugenia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. We need to make love.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away his fingers and sat up. \u201cIt\u2019s very kind of you, Jem, but I think I would feel more comfortable if you listened to what I said.\u201d</p><p>He groaned and his fingers fell from her thighs.</p><p>\u201cEugenia needs the companionship of other little girls,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He pulled a pillow over his head.</p><p>\u201cI know you loathe the idea,\u201d she said sympathetically. \u201cBut you needn\u2019t send her away to school. If you would send her with me for visits now and then, I would invite children to my house. There are very nice girls just down the lane.\u201d</p><p>He said something but it was muffled by the pillow. Years of marriage had taught Harriet a great deal about men, however, and she kept talking. If he really had something to say, he would remove the pillow.</p><p>\u201cEugenia thinks you have her locked in her rooms, as if she were some sort of prisoner. One of the maids told her the house was full of monsters.\u201d</p><p>The pillow flew to the ground. His eyes were blank. But she couldn\u2019t shelter him; she couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cApparently she was frightened by the monsters, but now she says she\u2019s more frightened by rats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it!\u201d Jem growled, throwing himself off the bed. He walked across the room to the hearth, bent over, and picked up a log.</p><p>Harriet watched the lean powerful line of his body. \u201cShe could visit me,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are often kittens in the barn. The family down the road has three little girls. I\u2019ll invite them over for tea. She can learn to ride a pony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tea party? I could\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harsh things needed to be said, Harriet felt. It was like lancing a wound. \u201cProper little girls couldn\u2019t come to Fonthill,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cLet her visit me, Jem.\u201d</p><p>He slammed his palms down on the mantelpiece. \u201cI\u2019ve bungled it all, haven\u2019t I? I should have sent her away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you might have done that,\u201d Harriet said cautiously.</p><p>\u201cSally died the night she was born. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t believe it for months. Sally was so young\u2014and I\u2019d never even thought about death. It never occurred to me, fool that I was!\u201d His voice was savage.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you had thought about it, what could you have done?\u201d</p><p>He swung around, eyes burning. \u201cDon\u2019t you know? You\u2019re a widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve never found there was any way to prepare for death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could have said goodbye,\u201d he said, his lips a thin line. \u201cI would have said goodbye. I would have told her that I loved her. I would have\u2014\u201d he broke off.</p><p>A tear rolled down Harriet\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019m sure she knew you loved her. She knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it. I never told her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be told those things,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cPeople rarely talk of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father arranged the marriage,\u201d Jem said, his mouth twisting. \u201cI was too much of a hellion, he said. A danger to all of England.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Harriet asked, jumping at the chance to lighten his tone. \u201cAll of England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe facts of the matter are rather ironic, under the present circumstances,\u201d he said, smiling faintly. \u201cMy father didn\u2019t mind when I was raising Cain at Oxford. He wouldn\u2019t have cared how many demi-reps I bedded. He told me repeatedly, since I was five years old, that a bordello is man\u2019s version of paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy personal rebellion,\u201d Jem said broodingly, \u201cis that I have never paid a woman for her attentions. And I never will.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swallowed. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s good,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cAs a youngster, I managed to find plenty of women who were happy to do the deed for free, thus following the family tradition while engaging in a little mutiny at the same time. It was only when my father thought I was pursuing men that he got the wind up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen!\u201d Harriet exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cMen.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s not in me. But one of my closest friends from Oxford was of a different sort. He was a true friend. Not my lover, but my father couldn\u2019t be bothered to see the difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he alive anymore?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cKilled. No goodbye there either. At any rate, my father thought I was learning to share his proclivities, so he married me off to Sally.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was she like?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFunny,\u201d Jem said. \u201cI resented her, of course. She was tall and slim, and I fancied my father had picked her because she looked like a boy. But she was a woman, all through. She could pull witticisms out of the air.\u201d</p><p>Jealousy sometimes masqueraded as hatred. Sometimes it was just hatred, though. Harriet thought she probably hated tall, slim Sally.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been eight years since she died,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had very little time together. But we had amusing times while she was alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Harriet said flatly. And then she added: \u201cI can see why you wished you had said goodbye. I\u2019m sorry that wasn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you say goodbye to your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas it quite sudden?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cThey came and told me Sally was dead,\u201d Jem said, dropping into a chair. \u201cAnd then they brought me Eugenia. She was ugly, of course. She had an odd head because Sally had labored so long. I thought she looked like some sort of monkey. But she looked at me with her squinty little eyes, and I could see Sally there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s so sweet,\u201d Harriet said, feeling a lump in her throat.</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see Eugenia herself. All I saw was that Sally had left a scrap of herself behind, and that I had to treasure it. So I bought this house and had the west wing secured to keep her safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why on earth would you have to worry so much?\u201d Harriet asked. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the richest man in England,\u201d Jem stated. \u201cMy father had a fair amount, as well. And my sister\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to your sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA man kidnapped her and forced her into a false marriage. My father had him tracked down and killed, of course. Just like that, my sister became a widow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe must have been so distressed by the whole event!\u201d Harriet cried.</p><p>\u201cShe was distressed long before,\u201d Jem said. But his tone didn\u2019t invite any more questions.</p><p>\u201cThere has to be some way that Eugenia can have more of a childhood,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cIf she visited me, no one would suspect who she was; she would be perfectly safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cAll this talk of visiting...you haven\u2019t left yet, Harriet. You\u2019re in my house...\u201d She loved that look in his eye. \u201cIn my bed...\u201d</p><p>His hand slid under her and wrapped around her bare bottom; she started to say something but his mouth was on her breast. This was no whispery little caress. His mouth was warm and wet. A tremor went through her body. He sucked harder and whatever Harriet was going to say died on her lips.</p><p>He was shaping her buttocks in his hand, pulling her up and toward the pull of his mouth. He made his way down her body with tiny bites, and every touch of his mouth made her shake.</p><p>He reared up and she opened her eyes again. There was a wicked spark in his eyes, something that spoke of lust, pure lust.</p><p>\u201cI want you. Now.\u201d He ran his thumb over her nipple. \u201cDo you understand, Harriet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He rubbed a little harder. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to want to make love to you in the morning as well.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to say something, but he ran his thumb down between her legs and she started gasping instead.</p><p>Eyes still on hers, he put a hand on her breast. \u201cYou\u2019re part of this, Harriet. You\u2019re not just the audience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, hearing the desire in her own voice. Then she woke up to what he was saying. \u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d She looked rather wildly at his body. Would he like to be kissed?</p><p>He grinned, and the sparks were wild in his eyes. \u201cFor now, lie back and tell me exactly what you feel.\u201d</p><p>It took her a while. Harriet had not been raised to tell men what to do. Yet perhaps the fact that she\u2019d practiced that particular skill in a court of law lay behind her success: by twenty minutes later, she was very comfortable with the practice indeed. \u201cYes,\u201d she found herself saying. \u201cNo, not there\u2014there!\u201d And finally she couldn\u2019t form words anymore, but by then Jem had turned her body into a musical instrument. He knew her strings and chords and melodies...</p><p>He knew her song and he loved it. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They took a bath (Harriet made Jem go into the wardrobe and stay there until the footman came and went). The bath was...interesting.</p><p>They sopped up the water with a sheet and found their way back to bed, crawled, exhausted, into the bed.</p><p>Harriet woke to find Jem\u2019s large warm body curled around hers. I\u2019m not just the audience, Harriet told herself.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t a concept she\u2019d ever imagined. She was the audience in most of her life: Benjamin\u2019s audience for chess, the court\u2019s audience for arguments.</p> <p>Not an audience was a fascinating concept.</p><p>She ran her fingers over his muscled chest, through his chest hair, circled his nipple. Jem made a sound in his sleep and rolled onto his back.</p><p>A penis, Harriet decided, was an odd thing. Though she loved her breeches, she was just as glad not to have one of those. She slid her hand down his stomach and then touched him. It.</p><p>It was smooth and hard, like a piece of marble. It raised questions in her mind. What would it taste like? What would it feel like in her mouth? What would\u2014what did it feel like to Jem?</p><p>He was sleeping so peacefully, long lashes resting on his cheek as his chest rose up and down. But the fact was that he kept kissing her in private places. An involuntary shudder ran through her body. Surely he would like it if she did so to him.</p> <p>She had dared to touch him in the bath, a soapy hand running up and down his shaft. He had thrown his head back and groaned, as if he were in pain. But then he stopped her.</p><p>It had been stark desire in his face, the same sort of tearing, itching lust that made her cry out when he was kissing her, arching her hips, begging him to come to her.</p><p>Yes, she had the idea that he might truly like it if she kissed him.</p><p>So she did.</p><p>He was warmer than marble, and he tasted like soap. Lemon soap, because it had been her bath.</p><p>She started experimenting, and forgot he was part of the picture until all of a sudden a male body erupted from the sheet and flipped her over.</p> <p>For a moment Harriet relaxed, her body welcoming his touch, the fierce look in his eyes, the way his body\u2014</p><p>But: \u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Jem froze. Gulped, like a little boy caught with a stolen cake. Harriet started grinning and wiggled her body backwards. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d His voice sounded rusty. Not smooth and sensual, but desperate. She started laughing, slid out from under him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the audience,\u201d she told him, leaning over, loving his chest and his arms, and the way his muscles defined his stomach. \u201cRight now, you are an audience.\u201d</p><p>Then she pushed him down and began deliberately, slowly, powerfully taking over the game. Making it her own. His body...hers. Owned by knowledge of its every crook and corner.</p><p>She turned his body into a musical instrument and finally held him helpless, groaning, begging, his hands clutched in her hair.</p><p>\u201cI never lose control,\u201d he said, warning her, reassuring himself, something like that. His teeth were obviously clenched. \u201cHarriet...\u201d</p> <p>She ignored him, slid over his body.</p><p>And took his control. Threw it away with her kisses, caresses, slow wet love...</p><p>No audience, she.</p><p>After, he lay there silent.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been so right,\u201d he said, a moment later. He sounded awestruck. She let herself laugh, then tucked herself against his side.</p><p>When he rolled over this time, it was in a tangle of limbs that included a silent request, her affirmation, their utterly silent agreement...</p><p>Then he was pounding into her and it was as if she felt both him, almost too large, pulsing with life, and herself, soft velvet, wet. She felt his body as much as hers.</p><p>He lowered his head and they kissed. He never missed a beat; her body rose to meet his.</p><p>It\u2019s as if we\u2019re not two people anymore, Harriet thought blearily. But those delicious heat waves were starting to spread, to grow from her toes, to rock through her body and everything slid away from her but the feeling of his strong body in her arms, the wildness of his tongue, the power of his body.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Marriage Proposals are So Romantic...Sometimes</p><p>February 9, 1784</p><p>\u201cI have to pack,\u201d Harriet said the next morning, very early. \u201cAnd you have to leave this room. Any moment Lucille will enter to help me dress and she\u2019ll likely shriek the house down if she sees you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving,\u201d Jem stated.</p><p>Harriet had seen that look on a man\u2019s face before. It was the look Benjamin had when he had just started a game of chess and she wanted to leave a party and go home. It was the look her father used to get when her mother would demand that he wear jeweled heels.</p><p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Jem added, \u201cyou\u2019re not going anywhere either. I\u2019ll send the Duchess of Cosway home with six outriders to protect her, if you wish. I\u2019ll send the entire household with her.\u201d He rolled over and put a finger on her nose. \u201cYou, Miss Harry, are staying with me.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was conscious of a feeling of giddy joy. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here forever,\u201d she managed. \u201cThere are things I have to do at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour country squire is gone. My wife is gone. Neither one of us has any reason to be anywhere other than in this bed. You don\u2019t have children, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarriet, do you really think that you\u2019re simply going to leave and go back to your little estate, wherever it is?\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cOf course I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cI appreciate the moments in bed when you forcefully state your opinion, Jem, but this is different. I am not going to stay with you. I shall return to my own estate, and I would be very happy to bring Eugenia with me for a prolonged visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d she said, biting her lip. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for her being in that room by herself all the time. Did you see the game she\u2019s playing right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought some of the rats were very well fashioned,\u201d he said. \u201cI do feel guilty because she wasn\u2019t adequately bathed before bed. We\u2019ve had the rat-catcher into the house. He hasn\u2019t found any evidence of a rat infestation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would an infestation mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat this house held a whole village of them. He thinks the rat that bit Eugenia came in to escape the cold and was frightened. But she\u2019ll have one of the terrier puppies from the village to stay with her, just as soon as it\u2019s old enough to leave its mother. And no rat will never enter her room with a terrier there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think my house has rats\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think mine did either!\u201d he said, his voice raising.</p><p>\u201cBut I know there are little girls living next to me,\u201d she said, pleading. \u201cPlease let her pay a visit, Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. She\u2019s not paying a visit because you aren\u2019t leaving.\u201d</p><p>Harriet was starting to feel a little exasperated. \u201cYou need to listen to me, Jem. You have just as much trouble being an audience as I do, it seems.\u201d She swung her legs out of bed. \u201cI wonder where Lucille is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here within the half hour, and your reputation will be ruined forever.\u201d There was a liquid note of satisfaction in his voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNot mine,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cMr. Cope\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, then, my reputation will be ruined forever,\u201d Jem pointed out, \u201csince you are Mr. Cope.

I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you loved her so much?\u201d Harriet hoped her tone wasn\u2019t surly. She didn\u2019t feel surly...much.</p><p>\u201cNo. I loved her, but loving a dead woman wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop a man from sleeping with a lively courtesan.\u201d</p><p>This struck Harriet as male logic. \u201cIf you\u2019re not leaving,\u201d she said flatly, \u201cI am. Do not follow me; Isidore is certainly still unclothed.\u201d</p> <p>And she walked straight through the connecting door.</p><p>When he thumped on the door, she took the precaution of locking it.</p><p>Isidore stuck her head up from the covers. Her hair was tumbling around her shoulders. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d she asked fuzzily. Then her eyes widened. \u201cIs there a rat in your room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cHarriet, open this door,\u201d Jem bellowed.</p><p>Isidore fell backwards. \u201cOh, Harriet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou are going to marry me,\u201d Jem bellowed. \u201cAnd you know it!\u201d</p><p>Harriet choked. \u201cI am not going to marry you. But thank you for the proposal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Strange just asked you to marry him,\u201d Isidore said in a faintly awed tone. \u201cHarriet!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I said no,\u201d Harriet\u2019s heart was beating fast. It was the first time a man had asked her to marry him of his own volition. Benjamin\u2019s proposal came about through an arrangement between their fathers.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d Isidore hissed. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be mercenary, but in case you\u2019ve forgotten, he\u2019s terribly rich. And charming.\u201d</p><p>The door shook as a fist pounded into it again. Jem bellowed: \u201cHarriet, open this door or I\u2019ll break it down.\u201d</p><p>Isidore gave a little shriek. \u201cOpen it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see if he can really break it down,\u201d Harriet responded.</p> <p>The entire door frame shook and there was the groan of splitting wood.</p><p>\u201cHe can,\u201d Isidore said happily. She was sitting up in bed now. \u201cThis is so exciting. And romantic! I wish my husband would break down the door to fetch me.\u201d</p><p>The door shuddered under the next blow. \u201cI listened to everything you said!\u201d Jem shouted. \u201cYou have little girls next door, and kittens in the barn, and what you\u2019re really saying is that you love Eugenia.\u201d</p><p>Harriet unlocked the door and swung it open.</p><p>He was standing there, hair on end, eyes fierce. \u201cYou\u2019ll marry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss that later. If you stay, I\u2019ll let you take Eugenia for a visit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here forever, in breeches. This won\u2019t work for me, Jem. I\u2019m not who you think I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know exactly who you are,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cYou\u2019re the wife of a country squire, who died in some sort of accident.\u201d</p><p>Isidore made a sharp little movement but said nothing.</p><p>\u201cMy husband didn\u2019t die in an accident!\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to tell him the truth, either. Benjamin\u2019s death was still her secret.</p><p>\u201cCall it what you wish,\u201d Jem said. \u201cHe died in his own bed, then.\u201d</p><p>It was more or less true, so she nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou came here on a lark, and now you want to fly back to your tidy little nest. But I\u2019m not going to let you. I\u2019ve never asked a woman to marry me, ever. Do you realize that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t ask me,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cYou issued an ultimatum. And while I am gratified to think you are having new experiences, I don\u2019t mean to marry you.\u201d</p><p>Jem, being Jem, instantly switched tactics. \u201cThe real point at issue now is whether you want Eugenia to pay you a visit, or whether you can reconcile it with your conscience to leave her here, locked up in the west wing like a cracked, aging relative, vulnerable to rats and Lord knows what else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t use Eugenia as blackmail,\u201d Harriet said, frowning at him. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s my wild card,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re in a fair way to loving her, Harriet, which is a good thing because when we marry, you\u2019ll be her mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t said I\u2019d marry you!\u201d Harriet said with some exasperation. \u201cYou just won\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her. You\u2019d think his kiss would have been as aggressive as his talk, not to mention the way he practically beat down the door.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t. It was so sweet it melted her heart. His lips were hot on hers, silent, delicate. But she was no fool. It was a diplomatic parley, his kiss. It was a shot over her bow from a pirate ship, a notice that she wasn\u2019t going to leave his territory without a fight.</p><p>And God help her, her arms went around his neck. He rewarded her by tightening his arms around her. She opened her lips to him like a starving woman, and what he brought her\u2014what he brought her made her heart bloom, made the current in her blood turn to sparks, hot and burning.</p><p>\u201cWill you stay?\u201d he asked her a bit later, his voice quiet and steady. \u201cPlease stay, Harriet. I know I\u2019m not very good at listening, but I\u2019m learning to be your audience. I remember everything you\u2019ve said to me. Please.\u201d</p><p>Harriet heard Isidore sigh, behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you, Harriet,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Harriet managed.</p><p>His long fingers cupped her cheek. \u201cI can\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you keep me locked in the west wing?\u201d She didn\u2019t know where that came from, but it made sense.</p><p>He froze for a moment, that long graceful body still. \u201cI suppose you are giving me a lesson, Harriet mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Lucille!\u201d came a sprightly voice from the bed behind them. \u201cJust ignore these two.\u201d</p><p>Harriet turned, but Jem pulled her back against him. \u201cYou see, Lucille,\u201d he said, bending to kiss Harriet\u2019s neck, \u201cI have discovered your mistress\u2019s secret and I must say, it makes me very happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to stay a few more days, Lucille,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay as well,\u201d Isidore said promptly.</p><p>Lucille looked bewildered. She was carrying a stack of perfectly folded stockings, ready to be packed in Harriet\u2019s trunk.</p><p>\u201cI can send you home with outriders, Isidore,\u201d Jem said. \u201cYou\u2019ll be perfectly safe. I could find a good woman from the village to accompany you.\u201d</p><p>But Isidore was giggling. \u201cNo. It\u2019s like watching one of my favorite plays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut Your G\u2014\u201d Lucille began and then stopped, catching Harriet\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cI plan to stay in my male clothing, of course,\u201d Harriet said calmly, as if Lucille had said nothing. \u201cWe shall continue our visit for a brief period of time.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jem laughed. \u201cThere goes my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is act in a normal fashion,\u201d Harriet said, twisting around to look at him.</p><p>\u201cHow much you have to learn, love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall enjoy watching it,\u201d Isidore said, with a honey-like satisfaction in her voice. \u201cI have a feeling that Lord Strange\u2019s reputation is about to dive to a new level of disreputableness, and I shall be here to see it!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Harriet said briskly. \u201cI shall stay away from Jem when in public, and all he has to do is keep to his normal impolite habit of ignoring his guests.

Harriet saw all sorts of questions trembling on her lips, some stopped by Jem\u2019s presence, others by the barriers between maids and duchesses.</p><p>\u201cBe off,\u201d she said to Jem, giving him a little push toward the door.</p><p>\u201cLook at Harriet\u2019s lashes,\u201d Jem said, draping himself in the door.</p><p>Isidore and Lucille looked in the general direction of her face.</p> <p>\u201cLushly feminine,\u201d he said, his voice deepening. \u201cI knew she was a woman the moment I saw her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou certainly did not!\u201d Harriet exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cNo man\u2019s lip has such an erotic curve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen did you discover Harriet\u2019s sex?\u201d Isidore asked curiously. \u201cDid you really know from the beginning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers told me,\u201d Jem said. \u201cThough I guessed before he confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll thank you to take yourself out the door before you ruin Isidore\u2019s reputation,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cYou might find yourself in a duel. Remember, Isidore has a husband to protect her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn a matter of speaking,\u201d Isidore murmured. \u201cI feel as if I\u2019m learning so much about men and women just from watching the two of you. I may shock my husband if he ever arrives.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis arrival is a given,\u201d Harriet pointed out. \u201cStill, I would prefer that the household doesn\u2019t find Lord Strange standing in your doorway, and you in bed. Your husband will arrive only to divorce you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOut!\u201d she said, pointing to the door.</p><p>And this time, Jem obeyed, only sticking his head back in to say, \u201cFencing at eleven.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Sources of Inspiration</p><p>February 10, 1784</p><p>\u201cI t\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d Isidore said, the next morning. \u201cI would have thought to receive at least an answer from my husband\u2019s solicitor by now. I first wrote everyone with my plans months ago. My mother-in-law should have been able to work her magic by now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYour husband is a dunce,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAre you coming to breakfast?\u201d</p><p>Isidore was lying on her bed, deliciously gowned in a French neglig\u00e9e, reading a book. \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019ve just started Tacitus\u2019s war manuals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is Tacitus?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas,\u201d Isidore corrected her. \u201cA Greek tactician. If I ever need to lead an army into battle, I am entirely prepared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will keep that in mind,\u201d Harriet promised, and left Isidore happily sipping hot chocolate and wiggling her toes.</p><p>Nell was waiting for her outside the breakfast room. Harriet slowed when she saw her, but Nell took her arm and pulled her to the side. \u201cI just want you to know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat I don\u2019t blame you for it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d Harriet asked, confused.</p><p>\u201cFor taking him away from me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was as if my eyes opened up night before last, because after you left the table, he went all drab and silent. And I knew that he had been witty for you, but he couldn\u2019t be bothered for me.\u201d Harriet felt a terrible pang of guilt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just want to know one thing,\u201d Nell said.</p><p>Harriet blinked at her.</p><p>\u201cDid you laugh at me? Were the two of you making up that poetry and laughing at me all the time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d Harriet cried. \u201cAbsolutely not. I wrote the poetry for you because I thought...\u201d Her voice trailed off.</p><p>\u201cYou thought he was interested in women,\u201d Nell said. \u201cI did too, obviously. You know, in a way that makes it easier? I really thought he fancied me. I just want to say that if it had to be someone else, I\u2019m just as glad it\u2019s you. Because it\u2019s not another woman.\u201d Her eyes flashed. \u201cI\u2019d have to kill you if you were a woman, Harry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Harriet said faintly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about it...this is why no one ever hears of Strange actually being with a woman.\u201d</p><p>Harriet gulped.</p><p>\u201cI should have known. I mean, I work in the theater. But I was just blinded by the way he is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Harriet said, feeling a surge of sympathy.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re giving our final performance tonight, and we\u2019ll be off to London,\u201d Nell said. \u201cAnd do you know, I was talking to Miss Linnet last night. She was the lead at Drury Lane last year, and she had a very nice understanding with a prince. I think a prince would suit me just fine. Don\u2019t you think so, Harry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Harriet said, nodding. \u201cA prince would love you, Nell.\u201d</p><p>After breakfast, Jem crooked a finger, and they ended up in the gallery, fencing. Except the fencing turned into something else. They went to visit Eugenia, and on the way back, Jem suddenly whirled her into a spare bedchamber.</p><p>That night at the Game she won the patent to a curious calculating machine that cast sums. It was very pretty, but not useful, to Harriet\u2019s mind. So later she allowed Jem, who thought he could make improvements to it, to win it from her at another kind of game they played at night.</p><p>\u201cI want to know exactly when you guessed I was a woman,\u201d she said, sometime near midnight.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want it to be a secret? I could tell you on your fiftieth birthday. As a surprise.\u201d</p><p>She snorted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no,\u201d Jem said. \u201cThis is a bit embarrassing. I didn\u2019t know from the very beginning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, it was utterly demoralizing, the way I kept looking at you and\u2014well\u2014desiring you, and there you were, a man.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to think I\u2019m a fool.\u201d</p><p>She just turned her head and looked at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I am a fool,\u201d he said with a groan.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take that as a given and move on,\u201d she suggested, smiling at him.</p><p>He started kissing her and they both forgot the subject of conversation.</p><p>\u201cI was idiotically slow in discovering your secret,\u201d he said, some time later.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take that as a given as well,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cJust when did it first occur to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe moment I accused you of kissing the stableboy. You were so horrified\u2014and yet you had kissed him.\u201d</p><p>Harriet snorted. \u201cDegenerate beast that you are. I remember you suddenly got very cheerful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was. Do you know, I was actually starting to contemplate the unthinkable?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cFor me?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about you that\u2019s just\u2014mine,\u201d he said. \u201cMale, female...I\u2019m not so sure it would really have mattered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m a female. So what exactly did you and Villiers say to each other in Latin?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cI can hardly remember. I thought up the test. Obviously, if you didn\u2019t know Latin, you were a woman. And you didn\u2019t. But then Villiers took the opportunity to tell me that if I allowed Kitty anywhere near you in a state of undress he\u2019d take off my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love Villiers,\u201d Harriet said with satisfaction.</p> <p>\u201cNow love me,\u201d Jem said, rolling over.</p><p>Days passed like strings on a pearl necklace: luscious, erotic, sweetly spaced, beautiful.</p><p>Harriet understood the Strange household now. Its secret revolved around the Game. No wonder Jem rarely came downstairs to meet new guests. It was the Game that mattered, and half the new guests were merely there to provide entertainment for the players.</p><p>And now Harriet knew why the Graces stayed so long at Jem\u2019s house, though Jem himself showed no interest in their talents. And how sundry other young ladies came by their jewels and the smiles in their eyes.</p><p>Sometimes the Game continued until two or three in the morning. One night Lord Sandwich started a conversation about how to raise three hundred thousand pounds for the use of the Home Secretary. Villiers suggested a poll tax. Jem shook his head. Harriet suggested a wine tax.</p> <p>\u201cAnd why is that, young man?\u201d Sandwich said.</p><p>\u201cWine is a luxury,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cAlcohol is the primary cause of most criminal incidents adjudicated in the family courts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who you are,\u201d Sandwich grumbled.</p><p>\u201cYou must study your Debrett\u2019s more closely,\u201d Villiers said, with a cutting edge to his voice. \u201cI have very few relatives, Sandwich. I can\u2019t afford to have any ignored.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s scurvy few relatives you have on the right side of the blanket,\u201d Sandwich said.</p><p>\u201cYoung Cope is one of them,\u201d Villiers said, unruffled. \u201cA wine tax is a fine idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d a man said, who turned out to be the Lord of the Privy Seal.</p><p>But conversation evolved around Sandwich\u2019s love of fine claret, and in the end the idea of the wine tax carried. It was a heady sensation. She, Harriet, had influenced the policy of England.</p><p>Jem began coming to dinner every night. And luncheon, many days. Some nights he sat beside her, and others he sat at the head of the table and flirted with Isidore.</p><p>The heady pleasures of being male\u2014of being able to ride freely, fence, and argue\u2014grew more and more dear to Harriet. She found every conversation interesting. One night she got into an argument with one of the scientists about the recent discovery of a new planet called Uranus. Mr. Peddle argued that the head of the Royal Society shouldn\u2019t have given Herschel, the man who discovered the planet, a Copley medal.</p><p>\u201cWhat did he really do? The man spends his time stargazing, that\u2019s all. And now he\u2019s elected a fellow of the Royal Society! For nothing. You know, Sir Giles, down there\u2014\u201d He nodded down the table at bespeckled professor. \u201c\u2014Sir Giles identified the genus of the Purple Swamphen. Now that\u2019s a good reason to become a Fellow. This man just looks at the sky and notices a star. Bah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we need to map the night sky,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWe have to understand our world. And stars are no different than wings on a butterfly, to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI disagree,\u201d Peddle said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll understand how very different it is to spend a lifetime doing exacting scientific analysis, versus sitting outside of an evening with a glass of wine and waiting for a star to catch your attention!\u201d</p><p>Jem elbowed her. \u201cTurned down as a Fellow of the Society,\u201d he murmured into her ear. \u201cMigratory habits of the grasshopper not considered an adequate topic. The study took him seven years.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStrange was admitted to the Royal Society by right of his experiments on frog\u2019s legs,\u201d Peddle said. \u201cNo one can dispute that.\u201d</p><p>Harriet raised an eyebrow at Jem. \u201cIndeed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChanging all sorts of things to do with electricity,\u201d Peddle said, rather vaguely. \u201cFrog\u2019s legs and metals; you must have read about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was five years ago,\u201d Jem said. \u201cFrogs are well in the past.\u201d He had that secret smile in his eyes. He was proud, but he was pretending it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>Harriet turned to Mr. Peddle and asked him about how grasshoppers make music.</p><p>Later that night Harriet enquired about frog\u2019s legs, but Jem wasn\u2019t interested in them any longer. \u201cThey twitch,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was all rather fascinating, but then I wrote up everything I knew. It pointed toward mathematics, so I followed my nose and I never ended up back with frogs.\u201d</p><p>Harriet shook her head. \u201cAren\u2019t you proud of being made a member of the Royal Society?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cProud...I\u2019m proud of this.\u201d And he got out of bed, buck naked. It turned out that what he was proudest of was a bridge. \u201cFive arch ribs,\u201d Jem said. \u201cOver one hundred feet across the river.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful!\u201d Harriet said, tracing the drawing with her finger.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have done it without Darby\u2019s cast iron. See, each one is cast in two halves?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She was beginning to understand how the combination of Jem\u2019s wildly powerful mind and his inventiveness were changing the world. Literally changing the world.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you most proud of?\u201d he asked her later.</p><p>There were no bridges to mention so she said, \u201cIn the town where we live, the judge is a drunkard. So sometimes, if he was incapable, my husband would sit in the court.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that legal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s always been done that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAristocrats,\u201d Jem said, amused. \u201cSo the country squire would stride in and save the day, would he?\u201d</p><p>Should she tell him? She should...she should...I am a duchess. How hard was that to say aloud? Very hard. The words made her afraid. She couldn\u2019t help thinking of Jemma\u2019s words\u2014that no one makes love to a duchess without thinking of the rank. The title changed everything.</p><p>\u201cI can see Villiers doing that,\u201d Jem said, idly tracing a pattern on her shoulder with one fingertip. \u201cWhat happened after your husband died? Did the next squire take over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did.\u201d</p><p>He sat up and his mouth fell open in a very satisfactory manner. But then he snapped it shut and said, \u201cOf course you did. Of course you did!\u201d</p><p>They ended up talking about Loveday Billing and women like her, women whose lives could be changed, perhaps, by a sympathetic voice and two pounds. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a very small amount of money can do,\u201d Harriet found herself saying. She told him things she\u2019d never told anyone, about her view of the world and its injustices.</p><p>But he liked stories of Sibble best, Berrow\u2019s most creative criminal. \u201cHe plagues the town,\u201d Harriet said heart-feltedly. \u201cNo one is safe. It\u2019s all a game to him.\u201d</p><p>Jem laughed and laughed.</p><p>One night Jem rose from dinner and announced that the men would retire to take port together. The ladies left for the sitting room with looks of discontent. The men sat around the flickering candlelight for hours, arguing about slavery, tax relief, advances in taxidermy, whatever came to mind. There was no Game that night. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Harriet put her elbows on the table. She refused a cheroot, but drank more port than was good for her. Jem sat at the end of the table, his eyes laughing, not looking at her much.</p><p>But then he said something about the artwork at the ancient Roman site, Pompeii. Apparently every single drawing featured a phallus.</p><p>Even more interesting, it became clear that most of the men in the room had given those drawings plenty of study while touring Europe.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite object from Pompeii is the birdbath,\u201d Jem said lazily. \u201cCope, you saw the birdbath, didn\u2019t you? When you took the grand tour, I mean?\u201d</p> <p>He was playing with fire. \u201cOf course,\u201d Harriet said firmly, dropping her voice a notch. \u201cIt was inspiring.\u201d</p><p>Lord Pensickle hooted, and shot her an edgy look. \u201cFound it inspiring, did you? That\u2019s rather revealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne must assume that you found your own inspiration elsewhere,\u201d Villiers said. Harriet loved the fact that she had two champions: her supposed relative, Villiers, and her host.</p><p>\u201cThe brothel,\u201d Pensickle said promptly. \u201cNice-looking frescoes. Nice-looking women. I see nothing particularly interesting about a birdbath that pees water. And no one has equipment of that size.\u201d He gave them a squinty look, and Villiers smiled into his sleeve.</p><p>Jem left his seat at the head of the table and sat down next to Harriet. \u201cAfter all,\u201d he said, sotto voce, \u201cthere are only men here.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet was so happy she didn\u2019t worry about it. Jem poured her port, and laughed at her jokes. When all the men launched into a rousing version of The Westminster Whore, he elbowed her until she joined in the chorus. When Lord Oke staggered away from the table and pissed in the corner, Harriet squealed and Jem elbowed her silent.</p><p>\u201cI thought there was a chamber pot there,\u201d wailed Oke.</p><p>Jem rang for Povy and ushered everyone out of the room so cleaning could commence.</p><p>They lay in bed that night and Jem played with drops of forty-year-old burgundy, trailing them across her breasts and licking them clean.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t said anything about my offer of marriage,\u201d he said, once they had bathed and fallen back into bed.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI asked you to marry me,\u201d he said, hair falling over his eyes so she couldn\u2019t see them. \u201cRemember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014that was a joke. Wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>She held her breath, but he said: \u201cWhat was your husband like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe liked porridge in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t make love the way you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that. Tell me what I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe loved chess. More than anything, he loved chess.\u201d</p> <p>Jem was silent, but she knew him now, knew that his mind flew directly to the implication that Benjamin didn\u2019t love her as much as the game. \u201cDid he like playing judge?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She hesitated. \u201cI actually started sitting in the shire court before he died. He was so busy.\u201d That was a lie, but it was a wifely lie.</p><p>They spent the rest of the night talking about the bonfire on Guy Fawkes day last that burned down Peter Nicoll\u2019s dairy, and how hard it was to apportion blame to a crowd of drunk men. She told him about the theft of six oranges and then they talked again about Loveday Billing and her five husbands.</p><p>\u201cFive!\u201d Jem said. \u201cLoveday was an energetic woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey kept leaving her,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cI think she just wanted one, but she couldn\u2019t keep one in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to stop thinking about my other wives,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIt would never work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor Loveday, once a husband was in jail, or in Italy, he was gone.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s hair was over his eyes again. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that for me, when Sally died. She was there still for so long. At the breakfast table, or down in the garden. I kept thinking I would turn a corner and she\u2019d be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sounds heartbreaking.\u201d She brushed back his hair.</p><p>\u201cWasn\u2019t it like that for you as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when your husband was gone, you never thought you saw him through a door, forgot he was gone, remembered something you had to tell him?\u201d</p><p>How could she tell him what it was like when someone committed suicide? It was the one fact that she lived with, day in, day out, for months, for a year. She never forgot the cause of death long enough to think she saw Benjamin in the garden. The pain was in her bones, in her feet.</p><p>\u201cHe killed himself.\u201d</p><p>She made herself say it, the deepest most self-hating thing she could do, because she couldn\u2019t keep it quiet any longer. \u201cYou might want to reconsider your proposal. Quite a few people think that Benjamin was so deeply unhappy because\u2014because of me.\u201d</p><p>He gathered her roughly into his arms and held her against his chest and said one word. It was an ancient, Anglo Saxon word, the kind of violent swear word that never came from his mouth.</p><p>The wall she\u2019d built up to keep him out cracked a little. And perhaps there was even a small crack in the wall under that one, the wall she\u2019d put between the world and herself after Benjamin shot himself.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Jem said huskily. He was kissing her hair, and squeezing her so tightly that her chest hurt.</p><p>She stifled a sob because she didn\u2019t want to cry, not now. She wanted to hear what he was saying.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t making a good deal of sense. He kept saying how sweet she was, and then what a total idiot her husband had been. And as for the people who could possibly imply that his suicide had anything to do with her, well, they were idiots too. And worse.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t matter so much. It was that he didn\u2019t love me enough to stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a fool,\u201d Jem said roughly. \u201cYou know that, don\u2019t you? I can\u2019t not speak ill of the dead in this case.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. But then: \u201cBenjamin wasn\u2019t a fool. He was just so unhappy that he forgot about me. There wasn\u2019t room in his mind for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in my mind but you,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>And then he set out to prove it to her, in an entirely satisfactory manner.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>An Unexpected Marriage</p><p>February 19, 1784</p><p>H arriet walked into the drawing room unprepared to find Isidore glittering like a bird of paradise. Or a princess. Harriet actually blinked for a moment, watching her. Isidore was clinging to Jem as if he were the tree she was determined to nest in\u2014which was also strange and unexpected.</p><p>She was wearing a gown that fitted her like a second skin. It was made of a silver material that shimmered every time she moved. At her waist it billowed into soft billowing folds, transparent, pulled back to reveal watered silk of a deep blue color. It was a dress for Marie Antoinette. It was a dress for a princess...</p><p>Even more so when Harriet got close enough to realize that the bodice and skirts were sewn all over with tiny glittering stones. Diamonds. And there were diamonds in Isidore\u2019s hair too.</p><p>It took her a few minutes to actually reach Isidore\u2019s side; gentlemen were clustered around her as thickly as salmon swimming upstream, with Jem like a rock in the middle. He met her eyes over Isidore\u2019s head and mouthed something, but she couldn\u2019t understand. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy darling Mr. Cope,\u201d Isidore cried lavishly.

Harriet frowned. The words were written in a strong hand, dashed off as if the writer cared little for penmanship. She almost missed the one remaining word. Tonight. And then: C, scrawled in the lower right corner.</p><p>Harriet gasped. The duke. Isidore\u2019s Cosway. Isidore\u2019s scheme had worked. He was here, not just here in England but here.</p><p>She started back toward Isidore, elbowing one of the jugglers sharply in the ribs.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cope,\u201d Isidore said again. She was utterly exquisite\u2014and as white as a water lily.</p><p>Harriet took her arm and pulled her away from Jem, who looked rather relieved. Naturally all the men turned to follow, as if Isidore were some sort of rabbit and they the foxes.</p> <p>Isidore smiled, that lavish erotic smile she had, the one that promised men everything and delivered nothing. Harriet could actually see the man closest to her shiver a little. \u201cMy dear Mr. Cope will escort me to\u2014to\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will return, gentlemen,\u201d Harriet said, towing her away.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d Isidore cried, the moment they were free of the crowd. \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind, Harriet! I don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve brought the man all the way from the Nile,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cOf course you want him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not ready,\u201d Isidore said fiercely. \u201cIn my bed, Harriet. I\u2019m not ready for that. With a stranger. Tonight!\u201d</p><p>In truth, it was a daunting prospect, put so bluntly. Isidore came to a halt. \u201cIt\u2019s worse because of watching you and\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Harriet pinched her. \u201cHush!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean...\u201d</p><p>And Harriet did. When she was married, if she\u2019d had any idea how much pleasure, joy, a man and woman could have together...the comparison to her own life would have broken her heart, probably.</p><p>\u201cIsidore\u2014\u201d she said, as they went through the door into the entrance hall. \u201cYou must\u2014\u201d But the words died in her throat.</p><p>When she walked into the drawing room a mere two minutes before, the great foyer to Fonthill was populated only by a group of lackadaisical footmen. But now the front door was open, bringing with it a little swirl of snow and darkness.</p><p>She heard Povey\u2019s measured tones. \u201cIndeed, Your Grace, it is an unseasonably cold winter.\u201d</p><p>And then a deep laugh. \u201cI\u2019m not used to it, and I\u2019m shivering like a shorn lamb, I assure you.\u201d</p><p>Isidore went utterly rigid, and made a little sound of distress. The man was inside now, but his back to them. He was huge, wrapped in a greatcoat and an enormous fur hat.</p> <p>\u201cI have to go upstairs,\u201d Isidore breathed.</p><p>\u201cToo late,\u201d Harriet said, stopping her. \u201cHe\u2019ll see you on the stairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>Harriet gave her the frown she gave repeat visitors to her courtroom. \u201cYes, you can.\u201d</p><p>It was as if everything was happening in slow motion. The greatcoat was gone, and the hat was gone. Harriet had hardly time to see a great tumble of inky black hair, unpowdered and not even tied back, before he turned.</p><p>Her first thought was that he couldn\u2019t be English. She\u2019d never seen an Englishman that color\u2014a sort of gorgeous mahogany. He wore a jacket that Villiers would envy, made of pale blue but he didn\u2019t have it buttoned in the front, as was proper. She could see brown skin, right down below his throat. Where was his cravat? He wore no waistcoat. Long white cuffs tumbled over his hands, but rather than have them caught at the wrist by a pearl button, he wore them open. He was half dressed.</p><p>There was a moment of utter silence in the anteroom. The duke was looking only at Isidore.</p><p>Just as Harriet was about to say something\u2014some sort of introduction!\u2014he swept into an extraordinarily deep bow. Her eyes fixed on his face, Isidore sank into a deep curtsy. Still without saying a word, she held out her hand.</p><p>\u201cMy duchess, I presume,\u201d he said, carrying the hand up to his lips. His voice was dark and foreign, like that of a man used to speaking strange languages.</p><p>Harriet felt as if she were watching a play. How did Cosway know that he was facing his wife? And didn\u2019t he wish to retire to his chamber before he greeted Isidore? His face wasn\u2019t clean-shaven. Gentlemen\u2014dukes!\u2014never had stubble on their faces, to the best of her knowledge. That\u2019s what valets were for: to make sure that dukes pinned their cuffs, wore waistcoats, buttoned their coats...</p><p>No valet could tame the wildness of Cosway\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to introduce a dear friend of mine, Mr. Cope,\u201d Isidore said.</p><p>Harriet bowed, and the moment she straightened she saw that he knew precisely what she was. Instantly.</p><p>His eyes were dancing with amusement.</p><p>\u201cMr. Cope,\u201d he said, softly. \u201cHad I known that my wife\u2019s friends were of this...caliber, I would not have rushed across all England to rescue her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need no rescuing,\u201d Isidore said coolly, just as if she hadn\u2019t planned precisely that.</p><p>\u201cI had no doubt,\u201d he said. \u201cAlack and alas, my mother is of a nervous disposition. I do believe she would have swum the Nile and bearded the crocodiles herself in order to bring me home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould Your Grace like to refresh yourself before joining the company?\u201d Povy asked. Harriet had forgotten he was there.</p><p>The duke shook his head. \u201cThe duchess and I leave in the morning, and I positively long to see the decadent pleasures offered by Fonthill. I\u2019ve just come from a rather extraordinary wedding given for the Princess Ayabdar and yet from my mother\u2019s descriptions of Fonthill I expect to find myself shocked to the bone by Lord Strange\u2019s bacchanalian scene. I confess myself all anticipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fear Your Grace will be sorely disappointed,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cAs shall I, if you are forced to leave in the morning. I myself do not plan to leave for several days.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand in his again and raised it to his lips, smiling. Harriet almost fell back a step.</p><p>\u201cAh, but sweetheart,\u201d he said, his voice too low to be heard by Povy and the footmen, \u201cI am all eagerness for our wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are wed,\u201d Isidore said sharply. \u201cYou may have ignored that fact for years, but I assure you it is true.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe signed some papers, or at least I did. I\u2019m not sure you were old enough to know your letters. As I said, I\u2019ve come from a proper wedding. It lasted four days, or perhaps longer; it was hard to keep track of the days or the pleasures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Isidore said. \u201cHow fortunate for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI spent the time thinking of you. And planning our wedding.\u201d</p><p>She frowned.</p><p>\u201cWe are going to be married,\u201d he told her. \u201cAs befits a princess\u2014or in this case, a duchess who waited far too long for her duke to kiss her into life. Surely you feel as if you have been sleeping one hundred years?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Isidore was silent.

And he smiled. He was by no means classically handsome, in an English sort of way. He had a big nose, and all that tumbling black hair, and that golden-dark skin. But Harriet realized her mouth had fallen open anyway.</p><p>\u201cA wedding,\u201d the duke said. \u201cThe kind of wedding celebrated in Gondar, from which I just returned. My mother is preparing the estate and invitations will be delivered all over England. We may have to send a special invitation to Mr. Cope, of course. For some reason I think my mother may not know his name.\u201d His eyes slid to Harriet, and she realized with a start that she was simply standing there like a dunce.</p> <p>\u201cI would be honored,\u201d she said weakly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me for not taking your arm? Under the circumstances?\u201d There was a devil laughing in those eyes.</p><p>Harriet fell back and bowed, and Cosway swept Isidore through the door into the drawing room. There was a moment of dead silence and then a clatter of tongues that she heard straight into the antechamber.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-one</p><p>In Which Lord Strange\u2019s Reputation Takes a Strange Turn</p> <p>February 20, 1784</p><p>T he next night it started all over again\u2014a table of half-drunk Oxford professors together with some odd and highly intelligent actors, Lord Pensickle and Mr. Nashe. Villiers came to dinner and stayed for port. Everyone talked of little other than the Duke of Cosway\u2019s return, and the way he swept his duchess away to London after one evening at Fonthill.</p><p>\u201cI suddenly realized something,\u201d Harriet said to Jem. He was sprawled next to her in a chair. Now they had a routine. Once the ladies left he moved down the table and sat beside her without a word. It allowed him to do naughty things with his hands.</p><p>They felt happy sitting together. They never said it, but silence didn\u2019t make it any the less true.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked lazily. He was watching Mr. Nashe play chess with Lord Pensickle. Pensickle was a little the worse for port, and kept picking up the wrong pieces and galloping them across the board.</p><p>\u201cThe only dissolute persons in your house are women.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t say that,\u201d Jem said. \u201cLook at Villiers, for instance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean it,\u201d Harriet said. She looked around the room. There were perhaps twenty men around the table. Down to the left, two of the Oxford professors were chattering about a recent visit to the Duchess of Portland\u2019s collection at Bulstrode Park. Sir Joseph Banks, the President of the Royal Society, was talking about something called a Banks Florilegium\u2014and the need to raise funds for the project. His audience looked unconvinced. Nashe and Pensickle were playing chess.</p><p>Sullenly congregating in the drawing room (the ladies had made it clear that they did not approve of the new custom of separate evenings), were the Graces, Sophia Grafton and the rest.</p><p>\u201cYour house gains its reputation from the women you invite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is true of any house,\u201d Jem said, with a flash of anger in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s one of life\u2019s great unfairnesses. Mr. Avery, for example, maintains Mrs. Mahon in royal style. She\u2019s doubtless out in the drawing room right now boasting about the little silver boxes he\u2019s bought her. But is his reputation any the worse for it? No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s grotesquely unfair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe world is unfair,\u201d Jem said. \u201cReputation is ephemeral and unfair. Why should the Duchess of Beaumont be famed for her liaisons and yet Mrs. Mahon be an outcast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJemma married before she had an affaire,\u201d Harriet said, jumping to the defense of her childhood friend. \u201cAnd then she didn\u2019t stray until she found her husband on the desk with his mistress.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA bitter moment, I expect,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cVery!\u201d Harriet said. \u201cDid you maintain a mistress while married to Sally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Sally was enough to keep me busy.\u201d</p><p>Harriet spared a moment for a pulse of dislike for tall, slim, busy Sally.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you two talking about?\u201d Lord Pensickle said, raising his head from the chess board.</p><p>\u201cCheckmate,\u201d his opponent said.</p><p>Pensickle gave a little snort of disapproval and pushed away the board. \u201cEvery time I look across the table, you have your heads together.\u201d</p><p>Harriet gave him a cool look. \u201cWe were actually discussing mistresses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you have one!\u201d Pensickle said, with a guffaw. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought your instrument was old enough to function.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stiffened.</p><p>But before she could answer, Villiers cut in. \u201cNow that is surely a matter of the pot calling the kettle black, Pensickle. According to the laments so widely distributed by your former mistress, you have some...difficulty there yourself. All due to age, no doubt!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must say,\u201d Jem said, \u201cI found the poem published in Gentleman\u2019s Magazine rather amusing myself. Though undoubtedly it had nothing to do with you, Pensickle. You have to admit, all those jokes about the pen that would cast no ink were clever.\u201d</p><p>Pensickle\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cMy pen has more than enough ink,\u201d he flashed. \u201cAnd at least I\u2019m dippin\u2019 in the right kind of inkwell, if you don\u2019t mind the presumption, Strange.\u201d</p><p>For a moment Harriet thought that Jem would leap across the table. There was a sudden calmness around his large body, but he just grinned.</p><p>\u201cVilliers and I are educating Harry about the responsibilities of manhood, including lessons in proper treatment of the fair sex. Perhaps we\u2019ll take you on next, though I doubt things would go as well. Harry, after all, has found himself in the favor of one of the Graces.\u201d</p><p>That was true enough. Kitty was so saddened by the terrible accident that had befallen her darling Mr. Cope that she sought Harriet out at every possibility, hanging on her elbow and smiling sadly at her.</p><p>\u201cIt ain\u2019t Harry\u2019s inclinations that I\u2019d question,\u201d Pensickle said, pushing back from the table. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be going in the morning, Strange. I don\u2019t mind the house being a little strange, but we all have our limits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy all means,\u201d Jem said, smiling at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I ask my butler to help you now? No need to wait until morning. Just think. You might get lured into another game of chess and lose, or worse\u2014one of the young ladies in the other room might request the use of your pen.\u201d</p><p>Pensickle knocked over a chair on his way out the door.</p><p>Harriet felt a little sick. The table had gone stone silent, naturally, but now eased back into talk as if nothing had happened. She felt the nearness of Jem\u2019s leg, even though he had turned away and was chatting with the man on his right.</p><p>She turned to her left. Frederick Sanders gave her a queasy little smile and his eyes skittered away from hers. He was a middle-aged man with a cheerful red face and a parcel of coal mines, here to ask Jem to invest in coal.</p><p>As a matter of fact, Harriet had talked Jem out of the investment, based on the fact that the mines were dangerous for workers, but Sanders didn\u2019t know that. He\u2019d been perfectly friendly to her up to this moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Then Villiers, across the table, leaned forward. \u201cWant to go for a walk, Harry?\u201d he said, rising.</p><p>She gratefully rose as well. And left without saying goodbye to Jem, though what good that would do from a gossip point of view, she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cI need to start walking, or so my valet tells me,\u201d Villiers said with a little sigh.</p><p>\u201cYou look much better than you did a few weeks ago,\u201d Harriet said. All the footmen were standing around the corridor. How much could they have heard of Pensickle\u2019s fury? Would he say something to his valet?</p> <p>\u201cI mend,\u201d Villiers said. Povy bundled the duke into an enormous greatcoat, and Harriet shrugged into her own.</p><p>They walked out into the night. There was just a thin fall of powdery snow in the air. It came onto their hats, not seeming to fall as much as to suddenly appear with its chill greeting on lips and noses.</p><p>The windows of Fonthill spilled dusky orange-red light onto the snow. They walked silently to the opening of the great gates, and then Villiers paused, leaning against one of the pillars. \u201cDamn, but I\u2019m a husk of a man,\u201d he said, a trace of an apology in his voice.</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cHave I ruined his reputation forever, Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would take an idiot not to know you are bedding each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why!\u201d Harriet cried, frustrated. \u201cHe rarely whispers anything to me, or touches me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in your eyes when you look at each other,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut they\u2019re a strange crew at Fonthill. Most of the women are here for the free bed and board, and they\u2019ll not let a little thing like choice of bedfellow stand in their way of free champagne.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014do you really think so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are hardly acquaintances of Strange\u2019s,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cSometimes he doesn\u2019t even know the women\u2019s names. I have no idea why he opens his house to every light-skirt who makes her way here, but he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever to actual night-walkers,\u201d Harriet objected.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he has some standards,\u201d Villiers said wryly. \u201cThe majority of them are fending for themselves\u2014either as actresses or as sole practitioners, if I might employ the term.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes them more interesting than many ladies,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cExactly. If we\u2019re discussing men,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cthen yes, some of them are friends. There\u2019s the Game, of course, but I actually think men chiefly like this house for intelligent conversation, in combination with cheerfully loose women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you\u2019re here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yet in a position to avail myself of female company,\u201d he said, still leaning against the pillar.</p><p>Harriet threw back her head to look at the stars. Somewhere up there was the new planet, except it wasn\u2019t truly new. It was just new to them. The stars looked cold and very far away.</p><p>\u201cShould I leave?\u201d she asked. And she held her breath, because she didn\u2019t want to leave. She wanted\u2014oh, so greedily\u2014more days like these, full of vigorous exercise, vigorous argument, vigorous love-making.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll discover your true gender soon,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd if they discover that you\u2019re a duchess, Harriet, then the fat is truly in the fire. It would be disastrous\u2014not for Strange. For you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s just a joke,\u201d Harriet said feebly.</p> <p>\u201cI saw it that way. If it had been nothing more than a short masquerade, we could have carried it off. But I thought we were talking about a few days. Now it\u2019s a matter of time. The way Strange looks at you...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Harriet said, heartfelt.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t told him who you really are, have you?\u201d</p><p>Harriet shook her head.</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t take it well. And, Harriet, the longer you conceal your rank, the more he will see your revelation as a betrayal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI tried to tell him,\u201d Harriet said, near tears. \u201cI couldn\u2019t...I\u2019ll leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter telling him the truth, I hope. He deserves that.\u201d Villiers had a touch of a smile on his mouth. \u201cHow lucky you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo be so close to complete loss of reputation?\u201d she asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cI would pay for such intoxication. I might give up the final shards of my reputation for it. Give yourself one final day to savor. Leave the following day.\u201d</p><p>And he began to walk back to the house, favoring his right side, moving slowly.</p><p>But Harriet stayed behind, staring at Villiers\u2019s back through the thin, icy veil of snow. She couldn\u2019t squash the hope in her breast.</p><p>Surely, surely, Jem would not be able to see her go. They separated during the days, of course. She read in her bedchamber or played with Eugenia.</p><p>But when they came together it was with such joy, such intellectual curiosity, such\u2014physical pleasure. Surely he would not just watch her go.</p><p>The idea of waving goodbye was as bitter as the faraway stars.</p><p>He would tell her that it didn\u2019t matter who she was. He would follow her. Eugenia and he would follow. He would say goodbye to his guests, and come to her estate.</p><p>Surely he would.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>Double the Pleasure</p><p>February 21, 1784</p><p>T he next day the snow was gone, and the day was clear and cold.</p><p>\u201cRiding?\u201d Jem asked, glancing at her when she entered the breakfast room.</p><p>She gave him a slight nod, and then turned to greet Kitty. Kitty dragged her over to the side of the room. \u201cI heard all about it!\u201d she said in a thrilled whisper. \u201cI know you must be feeling terrible, but don\u2019t. I told everyone that you weren\u2019t a molly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cYou know what a molly is, don\u2019t you?\u201d Kitty asked.</p><p>\u201cYes, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what that foolish Pensickle thought you were. As if he\u2019s one to talk! We all know about him. Anyway, I told them\u2014\u201d she leaned over and whispered in Harriet\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Harriet exclaimed. \u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot only that but that you made myself and Roslyn happy. Roslyn thinks you are perfectly adorable, and she\u2019s so sad about what happened to you. She\u2019s telling everyone about last night. Roslyn is the muse of lyric poetry, you know, and she can really tell a lively story.\u201d Kitty giggled.</p><p>\u201cOn the same night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTogether! You had been only mine, but last night you were so mortified by those horrid untruths that you surpassed yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Harriet said, rather faintly.</p><p>Kitty kissed her cheek. \u201cI\u2019m your friend, Harry, forever. Don\u2019t forget that.\u201d She went back to her seat.</p><p>Jem rose to leave, but paused for a second. The memory of what happened in the middle of the night flashed between them, and Harriet felt herself turning pink. In the dark they had pleasured each other until they were breathless, begging, taking turns with sweet torment...</p><p>\u201cFrom what I hear, I should be taking lessons from you in manhood,\u201d Jem said, his voice just loud enough so that it could be heard by the room.</p><p>There was a stifled burst of giggles from Kitty\u2019s direction.</p><p>Harriet grinned at him. \u201cThere are times when youth is an advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps I could give you a few pointers.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOuch!\u201d Jem said, and everyone started laughing.</p><p>It would be all right, Harriet thought, sitting down with weak knees.

She squared her shoulders and accepted a slab of roast beef, hardly cooked, from the footman.</p><p>Breakfast passed in a flash. Kitty giggled every time she looked at Harriet and so did Roslyn, who kept giving Harriet slow winks.</p><p>Sanders came in, and sat down at Harriet\u2019s side. \u201cHeard about last night,\u201d he said, under cover of the conversation. \u201cWe all should have known that Pensickle was uttering rot. Everyone knows about the man\u2019s capabilities in that direction. Jealous, no doubt.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet murmured something.</p><p>\u201cHad a brother with a friend of that persuasion,\u201d Sanders confided.</p><p>Harriet really wished he wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>But Sanders was done with that topic and onto another. \u201cWhen I was a youngster, I would have loved to get up to the sort of high jinks you engaged in last night.\u201d He eyed Kitty in a toothy sort of way. \u201cMarried too young, that\u2019s what happened to me.\u201d</p><p>He thumped Harriet on the back so suddenly that she choked on a mouthful of beef. \u201cYou\u2019re doing it the right way, Cope. Spread your wild oats, and spread \u2019em wide, I say.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>It was a relief to escape. By the time she\u2019d negotiated all the winks and thumps from men, and all the giggles and veiled invitations from women, she was so tired that she felt like going back to bed.</p><p>Instead she pulled on her riding breeches and trailed outdoors to the stable. The day had started clear but was beginning to look gray again, with a hint of snow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re actually working today,\u201d Jem said, when she walked in. Nick was waiting for her, holding her horse. \u201cWe\u2019re going out to check the north stables and make sure all\u2019s snug and tight. My stable master thinks we may need to buy some grain to make it through the winter.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swung up on the saddle with a little puff. She was a much better rider now, and she didn\u2019t think that the tender ache in her thighs could be put down to riding astride.</p><p>At least, not riding a horse.</p> <p>The thought made her smile and she looked up to find Jem\u2019s eyes on her. He abruptly wheeled his horse and left the stable. She followed, wincing as the bitter air hit her face.</p><p>He was waiting and leaned over, took her mouth in a hard kiss. \u201cDon\u2019t ever smile like that if there is anyone else in the room.\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s heart sang. He would never let her go.</p><p>\u201cJem\u2014\u201d she said, but he was gone, and with a little shout she let her mare leap after him. She was a good rider now, able to go around turns at a gallop, although native common sense led her to slow her horse. Jem simply clung to the side of his mount and went faster.</p><p>Snow was in the air, the smell of it and the taste of it on the wind.</p><p>Harriet was just starting to get tired when a large barn loomed into view to the right. Jem immediately slowed his horse and picked his way across the frozen field. Then he jumped off and led his horse over to a small door in the side, not the huge door that accommodated the hay wagons.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Harry,\u201d he shouted over his shoulder.</p><p>Harriet clambered down rather painfully. That extra bit of gymnastics in the middle of the night\u2014though it was wondrously fun\u2014had taken its toll.</p> <p>She led her horse into the warmth, out of the wind. Stacks of golden hay towered over their heads, winding toward the wooden loft far above.</p><p>\u201cThis is the largest barn I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Harriet said, awestruck.</p><p>\u201cYour husband\u2019s storage barn isn\u2019t so large?\u201d Jem asked. There was just a touch of satisfaction in his voice that made her smile. If she didn\u2019t like Sally, Jem didn\u2019t seem to like Benjamin either. Though she hadn\u2019t told Jem anything much about Benjamin.</p><p>Not that it mattered, not with the true, clear emotion that strung between them. She\u2019d tell him when the moment felt right. Jem tied up the horses, then took her hand and they wound their way through a narrow pathway in the straw.</p><p>\u201cI just have to check the grain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBack here, in the lofts. We have a terrible mouse problem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps rats. You were so lucky with Eugenia\u2019s bite,\u201d Harriet said with a shudder. \u201cBy yesterday afternoon I could hardly see the punctures at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe shepherd brings his ratters to the barn once a week,\u201d Jem said. \u201cIronic, isn\u2019t it? I take excellent care of my barn, but I let my own child be bitten.\u201d</p><p>Harriet\u2019s fingers tightened, warm, around his. \u201cIt was an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe seems fine. Did she show you what happened to the castle?\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed. \u201cTrust Eugenia to turn a disaster into a triumph.\u201d A ham-handed footman had dropped a log on one side of her paper castle, crushing it. So Eugenia promptly declared the castle a ruin, and said the rats had won. \u201cLast night she was busily cutting out baby rats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw them,\u201d Jem said. \u201cThey looked like little puddings with tails, but I didn\u2019t tell her that. Here\u2019s the grain.\u201d He wrenched open the wooden top and they stared down into a huge bin. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him to buy a bushel or two,\u201d Jem decided.</p><p>Harriet reached out a hand and let the smooth kernels sort through her fingers. \u201cIt smells so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as good as you do.\u201d</p><p>He was looking at her again with longing in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose this will ever go away?\u201d she asked, hearing hunger in her own voice.</p><p>\u201cI doubt it. But why worry? We\u2019re having so much pleasure at this moment.\u201d</p><p>He pulled off her greatcoat and ran a hand under her shirt, only to be frustrated by her bandaged chest. So his hand started to roam downwards instead.</p><p>At first they just stood there, leaning against the rail, kissing until they were both panting a little, until Jem\u2019s heart was pounding under Harriet\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cIf only they could see us now,\u201d he said, amusement in his voice. \u201cI\u2019m afraid no amount of fibs from Kitty would help.\u201d</p><p>But Harriet wasn\u2019t interested in imagining what they looked like together. She wound her fingers through his and tugged. \u201cLet\u2019s lie down,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cA tussle in the straw like shepherds...I can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStraw gives me hives. I itch for days,\u201d he said, his eyes on hers. \u201cBut I think we could manage standing up, don\u2019t you, Harriet?\u201d</p><p>His hand was doing a slow caress of her hip. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI think so.\u201d</p><p>Two seconds later he was kneeling in front of her, she was holding onto the railing for dear life, and he was\u2014he was\u2014</p><p>He pulled back his head. \u201cYou know, Harriet,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cI sometimes get the feeling that you would like to scream. May I remind you that there\u2019s no one for miles around this barn?\u201d</p><p>Harriet gulped\u2014but then he pulled her toward him again and that wicked tongue of his turned her knees to water.</p><p>In the end, she didn\u2019t really scream. It was more like\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat was a scream,\u201d she heard Jem say. \u201cI knew you had it in you.\u201d But it was her turn, so she slid to her knees before him, and satisfactorily proved that Lord Strange had no control at all when it came to Harriet. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>None.</p><p>Then he was turning her around, belly to the railing, his large hands shaping her bottom. \u201cGod, you\u2019re beautiful, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say that no, she wasn\u2019t beautiful. Her hips were too round and her bottom was too round and her breasts were too small, but there was something in his voice that made the comment die in her throat.</p><p>His voice made her beautiful. His hands caressed her and she felt as if they were her own hands: from him, she learned the beauty of a woman\u2019s sweet curve, of a generous hip, of the delicate, mysterious space between a woman\u2019s legs.</p> <p>They were so together that her body knew what he wanted before her mind did. She arched back, welcomed him, sobbed when hard velvet stroked into her. His hands encircled her, protecting her from the railing.</p><p>He took it slow, each stroke a promise, to Harriet\u2019s mind. The days strung forward, days and nights with Jem...</p><p>Exclamations aren\u2019t enough. There are times when screaming is called for, especially when Jem slipped a hand in front of her body and began a wicked dance with his fingers. He rode her until she shattered; turned her about so he could kiss her again. Lifted her onto the railing so that her legs wrapped around his hips, saying that he didn\u2019t want to come without seeing her face.</p><p>She cried. What\u2019s a scream, after all, but a prelude to tears?</p><p>He was so deep within her that they didn\u2019t feel like two people.</p> <p>Just one.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p><p>Fear</p><p>T hey came home slowly, walking the horses most of the way because Harriet admitted that her thigh muscles hurt.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d take you in my lap,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019d be seen.\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed. \u201cI can\u2019t put Kitty\u2019s storytelling abilities to waste.\u201d</p> <p>So they walked the horses home through the gathering snow and dark. She gratefully gave her mare back to Nick, and walked back to the house.</p><p>They were met by Povy.</p><p>\u201cA fever, my lord,\u201d he said, without preamble. \u201cMiss Eugenia has a fever and it\u2019s quite high. I\u2019ve sent for the doctor.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s whole body froze. \u201cWhen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAn hour ago. I sent to the stables, but they said you had to be on the way back home already.\u201d</p><p>Jem pounded up the stairs, gone in an instant.</p><p>Harriet turned to Povy. \u201cWhat have you done for it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve ordered the maids to make a snow bath. We\u2019ll use it if we have to. At the moment I have her snug in bed. I\u2019m sure you will be a comfort.\u201d In that instant she realized that Povy knew precisely what she was (a woman), and quite likely, who she was (a duchess) as well. Povy was simply that sort of man.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Harriet said, moving toward the stairs. She was thinking desperately about the laborer on her estate, the man who died of rat-bite fever. It had been a few weeks before the fever came on; yes, just the same as for Eugenia. But he had some sort of rash\u2014</p><p>\u201cIs there a rash?\u201d she asked.</p><p>She saw the same awareness in Povy\u2019s eyes. He probably knew symptoms of every disease. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>That yet was no comfort.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-four</p><p>Hell</p><p>February 23, 1784</p><p>T he first two days Harriet tried to stay out of Jem\u2019s way. How long had she known Jem and Eugenia? A matter of weeks, even if it felt like years. She stopped in the morning and the evening to see Eugenia. She asked Povy for news every time she saw him. She wondered if she should leave, and couldn\u2019t bear to go out for a brief walk.</p><p>In case...in case Jem needed her. In case Eugenia needed her. In case something so awful happened that she couldn\u2019t put it into words.</p><p>Most of Jem\u2019s guests didn\u2019t appear to notice that their host was never to be seen. They heard his daughter had a fever, and having ascertained that it wasn\u2019t contagious, continued with their pursuits. The Graces left to travel to the house of the bishop for a week-long \u201cperformance.\u201d Presumably the Game continued, though Harriet neither knew nor cared.</p><p>On the third day, Harriet peeked into Eugenia\u2019s room in the evening to find Jem slumped in a chair by her bedside, asleep. He woke with a start.</p><p>The feverish patches on Eugenia\u2019s cheeks told their own story. She wasn\u2019t in a deep sleep: every once in a while she would shake her head, back and forth, as if she were in an argument.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s she doing?\u201d Harriet whispered.</p><p>\u201cFighting,\u201d Jem said. His voice was leaden with exhaustion. \u201cShe\u2019s fighting as hard as she can.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia shook her head again and said something indistinct. There was a no somewhere in the mumble.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a good fighter,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cWhere\u2019s her nurse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugenia doesn\u2019t like her. I\u2019ll have to find another one tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there any way I can help?\u201d Harriet said. She\u2019d asked before, but he said no.</p><p>Now he looked at her, gaunt and exhausted. \u201cI have no right to ask you this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease allow me to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t like the nurse the doctor sent. But she likes seeing you. She asked for you once.\u201d</p><p>Harriet came forward in a rush. \u201cI was trying not to be in the way. You should have called me when she asked for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the middle of the night.\u201d He stood up, rubbing his hands over his eyes. \u201cCould you sit with her, just for an hour or two? I need some sleep.\u201d</p><p>Harriet pushed him toward the door. \u201cGo. Come back in the morning.\u201d She curled up in a chair next to Eugenia\u2019s bed. At some point the little girl woke up and asked for water. She smiled blearily at Harriet. By morning she was fretful.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want water,\u201d she cried. \u201cMy side hurts. Where\u2019s my papa? Papa!\u201d</p><p>A maid entered the room and Eugenia\u2019s voice escalated. \u201cDon\u2019t want her here! Make her go away!\u201d</p><p>Harriet cast an apologetic look at the maid, who scuttled away.</p><p>The only thing that settled Eugenia was singing. So Harriet sang.</p><p>She was singing Drink to Me Only when Eugenia woke again. Harriet put a cool cloth on Eugenia\u2019s forehead.</p><p>\u201cAre you ever going to marry someone, Harry?\u201d she asked sleepily.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you had a baby, I could hold her. When I grow up I\u2019m going to have fourteen children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Fourteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Billows in the village has fifteen, and Papa says that\u2019s far too many.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is\u2014\u201d</p><p>But Eugenia was asleep, a little smile on her face. Perhaps she dreamt of fourteen children. At least she didn\u2019t shake her head. But an hour later she woke again, feverish.</p><p>\u201cI want a different song,\u201d she said fretfully. \u201cA song about papa. Sing me about papa.\u201d</p><p>Harriet panicked. She was singing the refrain of Papa\u2019s Tower is Falling Down for the fourteenth time when Jem entered the room. \u201cI\u2019ve sent for another doctor from London,\u201d he said by way of greeting. \u201cHow are you feeling, poppet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hot,\u201d Eugenia said, her lower lip trembling. \u201cI hate it in bed. I hate it here. I want to go outside. I want to sit in the snow.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stumbled up from her chair and Jem sat down. And that\u2019s how it went. For years, it felt like. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fever and the chills chased each other in an endless circle. Harriet sang song after song.</p><p>Nights were so much worse than days. Sometimes the fever waned slightly in the daytime, though it raged at night.</p><p>Sometimes in the daytime when Harriet said, \u201cHello, sweetheart,\u201d to Eugenia, she would open her eyes. Every once in a while she woke up and seemed completely rational. Even when she cried and said it hurt, they took it as a sign of strength.</p><p>But at night she never slept for more than an hour. When she wasn\u2019t sleeping, she went back to fighting, as Jem described it. She thrashed her head, back and forth, and shouted until her voice cracked. When she did sleep, it wasn\u2019t a natural sleep, but the kind from which people don\u2019t always wake.</p> <p>One day Harriet realized that Eugenia had been ill, really ill, for two weeks. She was sitting by the bed, wringing out a cold cloth to put on Eugenia\u2019s forehead when she heard Jem outside the door. \u201cCan\u2019t you do anything?\u201d he asked the new doctor fiercely.</p><p>And the man\u2019s voice, low. \u201cGod, and I wish that I could. We just don\u2019t know enough. There\u2019s people studying fevers, but they\u2019ve little to say about rat-bite fever.\u201d</p><p>And then she heard Jem walk away, down the hall, break into a near run. He never cried in front of her. But every day his face was more strained, the lines by his mouth more cruel.</p><p>When he returned, later that day, Harriet went to take a bath. The house was quiet, just a huge house and somewhere in it the rat that had given Eugenia a fever.</p><p>Just a house, and a father and his dying daughter.</p> <p>She stopped and rested her forehead against the corridor wall.</p><p>Days stretched into another week.</p><p>Eugenia was shrinking every day. Her little face grew more peaked and tired, her eyes larger.</p><p>One day Harriet went out for a walk, and when she came back, she saw with fresh eyes what she had known inside for days. Eugenia was dying. It literally felt as if her heart stopped, and not silently, but with some great screeching pain.</p><p>Eugenia was shaking her head again, back and forth, back and forth. Her cheeks were red and she was moaning, a little slipstream mumble of words, but Harriet knew what they were: a litany of pain.</p><p>She stumbled forward and fell on her knees by the bed.</p> <p>Jem was perfectly stark white, his eyes surrounded by black circles. \u201cIt\u2019s not going anywhere,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cIt\u2019s taken hold for good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t know that,\u201d Harriet whispered. \u201cNo one can know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t bear this much longer.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swallowed, buried her head in the covers, as if not to hear.</p><p>\u201cThe doctor says perhaps today.\u201d Jem\u2019s voice didn\u2019t even sound like his own. It sounded like a voice echoing from far away.</p><p>Harriet\u2019s tears burned her hands, burned the inside of her nose, burned her heart. \u201cWould you like to be alone with her?\u201d she said, raising her head. Tears dripped from her cheeks.</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cStay with me. With us.\u201d</p><p>So they sat together.</p> <p>The day wore on. Toward evening, Harriet found herself thinking the oddest thoughts: that twilight is not really dark. It\u2019s gray. The sun gone, the world turns gray, without emotion, without color. It seemed a fitting time for a little girl to slip free of all this pain, to let go.</p><p>But Eugenia never did. She would fall into silence, and panic would grip Harriet\u2019s heart, and then she would start shaking her head again.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fighting it,\u201d Jem said suddenly, after hours of silence. His voice cracked mid-sentence. \u201cShe won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><p>Harriet managed to smile at Eugenia. \u201cGood girl,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has to know it\u2019s all right to go. It\u2019s all right, darling, it\u2019s all right.\u201d His voice broke, and tears were rolling down his face. \u201cYour mama\u2019s waiting for you. There\u2019s just too much pain here, poppet. It\u2019s all right. You can let go, Eugenia.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t hear you,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cYes, she can.\u201d He bent over the bed, cradled his daughter\u2019s little face, told her again. And again.</p><p>Harriet buried her head in the covers and wept. Then she suddenly heard him say in a different voice: \u201cHello, poppet.\u201d</p><p>She reared up her head. Eugenia was looking blearily, irritably, at her father. \u201c\u2019Lo, Papa.\u201d</p><p>They were the most beautiful two words that Harriet had ever heard.</p><p>Eugenia frowned. \u201cStop telling me to go, Papa. I\u2019m too tired to go anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course you are. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Harry?\u201d</p><p>Harriet leapt up and tangled on her own feet and half fell on top of Eugenia. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSing me that song,\u201d Eugenia said, closing her eyes again. \u201cI want that song, Harry. My favorite song.\u201d</p><p>So Harriet sat down on the bed and started to sing. Her voice wavered and cracked. \u201cDrink to me only, with thine eyes...\u201d she sang. \u201cAnd I will pledge with mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut your hand on my cheek,\u201d Eugenia ordered. \u201cLike you did before, Harry.\u201d</p><p>So she did. \u201cYet leave a kiss but in the cup\u2014\u201d She couldn\u2019t manage the high note and slid low instead. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll not ask for wine.\u201d</p><p>As they watched, Eugenia fell into sleep. It was a deep sleep this time. She was so far away that her chest hardly moved.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take it,\u201d Jem said suddenly, stumbling to his feet. A great cracked sob came from his chest. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014Harriet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo for a walk,\u201d she said, looking up at him. \u201cShe won\u2019t die, not this hour. Not this moment.\u201d</p><p>He stood, frozen in the door. \u201cI can\u2019t watch. I\u2014can\u2019t\u2014watch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo,\u201d she said, loving him, loving Eugenia. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll watch and she won\u2019t die. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>He stumbled from the room. She lied, she had lied. It seemed obvious to her, as it undoubtedly was to Jem, that Eugenia was leaving them now. If not this minute, in five minutes, in an hour.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-five</p><p>Yet Leave a Kiss But in the Cup...</p><p>March 15, 1784</p><p>H arriet picked up Eugenia and carried her over by the fire to the rocking chair. Her little body was all bones.</p><p>She stayed by the fire, rocking back and forth, tears sometimes falling on Eugenia\u2019s face. The odd, funny little girl with a logical mind and a passionate wish for babies had crept into her heart.</p><p>When Benjamin was alive and they were first married, she had thought they would surely have children. Those unborn children tumbled through her dreams, teething on chess pieces, strutting the way Benjamin did, smiling at her with his eyes.</p><p>But then the children never came and somehow those dreams became faded and tired, rather like their marriage.</p><p>More tears fell on Eugenia\u2019s hair. She had found a child, only to lose her.</p><p>Once Eugenia stirred, but Harriet shushed her, kissing her forehead, and singing a few bars. She slipped back into that deep sleep.</p><p>Harriet was still rocking when Jem came back.</p><p>He walked in the door and she saw the question in his eyes and shook her head quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s here, still here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He looked down and despair was written in every inch of his body. \u201cI\u2019ll take a bath and then I\u2019ll hold her,\u201d he said. His voice was toneless.</p><p>Shock, she thought. He can\u2019t let himself face it yet.</p><p>Harriet kept rocking, her arms aching with exhaustion.</p><p>A slanted hint of pearly light came in through a crack in the curtains. Dawn had arrived.</p> <p>The light wasn\u2019t gray anymore. Rose, dusted with pearl, played over Eugenia\u2019s closed eyes. She didn\u2019t stir. Harriet freed one arm and put a hand on Eugenia\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Jem entered the room, deep in the cotton wool he had somehow wrapped himself in. He felt like a snowman come to life, cold, emotionless, walking by some miracle.</p><p>Harriet was still by the fire, but she\u2019d stopped rocking. He registered that was a bad sign, walked toward them. Harriet had patches under her eyes like bruises. Her hair was tied back with a simple ribbon, and strands of curled silk were falling about her cheeks. Eugenia was curled in her arms like a baby hedgehog.</p><p>There was something in Harriet\u2019s eyes...He looked at his daughter again. Put his hand on Eugenia\u2019s forehead.</p><p>Harriet\u2019s smile was so beautiful that he felt it in the fiber of his bones. The cotton wool peeled away, left him reeling.</p> <p>Morning light came toward him like a blow of color.</p><p>\u201cThe fever,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt\u2014is it?\u201d From the earliest days, the fever had waned, but it never really left. But Eugenia\u2019s forehead was cool. Cool.</p><p>Harriet tried to say something but she was crying.</p><p>Eugenia opened her eyes. \u201cPapa,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He scooped her up. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d He heard his voice crack with no embarrassment.</p><p>\u201cHungry,\u201d Eugenia sighed, putting her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>Harriet\u2019s wonderful, husky chuckle was a shadow of its former self\u2014but she hadn\u2019t laughed in weeks. Eugenia hadn\u2019t asked for food in weeks either. She\u2019d protested every spoonful of soup they gave her. Jem laughed, felt something wet on his cheek and realized he was crying.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to be all right,\u201d he whispered, tightening his arms around his little girl. \u201cHarriet, she\u2019s going to be all right!\u201d</p><p>Harriet laughed again.</p><p>He looked down at her. The joy was almost painful. \u201cI love you,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cDo you know that?\u201d</p><p>Harriet turned a little pink. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEugenia and I both love you. Our Harry.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia was asleep again, so he tucked her back in bed and then picked up Harriet and put her in his lap instead.</p><p>She put her head against his shoulder and they just stayed like that, staring into the smoldering fire. It took an hour, perhaps. But finally he heard her voice, like a kiss. \u201cI love you, Jem.\u201d</p> <p>He tightened his arms.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-six</p><p>Games</p><p>March 16, 1784 The following evening</p><p>J em walked out of Eugenia\u2019s room and his feet turned of their own accord toward Harriet\u2019s bedchamber. Eugenia was well.</p><p>She would live. The doctor agreed. She would live.</p><p>Mr. Avery was strolling down the corridor. \u201cWe\u2019ve missed you at the Game,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s your daughter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. Perhaps I can join you tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren are pesky creatures. I\u2019m quite proud of myself for not spawning any. Will Cope join us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Avery accepted that without a blink of an eye.</p><p>Jem\u2019s heart sang. Everything could go back to normal now. Except of course it wouldn\u2019t be the same, it would never be the same. He had Harriet now.</p><p>He pushed open the door of her chamber without knocking, hoping to find her undressed. Bathing.</p><p>She was writing a letter. He knew there was a smile in his eyes, saw it echoed in hers. He came around behind her and pulled Harriet\u2019s hair out of its ribbon.</p><p>\u201cI need you,\u201d he said fiercely.</p><p>She stood in his arms and turned, silent and sleek.</p><p>He pulled her to the edge of the bed, standing before her, so that he could make love to her, and still see her, all her sweet curves and delicious roundness. Harriet had no shyness, no modesty. She lay before him like a gorgeous feast, her legs wrapped around his hips.</p><p>Being Harriet, she never really stopped talking. \u201cDeeper,\u201d she said. Her lips, crimson and plump, caught his attention and he bent forward, taking her lips without missing a stroke.</p><p>Making love to Harriet was like nothing he could describe.</p><p>So he didn\u2019t try, just tugged her out of a nap a few hours later. \u201cCome on, Harry, on your feet.\u201d</p><p>She rolled away into the pillow. Her lips were bruised and swollen from his kisses. His body flared and did one of those instant calculations men can do in their sleep. Do it again now, or wait? Wait.</p><p>\u201cPut on your breeches,\u201d he said. \u201cThe boys are waiting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Game,\u201d he said, giving her a kiss just because he could. \u201cThey\u2019ve missed us. I promised we\u2019d go tonight.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cThe Game has kept going? Without you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they think we\u2019re going to join them tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey think their host and Mr. Cope are going. I told Povy that we\u2019d take the seventh and eighth seats.\u201d Her thighs were irresistible. He ran a hand up her right leg, stopping right where her sweet plumpness began.</p><p>She frowned at him and turned away. But that just meant that the curve of her bottom caught his eye.</p><p>He ran a hand slowly over her hip. \u201cHave you ever played master and slave girl?\u201d he asked, not expecting a yes. Whoever that gentleman farmer was Harriet married, he didn\u2019t sound like a master.</p><p>She gave him a look and sat up. \u201cAre you really telling me that the whole cohort of wastrel Game-playing men are still here and you agreed to meet them tonight?\u201d</p><p>He thought she phrased that quite succinctly. \u201cExactly. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJem, don\u2019t you think\u2014\u201d she started. And then lapsed into silence.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d rather stay here,\u201d Jem said, having a change of heart, \u201cI\u2019m perfectly willing. I can teach you a lovely game called Master and Slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure,\u201d she said. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re the master and I\u2019m the slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOther way around,\u201d he said, pulling her legs to the edge of the bed and then falling to his knees. \u201cCommand me, O Master.\u201d</p><p>He loved her chuckle. It made his heart dance; it made him harder than a rock.</p><p>But she was persistent too. \u201cGet up, Jem. You don\u2019t really think that we\u2019re going back to\u2014to the Game this very night?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you tired of primero?\u201d He got to his feet. \u201cI can go by myself, though they\u2019ll miss you. Povy can easily find someone for the eighth seat.\u201d He wandered over to the fire. \u201cEugenia had two eggs for supper tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s wonderful,\u201d she said.</p><p>But something was sinking into his mind. He knew that tone. Every man in the world knew that tone.</p><p>\u201cHarriet?\u201d he said warily.</p><p>She was standing with her arms folded. \u201cYou don\u2019t think everything is going to go back to exactly as it was, do you?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cUm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>After a moment or two, she prompted. \u201cJem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, it won\u2019t be the same,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you, Harriet. I mean, I loved you before but now I know I love you. That\u2019s different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think that Mr. Cope will be coming out to play primero tonight?\u201d</p><p>It was starting to feel like a stupid decision to wake her up. Harriet\u2019s eyes had darkened. Even though she was so angry, she was standing there naked.</p> <p>He couldn\u2019t help noticing.</p><p>And she saw that he noticed. Her eyes slid down his body and then narrowed. \u201cI suppose there\u2019s an alternative to a night of primero.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said, warily, feeling he was walking into a trap. \u201cWe could play a different game,\u201d he added hastily. \u201cChess, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Master and Slave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLife is not all about games, Jem.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help what his body thought, so he grabbed a dressing gown and wrapped it around himself.</p><p>\u201cYou said you loved me,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cI did. I mean, I do love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you see that things have to change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d He could feel tension building in his chest.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t be Mr. Cope forever,\u201d she said.</p><p>Relief flooded his chest. He grabbed a dressing gown and gave it to her, because he still couldn\u2019t concentrate. \u201cOf course, I don\u2019t want you to be Mr. Cope. I want you to be Harriet. I have an idea about that. We\u2019re going to kill off Cope, in an unfortunate carriage accident. I\u2019ll go away for a few days and meet you. Then you can come home with me, and just be Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be just Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d He could feel himself almost gabbling, but there was a look in her eyes he didn\u2019t like.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live like this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike this, Jem,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWith the Game, and the Graces gallivanting around the house when they\u2019re not out entertaining bishops. I\u2019m not\u2014\u201d</p><p>The truth slammed into him like a brick wall. Of course she wanted to get married. And he meant to do that, of course he did. He\u2019d only asked her once, through the door, and she hadn\u2019t answered.</p> <p>He walked across to her, cupped her face in his hands. \u201cI know what you mean, darling,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d She sounded pretty stunned. He had meant to ask her to marry him again, because he\u2019d known from the very first time they made love that she was his. That he would never let her out of his sight.</p><p>\u201cYou know, when I married the first time, I thought of marriage as some sort of jail. Like a little cage. A prison sentence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCharming,\u201d she said and he loved her dry wit so much that he almost smiled, but the moment was too important.</p><p>\u201cMarrying you will be completely different.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a jail sentence?\u201d</p><p>She still looked a bit peeved.</p><p>\u201cI love you. I mean, I did love Sally, but not when we first married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYet Sally was so amusing to be with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing she enjoyed the Game, if she was allowed to play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, actually she was very\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood at primero, was she?\u201d He didn\u2019t like the way her eyebrow shot up. And how on earth had he got onto the topic of Sally? The love he felt for Harriet was far deeper than what he had felt for Sally. She seemed like a long-ago playmate.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t remember whether she played primero well or not,\u201d he said, going for a safe bet. \u201cWe were like two puppies together, Harriet. Not like you and me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh? And what are we like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGrown up,\u201d he said firmly.</p><p>\u201cGrown up.\u201d She said it slowly, as if she were tasting the words. \u201cAnd how do such aged people as ourselves behave?\u201d</p><p>She was obviously furious. Jem\u2019s self-preservation instincts finally took over and he said, \u201cI think we should discuss this later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might miss the Game if we actually discussed the future,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m happy to discuss the future!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...the future. Harry Cope dies. Harriet, who happens to have an unusual resemblance to Harry Cope, appears at your estate and after a brief flirtation, we marry. A nine-days\u2019 wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt could work.\u201d But he could feel anger building in him too. What had he done to deserve her scorn? Ask her to marry him? Only that. Ask her to marry him.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll spend our days learning a little fencing, riding, trading quips with the Graces or their ilk, greeting any new people who happen to appear uninvited\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI invite everyone who comes here!\u201d he said, stung.</p><p>\u201cWander down to greet our guests around twilight, have a bite to eat, start the Game\u2014oh wait, I won\u2019t be part of that anymore, will I? I suppose I\u2019ll teach the Graces how to embroider or something ladylike.\u201d</p><p>Tenderness seized his heart. He would hate to be shown a glimpse of the freedoms allotted to men\u2014and then be forced to give them up. It would break his heart.</p><p>Obviously, it was doing the same to Harriet.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll change the rules,\u201d he said, putting a hand on her cheek. \u201cAll men...and Harriet.\u201d</p><p>She struck his hand away from her face and spun away. Surprised, he stumbled back.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand at all!\u201d</p><p>He caught his balance on a chair. \u201cI would have to agree,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI asked you to marry me. I offered to change the rules of my household so that you could continue to join the Game because I know you enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything!\u201d</p><p>He felt a swell of rage but he caught it back. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to explain it to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all games with you. Life is not a game!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I don\u2019t work hard enough?\u201d he said. His lips seemed to be numb. \u201cI assure you that I manage my holdings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain you do,\u201d she said scathingly.</p><p>He waited a moment to see if she wanted to explain herself. Then he said, \u201cIt takes a great deal of work to keep a vast estate and income the size of mine afloat, Harriet. You wouldn\u2019t understand that, but I don\u2019t see why your ignorance should result in scorn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI manage an estate as well,\u201d she flashed.</p><p>Of course, the farmer probably left an estate. It must not have been entailed, which suggested that Harriet\u2019s husband was a commoner. Not that it mattered to him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the way you approach life,\u201d she said. \u201cAs if it were one long game.\u201d Her face had a stony look to it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand your criticism. I assure you that I take no unnecessary risks with my estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust with your child,\u201d she flashed.</p><p>He felt himself growing paler. She dared\u2014dared\u2014to say that he took risks with Eugenia? Still, he forced himself to respond calmly. It was almost like a miracle, the way he heard his own voice enquire mildly, \u201cAnd how exactly should I have protected Eugenia from the rat, Harriet?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that! Anyone could have that happen\u2014but she was alone when it happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather you\u2019re criticizing my ability to hire nursemaids.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat governess was as feckless and beautiful as the rest of the women in this house,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cShe had no real care for Eugenia: none.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was in love. That could happen to anyone.\u201d Though he was starting to wonder if it had really happened to Harriet.</p> <p>\u201cShe was part and parcel with the women who pay you visits,\u201d Harriet snapped. \u201cMy mother would have called her a wag-tail. She was nothing more than a ladybird, looking for her next meal!\u201d</p><p>Jem could feel himself growing rigid. Ice poured down his back. \u201cI regret that you think I willingly hired a ladybird to care for my daughter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hire her willingly,\u201d Harriet cried. \u201cI suspect you simply don\u2019t know what a decent woman looks like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not a hermit,\u201d he pointed out, counting to one hundred in the back of his mind. \u201cI frequently visit London, which is stiflingly full of boring woman who must, therefore, be virtuous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, of course virtue is boring!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. And it makes such claims for itself. The very smell of virtue makes a woman utterly tedious, and at the same time, utterly conceited.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am a virtuous woman,\u201d Harriet said through clenched teeth.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll have to agree that you are an exception,\u201d Jem said. He was vibrating with rage over her criticism of his childrearing. \u201cI shall do my best to engage a truly virtuous nanny for Eugenia. Or else I\u2019ll just try to find one like yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou came to my house under a false name, dressed in breeches,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWhen it became clear to both of us that we were of compatible genders, you fell into bed with me without showing an undue amount of virtue. Thank God.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn short: you think I\u2019m a strumpet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly in the best meaning of the term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ladybird.\u201d</p><p>His back stiffened again and his jaw tightened. \u201cThere would be nothing so terrible about being a ladybird, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo is that the future you have in mind for Eugenia? Is that why she is locked in the west wing, hardly able to enjoy fresh air\u2014while all the ladybirds trot around your estate?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never kept Eugenia from the fresh air. Neither have I unreasonably immured her from our guests. She has come to know a few of the young women very well.\u201d</p><p>Too late, he realized this was a mistake. Harriet\u2019s eyes flashed and she made a sound that could have been a growl, on a man. \u201cI gather it is your ambition to turn her to a ladybird, then, since you give her such excellent companionship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you please find some other term for this conversation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoxy?\u201d Her tone was delicate but sharp as knives. \u201cDrab or strumpet? There are so many appropriate words.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd as a virtuous woman, you know them all,\u201d he said, pushed beyond endurance. \u201cGood women delight in throwing terms at those less fortunate\u2014even while they gaily engage in precisely the same behavior.\u201d</p><p>She paled and he knew that went home.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right,\u201d she said, a second later.</p><p>\u201cYou virtuous women shun and scorn those whom you believe to be weaker, less righteous. And yet\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019ve played the doxy in your house, and now I have no right to condemn you for your taste in companionship. After all, I transformed myself into precisely what you always desired.\u201d</p><p>He was never very good at sorting out a whole swirl of emotions, and he felt buffeted by them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLuckily, I am quite certain. You are right.\u201d</p><p>She waited until he said, cautiously, \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had no right to ask you to change, or to think that you were even capable of it. I thought\u2014\u201d and something flashed across her eyes \u201c\u2014I thought you saw my heart. I thought you knew me. What a fool I was.\u201d</p><p>She almost whispered the last.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look grieved,\u201d Jem said, catching her arm. \u201cI do know you, Harriet. I love you.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t even hear him. \u201cI wove it all in my head, of course, fool that I am. I was playing the doxy and you saw me as a doxy, and that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never saw you as that! Never!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is that,\u201d she finished.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Finally, she looked at him again. \u201cI am extraordinarily slow in my understanding, Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo am I,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I have no idea what is going on here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will make you laugh.\u201d There was something empty in her eyes that made him want to scream at her. \u201cI actually thought you would\u2014you would change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will change! I told you I would change. I want to marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never asked anyone to marry me, by my own impulse and reckoning. I didn\u2019t think it would be thrown away so lightly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you knew what kind of woman I am. I thought you would\u2014I thought you would become that sort of man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the sort of man for you, Harriet. Don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou are a wonderful companion. I thought you could be something you\u2019re not at all. I thought you could be the sort of man who marries a woman like me\u2014the real me, not Mr. Cope. Not me under a secret name and having a wild affaire. The me who runs an estate, Jem. The me who sits in judgment in the shire court. I did behave like a ladybird.\u201d She must have seen him flinch. \u201cBut I thought you knew that it wasn\u2019t the real me...I thought you would come home with me.\u201d</p><p>He laughed, heard his own laugh, like a bark. \u201cTo the little farm your husband left you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever size it is, darling,\u201d he said, reining in his impatience, \u201cFonthill is hundreds of acres. It\u2019s not practical to leave my estate and move to yours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant\u2014I meant not just physically come with me. Come with me in other ways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you mean become some sort of country squire, like your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy husband wasn\u2019t a country squire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever he was,\u201d Jem said impatiently. \u201cA gentleman farmer, living off in the country with his hogs. I don\u2019t care if he wasn\u2019t a gentleman, Harriet. I\u2019ve never cared for rank. You should know that about me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that,\u201d Harriet said. \u201cBut Jem, I haven\u2019t been honest with you. I played the doxy, and I\u2019m not one. I\u2014I frolicked with the Graces, and I led you to believe that I could live in such a way for my whole life.\u201d</p><p>There was something in her face, something almost resigned, that made him feel slightly crazed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lied to you by omission.\u201d Harriet said flatly. \u201cMy husband was a duke. And I am a duchess.\u201d</p><p>The moment she said it, he knew the truth in his bones. Of course, she was a duchess. She had the spine of a duchess, and the natural tone of command. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She didn\u2019t expect people to love her: she expected them to fear her. To bow and scrape before her. That was why she loved being Cope so much. It set her free, in the same way that not being a woman set her free.</p><p>\u201cA duchess,\u201d he said, fury burning its welcome into his heart.</p><p>She inclined her head. It was a duchess\u2019s nod. But there was a tear sliding down her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou pretended to be other than you are\u2014why?\u201d But he knew, he knew. \u201cI\u2019m not good enough for a duchess. You deceived me, day after day\u2014because of rank?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t rank. You are\u2014yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I am a bird of a different feather, for all I pretended to be someone I\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I fell in love with an illusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you? Did you fall in love with an illusion too, Harriet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You never lied to me. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of lying, Jem.\u201d</p> <p>He folded his arms because it was ungraceful to clench one\u2019s fists in polite conversation. Especially with a duchess, one had to presume. \u201cIronic as this may seem, I would have thought it below myself to pretend to a lower rank than my own. I gave you myself, such as I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou have been utterly honest with me. This is your life, and\u2014and that\u2019s wonderful. You love your life. And\u2014and that\u2019s wonderful. Truly. I\u2014I\u2019m a fool, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you mind explicating the nature of your foolishness?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him for a moment, as if she were memorizing his face. His heart turned over. She was really going to do it. She was going to leave him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re the only gentleman I\u2019ve ever met who truly doesn\u2019t care about rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI honor that. But I can\u2019t live like this.\u201d</p><p>Jem felt his tone hardening before he even said it. He knew why she couldn\u2019t live in a house without rank: she was a duchess, for God\u2019s sake. That would be like giving away her most precious possession. \u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a house in which people just come and go, like some sort of changing play. You don\u2019t even know all of them, Jem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not good enough for a duchess. I completely understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of good. Well, perhaps it is.\u201d He could see her make some sort of decision. She looked up at him. \u201cI\u2019m a staid person, at the heart, Jem. All I ever wanted, really, was to have some children and a husband who loved me. That was it. I never\u2014\u201d</p><p>She turned away but he saw the gleam of tears again and it tore his heart.</p><p>\u201cI never dreamed I would be as wild as I\u2019ve been here. Playing primero for huge stakes, having an affaire...It\u2019s not me. But I also\u2014I can\u2019t live with people like the Graces, not for the long term. I don\u2019t want to be in a house that is an inn for itinerant players and drunk jugglers, not to mention the scientists and politicians. Yet I loved every moment of it. It\u2019s changed me, changed my life. I don\u2019t blame my husband for dying any more.\u201d</p><p>Ice and anger slammed into his heart. \u201cI am happy that Eugenia and I could be of use to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d she cried, holding out her hand. \u201cDon\u2019t leave in anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou lied to me. I thought you were the widow of a farmer\u2014\u201d He spat the word. \u201c\u2014and all along you were merely playing with the hoi polloi. Amusing yourself with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that!\u201d</p><p>Bitterness seized his throat. \u201cDo you know what I think about people, Harriet? I think the worst lie was not when you pretended to be a dumpy widow. I have that phrase right, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Her face was stark white. \u201cI am\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop it,\u201d he said through clenched teeth. \u201cIt was when you pretended to be a squire\u2019s wife. Villiers was having his little duke\u2019s game, bringing along two duchesses. I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t see that; it\u2019s just the kind of twisted humor people of your rank appreciate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a joke!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the kind of joke that only a duke would appreciate,\u201d he said tonelessly. \u201cI know Eugenia won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t say that to her. It\u2019s not true!\u201d</p><p>He just looked at her, and the silence grew bitter and thick between them. \u201cI\u2019ll try to keep the uglier parts of the truth from Eugenia. You go, back to the duchy. I\u2019ll stay here. And God, I hope that we never meet again.\u201d</p><p>Her face was tear-stained, but she kept her chin high. \u201cI don\u2019t see what I did that was so terrible, that deserves this level of rage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved you. I thought I knew you. My anger should be at myself, not at you. I will endeavor to make it so.\u201d And then he said, \u201cIf you\u2019ll forgive me, I have an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><p>He waited while she tried to say something that got caught on a sob, raised her head again. \u201cAre you sure you\u2014couldn\u2019t you come with me, Jem? I love you. I love you so much.\u201d</p><p>It was maddening to feel sorry for her. To still feel love for her, even. She was a liar who entered his house and amused herself with him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a toy that can be bought,\u201d he told her, finally. \u201cI\u2019m a man with a large estate and a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a house party,\u201d she said with a touch of bitterness. \u201cDon\u2019t forget all your guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have a life. It\u2019s not a perfect life, and it\u2019s not a duke\u2019s life, but it\u2019s my own. I am Lord Strange. I earned my reputation and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She interrupted him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t! And you know you didn\u2019t! I don\u2019t believe you slept with any woman since Sally died. Did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy lovers are irrelevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you!\u201d she shrieked at him.</p><p>\u201cOnly once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why\u2014why couldn\u2019t you just love me, instead of all these other people?\u201d Her voice choked again. \u201cWhy do you need the Game so much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved the person you presented yourself as\u2014a funny, wise, intelligent person who loved learning to fence and ride and play poker. But that person\u2019s not real.\u201d He felt merciless, and yet it had to be said. \u201cYou\u2019re a duchess. You\u2019re not Harry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew I wasn\u2019t Harry!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were someone I could love,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cAnd someone who loved being here, with me. But you\u2019re right. A duchess can\u2019t have anything to do with Lord Strange. No duchess should ever darken the door of this house. You shouldn\u2019t have come.\u201d</p><p>He left her small white face behind him, and walked away. Her voice stopped him at the door.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Her voice didn\u2019t even tremble. \u201cI may have misrepresented myself, and I suppose you can\u2019t forgive me. Or don\u2019t want to forgive me. But I saw you for what you are and could be, Jem, and I love you. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>His eyes burned suddenly so he didn\u2019t turn around. \u201cYou saw me for a loose screw who welcomes riff-raff into his house.

It seems I have a genius for finding men who care more for a game than for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m certain that you will find someone of your rank,\u201d he heard himself say. The flash in her eyes could have been agony\u2014or dislike, so he opened the door.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t walking away, because she had left him, really.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t good enough for her. And she didn\u2019t even know the whole of it. His mouth twisted. His valet took one look at him and practically threw his clothing toward him.</p><p>Then he was away: pounding down the road, down the slick road, hating her, hating himself, his heart bleeding for Eugenia. How would he explain to her? Harriet didn\u2019t love us enough? What do you tell a little girl who thinks\u2014</p> <p>Actually, what did Eugenia think?</p><p>She knew that Harriet was a woman. But she\u2019d never said much other than that. He hadn\u2019t told her that he meant to marry Harriet.</p><p>Although he always meant to marry her, he realized with another sickening lurch of his stomach. Almost unconsciously, he had decided long ago that he was going to do Harriet a favor by marrying her and rescuing her from her boring little backwater of a farm. Bring her to a life of luxury. He kicked his horse and they went faster, until the wind screamed in his ears.</p><p>A life of luxury, he was offering. In a tawdry house full of strangers and primero games. While she probably lived in a castle.</p><p>If he cried, which he never did, his tears would have turned to icicles on his cheeks.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-seven</p> <p>To Be Better Than a Game</p><p>March 18, 1784 Berrow House Country Seat of the Duke of Berrow</p><p>H arriet got home, all the way home, by two days later. Villiers\u2019s man, Finchley, gathered up her clothes, and Harriet gathered up the shards of her self-esteem and her love, and took it all home in the carriage with her.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even cry until her spaniel, Mrs. Custard, ran to meet her. And then she dropped right down on her knee in the dirt and hugged him. His tail wagged furiously.</p><p>\u201cHe checked the front door for you every day, Your Grace,\u201d her butler, Wilson, said from somewhere above her right shoulder.</p><p>Harriet bit her lip hard. She couldn\u2019t cry in front of the servants. She never cried in front of the servants, not when Benjamin died, not when...</p><p>When had anything worse than that happened?</p><p>Besides having her heart ripped out and rejected, thrown back in the dirt at her feet.</p> <p>You\u2019d think she\u2019d be used to it. Benjamin didn\u2019t really love her; neither did Jem. They both loved their games better\u2014the game of chess, with all its intricacies and power struggles, the game of\u2014of being Lord Strange. With all its odd generosity, male camaraderie, celebration, and the game of primero, with all its intricacies, power struggles, and bets.</p><p>A tear dropped into Mrs. Custard\u2019s graying fur.</p><p>Once, for once, she wished that someone would love her more than a game. The way she loved him.</p><p>\u201cThe servants await you, Your Grace,\u201d her butler said. He meant they would be all lined up inside the front door, waiting to curtsy.</p><p>\u201cMy goodness, Wilson,\u201d she said, striving for a light tone. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as if I\u2019ve been gone for months. Disperse them, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDisperse them.\u201d She didn\u2019t use that tone often.</p><p>\u201cYou have a visitor,\u201d her butler continued. His training did not allow him to betray a wounded tone, but she could tell he would have liked to.</p><p>\u201cA visitor? How odd. No one knew I was coming home today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe arrived two days ago and has been awaiting your arrival,\u201d Wilson said.</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d Harriet said, rising and brushing fur off her hands. \u201cShe is?\u201d</p><p>The butler pulled himself to a standing position. \u201cThe Duchess of Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, goodness,\u201d Harriet said, walking toward the great stone arch that led to the inner courtyard. \u201cWhere is she now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the conservatory, I believe, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>Harriet walked into the courtyard, and through the west door that led to the conservatory, avoiding the front entry and the waiting servants. She was conscious of resentment. She didn\u2019t want to see Jemma, fond though she was of her. She wanted to fall into the nearest bed and cry. She wanted to cry until she had hiccups and couldn\u2019t stop. She wanted to cry as many tears as she had for Benjamin.</p><p>Which was ridiculous.</p><p>Jem was not dead. He just didn\u2019t love her enough. A tragedy for her, for no one else. And yet she could feel her blood beating to the rhythm of the tears she wanted to shed.</p><p>Because she thought\u2014she really thought\u2014that he would come home with her. That he loved her truly, saw her truly. But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>She found Jemma sitting in the section of the conservatory that Harriet called the orange arbor. She had tried to grow oranges, but they flowered and never grew fruit. She couldn\u2019t bear to discard the trees, so they stayed in a corner, all scented shiny leaves.</p><p>By the time she saw Jemma, tears were hanging on her eyelashes.</p><p>Jemma was seated on a bench under an orange tree, playing chess, apparently by herself. Harriet walked up quietly. It felt odd to be in a dress. Slippers were much quieter than boots. As she watched, Jemma moved a white piece, and then one of the blacks.</p><p>She glanced up and sprang to her feet. \u201cDarling Harriet, you\u2019ve come home!\u201d</p><p>Then Jemma had her arms around her, and a white handkerchief out, and Harriet collapsed against her. \u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014It\u2019s just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d Jemma murmured. \u201cIsidore told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told you that he doesn\u2019t love me? She knew? Why am I the only dunce? Why am I the only one who never knows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsidore didn\u2019t say that,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cShe said that you were having a lovely time together but that\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love me,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cI can only identify a man in lust,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cI have no idea how reliable Isidore is in these matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was in lust,\u201d Harriet said, hiccupping. \u201cBut I thought he loved me.\u201d The words wrenched out of the bottom of her heart. \u201cHis daughter got sick, and he asked me to be there with her. And I thought\u2014I thought it was because\u2014I\u2019m such a fool!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Jemma said, rocking her a little.</p><p>\u201cI thought he was thinking of me as being Eugenia\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he was thinking that,\u201d Jemma said.</p><p>\u201cI was good enough,\u201d Harriet said, \u201cat least while I had my trousers on. He said we could kill off Harry Cope, and then he\u2019d marry Harriet, and I could go right back to playing primero with the men every night.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA fool,\u201d Jemma diagnosed.</p><p>\u201cAnd then when I said I was leaving, and I even\u2014I even begged him to come with me, but he wouldn\u2019t.

It wasn\u2019t like that, it really wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d</p><p>She was crying so hard now that she bent over at her waist, arms wrapped around herself, crying in big ugly gulps and odd noises.</p><p>\u201cI loved him and he didn\u2019t love me enough,\u201d she said, her voice wavering. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sick\u2014I\u2019m so sick of always being second rate, of never being enough. The moment he found out I was a duchess it all just changed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh,\u201d Jemma said, softly. Her hand paused for a moment, stroking Harriet\u2019s hair. \u201cPeople always treat duchesses differently,\u201d she said. \u201cA duchess is the highest in the land. There are many men who would never even flirt with a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to flirt with me,\u201d Harriet said, sitting upright again and wiping her nose. \u201cHe just had to marry me! And then I wouldn\u2019t be a duchess anymore. I\u2019d be plain Lady Strange.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe he wanted to but he couldn\u2019t imagine it,\u201d Jemma suggested.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t love me enough. And you know? I\u2019m tired of people who don\u2019t love me enough,\u201d Harriet said, her voice rising. \u201cI\u2019m not so terribly second rate. I\u2019m really not like Mother Goose. I\u2019ll never be as beautiful as you, Jemma, but I am beautiful. I am. I look best in boy\u2019s clothing, but\u2014but he saw me in boy\u2019s clothing. And I look really good with no clothes at all!\u201d</p><p>Jemma chuckled. \u201cI believe you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m smart. Maybe not as smart as you\u2014\u201d Her voice stopped. \u201cOh God, listen to me. I said it myself. You are beautiful and intelligent, and I\u2019m just good enough, and smart enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t have much intelligence,\u201d Jemma said matter-of-factly. \u201cI can\u2019t figure out much except chess, for example. And how far has that got me? I have won a lot of chess matches. And where am I because of it?\u201d The bitterness in Jemma\u2019s voice silenced Harriet for a moment.</p><p>\u201cChess didn\u2019t stop my husband from having a mistress. Chess didn\u2019t stop me from ruining the prospect of our possible happiness by retaliating and bedding a man. Chess didn\u2019t make Elijah love me, or care what I was doing in France. Chess won\u2019t do anything.\u201d Her tone was fierce. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing special about a head for chess.\u201d</p><p>Harriet blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cStrange is a fool,\u201d Jemma said. \u201cYou are wonderfully intelligent, and gorgeous clothed and unclothed, and you don\u2019t even play chess\u2014what more could a man want? You would have been loyal to him\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would kill him if he took a mistress,\u201d Harriet said fiercely. \u201cI started to think about him taking a lover on the way home and I almost turned around the carriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSee what he gave up?\u201d Jemma said. \u201cThe potential of being married to someone who loved him enough to become homicidal. You have a broken heart but broken hearts do mend. You are free to find a man who knows exactly what a intelligent, beautiful person you are.\u201d</p><p>Harriet sniffed.</p><p>There didn\u2019t seem to be much more to say on the subject, so after a time they both retired to their rooms.</p><p>Harriet fell onto her bed and waited for a tide of misery to wash over her\u2014but it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Instead she kept thinking that she deserved better. Anger made it too hard to lie still, so she leapt to her feet and walked the room. She deserved someone to love her.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t second rate, she really wasn\u2019t. Perhaps she was clumsy in panniers, but Jem didn\u2019t know that. What he knew was that she was nimble at fencing.</p><p>And perhaps she looked like a partridge in women\u2019s clothing\u2014but again, he didn\u2019t know that. He\u2019d seen her at her best. And she felt beautiful, those times when they made love. Even thinking about their afternoon in the barn made her feel a little teary\u2014and very angry. What was he doing, throwing away something as precious as what they had?</p><p>She almost dissolved into tears, remembering the way he cupped her face, and said that he\u2019d make love to her in the stable on her eightieth birthday.</p> <p>The crucial thing was that she had said\u2014she had actually managed to say that she loved him. She\u2019d begged him not to leave her.</p><p>And he had still let her go.</p><p>That was the only thing that mattered, not how he felt about her being a duchess, or whether he thought she was a liar, or those other things he said.</p><p>It was like a cold knife, but it was also good. If she\u2019d had the time to beg Benjamin not to leave her, he would have done so anyway. She knew that. But she would have liked the chance to tell him one last time that she loved him.</p><p>It was the same thing all over again, except that Jem was alive, presumably sitting around at the Game, flirting with the Graces...</p><p>It was the same thing, all over again.</p><p>He was dead to her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-eight</p><p>The Definition of Manhood, Under Discussion Again</p><p>March 21, 1784</p><p>I t was time for the Game, so Jem made his way to the study. Lord Brouncker arrived with news of a great quarrel between the East India Company and a man named Stallybrass, which was inflaming both Houses of Parliament. Jem didn\u2019t care.</p><p>He bet wildly and without interest. He ended up betting that Fox would not prevent passage of the Mutiny Bill, even though he hated engaging in that sort of random expenditure of money.</p><p>The Game dissolved into nothing more than a series of drunken reminiscences, all of which had to do with a certain opera singer named Noelle Gray who seemed to have a generous temperament, to say the least.</p><p>Jem could hardly control his irritation.</p><p>Villiers was smiling his secret little smile across the table. It provoked him, so he said belligerently, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was maintaining a dignified silence,\u201d Villiers observed.</p><p>\u201cDistasteful,\u201d Jem snapped. \u201cGentlemen, shall we have another hand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNoo,\u201d Brouncker said, shaking his head. \u201cCan\u2019t manage it. My stomach\u2019s upset. Might shoot the cat.\u201d</p><p>Jem decided never to invite that idiot again. He looked around the room. He didn\u2019t want to see any of these men again, with their belching and pettiness. Lord Oke was peeing against the wall again, though he knew perfectly well that there were chamber pots in the hall. Now he would pretend that he saw\u2014</p><p>\u201cDamme if I didn\u2019t see a chamber pot there but a moment ago!\u201d Oke roared.</p><p>\u201cMissing something?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>The tone of his voice was nicely calibrated to sting. Jem turned and snapped at him. \u201cIf you wish to say something, just do so. Be a man, for once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that really the subject at hand? What is a man, after all?\u201d Villiers asked softly. He was magnificently dressed in a flared coat of raspberry, edged with an elaborate braided twill. He had his hair tied back and unpowdered, of course. Only fools like Oke bothered to powder their hair for the Game.</p><p>\u201cA man,\u201d Jem said, \u201cis not a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConcise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are not fools who\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho turn out to be what they are not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAh, the beauty of your logic,\u201d Villiers said amiably. \u201cReally.

She showed remarkable spirit for someone of her sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Villiers said, sitting back. \u201cAnd therein we have the serpent in the Garden of Eden, do we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must admit there is some discrepancy in how she was presented to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have never been one to overlook rank,\u201d Villiers said, waving his hand. He wore a ruby on one finger.</p><p>\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet if I judge Harriet correctly, one could not say that she takes rank as seriously as do I\u2014and oddly enough, as you appear to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought she was the widow of a country squire,\u201d Jem said, scrubbing his face with his hands. He might as well tell Villiers. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be doing her a favor, by taking her out of a dreary country existence.\u201d</p><p>Villiers laughed.</p> <p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Jem said. \u201cMore the fool I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duchy of Berrow is no small hamlet,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cBerrow?\u201d Jem\u2019s head shot up. \u201cBerrow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat duchy did you think we were discussing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never asked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t very many of us,\u201d Villiers observed. His ruby ring seemed to wink at Jem.</p> <p>\u201cHer husband...\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe came to the Game once,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>\u201cYou never invited him again,\u201d Villiers guessed.</p><p>\u201cNo. He wasn\u2019t really interested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBenjamin was one of my dearest friends, though I didn\u2019t understand that until after his death. One can make terrible mistakes when it comes to love, you know.\u201d</p><p>Jem ground his teeth. The last thing he needed was a lecture from someone famous for spawning illegitimate children. \u201cYou are an unlikely font of such wisdom,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more. I have never been in love with a woman, for example.\u201d</p> <p>Jem looked at him startled.</p><p>\u201cNo, nor yet a man,\u201d Villiers said, shaking his head. \u201cBut I have loved. Here and there, here and there. I know the worth of the emotion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI loved Sally,\u201d Jem said.</p><p>But Villiers had known him for years, since those long-ago days, and he said nothing.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I didn\u2019t love her in the same way. But Harriet is a duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe established that.\u201d Villiers pushed his small glass of claret toward Jem with one finger. \u201cHere. I haven\u2019t touched it.\u201d</p><p>Jem looked at his own empty glass and picked up Villiers\u2019s, cradling it in his hand. \u201cShe is a good woman. A decent woman. She said the Game would have to stop, and I\u2019d have to follow her. But she has no idea. She knows nothing of my family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPesky things, families.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy reputation would ruin her. She\u2019d come to hate me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you are saying that I must give up the chance of falling in love as well?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you?\u201d Jem tossed back the claret.</p><p>\u201cOh, I do have some children out of wedlock, you know. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat, only the daughter that you\u2019ve tended so carefully? It shows a shockingly conservative turn of mind, Strange.\u201d</p><p>Jem snorted.</p><p>\u201cI suppose you are saying that due to my notorious lack of interest in my illegitimate offspring, and my accompanying reputation, that I must never fall in love?\u201d Villiers\u2019s question was delicately barbed.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t follow. I can\u2019t\u2014the Game...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, the Game.\u201d Villiers glanced around the room. It smelled of urine, thanks to Oke, and the air was redolent of cheroot smoke. \u201cA charming tradition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve fixed the majority of my contracts here. I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, one can always use more substance,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI wonder how my estates keep multiplying when I give them so little attention.\u201d</p><p>Jem shot him a look of extreme dislike.</p><p>\u201cI would guess that Harriet does not care for the Graces, and the other ladies of their ilk.\u201d He raised a finger at a footman, who bounded forward and brought him another glass of claret.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that she disdains them,\u201d Jem said, taking another deep swallow of wine.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to breakfast with them? I must admit that Chloe\u2019s laughter was making me tetchy earlier this evening. That story she told at dinner, about the bishop and the champagne bath. Hardly in good taste, don\u2019t you think? Especially with those details\u2014it was his miter she was talking about, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>Jem took another swallow.</p><p>\u201cNo good woman has ever loved me,\u201d Villiers said, putting down his glass with a little ring. \u201cI was engaged, you know. Last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeautiful girl. She fell in love with the Earl of Gryffyn and dropped me. Do you know how I found out? Because she looked at him that way. There was a sort of look in her eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of look?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cI see it now and then.\u201d</p><p>Jem knew where Villiers had seen it. In Harriet\u2019s eyes, when she looked at him. \u201cI know Harriet loves me,\u201d he said roughly. \u201cBut it would ruin her life, don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd they always say that women are the more sacrificial sex,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHow touching all this recrimination is. I wish that Roberta had seen her way to such a sacrifice, but she went off and married Gryffyn anyway. I do believe they are most happy together.\u201d</p><p>Jem grunted.</p><p>\u201cI thought perhaps Miss Charlotte Tatlock might fall in love with me,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe paid me visits while I was ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, you sound like a pitifiul case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne thing about nearly dying is that you quite lose the wish to disguise your own weaknesses,\u201d Villiers observed.</p><p>Jem silently thanked God he was feeling healthy.</p><p>\u201cMiss Tatlock fell in love with my heir,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re cursed in love,\u201d Jem said. \u201cNext thing you\u2019re going to tell me that you have your eye on Harriet.\u201d</p><p>Villiers said nothing.</p><p>Jem felt a punishing heat rising in his chest. \u201cYou\u2019re joking, right?\u201d he said in a stifled voice.</p><p>\u201cNo one could not have his eye on Harriet,\u201d Villiers said, looking back to Jem. \u201cShe\u2019s utterly delicious, as you well know, especially in breeches. Do you know that she and I almost had an affaire once?\u201d</p><p>Jem thought he might vomit. He shook his head.</p><p>\u201cI approached her but she slapped me. She was married then, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you just said that Benjamin was one of your closest friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnnoying, isn\u2019t it? I just seem to have the kind of constitution that simply can\u2019t pay attention to the claims of friends. If you had a claim on Harriet, for instance, I would do my best. But of course,\u201d he added gently, \u201cyou haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Jem gave him a leaden-eyed look. \u201cStop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStop what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ham-handed attempts to manipulate me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Villiers said, sipping his wine. \u201cI must be losing my touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf\u2014if I go after Harriet it won\u2019t be because I\u2019m afraid that you\u2019ll snatch her up.

Luckily, I am used to the circumstance. Well, I must to bed. This has been an utterly charming conversation, Strange.\u201d He rose and bowed, magnificently.</p><p>\u201cJem,\u201d Strange said, looking up at him.</p><p>\u201cDear me. First names are so very intimate. In that case, my name is Leopold, but I\u2019ll thank you not to use it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d Jem said, trying the name out. \u201cIt suits you, in a emperor-ish type of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike it,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cYou must call me Jem. So much advice and delivered with such poisonous precision...we must be the best of friends.\u201d</p><p>Villiers paused for a moment, and a smile warmed his wintry eyes. \u201cIndeed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is my impression.\u201d</p><p>He turned with a swirl of his magnificent coat, and was gone.</p><p>Brouncker was sick in the corner.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-nine</p><p>The Origins of Paradise</p> <p>March 22, 1784</p><p>\u201cH arriet said I could visit her,\u201d Eugenia reported. \u201cI can, can\u2019t I, Papa? I know she has kittens in the barn, because she told me so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia climbed up onto his lap, and Jem\u2019s heart thumped when he felt how light she was still. \u201cDid you have a big lunch?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cStew,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cAnd a special egg that Cook made me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat was special about it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt has a very fancy cheese called fromage bleu mixed into it,\u201d Eugenia reported.</p><p>\u201cYou eat like a lady of eighty,\u201d Jem said, tightening his arm around her.</p> <p>\u201cI like fromage,\u201d Eugenia said, obviously relishing the sound of the French syllables on her tongue. \u201cI like Harry too. Or Harriet. I miss her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI miss her too.\u201d In fact, the pain of missing her was almost like a physical pain in his chest. He couldn\u2019t imagine how to get through yet another day.</p><p>\u201cI thought she might stay with us,\u201d Eugenia said.</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cI hoped she would too, poppet. But she\u2019s a duchess, and she had important things to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked her what they were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe kind of laughed, and said that people on her estate needed taking care of, the same as your people do. And that she had a very old dog, who would miss her. His name is Mrs. Custard.\u201d</p><p>Jem opened his mouth\u2014and shut it again.</p><p>Harriet had a very old dog waiting for her. She was going back to an empty house. It hit him like a brick in the head.</p><p>Eugenia was looking at him with concern. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Papa,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI\u2019ll never let you be all alone. When I grow up, I\u2019ll have a house and you can stay with me.\u201d</p><p>He was an idiot. He was beyond an idiot. He loved Harriet. And love meant that you didn\u2019t let someone go home to an empty house and an aging dog, even if she did turn out to be a duchess. And even if she was infuriating, and holier-than-thou.</p><p>And even if\u2014</p><p>He looked down at Eugenia and suddenly realized something so obvious that he couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t understood it before.</p><p>That pain in his heart, the one that was so deep it made his bones ache, that was his fault. He accused Harriet of lying. But in reality, he was the one who concealed who he was.</p><p>He was a fool, an idiot, a child who was unable to stop looking for his father\u2019s approval\u2014even when he knew his father was dead and immoral in the bargain.</p><p>Why else did he turn his house into his father\u2019s version of Paradise? Why wasn\u2019t he the sort of father he truly admired\u2014a father who created a house that was safe?</p><p>Because he wanted his father\u2019s approval...a man who was dead and gone, and before that, drunk and dissolute.</p><p>Eugenia was pulling at his sleeve. \u201cPapa, don\u2019t look so sad. I promise you can always live with me.\u201d</p><p>He buried his face in her hair. \u201cI know that, poppet. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry for what?\u201d Eugenia asked, snuggling close but, as always, logical.</p><p>\u201cSorry for not being a better father. For allowing a rat to bite you, and keeping you in the west wing so you wouldn\u2019t meet my guests.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault the rat came in from the cold, Papa. Goodness!\u201d</p><p>How could he have been so stupid as not to see the pattern of his life? Fonthill was designed and driven by his boyhood wishes. He wasn\u2019t ashamed of that deep, driving wish he always had that his sister\u2019s life hadn\u2019t been ruined by circumstances outside her control, that she had been able to marry and have babies, as she deserved. But he was ashamed that he took his guilt and love for her and allowed it to blind him to the kind of household in which he was raising his own child.</p><p>But he was even more ashamed of the way he allowed a boy\u2019s wish for his father\u2019s approval to linger and shape his life, even when as a man he understood his father\u2019s corrupt nature. The way his father\u2019s shallow, careless attitude toward women that had led to his only daughter\u2019s violation.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t give every woman in peril a safe harbor...and his father would never come back to life and recognize that Fonthill was his version of Paradise.</p><p>If Harriet would just take him back, he would never sit down at the Game again. And every brick in Fonthill could crumble to the ground, that blasted bordello of a tower included.</p><p>\u201cEugenia,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you think that perhaps if we went to Harriet\u2019s house, she might see us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course she would, Papa.\u201d</p><p>Despair plunged through him. She wanted a Jem who didn\u2019t even exist. \u201cWe can\u2019t just go fetch her,\u201d he said, thinking it through. \u201cWe have to move to her house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHarriet has kittens,\u201d Eugenia said, reasonably.</p><p>What if she wouldn\u2019t take him? How could she possibly take him\u2014and she, a duchess? With his house and his reputation and his habits and\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat will make Harriet very happy,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cI could tell she didn\u2019t want to leave me, Papa. She doesn\u2019t have a little girl of her own, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>Harriet had said that she loved him, there at the end. She\u2019d begged him, and he threw it back at her. She had given him the most precious gift in the world and he flung it at her feet.</p><p>Jem felt as if he had been hit on the head and suddenly started thinking rationally. He loved Harriet. And yet he\u2019d hurt her so much. If there was even a chance that she would take him back...</p><p>He would do anything for her. Sell the house, disperse the Game, say goodbye to the Graces...</p><p>All those things were easy compared to the possibility of living a lifetime without her.</p><p>Chapter Forty</p><p>Duchess By Day</p><p>March 30, 1784 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>T he Berrow estate was easily as grand as Fonthill.

They waited.</p> <p>After fifteen minutes, Eugenia got restless and started dancing around the drawing room. Jem was feeling sick. This was absurd. Likely Harriet had come back to her beautiful estate and realized what an idiot she had been ever to entertain the idea of marrying a loose fish like himself.</p><p>All of a sudden the door opened. The Duchess of Beaumont. And...the Duchess of Berrow. Two gorgeous women of the very highest rank, bedecked and bejeweled, dressed in silk and satin.</p><p>Jem called Eugenia to him and bowed.</p><p>Harriet was exquisite as a woman. Her hair was piled on her head, all the curls tamed. In a gown she was even more sensual than in breeches. Now she didn\u2019t have a cravat under her chin, but a gown that plunged in front to show creamy skin, her small waist...her gown\u2019s billowing skirts made him long to tip her over, uncover her secrets.</p><p>Her eyes met his with all the curious welcome one might give a mere acquaintance. \u201cLord Strange,\u201d she said, holding out a hand to be kissed. \u201cYou do me too much honor. I had not expected a visit at such short notice.\u201d Then she turned to Eugenia and gave her a true smile. And a true kiss.</p> <p>Eugenia leaned in and said something in Harriet\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Harriet said, and without a glance in his direction, she took Eugenia\u2019s hand and led her away. \u201cThe kittens are in the barn,\u201d she said, as she left.</p><p>The Duchess of Beaumont lingered. Jem stood in the center of the room.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Jem just looked at her. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve come for Harriet. You won\u2019t let her go.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t such a fool. I\u2019ll make her come back to the room.\u201d</p><p>He sat down and waited. And waited.</p><p>Presumably Harriet was exacting some sort of revenge. Or screwing up her courage. It didn\u2019t even make him angry. He felt a strange sense of peace. His whole life had been defined by degrees of dissipation. He had thwarted his father by never entering brothels\u2014but he certainly lived in his father\u2019s footsteps in other respects. Since the moment he turned fourteen he had flaunted himself and his life as debauched.</p><p>Harriet was the only person he\u2019d ever met who thought that he was worthy of a better place than a brothel. She was worth the demise of Fonthill.</p><p>So he waited.</p><p>Finally, after two hours, she walked into the drawing room and quietly closed the door, leaning back against it. \u201cEugenia is having a bath. She slipped into the horse\u2019s trough.\u201d</p><p>He came to his feet. She was fifty times more sensual, more delicious in a dress than in breeches. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you do,\u201d she replied, rather unexpectedly. But she didn\u2019t leap into his arms, the way she had in the stables. Instead she just stood there.</p><p>He thought desperately about what to say. \u201cI like your dress,\u201d he said. Her face looked duchesslike. Polite. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like having your hair up in the air like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meet with Judge Truder this morning and we heard outstanding cases.\u201d</p><p>His mouth snapped shut.</p><p>\u201cThe duchy\u2019s administrative powers are exceeded by those of the government, of course,\u201d she said, standing ramrod straight, every inch a duchess. And a judge. \u201cAs you know.\u201d</p><p>He fumbled, trying to think how to start. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean the things I said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite all right,\u201d she said, with a cool incline of her head. \u201cI entirely understand. In the heat of the moment one often makes rash comments. I shan\u2019t give them a second thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m apologizing for,\u201d he said, watching her closely.</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered and he knew she wasn\u2019t as calm as she was pretending.</p><p>\u201cI assume that you were referring to the rather wounding things you said after I disclosed my rank,\u201d she said. \u201cBelieve me, I do not remember them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI remember every word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ignoring the horrid things you said because you are an ignorant fool.\u201d She said it with great precision.</p><p>\u201cI am. I am, Harriet, I really am.\u201d</p><p>She looked away.</p><p>He had to tell her everything. And then she would still have a hundred reasons to throw him out, but he would have tried. So he dropped to his knees, because when a man really wants to beg...</p><p>That\u2019s how he does it.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d she said, frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cI must.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth trembled and then straightened into a firm line. \u201cVery well.\u201d She folded her hands.</p><p>The floor was very hard under his knees, and her face was even harder. He knew, he knew in his heart that it wouldn\u2019t work. She didn\u2019t love him any longer.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I loved you, not really. Men just don\u2019t think that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cBecause your husband didn\u2019t really love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou already established that,\u201d she said. \u201cRight around the same few moments when you pointed out how unattractive I was as a woman, and how stupid I was to think I could get away with calling myself Mr. Cope.\u201d</p><p>Jem\u2019s heart twisted with the pain of it. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean those things.\u201d Then he couldn\u2019t stay on his knees any longer, even though that\u2019s where a man was supposed to be. He leapt to his feet and brought her hands to his lips. \u201cI was furious that you were a duchess. You suddenly moved out of my reach\u2014out of anyone\u2019s reach. I couldn\u2019t bear it. All the time I was thinking\u2014do you know?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>\u201cThat I would never have you. I knew how much every man at that party would have lusted after you, if they knew you were female. And they were able to go off to London and court you, without my reputation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thought I would fall into marriage with the next man I saw?\u201d She looked at him more with curiosity than anything else.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d he said jerkily, not letting her draw her hands away. \u201cI had one image of you in bed with someone else, and I lashed out at you. But God, Harriet, you\u2019re so beautiful. In a dress, in breeches, in just your skin. Any man under God\u2019s sky would wish to make love to you.\u201d</p><p>She managed to pull her hands away. \u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her and he loved her so much that the words piled up in his chest and couldn\u2019t come out. Not in the right order.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that I love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I do,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t believe that you really want to be with me. With me, Harriet. I\u2019m just a boring widow, you know. I wore black for a whole year. I never met a courtesan before I entered your house, and while I found it interesting, I\u2019m not enamored of the experience. I\u2019m boring, Jem, and you\u2019re not.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI sent everyone away. The Graces, the guests, everyone.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re tearing down the tower this week.\u201d</p><p>He had her hands again, was kissing them and trying to tell her all the things he couldn\u2019t put into words. \u201cI told them to tear down the tower, and Eugenia will tell you, I found a governess. Eugenia hates her.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time, Harriet felt a gleam of hope. \u201cWhat\u2019s she like?\u201d she asked cautiously.</p><p>\u201cShe has a remarkable figure. I can\u2019t hardly describe it other than saying that it goes out in the front as much as it goes out in the back. She wears black in honor of her husband. He\u2019s been gone a few years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwenty-six. I can\u2019t think about anything but you, Harriet. You left, and there was no point to the Game anymore. I had no interest in riding. I found myself walking up and down that damn picture gallery four times a day. I dreamed only of you.\u201d He pulled her close again and caught her lips in the most passionate kiss she\u2019d ever experienced.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be feeling this alone,\u201d he said, voice low. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that, Harriet. I never felt like this before. Sally and I\u2014we laughed. We were like children together. She never scolded me, or noticed what my faults were. She never made love to me the way you did.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet smiled.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t have made love to her the way I make love to you,\u201d he said, cupping her face in his hands. \u201cSomething happened since we made love in the barn. I can\u2019t stop thinking about you. I meant to leave you alone. You\u2019re a duchess, for God\u2019s sake. My family and my reputation are equally black. You do realize that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>The truth of it must have been in her voice because he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know the worst of it yet,\u201d but something eased in his eyes.</p><p>She was tempted to kiss him, but she made herself pull away and sit on the sofa.</p><p>He stayed there, a bewildered-looking man, with his dear lean face and a dark glower that made him look like a gypsy king.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if you miss all your friends?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe problem is that you shouldn\u2019t have to give up all your friends just to be with me. And someday\u2014\u201d she wrapped her hands in her skirts so they wouldn\u2019t tremble \u201c\u2014someday you\u2019ll be tired of me and you\u2019ll miss the Game.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her, his eyes dark blue and clear. \u201cDo you think that I will ever get tired of Eugenia?\u201d</p><p>A little snort escaped her.</p><p>\u201cThen why would you think I\u2019d get tired of you?\u201d He didn\u2019t sound challenging, just interested, the way he always was when there was a question of logic involved. \u201cI love you, Harriet. Love is not something that comes easily to me.\u201d</p><p>Her smile was wobbling.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to love you. Especially when I thought you were a man. And even more when I knew you were a duchess.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cBut there we are. I tried to cut you out of my heart, but I love you. How can I let you go? It\u2019s the same question I had with Eugenia, so be warned. I never could send her to school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to keep me locked in the west wing?\u201d</p><p>He walked one step and looked down at her. The look in his eyes...</p> <p>\u201cI think the west wing is too large for you. I\u2019m thinking more about just one chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she whispered. It was almost too much to take in. He did love her, plain widowed Harriet. He loved her.</p><p>And she knew Jem. He would never let her go.</p><p>He reached down to her at the precise same moment she flew to him. They kissed for...Harriet didn\u2019t know how long. They were talking to each other silently. Once she broke it off, only to whisper, \u201cYou\u2019ll never leave me, will you?\u201d</p><p>He knew what she was saying, and kissed her again before murmuring, \u201cI gave up the Game and it was never that important to me. What happened to Benjamin will never happen to me. Never. I\u2019m staying with you, wherever you are, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen my nephew is old enough, he\u2019ll take back this estate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy that point, we\u2019ll have Fonthill shaped into a perfect habitation for a duchess,\u201d he said promptly.</p><p>\u201cNot a duchess,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLady Strange.\u201d</p><p>He started kissing her again, and only stopped to say foolish things about how they\u2019d be together until they were both eighty-five years old, and her hair was white as snow, and she was a toothless crone...</p><p>She had to kiss him to make him stop.</p><p>Chapter Forty-one</p><p>A Chapter of Revelations...of Fathers and Brothels</p><p>T hey had tucked Eugenia into bed together, only to discover a dismal meowing noise coming from under her covers. The kitten was rescued and taken back to his mother. Then Harriet thought to lift up the cover again and discovered an unfortunate accident involving that kitten.</p><p>After the maids had come and gone, Jem whirled her against the wall in the corridor.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do it without you,\u201d he said, his voice husky.</p><p>\u201cYes, you could, and you have,\u201d she said, not bothering to pretend she didn\u2019t know what he was referring to. It felt as if she might be answering his unspoken thoughts the rest of her life. \u201cYou\u2019re a wonderful father.\u201d</p><p>But he shook his head. \u201cI need you. I don\u2019t think about rats and cat piss and falling towers. I didn\u2019t\u2014I didn\u2019t have much of a father, and I think that\u2019s why I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d</p><p>He wouldn\u2019t tell her anything more, and it wasn\u2019t until the middle of the night, when he was lying on the bed, his chest still heaving, that Harriet propped herself up on one elbow and said, \u201cI want to know why you were so angry when you found me in the stables with Nick.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes, shutting her away, but she had one great fear and wanted to say it. \u201cDid someone harm you when you were a boy?\u201d she asked quietly.</p><p>His eyes snapped open. \u201cThank God, no.\u201d</p><p>She waited.</p><p>\u201cBut it could have happened. Anyone with a story and a joke was welcome to our house. Sometimes they would stay for weeks, and my father thought it was all great fun. We were the lucky ones, he would say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you live at Fonthill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, we lived in Lincolnshire. One of those men was a hell-hound by the name of Sattaway. My sister was thirteen. Perhaps twelve. I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no!\u201d Harriet cried.</p><p>\u201cHe left after a few weeks but it was too late. She bore a child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe child died because he had given her syphilis. A disease.\u201d</p><p>Harriet swallowed. Jem didn\u2019t say anything else. \u201cAnd after that she was kidnapped by a different man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid she die soon after?\u201d Harriet finally ventured.</p><p>\u201cOh, no. She\u2019s not dead.\u201d</p><p>She put her head on his chest, but he just kept stroking her hair. \u201cYou really may not wish to marry me,\u201d he said finally. \u201cAnd\u2014\u201d</p><p>She reared up her head. \u201cYou\u2019d let me walk away?\u201d</p><p>There was a smile in his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m a reprobate to do this to you.\u201d</p><p>She rolled over on top of him, as if he were a mattress. \u201cYou are everything to me, Jem Strange. Don\u2019t you dare try to send me away again. Ever.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy sister owns a small, quite select brothel in Belfast, Antrim County, Ireland. She\u2019s quite happy, or so she says in letters. It\u2019s called the Ladybird,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cThe Ladybird!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry I reacted so badly when you labeled my guests ladybirds. They are, of course.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stayed quite still for a moment as the truth of Jem\u2019s life became clear to her. \u201cHow could you not include them?\u201d she said fiercely. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand. You are a wonderful man, do you know that? I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d</p> <p>His mouth twisted. \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be proud of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have never turned away a woman who reminded you of your sister, did you?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs your father alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to say that he died of parental guilt?\u201d The twist to his mouth made Harriet\u2019s throat burn. \u201cHe died four years ago, after drinking too much and deciding to prove that he could walk along the top of the stone fence that surrounded his kitchen garden in Bath. He couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She kissed him again.</p><p>\u201cBut I realized after you left that I created Fonthill for him...It was he who told me, my whole childhood, that a house full of loose women, a brothel, is a man\u2019s paradise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou created the house, but you never took advantage of that aspect of it,\u201d Harriet said slowly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable taking advantage of women who must trade their favors for their next meal.\u201d</p><p>Harriet put her head back down on his chest and listened to the steady beat of his heart. \u201cWe can still help women in distress,\u201d she said. \u201cIn every way possible. Just perhaps not in our very house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter you left, I realized that Fonthill had virtually become a brothel. I have a brothel. I who never willingly entered a brothel, not since my father forced me into my first one at age thirteen.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFonthill is not a brothel,\u201d Harriet said.</p><p>\u201cClose enough.\u201d His voice was bleak.</p><p>\u201cNot,\u201d she said firmly, sitting up so she could look in his eyes. \u201cYour sister runs a brothel. You do not. You had a wonderful, exuberant house party to which you invited all sorts of people, from scientists to singers. And if some of them found friendships under your roof, you never profited from that. They did.\u201d</p><p>He was silent.</p><p>\u201cThe Game was not dependent on female entertainment,\u201d she said gently.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a damned poor bargain, Harriet,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even speak: her heart was too full. \u201cYou are\u2014\u201d she swallowed \u201c\u2014mine. At the heart I\u2019m a tedious country widow.\u201d</p><p>He rolled over so fast that her words disappeared into his lips. \u201cYou are my Harriet, the most intelligent, funny, wise soul I have ever met. And, though it hardly matters, the one person who has ever driven me utterly mad with lust for your beauty.\u201d</p> <p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling up at him. \u201cDo you want a similar catalogue?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t care about any of that, if you think\u2014\u201d But he couldn\u2019t put it in words.</p><p>\u201cYou are everything to me,\u201d she whispered, tears in her eyes. \u201cI love every bit of you, from the wrinkles by your eyes, to your crazed architectural plans, to your generosity and your sweetness. You are a wonderful father, who never dishonored your own father by disowning his idea of paradise\u2014and yet you kept Eugenia warm and safe and loved. You welcome every woman with your sister\u2019s background, and yet you never took advantage of them. How could I not love you, Jem?\u201d</p><p>She was crying now, and he was kissing her. But he had something to say too, so he made her stop crying and listen to him.</p><p>\u201cBenjamin was a fool, Harriet. A fool. I\u2019ve never met another woman with your joy, your beauty, and your sensuality. But what I love most is your deep-down sense of fairness, the clear judgment that allows you to see people as they are, whether they are criminals or fools like myself, Villiers or Nell...\u201d</p><p>There didn\u2019t really seem to be much else to be said.</p><p>So they talked with their hands. And their lips.</p><p>And finally, with the greatest gift of all. With their bodies.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>E ugenia Strange\u2019s arm was starting to tire. Her little brother was much heavier than he looked. He was lolling back in her arm now, looking as if he were about to fall into his nap and yet he never seemed to actually do it. It was awfully frustrating.</p><p>Sure enough, the moment she stopped walking he opened his eyes and smiled gummily at her. Colin had his mother\u2019s velvety brown eyes. Since he was wearing a little blue shirt, they had a tinge of violet.</p><p>\u201cAll the ladies are going to be in love with you,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He sighed and closed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Eugenia said. \u201cIt is a bit tiresome, all this adoration.\u201d For example, she happened to know that right now there were eight gentlemen in the drawing room. Povy kept popping his head into the nursery and holding up his fingers silently to give her the new count.</p><p>But she hadn\u2019t met a single man in London who could entice her away from Colin. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you nap?\u201d she sang to him. \u201cOh, why won\u2019t you nap?\u201d</p><p>The door opened and she turned, thinking that it would be Povy, perhaps holding up all his fingers. But it was her papa.</p><p>He looked tired but happy, bone happy. Eugenia had the feeling that her darling, adored stepmother must have made the most of the hour since they disappeared after luncheon. Not that she noticed where they were going, of course.</p><p>\u201cYou never napped either,\u201d her papa remarked, stolling into the room. \u201cYou were an awful infant.\u201d</p><p>Eugenia snorted. \u201cAnd how would you know, Lord Strange? Since you spent my childhood racketing around a house full of gorgeous courtesans and mongrelly men?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMongrelly men?\u201d he said. \u201cHere, let me have that baby.\u201d Colin had stuck his head up and was making cooing, gurgling noises at the sound of his father\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cI was just getting him to sleep,\u201d Eugenia complained, handing him over.</p><p>\u201cYou look very fine to be in the nursery,\u201d her father said, looking her up and down. \u201cNew gown? And not to be indelicate, my daughter, but you are wearing something under it, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Eugenia turned up her nose. \u201cThis is Madame Car\u00eame\u2019s very finest new creation, Papa, and I\u2019ll thank you not to insult it. Or ask questions that don\u2019t concern you.\u201d But she smiled down at her gorgeous morning gown. It was made of the finest silk taffeta. It fell straight from her breasts and then frothed into an enchanting little ruffle at the bottom.</p><p>\u201cWell, go on then,\u201d her papa said. \u201cAll those gentlemen downstairs aren\u2019t here to see me, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be,\u201d Eugenia said, checking her reflection in the nursery mirror.</p><p>Her father snorted.</p><p>\u201cThey would love to snuggle up to the newest marquis in London,\u201d she said.</p><p>But her father wasn\u2019t listening to her. He was humming to Colin, and rocking his arms in a way that Eugenia almost felt she could remember in her bones. She went over to him and put her head on his shoulder. \u201cI love you, Papa.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou too, sweetheart,\u201d he said. \u201cYou too.\u201d</p><p>And then she went out of the door, knowing exactly why she didn\u2019t care about all those gentlemen down in the drawing room. Because not a one of them was a scrap on her papa, that\u2019s why.</p><p>She met Harriet coming down the corridor. Her beloved, sweet-faced stepmother didn\u2019t look nearly as tired as her papa. In fact, she had a sort of glow about her that made Eugenia secretly grin.</p><p>\u201cI think Papa is finally getting Colin to sleep,\u201d Eugenia whispered. \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite manage it. I was about to give up and call for his nurse.\u201d</p> <p>Harriet fluttered her hand toward the drawing room. \u201cThere\u2019s twelve of them in there now,\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>Eugenia groaned, but turned and sauntered down the stairs.</p><p>Harriet smiled, watching her go. Her awkward, big-nosed child had turned into the most ravishing girl to debut on the ton in years. She had all the eligible gentlemen\u2014and most of the ineligible ones\u2014at her knees, if not her feet. Not that Eugenia gave a damn.</p><p>Jem looked up from the crib where he was just putting down Colin.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a miracle,\u201d Harriet said softly. Colin gave a little snore and turned over. She looked down at him. \u201cHe\u2019s so beautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>Jem caught her in his arms. \u201cNot as beautiful as you. He takes after his father. I can already see the wrinkles starting by his eyes.\u201d</p><p>Lovingly Harriet pushed back the hair from his laughing eyes. Her body still tingled from the pleasure they\u2019d shared and she knew that he still felt it too. \u201cRemember when I first met you? I thought you were the most beautiful man I\u2019d ever seen, and since I arrived at your house with Villiers, that was really saying something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy first thought was that if Villiers had any idea of switching sides and seducing you, I\u2019d kill him first. I should have known from that moment. I\u2019ve never given a damn where men find their pleasure, and suddenly I was like a dog with a bone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA very strange bone,\u201d Harriet laughed.</p><p>He nuzzled her. \u201cI must say, I am glad that you\u2019ve given up your breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hard once I realized that everything I learned in breeches I could simply employ in my gowns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cStill, you never sit quietly as ladies are wont to do, during dinner conversation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re the most bruising rider in five counties, although no one knows that the duchess goes forth at twilight scandalously clad in breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not forget the fact that I took you in our last two rapier matches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo more,\u201d he whispered, his hand rounded on her belly. \u201cNo more riding and no more rapiers, Harriet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot for a while.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you suppose this baby came from?\u201d he said wonderingly.</p><p>\u201cThe usual places.\u201d He loved her laugh.</p> <p>\u201cBut we were married for years without children. And then Colin, and now\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think I could.\u201d</p><p>Under his hand was just the smallest flutter of life. \u201cI never used to cry, not a single damp eye, before I met you,\u201d he said accusingly.</p><p>She kissed him until he didn\u2019t feel sentimental anymore, just hungry. But he didn\u2019t want to wear Harriet out, so he didn\u2019t follow that kiss to its natural conclusion.</p><p>\u201cPovy told me that a letter arrived from your sister,\u201d Harriet told him. \u201cI think she is happy in London, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cShe loves being a matron at Magdalen House...the way she talks about the head of the Metropolitan Police. Do you think, Harriet? Perhaps?\u201d</p><p>Harriet grinned. \u201cShe\u2019ll be lucky if he doesn\u2019t arrest her. The letter I had last week described two young women whom she stole out of a brothel, as best I could understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not always prudent about her own safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe told me she carries a knife in each boot,\u201d Harriet said, running her hand along his cheek. \u201cI expect Eugenia to start carrying weapons any moment. She adores your sister, you know.\u201d</p><p>He was silent for a moment. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have imagined our life when I first met you in those breeches.\u201d</p><p>Harriet stretched. Her body was ripe with happiness. Pregnancy didn\u2019t make her cantankerous or nauseated. Instead she was singing with happiness. \u201cI ruined you. There you were, happy as a louse in the queen\u2019s mattress, surrounded by concubines and courtesans and actresses...\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd having nothing to do with any of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were waiting for me,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, someone to wear the breeches in the family.\u201d She looked up at him, but he was laughing.</p><p>Silently, of course. </p> </body></html>"]
