So much for thinking she wouldn\u2019t make a scene if she told her somewhere public.</p><p>\u201cWill you please keep it down, sis; I don\u2019t want everyone in here knowing my business.\u201d</p> <p>Suzy flicked her hand as if she didn\u2019t care, but thankfully lowered her voice as she asked, \u201cHow can you be pregnant? You actually have to have sex to get pregnant, and you aren\u2019t seeing anyone. Oh, God, you didn\u2019t get frozen sperm, did you?\u201d</p><p>If she wasn\u2019t so mortified by this conversation, Beth would have laughed at the question. \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t artificially inseminated so I obviously had sex. I know this is somewhat of a shock to you, but I had sex!\u201d</p><p>Now it was Suzy looking around as Beth belatedly realized her last sentence seemed to echo off the walls of the restaurant. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s talk about this rationally. Who is the bastard and where can I find him? He took advantage of you, and now he\u2019ll suffer the consequences. Has he even offered to step up and take responsibility?\u201d</p><p>Beth rolled her eyes and wondered if her sister was going to challenge the father of her baby to a duel next. For such a modern woman, her sister was freaking out more than she\u2019d have thought. Clearing her throat, Beth admitted, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know yet. I . . . haven\u2019t told him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, when are you planning on telling the man, when the kid is in college?\u201d Suzy sat before Beth with fire flashing in her eyes. Her red hair was pulled back in a French knot and, as usual, she was on the cutting-edge style-wise. Beth always felt frumpy around her. As a former fatty, she never felt comfortable in her new, smaller clothes. She\u2019d lost over a hundred pounds several years ago, and even though the mirror showed her one thing, she always saw her old self staring back at her. Suzy had gotten her red hair from their mother, and Beth was stuck with their father\u2019s unremarkable brown hair. Suzy was on the tall side and Beth was on the petite side. She\u2019d always thought she\u2019d missed out on the best family genes for sure. Realizing that her sister was staring her down, she took a breath and dove back into the fray.</p> <p>\u201cI just found out, sis, so I haven\u2019t had time to make a lot of plans. I\u2019m trying to come to grips with it myself. I took a home pregnancy test last week and then had a blood test with my doctor. I got those results this morning. I\u2019m pregnant. I have my first appointment in two weeks.</p><p>\u201cGeez, you would think I\u2019d told you I only had a month to live or something. Freak out much?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t mess with me, girl. I have the parents on speed dial. I can only imagine the horror of having this talk with them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d Beth whispered.</p><p>Suzy pretended to study her fingernails. \u201cOrdinarily I wouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m gonna need something to work with here. So, you either start talking, or I\u2019m going to pull our brilliant parents from whatever laboratory they\u2019re in and tell them all about their wayward child. \u2018Oh God, the shame, the disappointment, the heartache,\u2019\u201d Suzy finished dramatically.</p><p>\u201cYou suck,\u201d Beth grumbled. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ll tell you, but you have to promise me you won\u2019t overreact. I mean it, Suzy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho me? I never overreact.\u201d</p><p>With a snort, Beth took a deep breath and prepared herself. She knew from experience that her sister would release hell on her when she learned what had been happening behind her back. Maybe her friend Ella was right, this might have been a very, very bad idea, but there was no turning back now.</p><p>\u201cI met someone about six months ago. Before you ask\u2014no, we haven\u2019t been dating this whole time. I kind of despised him at first, but God, sis, I wanted him. He makes me feel unbelievable things. He is the first man that sends me up in flames every time I see him. Just one look from him and I\u2019m ready to rip all my clothes off and let him do whatever he wants to with me.\u201d</p><p>Suzy was staring at her in shock.</p><p>Beth left her in silence for a minute and then prodded her with her hand.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I get the whole urge-to-bang thing, but let\u2019s speed forward to the baby daddy\u2019s name. Crap, six months? Is it someone at Danvers?\u201d</p><p>Suzy felt like she\u2019d landed in the twilight zone. How could she not know her sister was seeing someone? Hell, not just seeing him, sleeping with him. Maybe she\u2019d been so wrapped up in Gray that she hadn\u2019t noticed things that she normally would.</p><p>Shit! Suzy could tell by the guilty expression on Beth\u2019s face that it was indeed someone that they worked with. Damn! She\u2019d thought the pregnancy thing was the biggest shock she was going to get, but the dreamy look that came over Beth\u2019s face as she talked about the guy was pretty close. She\u2019d never seen her like this. Beth had never been one to date very much and she certainly had never been so completely crazy over a man before. This guy better be on the up-and-up or his days were going to be numbered.</p> <p>Suzy took a deep, calming breath and studied her sister. She didn\u2019t look freaked out; she actually kind of had a glow about her. \u201cI never see you with anyone but Ella or Nick. Crap, they probably already know, don\u2019t they? Am I always the last one to know everything?\u201d</p><p>Beth had been working for Danvers International for about six months now as Suzy\u2019s assistant, ever since losing her job as an elementary school teacher due to budget cuts. Suzy handled event planning at Danvers and was engaged to Grayson Merimon, whom she had met a year ago when Danvers International merged with his company, Mericom, and created the largest communications company in the United States. They were both happy with the arrangement right now, and neither of them was ready to make a change.</p><p>She ran through her mind, trying to remember if Beth had been talking to anyone there more frequently than usual. \u201cAll right, I\u2019ve got nothing. I\u2019ll give you credit, you can sneak around with the best of them because I\u2019m totally clueless.\u201d</p><p>From Beth\u2019s expression, Suzy could tell she was debating the wisdom of revealing the father of her baby. Her options to force her to talk were limited, unfortunately. Since Beth had driven them, she would simply refuse to take Suzy home until she calmed down.</p><p>How much of a scene would she make in a restaurant? Beth wondered. Just spit it out. I\u2019m sure she will be happy. After all, you\u2019re keeping it in the family. She might be surprised, but she\u2019ll be happy for you. Just do it fast, like ripping off a Band-Aid.</p><p>\u201cOkay, um . . . It\u2019s Nick.\u201d</p><p>Suzy threw her head back and started laughing.</p><p>Wow, she sure was taking this well. Beth laughed along with her, relieved that Suzy didn\u2019t seem to be upset over her involvement with Nick.</p><p>Suzy wiped her eyes, still smiling. \u201cOkay, sis, enough delaying. Spill the name already.\u201d</p><p>Oh, crap, I should have known it wasn\u2019t going to go that well. \u201cSuzy, I\u2019m serious, it\u2019s Nick. We\u2019ve been seeing each other since we were both living with you after your accident. I mean, not immediately, but after a few weeks. It just happened. One minute I hated him and the next minute we were on the kitchen counter naked.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, please stop! Tell me you\u2019re kidding? How can you possibly be sleeping with Nick? He\u2019s like our brother. That little shit. I should have known he couldn\u2019t be trusted to keep his pants on. He seduced you, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Beth grimaced as she took in her sister\u2019s glowing red face. \u201cSuzy, I\u2019m not a kid, and it\u2019s not his fault. Honestly, I practically ripped his clothes off.\u201d</p><p>Suzy was starting to feel light-headed. Why hadn\u2019t she suspected anything? Nick was around a lot. Where you saw Beth, he was normally close behind. Never once though had she thought anything of it. She had just been glad that they were getting along better. Ugh, she had forced them together at every turn, trying to keep the peace. Oh, God, I\u2019m her pimp. I have been setting my sister up for sex with my future brother-in-law. I\u2019ve done everything but pay the man to do my sister.</p><p>\u201cGet your stuff; we\u2019re going back to my place. I want to hear all about this, but I need to be drunk first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu\u2014 But Gray will be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes he know about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I promise you, he doesn\u2019t know anything. Ella is the only other person who knows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust me, if Gray\u2019s home, he will make himself scarce when he sees my face. Now, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d</p><p>The silence in the car during the drive to Suzy\u2019s house was broken only by an occasional groan from her. Beth decided to stay quiet and let her come to terms with it on the way. It wasn\u2019t like she was doing much better. She still had a hard time believing that she was sleeping with someone like Nick. Never in her wildest dreams could she have imagined a man like him being interested in her. She had never been comfortable with her body, even though she was a normal size now, maybe even smaller than average for her height. Yet when Nick looked at her, she felt beautiful. Even when she tried to hide her body from him, he refused to let her. He had kissed every inch of her, and the desire in his eyes said that he didn\u2019t see any of the flaws that she did. Maybe he just needs glasses or he has secretly longed for a fluffy girl to cushion his hard contours.</p><p>Beth had no idea how Nick would react to the news of her surprise pregnancy. Everything about their relationship was casual. They did spend almost every night together, but there was never any talk of feelings. For all she knew, he was still fitting in dates with other women when he could. She wasn\u2019t sure what her feelings were for him, either. If she let herself, she would probably fall madly in love with him. The only thing that stopped her was the certainty that men like Nick didn\u2019t end up with girls like her.</p><p>He was a rich, sexy, handsome man with a killer personality. Everyone loved him. When he walked into a room, it lit up with his presence. Things were just better when he was around. Beth, on the other hand, knew she was just average at best. Some might consider her attractive, but she was far from model material, and those were the kinds of women Nick was probably used to dating. She couldn\u2019t work out what he could possibly see in her besides maybe the excitement of sneaking around? Boy, there had been plenty of that. They\u2019d had hot, furious sex all over Suzy\u2019s new home. Beth chuckled; her sister would croak if she knew that.</p><p>\u201cAll right, stop with the laughing. I can well imagine what\u2019s running through your mind, so please stop unless you want me to upchuck right here in your precious VW Bug.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s BMW was sitting in the garage beside Suzy\u2019s SUV when they pulled in. \u201cI\u2019m not talking in front of him. So unless he goes, I go.\u201d</p><p>Suzy snorted and marched toward the door. \u201cTrust me, I got this.\u201d When Suzy threw open the door to the beach house that she shared with her fianc\u00e9, she looked around as if moving in for the kill. When Gray picked that particular moment to walk in from the patio, Beth almost felt sorry for him. A smile lit up his face as he walked toward her sister, the love he felt for her evident in the intimate look in his eyes. As he leaned in for a kiss, Suzy put out a hand and stiff-armed him. \u201cWhoooa, that\u2019s close enough, slick.\u201d</p><p>Any other man would be confused by such a statement, but Gray seemed to take it all in stride. \u201cGood evening, Beth.\u201d When she smiled weakly at him, he turned back to Suzy. \u201cAh, baby, it would appear that I\u2019m in the doghouse again. We could save time if you just tell me what I\u2019m guilty of.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re guilty of having a horny brother who lowered his zipper in the wrong place this time!\u201d</p><p>Beth could see the instant Gray looked at her and made the connection. \u201cOh, hell. I\u2019ll kill him,\u201d Gray sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t have to; I\u2019m going to stick my foot so far up his ass, he may never walk right again.\u201d</p><p>Beth looked back and forth between her sister and Gray as they each threatened bodily harm to Nick in turn. This was really absurd. Nick hadn\u2019t seduced some teenager; she was an adult, fast approaching thirty. What did it say about her that they thought she was this easily led astray? Poor fat Beth, she has to be protected from evil Nick. Show the big girl some attention and she loses her head.</p><p>Screw this, she had had enough.</p><p>\u201cStop! My God, do you hear yourselves? Nick hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Let me tell you\u2014I wanted him. Hell, I still want him. I like sex; actually I love sex! Nick tried to be a gentleman and walk away after our first kiss, but you know what? I grabbed him and crammed my tongue down his throat and ripped the buttons off his shirt right in your kitchen. I have been fully willing and eager every time we have had sex and, believe me, we\u2019ve had plenty. I\u2019m enjoying myself and when I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll walk away.\u201d</p><p>When Beth paused to take a breath, she saw the stunned expressions on Suzy\u2019s and Gray\u2019s faces. Okay, possibly she might have gone a bit too far in her defense of Nick. Maybe a simple sentence letting them know it had been consensual would have been better than, \u201cHey, I\u2019m a slut.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUm, I think I\u2019ll go upstairs to my office. You know, take care of a few things. I\u2019m sure you two would like some privacy.\u201d Gray left the room as fast as his Italian loafers would carry him.</p><p>Great, I\u2019ll never be able to look him in the eyes again. Every time he goes in his kitchen, he\u2019s going to imagine me ripping his brother\u2019s clothes off against his granite countertops.</p><p>Suzy pointed her to the couch in the living room before she walked into the kitchen. Moments later, she returned with a bottle of wine, orange juice, and two glasses. She motioned for Beth to be quiet until she had filled her glass to the rim and then proceeded to drain half of it. Taking a deep breath, she said, \u201cAll right, start at the beginning and feel free to gloss over any parts that you know will make me want to puke.\u201d</p><p>Beth picked up the glass of juice that Suzy had poured for her and took a sip while trying to decide where to begin. Well, heck, if she wanted the whole story, then that was what she would get.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Six Months Earlier</p><p>Beth stood in the waiting room of the hospital with Claire and Jason. Her sister had been injured in an accident and Beth was waiting to see her. She was talking to Claire when a drop-dead gorgeous man strolled through the emergency room doors. Immediately the eyes of every woman\u2014hers included\u2014were riveted to him, or more specifically, to his butt. She was surprised when Jason said, \u201cHey, Nick, over here, man.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Hunk flashed a blinding smile that would do Colgate proud and swaggered over to where they were standing. He shook hands with Jason and then pulled Claire in for a hug. When those blue eyes landed on her, she had the urge to step behind the ficus tree beside her and try to blend into the scenery.</p><p>Jason stepped forward to make the introductions. \u201cBeth, have you met Gray\u2019s brother, Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no, I haven\u2019t.\u201d She cringed as Nick extended his hand. He was so attractive she was almost hesitant to touch the man. Reluctantly, she placed her hand in his and was surprised to feel a bolt of heat race through her. She instinctively pulled her hand back quickly, making his eyebrows arch in question at her.</p><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Beth. I\u2019ve heard only good things about your sister.\u201d She could feel her cheeks blushing furiously as he continued to study her.</p><p>Unable to bear his scrutiny another moment, Beth mumbled, \u201cI\u2019m going to see if they will let me back there to see her yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea, I\u2019ll walk with you,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>Well, damn, that didn\u2019t work out at all. Not only am I still stuck with him, he\u2019s right on my heels where he can\u2019t help but see every lump in my oversized butt. Mr. Perfect probably hasn\u2019t seen this much wiggle since his last bowl of Jell-O. She walked to the nurses\u2019 station and was told that Suzy had been moved to a room. She had hoped Nick would at least wait in the waiting room or the hallway, but no such luck; he was practically stuck to her back as she opened the door to her sister\u2019s room.</p><p>Another hot specimen of manhood was sitting at Suzy\u2019s bedside holding her hand. This must be Gray. Why in the world was Suzy trying to get rid of him? The man was hot with a capital H! This whole situation was becoming something of a nightmare for Beth. She had never felt that comfortable around the opposite sex, even though she was working on that particular issue, but to be in such a small room with not one, but two of the hottest guys she had ever met, well, it felt like pure hell. She resisted the urge to start tugging at the long dress she wore. Was it riding up? Did her back look fat? Did she have granny-panty lines? The list of insecurities seemed to go on and on. These were men who would have you panting one second, and then praying to God that they would never see you naked the next.</p><p>Gray smiled at her and stepped forward to introduce himself. Yes, of course his dental work was just as exceptional as his brother\u2019s. What had she expected really, buckteeth? She was extremely grateful when he stepped outside the room with his brother and left her alone with Suzy. I can really see why you would want to get away from that, sis. I mean, the man is just gross. His hair is too perfect and that body, I just hate it when men don\u2019t let themselves go. Where are his love handles? His five-hundred-dollar cologne is sickeningly seductive and that butt, ugh, please. Run while you can, the man is a toad.</p><p>Gray walked back into the room at that moment and she was relieved to see that Nick wasn\u2019t with him. After she made arrangements with Gray to come back the following morning, he insisted on walking her out to her car. Ugh, was she going to spend the rest of the evening with the Merimons trailing her down a hallway? When they reached her little red VW Bug, she found herself asking him about Nick. She wanted to clamp her hand over her mouth as soon as his name came out and she could see the surprise and possibly concern in Gray\u2019s eyes. When he told her that Nick was also going to be moving to Myrtle Beach, she felt her heart skip a beat. What was wrong with her? He was way out of her league. Maybe it was just wishful lusting.</p><p>After Suzy was released from the hospital, Beth was a frequent visitor to Gray\u2019s home where Suzy was to stay while she recovered. Suzy had a broken ankle and, since both Suzy and Beth lived on the upper floors of their buildings, Gray had insisted they stay with him. He wanted to keep Suzy close so he could monitor her recovery, and he invited Beth to make herself at home there as well, so she could help keep an eye on Suzy. At Gray\u2019s beautiful beachfront home, she ran into Nick daily and he always had some remark to make. He had taken to calling her \u201cprincess\u201d and she felt sure that he was only doing it to mock her. No matter how she snapped at him, it never seemed to hit the mark. He just laughed it off and an hour later he was back to picking on her again. She alternated between drooling over his hard body and wanting to strangle him with the kitchen towel.</p><p>Was she imagining the sexual tension that seemed to vibrate between them? Surely, it was only on her part. It had been a long time since she had been with anyone that didn\u2019t require batteries. Maybe it was time to go home, pop open the toy drawer, and release some tension.</p><p>Who would ever believe that the poor spinster sister would have one toy, much less a couple? Suzy would fall over in a dead faint if she found out. Not that Beth had any intention of ever talking about sexy toys with her sister. Of course, Suzy would probably be proud of her and present her with a coupon from somewhere like Vibrators-R-Us. Just because she wasn\u2019t having sex didn\u2019t mean she wouldn\u2019t like to. Weren\u2019t women supposed to be in their sexual prime around thirty? If that were true, it might be time to stock a case of Duracells for these hard times.</p><p>Before Beth really understood what was happening between them, she had suddenly started changing the way she dressed. She couldn\u2019t bear for Nick to see her in her frumpy wear. She tried to tell herself it was just so she wouldn\u2019t embarrass Suzy at the office, but a part of her knew it was so that Nick would look at her with something other than laughter for once.</p><p>One evening they had decided to have a barbecue at the beach house and invite their friends from Danvers. Claire, Jason, Ella, and Declan Stone, the new guy to their group, all attended that night. She had sat beside Nick at the patio table while they had dinner. She was wearing a sundress, a sexy red thong, and a matching bra that she had purchased at Victoria\u2019s Secret that day on a whim. She had to admit that she was feeling just a little naughty with such sexy undergarments. She was usually more of a Sears catalogue type of gal. Nick was wearing a pair of cargo shorts, so every time either of them shifted, their bare legs came into contact. After a while, she was starting to wonder if Nick was making sure that happened a lot more often than it should have.</p><p>By the time everyone left for the evening, she was feeling pretty hot and bothered. Had Nick missed a single opportunity to touch her during dinner? No doubt he thought it was pretty funny. Let\u2019s feel the fat girl up and give her the thrill of her life. Sadly, it probably was one of Beth\u2019s bigger thrills, at least in recent history. She was more than a little pissed at him when she stomped into the kitchen with the last of the dinner plates. When she saw him leaning against the counter drinking a beer, she wanted to stomp her feet and throw an honest-to-goodness tantrum. Couldn\u2019t she go anywhere that he wasn\u2019t in her face?</p> <p>Nick\u2019s mouth curved into a slow grin as he looked at her. \u201cHey, princess, need some help with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Beth snapped. She walked over, dropped the dishes loudly onto the counter beside the dishwasher, and started stacking them inside.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem, princess?\u201d</p><p>Beth slammed the last plate in the dishwasher and whirled around to confront him. He looked wary as she opened her mouth to blast him. To both of their surprise, instead of the tirade she had planned, she grabbed the front of his shirt and pulled him down to her while she raised herself on her toes. Just before she locked her mouth onto his, he whispered, \u201cPrincess?\u201d</p><p>Nick put down his beer with a sexy groan and wrapped his arms around her. Suddenly, his mouth took control of the kiss and his tongue entered her mouth as if he wanted to possess her. She moaned low in her throat, as he grabbed her butt cheeks to pull her closer. She had no idea how long they stood there, but she did know that she had never been kissed as Nick was kissing her. He sucked on her tongue, as if he couldn\u2019t get enough. Every stroke, every sip only made her burn hotter. He rocked his hips against hers in tempo with his tongue tangling with hers. Beth could feel him hard against her stomach and she wantonly rubbed against his length and felt a heady sense of power when he rumbled deep in his throat.</p><p>Abruptly, he lifted his head and pulled away from her, staggering backward as if drunk. He leaned against the counter, running a shaky hand through his hair. \u201cAh, hell, we can\u2019t do this, princess. Your sister and my brother will kill me. My God, you taste so good though. Shit!\u201d</p><p>Beth looked at him and for once decided to break all the rules. Tonight she wouldn\u2019t be denied\u2014the good girl was going bad and it was time for Nick to live up to his reputation. She smiled and gave him a predatory look as she stalked forward. His eyes were riveted to hers as she reached for the hem of his button-down shirt. With a mighty yank, buttons flew all over the kitchen and Nick\u2019s mouthwatering chest was laid naked before her hungry eyes. That wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as hot if those buttons hadn\u2019t given way. Thank God for poor sewing!</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes were nearly bugging out of the sockets by this point. \u201cFuck, Beth; screw it! I tried to be good, but I have got to have you now\u2014I can\u2019t stop again.\u201d</p><p>With those words, Nick reached down and grabbed the bottom of her dress, pulling it up and over her head in one smooth move. She stood before him in her sandals, thong, and demi-bra. She had never been so thankful for a good set of underwear. \u201cMy God, princess, you\u2019re beautiful. You have been driving me out of my mind and that was before I knew what was under your clothes.\u201d</p><p>A sense of urgency took over and Beth knew this wouldn\u2019t be a slow lovemaking. This was going to be hot, sweaty sex and that was just the way she wanted it. Nick reached out and palmed her breasts through her bra, quickly working the nipples to stiff peaks before sliding his hand down her stomach and cupping her sex in his hand. She knew he could feel the moisture through the thin silk material as he rubbed her into a frenzy.</p><p>In a move that would have put a stripper to shame, he had her bra and panties off as well his remaining clothes. She grimaced as he swung her effortlessly up and sat her on the counter. \u201cCondom, we need a condom,\u201d he managed to gasp out.</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m on the pill, we\u2019re fine,\u201d Beth moaned, impatient now for his possession. Nick looked like he had just received his birthday present early as he gave her that sexy grin. She reached forward to take his impressive length into her hand. She circled her finger around his tip, rubbing in the moisture that was gathering there.</p><p>Nick groaned. \u201cPrincess, you better let that go if you want this to last more than a minute.\u201d He gently removed her hands from his cock and pushed her back until she was lying on the counter with her hips almost hanging off the edge.</p><p>She felt his tip nudging against her slick entrance and shivers raced up and down her body. My God, I\u2019m really doing this. I\u2019m going to have sex with Nick Freaking Merimon right now and I could come just thinking about it.</p><p>Nick remained poised at her entrance, seeming transfixed by the sight of the bodies touching so intimately. His breathing was ragged as he trailed an unsteady hand down her neck and then circled each nipple. He then moved his caresses lower and lightly brushed against her damp curls, seeking the place where his cock rested against her slick opening. \u201cGod, you\u2019re so beautiful and you look like pure sex lying open to me like this.\u201d</p><p>When his finger slid over her clit, Beth almost came up off the counter. She wrapped her legs around his hips, trying to pull him forward into the place inside her that was desperate for his possession. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou want that, baby?\u201d Nick moaned. \u201cThen take it, take what you need!\u201d</p><p>Beth didn\u2019t need any further urging; she wrapped her legs tighter and pumped her hips forward, driving him deep into her. Her inner muscles quivered as he filled her almost to the point of pain. She knew that she should give her body a chance to get used to his invasion, but she was powerless to stop. Desire like she had never known was ripping through her, and her only focus was on ending the relentless ache that throbbed through her body. She pumped her hips against him harder, forcing him in to the hilt and then continued to grind herself against him, trying to take him even deeper.</p><p>Nick growled in his throat almost like an animal and suddenly his thrusts were meeting hers. He seemed no longer content to let her take the lead. He left little doubt as to who was in control as he took her ankles from behind his hips and lifted them up over his shoulders. He slid in so deep that Beth felt him rubbing against her cervix. He gripped her hips tightly in his hands and held her in place on the counter while he pounded into her. The kitchen was filled with the sounds of their moans and heavy breathing as they both raced toward their peak.</p><p>Beth felt herself starting to quiver as the first ripples of her orgasm started. \u201cNick, oh myyyy Goddd, Nick, don\u2019t stop!\u201d As pleasure started to tear through her in waves, Nick reached out to roughly flick her clit and she exploded. Her orgasm went on and on as he continued to pound into her. Just when she thought it wasn\u2019t possible, she felt herself start to crest another orgasm as Nick rammed into her. He stiffened with a shout as he reached his own climax.</p> <p>Beth thought she would pass out from the sensations running through her body. Nick released her legs and fell forward, almost toppling them both off the counter. His head landed against her stomach and she felt his sweat pooling in her navel. She idly ran her hands through his damp hair, enjoying this moment of closeness before she severed it.</p><p>\u201cShit, princess, you damn near killed me.\u201d Nick chuckled. \u201cYou are a damn tiger under that innocent, schoolteacher exterior, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled, pleased that she could bring a playboy like Nick literally to his knees. Apparently, those self-help books were really paying off. What she lacked in experience she more than made up for in research.</p><p>Ruffling his hair one last time, Beth said, \u201cHelp me down, Romeo. I have a bag of bagels wedged under my head.\u201d</p><p>Beth almost groaned as Nick slowly slid out of her, causing a delicious friction every inch of the way. One look into his face and she knew it was intentional. \u201cYou\u2019re a bad boy, Nick, you really are.\u201d When she finally had her feet on the floor, she deliberately stretched her body like a cat, working out all of the kinks that sex on the hard counter had caused. She noticed on the last stretch that she had Nick\u2019s full attention visually and physically.</p> <p>As he reached for her, she sidestepped his arms and started to gather her clothes. When she looked up at him, he had a puzzled expression on his handsome face. No doubt, he was used to women hanging all over him postcoital. She patted one of his firm butt cheeks on the way out the kitchen door and smiled to herself at the stunned expression on his face.</p><p>The sound of Suzy gagging beside her brought Beth back to the present. Suzy took a huge gulp of wine and groaned. \u201cMy god, Beth, I told you I didn\u2019t need all of the details. How am I supposed to look Quick-Zipper in the eyes again knowing what he did to you on my counter?\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed as she said, \u201cI believe the better question here, sis, is how will you look him in the eyes knowing what I did to him on your counter? Every time we have sex, he seems to expect something more. Why can\u2019t he just accept that I want to have sex with him without being his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know; maybe because you are pregnant with his child?\u201d Suzy snapped.</p><p>Beth waved her off. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not it. He doesn\u2019t know about that yet. It\u2019s not a game changer anyway. I still don\u2019t plan to get involved with him. Nick is a player and that might make him really, really, really great in bed, but it doesn\u2019t make him a good father figure. He can be involved, but I will be the parent to my child.\u201d</p><p>Suzy looked at her as if stunned. \u201cJust who in the hell are you, Beth? You know I\u2019m far from a prude, but I have to say I hardly recognize you. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m putting down your choices, because I\u2019m the last person who should throw stones, but you just seem so different from the person I always thought you to be. It\u2019s blowing my damn mind into a million pieces. I\u2019m horrified and strangely proud of you all at the same time. Nick really didn\u2019t take advantage of you, did he?\u201d</p> <p>With a smile of supreme satisfaction, Beth said, \u201cNope, he had very little say in the matter. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t sleep around. You know I haven\u2019t slept with many guys. And Nick is the first man I have had sex with in years.\u201d Then, almost embarrassed to admit it, she continued, \u201cI wanted him though, sis, and for once I didn\u2019t let the fat me talk me out of it. I know we are nothing alike and it\u2019s not going to go anywhere. I won\u2019t let him break my heart, but I\u2019m enjoying the ride.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit on a stick, Beth! Helllloooo! This just went from sowing some delayed wild oats to a serious, life-altering complication. You do realize that your life has changed forever, don\u2019t you?\u201d Suzy asked more gently.</p><p>Smiling, Beth said, \u201cYeah, I do and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I\u2019ve always wanted to have a family and finally I get what I want. It might not be the fairy-tale version, but it\u2019s closer than I ever imagined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you something else? Why are you talking about Nick as if you already know he won\u2019t be sticking around? Are you sure he doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, he is totally clueless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this,\u201d Suzy groaned, \u201cbut you should give the guy a chance to do the right thing. I know he has probably given more rides than Greyhound, but deep down he seems like a good guy.\u201d</p><p>After all of these years, Suzy never failed to surprise her with some of the things that came out of her mouth. Comparing Nick to the Greyhound bus line? She idly wondered how Suzy would react to knowing that even though she hadn\u2019t slept with many men, she had been on a bit of a dating marathon the last few months. Somehow, she didn\u2019t think Suzy was ready to deal with any more information tonight. Her bottle of wine was long since empty and her sister still looked shell-shocked.</p><p>But after another moment of deep thought, Suzy said, \u201cSo this has been going on for a while. How in the world have you managed to keep it hidden?\u201d</p> <p>Beth laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s been rather easy. No one suspects the fat girl of screwing the hot guy\u2019s brains out. I could have been doing him in the office when you walked in and your mind would have come up with some other way to justify it. I\u2019m just not hot-guy material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it, Beth, you are not a fat girl! Why must you continue to harp on that? The only reason I wouldn\u2019t have suspected you two of sleeping with each other is because you and Nick are always arguing. Ugh, now I know that\u2019s just foreplay. You\u2019re a beautiful woman, and I have no doubt that Nick had a boner every time you walked past.\u201d</p><p>Chuckling, Beth said, \u201cWow, when did you become such a romantic? Settling down with Gray has done wonders for you. I can only imagine how you sweet talk him.\u201d</p><p>With a feline smile, Suzy said, \u201cTrust me, Gray has no complaints about anything concerning my mouth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, gross! Please don\u2019t go there; leave me with some of my ignorance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you bitching about? I\u2019m the one who is going to have to tear the damned counters out of my kitchen because I\u2019ll never be able to use them again without wondering if your butt cheek was on that section.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9, sis. You\u2019ve got me there,\u201d Beth agreed.</p><p>\u201cWhen do you plan to tell Nick about the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, obviously before it\u2019s born.\u201d When Suzy elbowed her, Beth sighed. \u201cProbably tonight. He\u2019s supposed to come over this evening, so after we, um, well you know, then I\u2019ll see if I have the energy to tell him.\u201d</p><p>Luckily, she was saved from Suzy\u2019s comment when Gray walked hesitantly into the room. He looked as if he was prepared to dive for cover at any moment.</p><p>Beth took pity on him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Gray. I\u2019m getting ready to leave.\u201d She took advantage of the distraction that Gray offered and quickly grabbed her purse. She gave Suzy a fast hug and smiled at Gray as he insisted on walking her to her car.</p><p>He reached for her door handle, but instead of opening it, he turned to look at her. \u201cBeth, are you okay?\u201d he asked quietly.</p><p>She was touched to see the look of concern in his eyes. Suzy had hit the jackpot when she met Gray, and a part of Beth couldn\u2019t help but feel a little envious. She might be sleeping with a Merimon brother, but he was as different as night from day from Gray. Smiling reassuringly at him, she said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, Gray, really I am. I hope Suzy doesn\u2019t give you a hard time about Nick. He isn\u2019t the bad guy in all of this. If anyone is, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Beth could see that she had surprised Gray yet again. He gave her a shrewd look and said, \u201cBe careful, Beth. Whether you mean to or not, you\u2019re giving my brother something that he won\u2019t be able to resist: a challenge. I doubt he has ever had a woman walk away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean. Both Nick and I know where things stand between us. I bet he\u2019s blowing the dust off his little black book as we speak.\u201d</p><p>With a tired sigh, Gray said, \u201cAll right, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d He leaned over to kiss her cheek and then opened the door for her. \u201cBe careful driving home and, um, tell my brother I said hello.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Suzy laid her head back on the couch, trying to come to terms with everything she\u2019d learned from her conversation with Beth. Apparently, the quiet ones were always hiding something. She almost felt sorry for Nick. She was fairly certain that her sister had seduced him right out of his pants. This whole thing might be kind of funny if not for the baby.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see Gray standing in front of her, visibly braced for her assault. She held her hand out to him, suddenly more thankful than ever to have such a wonderful man in her life. He took her hand and settled in beside her. She laid her head against his chest and snuggled back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, baby?\u201d Gray asked quietly.</p><p>With a sigh, Suzy said, \u201cBeth\u2019s pregnant and Nick\u2019s the father.\u201d</p><p>She felt Gray stiffen against her. This was all hitting too close to home for them. Just months ago, their relationship had almost been destroyed by a woman from Gray\u2019s past claiming to be pregnant with his child. If not for Reva\u2019s sudden attack of conscience, they may well have lost each other. She knew that it was a hard blow to Gray, but she also knew that he would support his brother and Beth no matter what.</p><p>\u201cAh, shit. Does my brother know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I think she\u2019s going to tell him tonight. God, Gray, how could I have been so blind? I never suspected anything was going on between them. I was so desperate for them to stop arguing that I even pushed them together at every turn. I might as well have bought them a set of handcuffs and some Cool Whip. I practically made this happen.\u201d</p><p>With a chuckle Gray said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about the handcuffs, but a box of condoms might have come in handy.\u201d</p><p>Suzy smacked his chest, but couldn\u2019t help the laugh that escaped her lips. \u201cWell, if I had thought my sister was getting busy with someone, you bet I would have covered that base. It wasn\u2019t Nick, though. Apparently, he tried to be good for once. I never thought I\u2019d be saying this but supposedly my sister seduced your brother. The only person who can drop Nick\u2019s zipper faster than him seems to be Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Gray murmured. \u201cI just never imagined Beth . . . I mean, um . . . wow.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Suzy said, \u201cYeah, I know exactly what you mean. I don\u2019t even know how to process this. Things were much easier when I thought my sister was the innocent little wallflower seduced by your gigolo brother. At least then I would have a clear course of action. Kick his ass and then help her pick up the pieces. Now I\u2019m in the uncomfortable position of feeling like I need to protect Nick from my cougar sister.\u201d</p><p>Gray gave her shoulders a squeeze and laughed. \u201cTrust me, baby, my brother has never been innocent a day in his life, so don\u2019t make him the saint here. He might have been swayed the first time, but unless Beth had him chained up somewhere, he\u2019s been sleeping with her all this time of his own free will.\u201d</p><p>Suzy turned and wrapped herself around Gray. When his lips settled onto hers, she felt the world slip away, as it always did whenever he touched her.</p><p>Beth smiled as she pulled into her parking space in front of her apartment and saw Nick\u2019s Audi in her other space. For weeks he had been driving a minivan that he had rented while his car was in the shop. The van really had come in handy while Suzy was on crutches with a broken ankle. The three of them had gotten rather attached to it and, even though he wouldn\u2019t admit it, she thought Nick had been a little sad to see it go as well. The Audi R8 definitely suited him more though\u2014a two-door sports car that he adored. Beth had to admit, she felt a bit like a bad girl when she rode in it. It might not be sensible, but man was it sexy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>As she stepped in front of her door on the second floor, it suddenly flung open. \u201cGod, Beth, where have you been? You got off work hours ago. I called you several times and no answer. I was afraid something had happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Beth was surprised to see Nick visibly disheveled. \u201cUm, sorry, you knew I was meeting Suzy for a drink after work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was hours ago. Where the hell did you go for a drink, Atlanta? I called you, Suzy, and Gray. Have you all stopped answering your damn phones?\u201d</p><p>Good grief, what had gotten into him? Sure, she was a little later than usual, but she hadn\u2019t thought he would notice, much less be upset about it. Walking over to him, she went up on her tiptoes and wrapped her arms around his neck. She felt the familiar desire start to hum through her body as she looked at his handsome features. Nick Merimon was every woman\u2019s wet dream. He made her heart pound and her body go slick with need in an instant. He turned her into a wanton, intent only on having his body any way she could.</p><p>With Nick, she could pretend that she was someone else. There was freedom with him because he never knew \u201cfat Beth.\u201d She didn\u2019t think she could ever be comfortable dating\u2014much less sleeping with\u2014anyone who knew her when she was heavier. In her mind, they would be turned off by who she used to be. She felt like someone other than that plain, overweight girl she\u2019d always been when she was with Nick. In his eyes, she was pretty and sexy and that is exactly how she felt with him.</p><p>Beth had come to the realization a while back that in order to find someone to spend her life with, she would have to date outside her circle and, boy, had she been. Things had gotten complicated when she became involved with Nick and suddenly her two worlds were colliding.</p><p>The feel of Nick\u2019s warm mouth against the side of her neck had her nipples suddenly standing at attention. God, did that man know how to use his tongue. Outside the impressive package between his legs, that had become her favorite part of him. When did I turn into such a guy? Shouldn\u2019t I be concerned about his feelings or love him for his mind or at least his sense of humor? Instead, I just lust after his body. I\u2019m a T and A girl now. Well, tongue and ass that is.</p><p>Between nips to her lower lip, Nick growled, \u201cI missed you today, princess.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled at him. She knew this was a part of his whole seduction routine. If she ever let herself believe that she was special to him, then she was finished. Nick was an all-around good guy and he really loved women. He not only wanted you to feel special while making love, he wanted you to feel special before and after. It was probably why women seemed to love him even when he was showing them the door. It was one of the things she respected about him. He would go a mile out of his way to keep from hurting someone\u2019s feelings, especially a woman\u2019s feelings.</p><p>He slid his hands from her waist to the bottom of her dress, bunching it up in his hands. Pulling it up her body, he moaned low in his throat when he brushed his hand against her bare bottom. \u201cThe thong was the single best invention of this century. I hope you aren\u2019t attached to this, princess.\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, Nick snapped the fragile lace on one side and let it slide down her legs. When it reached her ankles, she kicked it off. Without releasing her, he quickly lowered the shorts he was wearing and kicked them away. He lifted her off her feet and she automatically wrapped her legs around his waist. He backed her up against the wall and her breath left her lungs on a whoosh as he impaled her on his cock.</p><p>Beth\u2019s neck arched back as she moaned in pleasure. He held her hips, setting a relentless pace as his body pumped into hers. Her body recognized his from the first stroke. The emptiness she felt when they were apart was only ever truly filled when his body was joined with hers. She tried hard not to think about what would happen when he was no longer there to take that ache away.</p><p>Sweat rolled from their bodies and Nick continued to claim every inch of her. His tongue licked her neck and then took possession of her mouth. She moaned at the taste of him. She could spend hours a day twirling her tongue with his. As her body started to tighten, she ground her hips against his, desperate for a release from the tension that threatened to split her apart.</p><p>As if sensing that she was close to the edge, Nick started swiveling his hips causing his cock to rub against her clit. The sensation was exquisite as pleasure radiated out from the sensitive nub. With another hard thrust, Beth exploded. The tremors shaking her body sent Nick to his own orgasm and, with a shout, he emptied himself inside her.</p><p>Still joined with her, he staggered to a chair. She collapsed against his chest, too tired to move. Sitting in the chair with her legs still wrapped around Nick and his cock still nestled inside her was one of the most intimate moments of her life. She felt his lips brush against her forehead as one last shudder shook his body.</p><p>\u201cI guess you\u2019re forgiven for being late, princess. Wall sex is gonna make me forgive and forget most every time.\u201d</p><p>Beth chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Ugh, I need a shower, but I don\u2019t have the energy to get there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust hold on, baby, I\u2019ll get us there.\u201d</p><p>Beth sighed with regret as he gently pulled out of her and then tried to protest as he lifted her and walked through the bedroom to the bathroom. She was flattered to see that he didn\u2019t look winded by the trip.</p><p>The shower was a quick affair. Both of them were too tired to attempt anything other than washing. They were already snuggled under the bedcover when she remembered that she had decided to tell him her news tonight. With a yawn, she decided it could wait until tomorrow and she drifted off.</p><p>Something woke Beth from a sound sleep. She lay there for a moment, disoriented until a crushing wave of sickness rolled over her. Pressing a hand to her mouth, she stumbled from the bed, almost sprinting to the bathroom. She barely got the lid up on the toilet before she emptied her stomach of its contents. As she sat on the floor wondering if there was going to be another round, she heard Nick knock on the door.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, round two was well on its way and she was again hanging over the toilet, even though there appeared to be nothing left. She felt Nick\u2019s hand on her back and then he was pulling her hair back from the line of fire. After a few moments, she was down to nothing but dry heaves so she dropped to the floor and sat back against the bathroom cabinet. Nick grabbed a cloth and wet it under the faucet before gently cleaning her face. She felt the strange urge to start crying when she looked into his concern-filled eyes.</p> <p>\u201cHoney, are you all right?\u201d</p><p>Beth nodded, too weak to say the words. Nick finished cleaning her up and then left the room. He came back a few moments later with a fresh gown and, without saying a word, he pulled her to her feet and used one arm to support her while using the other to strip the now soiled gown off and put the clean one on. He helped her brush her teeth and rinse her mouth and then he leaned down and hooked his arms under her knees, lifting her in his arms. Had she not been so weak she would have been horrified at him carrying her, but now she was just grateful for the help.</p><p>He had pulled the covers back on her side and now he sat her down and grabbed some extra pillows to prop up her head. When he had her tucked in to his satisfaction, he sat down beside her and gently brushed her hair out of her face. \u201cBetter now?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes, thank you, Nick,\u201d she rasped out.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened, princess? Was it something you ate last night?\u201d</p><p>Damn, the stupid tears were back in her eyes. What was wrong with her tonight? Had throwing up always made her an emotional wreck? Tell him, just get it over with. Beth opened her mouth to do just that and found no sound coming out at all. No matter how hard she tried, the words would not come. Chickenshit, you have to tell him.</p><p>Nick gave her a sweet kiss on the forehead and went to get her a bottle of water. Her eyes were getting heavier by the moment, and when he returned, she was already asleep.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Despite Nick\u2019s protests, Beth made it into the headquarters of Danvers International only a few minutes late for work. She took a deep breath and then tapped on her sister\u2019s door. Smiling at the grunt she heard in response, she opened the door and walked in. Suzy would never be a morning person and even living with Gray hadn\u2019t changed that. On those mornings when she did come in unusually perky, Beth knew exactly why. Gray brought out the soft side in her and Beth had never seen her happier. With a small sigh, Beth hoped she\u2019d have a love like that someday.</p><p>Suzy turned a sharp gaze on her as if expecting some type of war wounds. \u201cSo, what did he say? Are you going to make me beg?\u201d</p><p>Beth dropped in the chair in front of her desk and braced herself. \u201cI haven\u2019t told him yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Why the hell not? I thought you were going to take care of that last night.\u201d</p><p>Shifting in her seat, Beth murmured, \u201cUm, something came up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, something came up?\u201d Suzy demanded.</p><p>Beth could feel the blush starting to work its way up her neck and into her face. It was too much to hope that Suzy wouldn\u2019t notice.</p><p>\u201cOh, yuck! God, Beth, isn\u2019t that how this happened to start with? Can\u2019t you two keep your clothes on for more than five minutes?\u201d</p><p>With a wiggle of her eyebrows, Beth purred, \u201cTrust me, I remember exactly how this happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right, just please stop. I already had to take the stairs this morning when I saw Nick getting on the elevator. Do you have any idea how many damn stairs I had to climb because you can\u2019t keep your hands off the guy? You owe me a new pair of shoes and a pedicure.\u201d</p><p>Beth tried hard, but she couldn\u2019t contain the laughter that bubbled out when she thought of Suzy climbing all of those flights of stairs just to avoid Nick. The only person who hated exercise more than Beth was her sister. \u201cI almost told him this morning, after I threw my guts up. I think I had my first bout of morning sickness.\u201d</p><p>Suzy looked more closely at her with concern evident in her gaze. \u201cAre you okay? Why did you come in today? Get your stuff and go back home, you shouldn\u2019t be here sick.\u201d</p><p>Holding up her hand to stop the onslaught, Beth assured her that she felt fine now. \u201cI passed out in the bed before I could tell him. I\u2019m going to talk to him tonight. I\u2019ll have plenty of time to get my nerve up because we\u2019re just planning a quiet evening at home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, good, but if he says anything even remotely bad to you, call me and I\u2019ll be right over. I don\u2019t care who, um, instigated this, he still had to . . . you know. Ah, hell, he still shot the load without protection, so he is just as much to blame.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShot the load?\u201d Beth groaned. \u201cIt\u2019s called sex, Suzy, and you know plenty about it since you live with Mr. Sex-on-a-Stick as you called him once.\u201d</p><p>Waving her toward the door, Suzy said, \u201cJust go and don\u2019t come back for a while. Like maybe for the whole day while I try to scrub my mind of this entire conversation.\u201d</p><p>Beth chuckled and walked to her office. As she dropped her purse on her desk, her door suddenly shut behind her and warm hands slid around her waist. \u201cAre you feeling better, princess?\u201d</p><p>She smiled as she heard the sexy voice whispering in her ear. Allowing herself to snuggle back in his embrace for just a moment, she said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine now. What are you doing down here so early?\u201d</p><p>Nick turned her around in his arms so they were facing each other. \u201cI just wanted to make sure you were okay.\u201d He trailed a finger down the curve of her cheek and placed a kiss on the corner of her mouth. \u201cI was worried about you. You were so sick this morning.\u201d</p><p>It was so hard to hold out against his charms, especially when he was in this kind of loving, gentle mood. Keep it casual. He probably has the same routine with every woman he dates. He doesn\u2019t love you or even want to love you. He is just a nice guy. She gave him a quick smile and stepped out of the circle of his arms. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Nick, really. I feel great now.\u201d Walking around her desk to put some distance between them, she asked, \u201cAre we still having dinner at my place tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nick frowned, obviously confused about the distance that she tried to keep between them unless they were having sex. \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d</p><p>Beth started thumbing through a stack of papers on her desk, hoping that Nick would get the message and leave before she gave in to the urge to shove him down on her desk and ride that fabulous body.</p><p>As he started toward the door he suddenly turned around and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with Suzy? Just as I got on the elevator this morning I saw her walk up and then take off like a bat out of hell when she saw me standing there.\u201d</p><p>Beth quickly looked down, afraid her face would give her away. \u201cUm, you know Suzy, it could have been anything. She probably never saw you.\u201d</p><p>Still looking doubtful, Nick said, \u201cI guess you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll see you later on.\u201d</p><p>She flopped in her chair as the door shut behind him. Was it too early to be having pregnancy hormones? It was getting harder and harder not to buy into the idea of a relationship with him. But she knew that it would destroy her when he walked away and she couldn\u2019t risk it. Of course, now thanks to the baby, their lives would always be intertwined. With a sick feeling, she wondered how she would ever live through the many women she would be forced to see move in and out of his life. In the very near future, if he decided to be a father to their child, he could well have some other woman with him when he picked up their baby for a visit. A wave of nausea swept her, and she knew in her heart that this time it had very little to do with morning sickness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick slowly shut Beth\u2019s door and walked down the hall. After sleeping with her for months, he didn\u2019t feel any closer to her than their first time on Gray\u2019s kitchen counter. Everyone assumed that he just jumped from one bed to another, but he seldom did that and the few times it had happened, he had hardly been proud of it.</p><p>He had never planned on getting involved with Beth, even though she had intrigued him from their first meeting. Her obvious dislike of him was like fuel on a fire. The more she rolled her eyes at him, the more he teased her. She hated him calling her princess so he made sure he did it regularly. What had started as an innocent game had fast gotten out of control. He found himself making up reasons to stay at Gray\u2019s with Beth and Suzy while she was injured. He shuffled his schedule and worked far into the night so that he could free up more time to help. Of course, he would have done anything that Suzy needed and he knew that Gray was grateful that he was staying there while he was away. Truthfully, though, he just couldn\u2019t seem to stay away from Beth.</p><p>He was an affectionate person by nature and he usually had some level of closeness with the women he was involved with. Admittedly, it might be a brief relationship, but he still cared, to some degree, even after it was over. He couldn\u2019t understand why Beth seemed so determined to keep him at arm\u2019s length.</p><p>She\u2019d given him more than one hard-on before they\u2019d finally had sex. Probably the most memorable one was in Victoria\u2019s Secret when Suzy dragged them there to shop for something for Gray\u2019s return home after a long business trip. Nick had started by playfully holding up skimpy bra and panty sets trying to embarrass Beth. She finally walked off, clearly pissed off. He\u2019d let her go, giving her time to fume in private. As he was wandering around the store waiting for them both to be finished, he spotted Beth holding a pair of lacy black thong panties. Just when he felt sweat starting to break out on his forehead, she grabbed what looked to be a dozen pairs of them in various colors and matching lacy bras.</p><p>He had felt his erection starting to dig painfully into the zipper of his jeans when she paused at the end of the aisle and picked up a garter belt. She acted as if she wore stuff like that every day. He stood rooted in the same spot for at least five minutes trying to get control of his body. He really didn\u2019t want to be the weird pervert that went into a lingerie store to get his thrills. Luckily, he had gotten himself under control by the time he saw the girls paying for their purchases. Every time he saw that damn bag for the rest of the afternoon, he felt his cock stirring. He was practically saying \u201cDown, boy\u201d every few minutes.</p><p>The night they\u2019d finally had sex had blown him away. He wanted her so much by then that he was constantly on pins and needles when she was near. Her scent when she walked by drove him crazy. She smelled like a citrus mixture of exotic fruit and flowers. He actually caught himself sniffing when she left the room, hoping for a whiff of that enticing scent.</p><p>He had been determined not to hit on her, though. He knew Suzy and Gray would kill him if he slept with her and, even though he longed to land in bed with her, he never did anything other than tease her. When they were cleaning up after a cookout at Gray\u2019s home, she had walked into the kitchen with the last of the dishes. He had started to tease her when she dropped the dishes loudly into the sink. He would never forget the look on her face. Her eyes narrowed at him as if in anger, but her cheeks were flushed and she was breathing as if she had just run a marathon.</p><p>Suddenly, she had gripped his shirt, pulling him down to her and slammed her mouth against his. Shock had rippled through his body for a split second before desire took over. His arms came around her and it was the hottest moment of his life. He had tried to step back at some point and give her a chance to walk away, but she had held on for dear life and he was too far gone to walk away from her again.</p><p>He had lost himself in her from that moment. Seeing her in a pair of those sexy little panties that she had purchased from Victoria\u2019s Secret had finished punching his ticket. There was no way he could have left that kitchen without having her. She was just as desperate for him as he was for her. He had never been with a woman so responsive. She knew exactly where he wanted to be stroked. She touched him like someone with a wealth of experience, yet when he entered her body, she was almost like a virgin, so small and tight. He almost lost it on the first stroke into her body and just barely managed to hold it together until he felt her orgasm. Such loss of control was foreign to him. He prided himself on his \u201cladies-first policy,\u201d but, boy, had he come close to violating it.</p><p>He was so blown away afterward that he just wanted to find a bed and curl himself around her lush body. Instead, she had essentially patted him on the head and walked away. Say what? Wasn\u2019t that supposed to be his exit move? Her bedroom door had closed firmly and that had been it. If he hadn\u2019t been so damned exhausted he would have trailed her into her room and insisted that she talk about what had just happened. Since when did a guy have great sex with no strings and then want to dissect it all night long? She handed you every man\u2019s wet dream and you want to make it complicated? And that was when he realized he was in over his head with her.</p><p>The next morning, Beth had acted as if nothing unusual had happened between them. No eye contact, no hot looks or seductive body language, nothing. By the time he left work that evening he was wondering if he had imagined the whole thing. He had almost convinced himself of that fact when he got in the elevator for the penthouse at Danvers where he was staying until he found something to purchase. He reached over to put his key card in when someone stepped onto the elevator. The polite smile froze on his face when he saw it was Beth.</p><p>Fire blazed in her eyes as her gaze locked on his. He tried to pull it together and have some semblance of cool, but it was all over when she lined her body up flush with his and pressed her soft curves against the hard lines of his body. He sucked in a ragged breath groaning, \u201cPrincess, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>A husky laugh escaped from her throat when she purred, \u201cI\u2019m doing you, Nick, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\u201d With those words, she had hooked her arms around his neck and drew his mouth to hers. Just as their tongues met and tangled, he heard the elevator chime for his floor. He backed her out the door, knowing there were probably cameras in the elevators and he didn\u2019t want to give security any added entertainment.</p><p>As he tried to fit his key in the door lock, Beth wrapped herself around his back and her hand wandered around to his front, lightly stroking against the growing bulge in his pants. He thought he would break the damn key trying to get the door open. The key suddenly turned and they fell inside when the door opened. They ripped each other\u2019s clothes off and Nick pulled Beth onto his lap on the couch. They both moaned as he slid inside of her.</p><p>That was how most of their sex life seemed to go. A frantic twist of hands, tongues, and bodies coming together as they raced to the finish line. He tried to slow it down. He wanted to spend an evening doing nothing but exploring her body. But Beth wouldn\u2019t allow slow and gentle. Whenever he tried, she did everything she could to drive him over the deep end until they ended fast and furious.</p><p>Damned if he could understand it. Not that he was complaining because, quite frankly, sex with her was mind-blowing. He just wished that sometimes she would let him slow the frantic pace. Not every time had to be a trip to the Indy 500.</p><p>He had no idea what he wanted from Beth, but he was tired of her treating him like a fuck buddy. Go ahead and turn your guy card in because no man should complain about having hot sex with a beautiful woman whenever she wanted it. Still, her attitude toward spending more time together bothered him. Maybe it was time to stop being so available. Tonight he would do what assholes all over the world did daily. He would stand her up for dinner and, for once, let her wonder where her Mr. Available was. Sitting around glued to her side wasn\u2019t getting him anywhere so maybe it was time to change things up.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Where was Nick? Beth looked at her watch yet again and saw it was now after ten. He should have been here no later than six. Dinner had long since grown cold, but she\u2019d left everything on the table, too pissed off to clean up. She had planned on telling the big jerk about the pregnancy tonight, but now all she wanted to do was yell and scream at him\u2014and, God help her, she also wanted to sit down and cry.</p><p>For someone who claimed to want nothing from Nick, you certainly are overreacting at being stood up. With a groan of disgust, she went to the bedroom to get ready for bed. Already she seemed to tire much more easily than she normally did.</p><p>She awoke with a jolt. The room was spinning and her stomach was churning. She jumped out of bed and dove for the bathroom, where she once again lost the contents of her stomach. Since she had barely eaten anything earlier, it ended up being a lot of dry heaving after the initial sickness.</p><p>She was lying on the bathroom floor, too tired and weak to make it back to bed, when she heard someone stumbling around in the bedroom. She heard a crash and a loud curse. She relaxed, recognizing Nick\u2019s voice. He knocked on the bathroom door and slurred a loud, \u201cPrincess, you in there?\u201d</p><p>Before she could answer, the door burst open and Nick blinked several times while his eyes tried to adjust to the bright light. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing on the floor, princess?\u201d Nick asked, obviously confused. \u201cOh, shit, baby. Are you sick again?\u201d</p> <p>Disgusted and still pissed off at him, she snapped, \u201cCan\u2019t get anything past you, Einstein, can I? How about giving me some privacy, Nick, and then you can have the bathroom to hose all the booze off since you reek of it.\u201d</p><p>Nick seemed to be deep in thought over her suggestion. \u201cAre you finished being sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019m okay now. I just need a minute to make it back to bed.\u201d She swayed on her feet as she tried to stand up too fast. Nick was by her side in an instant. Despite her protests, he swung her up in his arms effortlessly and walked into the bedroom to deposit her on the bed. Without saying a word, he went to the kitchen and returned with a glass of water and a wet cloth. She sat quietly while he cleaned her face and held the glass to her lips.</p><p>For someone who had been slurring his words a few minutes ago, Nick seemed to have sobered up fast. \u201cYou need to go to the doctor tomorrow, baby. This is two nights in a row that you have been sick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, Nick. I\u2019m sure it will pass.\u201d Wrinkling her nose at the smell of liquor on his breath, she said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home and sleep it off?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you here sick. But I will go shower since it offends you so much.\u201d</p><p>Before she could stop herself, she blurted out, \u201cWhere were you tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you care, princess? Did you have an itch that you needed scratched? Because I know that\u2019s the only reason you ever want me around.\u201d</p><p>Beth saw red. Was he actually complaining about having sex with her now? She wanted to hit him with something. Instead of physically assaulting him though, she hit him where she knew it would hurt him the most. \u201cNo, you ass. I\u2019d just rather the father of my baby not wrap his car around a tree because he is stupid enough to drive while drunk!\u201d</p><p>Nick gave her a smug smile and said, \u201cI took a cab so get off your high horse.\u201d He stood up and walked into the bathroom.</p><p>Beth sat in the bed, stunned. He had made no comment at all about the first part of her sentence. Was he so drunk that he hadn\u2019t understood what she said? She finally worked up the nerve to tell him and this was it? No shock? No nothing?</p><p>Suddenly the bathroom door flew open and Nick stood there with no shirt on and just his pants riding low on his hips. She could hear the shower running. His face was white and his eyes were wild. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cUm, that I didn\u2019t want you to drive while you were drunk?\u201d Beth hedged.</p><p>\u201cNo, before that,\u201d Nick responded quietly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want the father of my baby to wrap his car around a tree.\u201d Beth closed her eyes when she saw the reaction on his face that she had expected when she first delivered her bombshell.</p><p>She heard Nick clear his throat and then, \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d</p><p>He was back about ten minutes later having obviously showered. He had pulled on a pair of lounge pants that he kept at her place to wear in the evenings. He looked stone-cold sober as he settled in a chair near her bed.</p><p>Beth was starting to get unnerved as he continued to stare at her. Finally realizing that he was waiting for her to say something, she cleared her throat and tried to think of where to begin. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant and it\u2019s yours.\u201d Smooth, Beth, real smooth. You couldn\u2019t start with a flowery speech? I think he already knows you\u2019re pregnant and that he\u2019s the father. \u201cI . . . I just found out. I was going to tell you tonight, but you didn\u2019t come home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow? I thought you were on the pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. God, I don\u2019t know. I could have missed one, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d She looked down to buy time, picking an imaginary piece of lint off the bedspread while she waited for him to freak out and start accusing her of trying to trap him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis is why you\u2019ve been sick the last few nights, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Then, almost as if it were an afterthought, he added, \u201cI thought it was called morning sickness?\u201d</p><p>Beth managed a strained laugh, saying, \u201cYeah, I seem to have that backward. I hope this isn\u2019t going to happen every day because it\u2019s a horrible feeling to wake up in the middle of the night deathly sick.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace, Nick said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t make it for dinner. I just had a lot on my mind. I wasn\u2019t with anyone though, so don\u2019t even think that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t, but thanks for clarifying. I know we aren\u2019t exclusive so you don\u2019t owe me explanations, but I would like the courtesy of a call the next time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeth, you are carrying my child; I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty damn exclusive.\u201d Without waiting for her response, he walked over to the other side of the bed and slid in. Turning off the light, he rolled over and gathered her loosely into his arms, kissing her gently on the forehead. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out, princess.\u201d</p><p>She snuggled against his warmth, too surprised to say anything else. Was he still in shock? He was taking this much better than she could have imagined. Maybe he was still too drunk to process everything. Tomorrow morning it would hit him, right?</p><p>Nick lay in bed awake long after Beth drifted off beside him. He curved his hand around her still-flat stomach as if looking for evidence of the life inside it. When she had dropped the bomb earlier, it really hadn\u2019t sunk in until he was about to step into the shower. He froze when he realized the enormity of her statement. The father of my baby. Damn, life had just taken a very sudden and unexpected turn. She had looked ready to bolt while she waited for his reaction. What had she expected him to say? He needed time to process everything.</p><p>He could imagine how Suzy and Gray were going to react to the news. Especially after their narrow escape with Reva a few months back. Things were different with Beth, though. He knew she wouldn\u2019t lie and deliberately try to trap him. Hell, she did everything she could to keep some distance between them.</p><p>There was no way Beth would try to get pregnant. He had tried to form a bond with her, and she was either afraid or just didn\u2019t want to be tied down to him. He had yet to figure out which. She sure wanted the sex. That was never in question. At times he thought he had caught her looking at him with what appeared to be affection. But he still couldn\u2019t really work out how she felt toward him. Plus, he didn\u2019t know what he felt; he just knew he wanted her in his life right now.</p> <p>Was he ready to be a father? Ready or not, it\u2019s going to happen. Oh, man, don\u2019t let it be a girl. I\u2019ll spend my whole life trying to keep men like me away from her.</p><p>Beth tangled her legs with his, snuggling further against him as she always did while she slept. She might keep her distance during the daylight, but at night, her body sought him out in the dark and curled around him, night after night.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cHow soon do you want to get married?\u201d</p><p>Beth spit her orange juice across the table, narrowly missing Nick\u2019s crisp white shirt. \u201cWh\u2014 What are you talking about?\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>Without looking up from his morning newspaper, Nick said, \u201cWell, since we\u2019re having a baby, we\u2019re getting married, princess. We also need to look at houses; this apartment is too small.\u201d</p> <p>Beth was speechless for a moment before she blurted out, \u201cWe\u2019re not having a baby\u2014I\u2019m having a baby and I don\u2019t need to get married for that.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at her in surprise and then spoke slowly to her, as if he were talking to a child. \u201cHoney, this is our baby and I plan to be a very hands-on father. I don\u2019t intend for my baby to have a different last name nor do I plan for him, or her, to wonder where Daddy is every day. Any ideas on where you want to have the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not buying a house or marrying you! Have you lost your mind? This isn\u2019t the Dark Ages where you have to marry the little woman because you knocked her up. Nick, I\u2019m perfectly capable of handling this by myself. You can see the baby anytime you like.\u201d</p><p>She had Nick\u2019s full attention now as he slapped the newspaper on the table. \u201cWhy even bother telling me, Beth? It seems like you have everything all figured out.\u201d Standing up, Nick bent over until they were face-to-face. \u201cWell, you know what, princess? I\u2019m not going anywhere. You aren\u2019t pushing me away from my child. Maybe I\u2019m not who you envisioned in this role, but I\u2019m who you\u2019ve got and you better learn to deal with it.\u201d</p><p>With one final glare at her, Nick stalked off. Beth heard the front door slam and she slumped back against her chair. What just happened? He wants to get married? Could he still be drunk this morning? Boy, was he pissed off. What had he expected her to say? Sure, every girl dreams of such a romantic proposal. Hey, little woman, let\u2019s get hitched this weekend. I want you barefoot and pregnant and in my home by nightfall. Ohhh, stop, Nick, you smooth-talking sex god, I can\u2019t take any more! Okay, so the sex god part is accurate. But down, girl. Don\u2019t get distracted by the countless orgasms he has given you. Focus on the big picture. He is not forever-after material. There is nothing there but heartache.</p><p>Nick was sadly mistaken if he thought he was pushing her into marrying him. With a glint in her eyes, she picked up her cell phone and checked her missed calls. She had twenty-nine. A few were from Suzy and Ella, but the rest were from men who actually were marriage material, at least their profiles said they were. She had signed up with a dating service before she met Nick and recently reactivated her profile\u2014now seemed like a good time to put some distance between herself and Nick. She needed to show Nick that, although she was carrying his child, she was still an independent person who made her own decisions. He had better call a halt on purchasing a new house or a minivan because she wasn\u2019t marrying him. She was moving on with her life.</p><p>She ruthlessly shushed the voice in her head that asked, \u201cWhat in the hell are you thinking? Pregnant women shouldn\u2019t be making dates for every night this week.\u201d She needed to focus on the future.</p><p>When Nick roared into the parking lot at Danvers a short time later, he spotted his brother leaning against his car waiting for him. He wanted to keep driving. He really didn\u2019t want to hear the lecture that Gray was no doubt about to unleash on him. He parked and jumped out of his car. Might as well get it over with. At least Gray wasn\u2019t as likely to kick him in the balls as Suzy.</p> <p>\u201cHey, bro, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Gray studied him as if debating whether to say something or not. Finally, he asked, \u201cAnything you want to talk about?\u201d</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Nick said, \u201cJust go ahead and spit it out. I know that everyone probably already heard that Beth\u2019s pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Suzy told me in a pretty colorful way.\u201d Gray laughed.</p><p>Clapping Gray on the shoulder, Nick said, \u201cSorry about that, man. I bet that was rough. I\u2019m sure she plans to rip me a new one before the day is over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pissed, but she realizes that you aren\u2019t completely to blame. I think having to deal with the mental image of you and Beth on our kitchen counter was much harder for her than finding out that her sister was pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, how much did Beth tell you guys? Women really do share everything, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed at Nick\u2019s obvious embarrassment. It wasn\u2019t often that his confident brother looked uncomfortable where a woman was concerned. \u201cOddly enough, she was just trying to defend you. She basically said that you tried to resist, but she was determined to override you.\u201d As if realizing what he had said, Gray added, \u201cMaybe override wasn\u2019t a good word to use.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled at Gray\u2019s poor choice of words. Then, taking pity on him, he decided to change the subject. \u201cI told Beth this morning that we were going to get married and find a house. That seemed to really piss her off.\u201d</p><p>Grinning, Gray said, \u201cWell, if you said it just like that I can\u2019t imagine why she wasn\u2019t jumping for joy. I\u2019m constantly wondering why people think you are the smooth talker in the family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this, Pick on Nick Day? What should I have said, man? It\u2019s not as if she was going to believe a big declaration of undying love. I care about her too much to lie to her. I don\u2019t think either one of us saw this coming, but now that it has we need to make some plans.\u201d</p><p>Gray studied him quietly for a few minutes before asking, \u201cYou do understand that you are going to be a father, right? I was expecting a different reaction from you this morning. Maybe more pacing, profanity, and less calm acceptance. You\u2019ve realized that marriage means monogamy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, smart-ass, I do. Despite your high opinion of me, I can actually be faithful to one woman. I have never screwed around while I\u2019ve been involved with someone and, believe me, the opportunity has presented itself more than once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeing faithful for a few months is a lot different from a lifetime.\u201d Gray held up a hand to silence his protests. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that you can be a father to this baby without getting married. I don\u2019t want to see you and Beth trapped in a marriage that makes you both miserable. I know that you care about her, but make sure you are doing this for the right reasons. I almost messed up my whole life with this very thing, so I know what I\u2019m talking about. I dodged a bullet, but if Beth is pregnant, then I damn well know that you are the father without question because Beth isn\u2019t Reva.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt his anger dissipate. He knew this was hitting a nerve with Gray and that he had his best interests at heart. He was just tired of first Beth and then Gray automatically counting him out. Why did everyone assume he would cut and run as soon as he found out? Was it a crime to have a long dating history? He had a demanding job that he excelled at and no one ever had to worry about him letting any of his business responsibilities slide. He never had to be told anything twice. He took the ball and ran with it every day. Granted, a baby was a hell of a lot more important than a job, but why did they automatically assume that he couldn\u2019t handle it? One thing was for certain: He would show them that there was more to Nick Merimon than just a good roll in the sack. But the first person he needed to prove that to was Beth.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>When Beth walked off the elevator, Ella was standing right there, as if waiting for her. The two had met when Beth had started working at Danvers, and the changes in Ella since their first meeting were nothing short of amazing. Ella had been raised by strict religious parents and had been sheltered her whole life. She had looked and dressed like someone at least twenty years older than she actually was.</p><p>Since Beth had spent most of her life hiding behind her overweight appearance, she could recognize a cry for help when she saw it. She knew that Ella desperately wanted to fit in and that she didn\u2019t have a clue as to how to do it. Beth might have problems with her own self-esteem, but she had no such qualms about helping Ella find her inner goddess. And, boy, had they ever!</p><p>The woman who stood in front of her now bore little resemblance to the awkward person of just months ago. Ella practically radiated happiness. She was still nervous and shy when someone out of her small circle of friends spoke to her, but she had come such a long way. Ella\u2019s former mousy brown hair was now a chestnut color and hung down her back in a long, shimmering curtain. Her blue eyes captured one\u2019s attention immediately and her adorable dimples made people try even harder to make her smile. She was small and petite, and Beth simply loved her to pieces.</p><p>The elevator chimed before they could move away and Declan Stone stepped out. She saw Ella\u2019s face light up as if she were a child sitting on Santa\u2019s lap for the first time. For some reason, Ella was nervous around every man of her acquaintance except Declan. Like herself, Beth thought that Ella needed to get out there more, but she didn\u2019t think Declan was the ticket.</p><p>The man was hotter than Myrtle Beach on the Fourth of July, but there was something almost dangerous about him. You never saw him standing around chatting with others, nor was he connected romantically with anyone. The man was a machine. Everything he said was direct and to the point. According to Nick, he was flawless in business negotiations and well respected around the world.</p><p>The only person who seemed to thaw the ice surrounding Declan was the woman standing beside her, and Beth was both impressed and terrified for her friend. Ella tended to stammer a lot when men spoke to her, but with Declan, everything was effortless for her. Beth caught a glimmer of a smile on Declan\u2019s surprisingly lush lips when his gaze rested on Ella.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Declan,\u201d Ella enthused.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Ella. I . . . hope everything worked out okay with your grandmother\u2019s procedure.\u201d</p><p>My god, this is priceless. He likes her. The Iceman actually likes Ella. Oh, shit, no! He will eat her for lunch and spit her out. She needs a man with training wheels to get her feet wet, not a man who started life as a Corvette. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe did great, Declan, thank you for asking.\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat and obviously uncomfortable to be having this conversation in front of Beth, Declan turned his gaze and finally acknowledged her presence. She got the more formal, \u201cGood morning, Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Declan. Ella, I\u2019m going to go check in with Suzy. How about lunch today?\u201d</p><p>Ella smiled and agreed immediately. When Beth turned the corner, she saw Ella and Declan still standing in the same spot. Ella seemed to buzz around him like a brightly colored firefly and Declan seemed helpless to look away. Why are you worrying so much about Ella and Declan? It seems like you have more than enough problems of your own to keep you busy for a while. Ella\u2019s a big girl and there is no way Declan would get seriously involved with her. She is way too innocent for him.</p> <p>When she walked into her sister\u2019s office, Suzy was ramming papers in her red leather bag and cursing under her breath. Sparing Beth a quick glance when she closed the door, Suzy said, \u201cI have to be across town in twenty minutes and I can\u2019t find my damn phone.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled as she walked to the credenza behind Suzy\u2019s desk and unplugged her sister\u2019s iPhone. \u201cI think you plugged it in here to charge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t they make a phone that doesn\u2019t have to be charged? What\u2019s wrong with a twelve-month Duracell?\u201d Suzy grumbled. \u201cI\u2019ll be gone until after lunch. I\u2019m going to check out the new conference facility for next month. Can you check with the suppliers and see where we are on our orders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, I have it on my list for this morning. You\u2019d better get going. Traffic will be terrible at this time.\u201d</p><p>As Suzy started for the door, she turned and asked, \u201cDid you tell him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, Mother, I did so you can stop worrying. He wants to get married and buy a house immediately. I told him no.\u201d</p><p>Suzy shook her head, clearly trying to process this latest development. \u201cHe wants to get married? Are you sure we\u2019re talking about the same Nick here? Oh, hell, don\u2019t say anything else. I\u2019m going to be late and I\u2019m terrified you will start talking about sex and I\u2019m not strong enough for that this morning. We\u2019ll talk when I get back.\u201d Suzy slammed out the door and then almost immediately flung it back open. In a low but menacing whisper she said, \u201cYou\u2019d better not have sex in my office . . . ever!\u201d</p><p>Beth chuckled as she walked to her own office. She hoped Suzy\u2019s warning didn\u2019t extend to her office because if it did, she had already violated that one. Maybe after-hours sex didn\u2019t count.</p><p>When Ella tapped on her door at lunchtime, Beth was just hanging up the phone after another exhausting call from Nick. At this point, she would rather him freak out and run than stay in the methodical mode he was currently in. He seemed to have an accidental-pregnancy handbook from the 1960s and he was running through it step by step. Marry the little woman immediately. Buy a house immediately. Plan the next ten years of Junior\u2019s life immediately. She felt weak and dizzy after the last call, and it had nothing to do with morning sickness and everything to do with Nick suffocating her. No matter how much she protested, he just kept going on as if he hadn\u2019t heard her. Was it really so hard for him to imagine a woman not dying to marry him? Um, yeah, you probably are one of the few women alive who wouldn\u2019t jump at the chance.</p><p>\u201cTough day?\u201d Ella gave her a sympathetic smile as she perched on the corner of Beth\u2019s desk.</p><p>Dropping her head onto her desk, Beth said, \u201cYou have no idea. The man is making me crazy. I just want a moment to breathe, but he is after me constantly. I haven\u2019t even had a chance to come to terms with it myself and he is pushing me relentlessly.\u201d</p> <p>Ella patted her back consolingly while making murmurs of agreement. \u201cGrab your purse and let\u2019s walk around the corner for lunch. Getting out of here for a while will help.\u201d</p><p>Beth gave her friend a grateful smile as she gathered her stuff. \u201cThat sounds great, but I\u2019m warning you now. If we see Nick anywhere on the way out, be prepared to run for your life because I am not talking about the advantages of breast-feeding anymore today, I mean it!\u201d She heard Ella\u2019s groan of disbelief behind her as they walked to the elevator. \u201cYou only think I\u2019m kidding. He\u2019s already tried to talk me into natural childbirth, too. Someone needs to stop the man from doing any more Google searches about pregnancy.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Nick opened Beth\u2019s apartment door that evening with the key that she had given him a few months back. Since their schedules were often different, it had made sense to be able to come and go as needed. She also had a key to the penthouse where he was staying.</p><p>He laid his briefcase down on the breakfast bar that separated the kitchen from the dining area. He noticed the blinking light on her answering machine that indicated a message. In all of the months that he had been in her apartment, he had never seen a message light blinking on the machine. He knew it was none of his business and an invasion of her privacy, but he couldn\u2019t seem to look away from the flashing light. Maybe it was something concerning the baby.</p><p>He managed to pull himself away from the machine without pushing the button to hear the message and walked to the bedroom to find Beth. She was curled up on top of the comforter on the bed sound asleep. She took his breath away. He didn\u2019t know how long he stood in the door just watching her. She looked so young and so vulnerable in sleep. The need he felt to protect her since he had learned she was pregnant was suddenly overwhelming. She looked so small lying there that it was hard to believe their child was nestled inside her.</p><p>In between meetings and conference calls, he had spent his day reading everything he could on pregnancy. Truthfully, a lot of it had scared the shit out of him. He had so much sweat on his face at one point that his secretary had asked him if he was feeling okay. He had wanted to yell, \u201cHell, no, I\u2019m not feeling okay. Beth is carrying a ticking bomb. A million things could happen to her or the baby. Oh, God, I\u2019m having chest pains. Am I too young for a heart attack?\u201d Instead, he had offered her reassurance that he was far from feeling ill and then called Beth for the tenth time to see how she was feeling.</p><p>Now, standing here and looking at the beautiful woman resting so peacefully, he once again felt his chest go tight. He knew she couldn\u2019t hear him but he made the promise anyway. \u201cI won\u2019t let you down, Beth. I\u2019ll be the best husband and father that I can possibly be. Just give me a chance to prove it. You will never want for anything. I\u2019ll lay the world at your feet. Just believe in me, please.\u201d</p> <p>Nick quietly shut the door behind him and walked into the kitchen for a beer. The light on the answering machine was again calling to him. You really should check it. What if there is a family emergency? She would want to know immediately. You would be doing her a favor. Before he could talk himself out of it, he grabbed a pen and a notepad to write down the message and pushed the button.</p><p>\u201cYou have two new messages. First message today at four twenty p.m. Hey, Beth, it\u2019s Seth. I wanted to make sure that we\u2019re still on for dinner tomorrow night. Please give me a call and let me know. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing you again.\u201d The next message was also from Seth leaving his cell phone number in case Beth had lost it.</p><p>Who in the hell was Seth and what was with the \u201cLooking forward to seeing you again\u201d? Had Beth been out with this guy recently? Nick felt something completely alien take control of him: jealousy. Maybe they hadn\u2019t formally talked about making their relationship exclusive, but he had assumed they were on the same page. He didn\u2019t date other women when he was involved with someone. Had Beth been dating? She was late coming home from time to time and she did mention going out to dinner with friends but at the time he thought she meant women friends.</p><p>Seth\u2019s intimate tone on the message didn\u2019t sound like that of a buddy. It sounded like a guy excited about seeing a woman. Well, she didn\u2019t have any problem letting you know that she wanted you, did she? You may not be the only ticket in town, my friend.</p><p>Beth rolled over in bed surprised to see how dark the room was. A look at the clock showed that she had been asleep for almost two hours. Despite the nap, she still felt fatigued. The morning sickness was taking a toll on her body. With another quick stretch, she slid her legs off the side of the bed and went to the bathroom to wash her face and straighten her hair.</p><p>Looking much more presentable, she walked into the living room and stopped short at seeing Nick sitting on one of the barstools deep in thought. She took a deep breath and allowed herself the pleasure of just looking at him. God, the man was beautiful. She had the urge to rip his clothes off every time he was anywhere near her and now was no exception. Her body tightened with need as she slowly approached him.</p><p>As if sensing her, Nick\u2019s head shot up. Beth stopped in her tracks at the look of confusion and sadness on his face. Something was obviously wrong. She reached out to take his hand and he moved his away. She dropped her hand back to her side and asked quietly, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>Instead of answering her question, he held up a slip of paper and snarled, \u201cWho is Seth?\u201d</p><p>Beth drew a complete blank. \u201cUm, Seth who?\u201d</p><p>Nick tossed the piece of paper down in disgust and jumped to his feet. \u201cBeth, don\u2019t you have anything a little more original than that?\u201d</p><p>Had he lost his mind? Maybe he was drunk. Where was the happy-go-lucky Nick that she was used to? This Nick was cold, angry, and, damn him, a complete turn-on. She wanted nothing more than for him to slam his mouth down onto hers and take her hard and fast. Talking slowly as she might to a child, she said, \u201cI really have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. You aren\u2019t making any sense.\u201d</p><p>Never breaking eye contact with her, he pushed a button behind him and played the messages on her answering machine. When the second message finished, she couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. A giggle escaped her and then another until she was doubled over laughing so hard that tears were streaming down her face. Instead of looking at her in anger now, Nick was just looking at her as if she were insane.</p><p>He didn\u2019t say a word as she mopped up the tears that had been running down her cheeks. \u201cSor\u2014 Sorry, give me a minute.\u201d Beth chuckled once more and took another breath to steady herself. Grinning at him standing there with his arms crossed and frowning at her, she asked, \u201cSo that message brought this whole he-man routine out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you think it\u2019s so funny, Beth, because I\u2019m still not amused. Who is Seth?\u201d</p><p>Shrugging her shoulders, she walked to the kitchen for a drink of water. \u201cHe\u2019s just a guy I went out with before, no big deal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know him and when did you go out with him?\u201d</p><p>Still unable to figure out why he would be upset, she replied, \u201cI, um, met him through a dating service and we went out a few weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>Nick turned to face her, his face thunderous. \u201cYou\u2019re using a dating service and you\u2019ve been seeing this guy while we\u2019ve been together?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly it hit her how bad this whole thing must look to him. True, they hadn\u2019t made any promises, but they had, for all intents, been spending most nights together. Well you wanted to put some distance between you, here\u2019s your chance. If you really want to lose him, you can do it right now. Faking a carefree manner that she was far from feeling, she said, \u201cI never said I wasn\u2019t seeing other people, Nick. I assumed you were as well. I signed up for the dating service months ago. Before you even ask though: Yes, I do know for sure that I am carrying your child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to ask that, Beth. I know you wouldn\u2019t lie to me about something like that. Tell Seth and anyone else you\u2019re seeing that it\u2019s over. You\u2019re pregnant and getting married. There seems to have been some confusion about seeing other people while we are dating, but let me clear it up for you. I\u2019m not sharing my girlfriend, and I\u2019m sure as hell not sharing my wife and the mother of my child. Send the memo, princess, you\u2019re off the market.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re crazy! I\u2019m not marrying you and you can\u2019t tell me what to do. I\u2019m an adult, Nick. You don\u2019t own me. In fact, I plan to go out with Seth tomorrow night.\u201d</p><p>Nick stared at her, clearly mystified over her refusal to make their relationship exclusive. Someone perfect like Nick could never understand the insecurities that someone like Beth harbored. He was too perfect for her. She would constantly find herself flawed against his perfection. She was pregnant and, God help her, about to start gaining some of her hard-lost pounds back. How would he feel when he could no longer span her waist with his hands? Would he enjoy her breasts as much when they were too large and far more than the current handful? Would he want to kiss and caress her lips as much when there was a double chin below them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick prowled toward her and she took a step backward, suddenly nervous at his intense expression. When he had her backed up against the wall, she laughed nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019re you doing?\u201d He ignored her question and lowered his head to her neck. She felt his warm lips slide against her sensitive skin and she gave an involuntary shudder. \u201cNick\u2014\u201d</p><p>His tongue thrusting into her mouth silenced the feeble protest she attempted to make. With a groan, she surrendered to him. They both knew she was powerless to resist how he made her feel. At that moment, she would have followed him off a cliff, so she issued no denial when he backed her toward the bedroom, never once breaking contact with her mouth. Just one more time and I\u2019ll be stronger the next time. Everyone deserves a weak moment, right? Even as she repeated the reassurances to herself, Beth had to wonder if she would ever be strong enough to walk away from this man who took her breath away and set her body on fire with just one look. Would it be so bad to take what he\u2019s offering?</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Beth had worked steadily through the morning, and she stood up behind her desk stretching her tired muscles. It was probably the workout from last night that had her fatigued the most. My God, that man knew how to use his tongue and the rest of him wasn\u2019t too shabby, either. She hadn\u2019t realized how lost in her thoughts she was until a snort from the doorway startled her back to the present.</p> <p>Suzy, Ella, and Claire stood there looking at her. Suzy looked disgusted, Claire looked amused, and Ella looked as she always did, supportive. \u201cUgh, I know that look. She\u2019s either thinking about the last time she got lucky or she just got lucky in her office. Just for the record, Claire, as an owner of this company, now objects to any sexual activity in her building, right, Claire?\u201d</p><p>Claire looked at Suzy and laughed. \u201cUm. . . . Sure, yes, whatever she says.\u201d</p><p>Beth stuck out her tongue at Suzy and grabbed her purse to join them. They all chatted about their mornings until they were in Suzy\u2019s SUV. Suzy turned in her seat and looked over at her sister sitting in the rear seat. \u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and address the elephant in the room. I told Claire you have a bun in the oven. You know I suck at keeping secrets from her. Now all of us know and you don\u2019t have to sit through lunch wondering.\u201d</p><p>She could feel her cheeks flushing as Claire gave her a sympathetic look. Ella, bless her heart, quickly changed the subject. The conversation was light and easy and Beth was just starting to relax after placing her lunch order when Suzy decided to move in for the kill. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the status on the whole marriage, white-picket-fence thing that Nick\u2019s trying to sell you?\u201d</p><p>You really had to give Claire credit. She didn\u2019t even look surprised by her best friend\u2019s abrupt question. Ella was looking like she wanted to crawl under the table. She still hadn\u2019t gotten used to Suzy\u2019s direct way of getting straight to the point. \u201cNothing\u2019s really changed; he still wants to marry me, but I told him it\u2019s not gonna happen. Boy, if you think he was pissed off over that, you should have seen his expression when I told him I was still going on my date tonight with Seth. Now, that was a Kodak moment if I\u2019ve ever seen one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhoa, wait a second. Who\u2019s Seth?\u201d Suzy demanded.</p><p>Beth immediately cringed. Way to go, Big Mouth. Now you\u2019ve moved Suzy up to DEFCON, level 5. Lie or tell the truth? Crap, he\u2019s probably already told Gray, so you might as well come clean. \u201cUm, just a guy from the dating service.\u201d Have you lost your mind? No one else knows about the dating service! Three sets of eyes were riveted on her and she fought the urge to slap her hand across her mouth in horror.</p><p>\u201cShit, I need a drink. Someone might have to drive us back to work because I don\u2019t think I can handle any more of this story sober,\u201d Suzy said, groaning. Beth thought she was kidding until she flagged a waiter down and ordered a grande margarita. She held her hand up to keep everyone silent until the large drink was sitting in front of her. After a dramatic gulp, she said, \u201cAll right, let\u2019s hear it.\u201d</p><p>Nervously stirring her drink with a straw, Beth said, \u201cI . . . I, um, joined a dating service a while back. It\u2019s no big deal. I just wanted to meet some new people.\u201d</p><p>Looking stunned, Suzy asked, \u201cYou joined a dating service while you were sleeping with Nick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, it was right before. Since Nick and I aren\u2019t really in a relationship, I\u2019ve still been dating casually.\u201d Oh, God, they are all staring at me. Why did Ella look so shocked? She knew about the dating service. Beth had even tried to talk Ella into joining with her.</p> <p>\u201cSis, I\u2019m not a cheerleader for Nick or anything, but how can you still be dating when you are involved with him? Doesn\u2019t he notice how often you are busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s usually only once or twice a week. He just assumes I\u2019m with Ella. I\u2019m not lying to him; he just doesn\u2019t ask,\u201d she defended herself.</p><p>With a smile, Claire said, \u201cWell, in his defense, he is Nick Merimon. As much as I love my husband and as sexy as he is, I can still appreciate the fact that Nick is hot, hot! It probably never occurred to him to think that you were seeing anyone else. I\u2019m betting this is the first time . . . ever. Just out of curiosity, why are you automatically counting him out? You obviously have feelings for him or you wouldn\u2019t be practically living together. Why won\u2019t you give him a chance? He\u2019s said he wants to marry you and raise this baby with you.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s shoulders suddenly slumped as she whispered what she already knew. \u201cBecause he\u2019ll leave. I can\u2019t let myself get attached to him. I know I am not the type of woman that someone like Nick will end up with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas he said something to you?\u201d Suzy demanded. \u201cI\u2019ll kick his ass. Who does he think he is running my sister down? You\u2019re way too good for him!\u201d</p><p>Suzy was getting to her feet, her face enraged, but Beth managed to pull her back down. \u201cNo, no it\u2019s not that. Nick has never said anything negative to me.\u201d Looking down, she added, \u201cHe seems to love my body . . . a lot. I just know it won\u2019t last, though. I\u2019ve always known that we were short-term.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Suzy said. \u201cYou\u2019ve continued to date this whole time so you would have someone to rebound with immediately, in case Nick left. You never intended for him to last this long, did you?\u201d</p><p>This lunch seemed to be going from bad to worse. Beth was never comfortable being the center of attention, even around her closest friends, and Suzy, Claire, and Ella hadn\u2019t stopped staring at her since she dropped the dating-service bomb. She knew that they weren\u2019t judgmental people, but she could see the shock and another emotion she knew well: pity. \u201cGuys, it\u2019s not that bad. Nick and I have a good time and when he leaves, life will go on. He\u2019ll see the baby whenever he wants to. I would never deny him that right. I just can\u2019t get caught up in what he\u2019s selling. Soon, the new-baby glow will wear off and he will be looking for a way out. I refuse to be a stage-five clinger like all the other members of the Nick Merimon Fan Club.\u201d</p> <p>Suzy chuckled beside her. \u201cStage-five clinger? God help you, Beth, because you are my sister through and through. Hell, you actually shock me on a regular basis now, and I didn\u2019t think that was possible. So you\u2019re testing Nick now to see if he\u2019ll run? Aren\u2019t you? Maybe a little torture? No boom-boom? Making him jealous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no, I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d Then with a laugh of her own, she said, \u201cThere is no way I can withhold the boom-boom. I never get enough of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, TMI! Please don\u2019t say anything else. I can\u2019t get drunk since I have to go back to the office, and this sure isn\u2019t a conversation I can deal with sober,\u201d Suzy moaned.</p><p>Beth took pity on Ella since she was already almost crimson with embarrassment. Ella had confided in her that she was still a virgin and Beth knew that she was easily embarrassed, especially over anything concerning sex. She patted her on the hand and whispered, \u201cSorry, Ella.\u201d</p><p>Ella gave her a shy smile in return and said, \u201cAre you kidding? This is like watching a live taping of Days of our Lives or Desperate Housewives.\u201d</p><p>Everyone around the table laughed and kept it light while they finished eating. When they were waiting for their bill, Claire looked at Beth with what could only be called an evil smile. \u201cSo, Beth, I have an idea. You say that Nick will cut and run when things get tough. I\u2019ve got the perfect way to give him a little test.\u201d Beth wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted to know, but she let Claire continue. \u201cYou know Mom and Tom are on their honeymoon, and Louise and her sister have gone to Florida for a few weeks. Jason and I would really love a date night, and we wouldn\u2019t trust just anyone with Chrissy.\u201d</p><p>Suzy looked at her friend in admiration. \u201cOhhhh, I like where you\u2019re going here. Hey! If you need a babysitter, why haven\u2019t you asked me? Gray and I are perfectly capable of babysitting.\u201d</p><p>Claire threw an arm around her friend\u2019s shoulders and laughed. \u201cThe last time I was at your house you set my diaper bag and purse on the sidewalk when Chrissy started crying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I couldn\u2019t see you pop your boob out one more time. The kid\u2019s going to choke on that thing, or something. Those babies are never going airborne again after the workout she\u2019s giving them.\u201d</p><p>Ella looked even more mortified if that was possible. Beth quickly asked Claire, \u201cYou would actually trust us to babysit for you? You know we don\u2019t actually have much baby experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI trust you completely, Beth. You were an elementary schoolteacher for years. We can go over all of the details and I\u2019ll run you through her routine. She goes to bed early so you guys wouldn\u2019t be on duty the whole time. If you want to see how Nick is around a baby, this is a perfect chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm, okay. Why not? I might as well start getting some practice in, and Nick needs to know what he is trying to get himself into. How about Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>Claire smiled. \u201cThat sounds great. Jason will be so excited. It will be nice to go to a restaurant to eat without spit-up all over us. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a conversation since the baby was born that didn\u2019t involve the contents of her diaper. Maybe we should just use our date time to catch up on our sleep in the car.\u201d</p><p>Suzy snickered. \u201cThat\u2019s just sad. It must be depressing to have a stallion that you never have the energy to ride.\u201d</p><p>Ella almost fainted when Claire smiled and said, \u201cOh, honey, my stallion is never in the stable. I\u2019m never too tired to give him a good workout.\u201d</p><p>Beth grabbed Ella\u2019s elbow and pulled her out of her chair. \u201cLet\u2019s go before you\u2019re ruined forever.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised when Ella said, \u201cOh, man, I just love them. I didn\u2019t know that Claire had a horse, though.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s mouth dropped open in shock. Surely, Ella wasn\u2019t that naive. When Ella doubled over in laughter and said, \u201cGot ya,\u201d Beth had to admit that her shy little friend had certainly come a long, long way.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Beth was relieved to see that Nick wasn\u2019t at her apartment when she arrived home. She didn\u2019t know who she thought she was fooling by insisting that they didn\u2019t live together because he was always here, and she didn\u2019t even question it anymore.</p><p>She quickly showered and pulled on a black jersey dress that landed just above her knees. It was sleeveless with a daring neckline. She pulled on some black sandals that added inches to her height. A pair of simple silver hoops and a matching necklace completed the look. She was supposed to meet Seth at one of her favorite seafood restaurants in half an hour. She grabbed her purse and gave a prayer of thanks that she had avoided a confrontation with Nick.</p><p>Seth was waiting for her in the lobby of Sara J\u2019s. Beth just loved the restaurant\u2019s beautiful view overlooking the marsh in Garden City, South Carolina. She summoned up her best \u201cdate smile\u201d as Seth leaned in to kiss her lightly. \u201cYou look beautiful, Beth. I\u2019m happy to see you again.\u201d</p><p>Seth Jackson was tall and thin. He had sandy blond hair that he kept neatly trimmed and groomed. He was the manager for one of the bigger hotels on the Grand Strand, and he was always trying to convince her to come take advantage of the many amenities that it offered. He placed a polite hand at the small of her back as he led her to the hostess stand. The restaurant was crowded, as usual, but they were quickly seated at a table on the outdoor patio.</p><p>\u201cI thought you might enjoy dining outside this evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is lovely; I\u2019m glad you thought of it.\u201d Conversation with Seth was always easy and uncomplicated, just as life with him would probably be. He was attentive, polite, and funny. He didn\u2019t set her on fire like Nick did, but he wasn\u2019t likely to burn her in the end, either. She ordered a glass of tea and Seth ordered a glass of red wine. When their drinks were delivered, she took a sip of hers and smiled at Seth as he regaled her with tales of the more unusual hotel guests in the last few weeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The hair on the back of her neck started to prickle as she felt someone watching her. She looked around, not noticing anything unusual. You\u2019re paranoid. Who would be watching you? When nothing out of the ordinary happened, she finally loosened up and enjoyed herself. When the door to the outside area opened, her mouth fell open. Sauntering toward her, looking like the devil himself, was none other than Nick. She knew what she must look like to Seth. She had stopped talking in midsentence and was now gaping at the man approaching their table. I wouldn\u2019t hold out much hope of another dinner invitation anytime soon.</p><p>Nick smiled as he reached their table. He laid his hand on her shoulder in a proprietary manner. \u201cWh\u2014 What are you doing here?\u201d she stuttered.</p><p>\u201cHey, princess. I was having dinner with a customer.\u201d</p><p>She looked around suspiciously, seeing no one waiting for him. As if he knew what she was thinking he added, \u201cThey\u2019ve already left. I happened to see you when I was leaving, so I thought I\u2019d come say hello.\u201d Leaning over her shoulder, Nick extended his hand toward Seth. \u201cNick Merimon.\u201d</p> <p>She could see that Seth was very curious about their exchange as he politely shook Nick\u2019s hand and introduced himself. \u201cSo, how do you two know each other?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cWe work together,\u201d Beth answered quickly.</p><p>\u201cWe also live together and Beth is having my baby,\u201d Nick added helpfully.</p><p>Beth watched in horrified fascination as Seth\u2019s uncertain smile slowly slipped off his face as he noticed the embarrassment on hers. \u201cBeth? Is this true?\u201d</p><p>With a weak smile, she said, \u201cWe don\u2019t officially live together; it\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat wasn\u2019t really the part I was asking about,\u201d he said.</p><p>She knew her face was flaming as she searched for an answer that wouldn\u2019t sound as damning as the truth. \u201cEr, yes, I am pregnant,\u201d she admitted, \u201cBut we aren\u2019t in a relationship or anything so I can see other people.\u201d Oh, my God, just shut up. Do you hear yourself? You have just given new meaning to the expression \u201cwhite trash.\u201d</p><p>Seth stood up from the table, now completely flabbergasted. \u201cI think you two need some time alone. Beth . . . good luck.\u201d With those words, he left as if the hounds of hell were nipping at his heels.</p><p>Nick walked around to take the recently vacated chair as she hissed, \u201cWhat in the hell was that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean, princess. If you wanted me to lie for you, then you should have warned me ahead of time. I was just answering his question honestly.\u201d</p><p>Getting to her feet, Beth snapped, \u201cWell, bravo for you then. I\u2019ll leave you here to revel in your honesty.\u201d She saw Nick hastily throw some bills on the table as he followed her out. When he reached over to pluck her keys out of her hand, she rounded on him, full of fury. \u201cGive me my keys, Nick; I just want to go home.\u201d</p> <p>All signs of humor were gone from his handsome face as he said, \u201cYou\u2019re too upset to drive. I\u2019ll take you home and we can pick up your car in the morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine! Just give me back my keys.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in a breath as he laid his hand against her stomach. \u201cThat\u2019s our child in there, Beth. I\u2019m not letting you tear out of here while you\u2019re this upset. I\u2019d never forgive myself if you had an accident and you or the baby was hurt.\u201d</p><p>All of the fight left her as her anger deflated. How could he drive her so crazy one moment and then say something like that in the next moment? He put a hand on the small of her back and gently led her toward his car. When he had her settled in the passenger seat, he walked around to the driver\u2019s side and slid in.</p><p>They drove across town in silence. She was relieved to escape to her bedroom when they reached the apartment. She desperately needed a few moments to herself to come to grips with the train wreck that was her life. She couldn\u2019t believe that Nick had rolled out their dirty laundry for the world to see tonight. Seth wasn\u2019t likely to ever speak to her again. The look on his face had been priceless. Just thinking about it made her start to laugh. Then, once the laughter started, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. Nick stuck his head in the doorway, looking at her as if she had lost her mind. It only made her laugh harder. Soon tears were coursing down her cheeks as she fought to take a breath.</p><p>\u201cUm, princess, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>Suddenly her laughter turned into tears. His concern was her undoing. The enormity of her situation was finally hitting home. Nick sat down on the bed and gathered her into his arms. He cradled her like a child, stroking her hair and murmuring soft words of comfort as she continued to sob. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, baby; I shouldn\u2019t have done that to you. I . . . I didn\u2019t know you liked that guy this much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cThat was actually kinda funny. I\u2019m scared, Nick. I\u2019m having a baby and Suzy\u2019s right; this is a life-changing moment. Everything\u2019s changing and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m strong enough to handle it.\u201d She took a hesitant look at his face, afraid of what she would see there. He probably thinks I\u2019m a pathetic basket case. All I do now is cry and throw up. If I were him, I would have my suitcase packed and waiting at the door.</p> <p>He grabbed a tissue from the nightstand and dried her tears. He kissed her on the forehead and pulled her back into his embrace. \u201cI keep trying to tell you that I\u2019m here for you. This isn\u2019t your baby, this is our baby. Why are you more than willing to go out with a man that you met through a dating service and give him a chance, but not me? We\u2019ve been sleeping together for the last six months, but you\u2019d rather trust a stranger than me?\u201d</p><p>Oh shit, that really sounds bad. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would swear he\u2019s hurt. Has he ever given me reason to believe that I couldn\u2019t trust him? No. With a sigh, she pulled back to study him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; you\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t handled this very well. You have to admit, you do have a bit of a reputation.\u201d Really? You couldn\u2019t just apologize and make nice?</p><p>Chuckling, he said, \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019re feeling better. As for my reputation, princess, I\u2019m a man. I don\u2019t sleep with a different woman every night, but, yes, I have dated my share. Contrary to popular belief though, I\u2019m not some kind of gigolo. I\u2019m perfectly capable of being faithful to one woman. If you haven\u2019t noticed, you\u2019ve had my full attention since the moment we met and I can\u2019t imagine that changing anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>He looked so sincere that she wanted to believe him. Maybe it was time to see what he really was made of. She would give him the chance that he seemed to want so much, but she wasn\u2019t going to make it easy. From now on, Nick would be involved up to his elbows. She would drag him to every doctor\u2019s appointment. They would be on a first-name basis with the employees of Babies-R-Us, where they would shop weekly until they found the perfect breast pump. She would ask him to rub her feet every night and cater to any cravings that she might have. First up though, they would babysit for Claire and Jason tomorrow night. If he made it through that, the games would begin. If he was still standing at the end, then she would beg him to marry her and never look back. Be prepared\u2014he\u2019s never going to make it. Don\u2019t let him break your heart. The man has left a trail of panties and broken hearts from here to Charleston. Don\u2019t forget it!</p><p>She turned to straddle him and pressed a kiss to his mouth. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s take it day by day. I can\u2019t promise anything, but I\u2019m willing to try.\u201d Her heart stuttered as he turned a sexy smile on her. He looked so happy that she almost felt bad about what she planned to put him through. No guts, no glory. When his hand slid slowly up her leg to the curve of her bottom, her thoughts scattered.</p><p>Beth felt the hard line of his erection pressing into her stomach as she lost herself in his kiss. Unlike their usual frantic coupling, Nick set a gentle pace. He drove her wild as he lazily caressed her. By the time he moved over her and took possession of her body, she was almost out of her mind with need.</p><p>He drove into her gently, as if afraid she would break. His mouth covered hers, his tongue tentatively thrusting inside to stake claim. His kiss became wild and uncontrolled, completely at odds with his possession of her body. She wrapped her legs around his hips, forcing him deeper inside her. She was frantic for a release from the building pressure. Each time her body clenched and she was close to going over the edge, he pulled back, refusing to let her go over the other side. After his third retreat, she was so desperate that she sank her teeth into his shoulder. Suddenly, the maddening rhythm was gone and he lost all control. She hung on for dear life as his hips drilled into her and they both found the release that he had been denying them.</p><p>When she floated back to earth, she was certain about one thing; no matter what other problems they might run into down the road, sex would never be one of them.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>They arrived at Jason and Claire\u2019s a few moments before six the next evening. Nick looked completely at ease as they walked through the door. She had to envy his endless supply of confidence and easygoing demeanor. He seemed perfectly content to be spending his Saturday night babysitting.</p><p>Claire showed her Christina\u2019s room and how to make her bottles. Nick stood in the living room talking to Jason as if he hadn\u2019t a care in the world. When Claire and Jason had both kissed Christina good-bye, Claire gave Beth an evil smile and plopped the baby into Nick\u2019s arms. Jason smirked while Claire tried to cover her laugh with a cough. Finally, there was a crack in Nick\u2019s confident fa\u00e7ade. He looked at Claire and asked, \u201cSo, are you guys sure about this? You know that we don\u2019t actually know anything about babies, right?\u201d</p><p>Jason clapped him on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine. We still don\u2019t know what the hell we\u2019re doing most of the time, but you learn. See you guys around midnight.\u201d</p><p>With another smirk, Claire followed Jason out the door.</p><p>As soon as the door closed, Nick held Chrissy out to Beth. She sidestepped him and walked to the couch to relax. Nick continued to stand in the entryway, obviously clueless about his next move.</p><p>\u201cCome on over here and sit down.\u201d She smothered a laugh as he held the baby in front of him like a ticking bomb. When he gingerly settled onto the couch beside her, she gave him a round of applause. Chrissy picked that moment to smile at him adoringly and he was a goner. She saw him melt before her eyes as another female lost her heart to him.</p><p>\u201cHey, beautiful, are you from around here?\u201d Chrissy grinned at him as if she knew exactly what he was saying. \u201cSo, do you want to go out and get a bottle or something one night?\u201d Chrissy gurgled in delight. Apparently, you were never too young to appreciate a hot guy.</p><p>Nick looked at Beth and asked, \u201cSo, what do we do now, just sit here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. Claire said that she had already fed and bathed her. We\u2019ll put her down for bed in about an hour.\u201d</p><p>Nick grinned. \u201cAn hour? Man, we got off good. If we had held them off until seven we would be home free.\u201d He had barely finished his last sentence when all hell broke loose. One moment Chrissy was smiling and the next moment she looked like Linda Blair in The Exorcist.</p><p>My God, they call this a spit-up? It looks more like a nuclear explosion. Nick had vomit dripping down his shirt, running off his arms, and pooling in his lap. Chrissy was apparently thrilled to be rid of the load and cooed happily.</p><p>\u201cHoly fuckamoly!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick! Watch your language.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, she can\u2019t talk. I have puke all over me; don\u2019t you think I deserve the satisfaction of some profanity?\u201d</p><p>Beth started laughing but was silenced when he thrust the baby in her arms. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get this stuff off me before I add some of my own to it.\u201d Giving her an evil grin, he said, \u201cGood luck, honey.\u201d</p><p>Wrinkling her nose at the foul smell, she carried Chrissy to her room and settled her on the changing table. She swiveled her little head around as if looking for Nick. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back soon, sweetie, and Auntie Beth will make sure he holds you again.\u201d She managed to strip the baby\u2019s clothes off and give her a quick bath with the warm baby wipes. Getting her dressed again was more challenging with her little legs kicking frantically. After ten minutes of getting one leg in just to have another kick out, Beth was about to give up. She was at her wit\u2019s end when Nick walked in with damp hair, wearing a T-shirt and shorts.</p><p>\u201cI had to raid Jason\u2019s closet.\u201d Looking at the stains on Beth\u2019s shirt, he added, \u201cYou might want to look through Claire\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will if I ever get Chrissy\u2019s clothes on. It\u2019s like trying to dress a wild animal.\u201d</p><p>Nick walked over and tickled Chrissy on the stomach, sending her off into a fit of giggles. \u201cHere, you hold her up and I\u2019ll slip her legs in.\u201d Finally, with a little teamwork they had her dressed. Beth was exhausted and ready to collapse. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPrincess, go ahead and take a shower, you kinda smell. I\u2019ll rock the baby for a while.\u201d</p><p>Hesitating, she asked, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay alone with her?\u201d He is better at this than I am. I should make a break for it before he changes his mind.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be fine. Don\u2019t take too long, though.\u201d Needing no further encouragement, she rummaged through Claire\u2019s drawers until she found a pair of jogging shorts and a matching top. She made quick work of the shower even though she was tempted to hide out in the bathroom for a while longer.</p><p>When she walked back into the baby\u2019s room, Nick was lying on the floor and Chrissy was sprawled on his chest. Oh, dear God, he is doing baby talk to her. She stood in the doorway watching her big and oh-so-sexy man say, \u201cShe\u2019s a good wittle girl, yesss, she is\u201d and \u201cWonder what Wikipedia has to say about the word wittle?\u201d</p> <p>Nick finally noticed Beth standing at the door and, instead of being embarrassed, he beckoned her to join them. Beth sat on the floor and laughed as he flew Chrissy like an airplane.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve never been around a baby? Because you\u2019re a natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, but it\u2019s not so hard, right?\u201d They both sniffed at the same time. \u201cHey, babe, do you smell something?\u201d He was giving her a suspicious look.</p><p>\u201cHey! Don\u2019t look at me,\u201d she said indignantly.</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not me.\u201d They turned their eyes to Chrissy in horror. \u201cOh, please, no,\u201d Nick whispered. \u201cCheck her, princess.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy me?\u201d she snapped.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, you\u2019re a woman, you know how to handle this crap. No pun intended.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust take her to the changing table and let\u2019s see what we\u2019re dealing with. It probably smells much worse than it actually is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I hope so because it smells like death,\u201d he said, gagging.</p><p>Beth grabbed his arm as he tried to drop and run. \u201cOh, no, big guy, we\u2019re in this together. Grab a diaper and be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould we put on gloves or something?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know, do you see any?\u201d Nick rummaged around, but came up empty-handed. \u201cJust forget it, and let\u2019s get this over with before I\u2019m sick.\u201d She quickly slid Chrissy\u2019s pants off and almost passed out at the sight that greeted her. The diaper looked huge and there was a distinct green outline around the leg openings.</p><p>\u201cDamn! Is that normal? Nick gagged again. \u201cWhat are they feeding the kid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust shut up and hand me some wipes. I\u2019ll open the diaper and you pull it out from under her on the count of three.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you out of your mind? I am not pulling that thing. I\u2019ll open it and you pull the sucker.\u201d</p><p>She moved out of the way muttering, \u201cBig baby.\u201d</p><p>Nick leaned away as far as he could before reaching for the tape on each side of the diaper. \u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>He pulled the tape and opened the diaper. She felt her stomach drop to her feet. \u201cOh, dear God. I can\u2019t Nick, I\u2019ll be sick if I touch that thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPrincess, if I have to pull the diaper out, then you\u2019re on butt duty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cO-okay, I\u2019ll just put a lot of wipes over it. Go ahead and pull.\u201d As Nick removed the diaper and held it out like a bomb, she grabbed a wad of wipes and covered Chrissy\u2019s bottom.</p><p>\u201cBeth, what do I do with this?\u201d Nick asked frantically.</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve got my own problems here.\u201d Nick circled the room looking more and more desperate for somewhere to dispose of the diaper. All of the bedrooms on the bottom level walked out onto the patio. When he walked over and wrenched the door open, she could only gape at him when he tossed the diaper over the railing. \u201cNick! You can\u2019t do that!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? You told me to figure it out, well I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut . . . you can\u2019t throw poop on the beach. You probably just broke at least ten laws. You\u2019ve got to go get it.\u201d She turned her focus back to Chrissy\u2019s rump and was glad to see that it was almost clean. The stack of used wipes beside her was starting to resemble a landfill. Nick had washed his hands so she had him come over and hold the baby on the table while she washed up.</p><p>It again took a team effort to get Chrissy dressed. Beth picked the baby up off the table and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go get the diaper. Take a trash bag and put it inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll hold the baby and you go pick it up,\u201d Nick pleaded. Then wiggling his eyebrows he added, \u201cIf you will, I\u2019ll give you the best sex of your life later.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, she said, \u201cOh, baby, you are so barking up the wrong tree right now. You\u2019ve got nothing to offer me that would make me go pick that up. Be a man and suck it up. How are you going to change our baby\u2019s diaper if you can\u2019t even pick one up?\u201d Ah, yes, insulting the manhood always gets results. Try not to smirk.</p><p>Beth was sure she heard some creative profanity as Nick headed off the deck with a large trash bag in his hand. She knew he had located the diaper when she heard him gagging, which continued all the way into the house. Nuzzling Chrissy\u2019s neck she said, \u201cNow that\u2019s how you bring a big, strong man to his knees.\u201d</p><p>Nick came back with the bag and dumped it in the kitchen trash. He insisted on taking another shower and changing clothes. After a quick sniff of herself, she handed the baby off to him when he returned and showered again as well. When she came out in another one of Claire\u2019s outfits, both Chrissy and Nick looked sleepy. She fixed a bottle and Nick snuggled the baby against his chest, rocking her gently while she ate. Oh, God, other than the diaper-throwing incident, he is better at this than I am. He doesn\u2019t seem scared at all.</p><p>They walked into Chrissy\u2019s room together and tucked her into her crib. Beth left the door cracked so they could hear her if she woke up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m beat,\u201d she said as she flopped on the couch beside Nick. \u201cHow can it be only seven thirty? I feel like we have been here for days. How in the world are we ever going to take care of a baby twenty-four-seven?\u201d</p><p>Nick patted her absently. \u201cWe\u2019ll get used to it. The first time is the hardest. Plus when it\u2019s your own kid, you know you don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I guess,\u201d she said doubtfully. She felt herself starting to nod off and dimly registered Nick slumping beside her.</p><p>Claire stood in front of the couch surveying the scene before her. Jason dropped his arm around her shoulders and she felt him shaking with laughter. \u201cMan, look at that train wreck.\u201d Jason chuckled.</p><p>\u201cJason, stop. They helped us out so we could have a night out. They do look pretty rough though, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRough is an understatement. Now I know how bad we must have looked for the first couple of months. No wonder everyone at work kept giving me that pitying expression. I must have looked like hell. Hey, are those my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, and I think Beth has mine on. It looks like Chrissy showed them no mercy.\u201d Claire grabbed her cell phone from her purse and snapped a picture of the sleeping couple.</p><p>Jason asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>Looking guilty, she said, \u201cUm, I\u2019m taking a picture to show Suzy. She\u2019s gonna love this. It looks like two homeless people crash-landed on our couch.\u201d</p><p>Jason kissed the tip of her nose and said, \u201cLet\u2019s wake them up and get them out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, maybe we should just let them sleep here; they look beat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your call, but I believe you promised to show me some of your old stripper moves tonight.\u201d</p><p>Claire\u2019s eyes widened and her breathing became heavy at seeing the desire in Jason\u2019s eyes. Suddenly she grabbed Beth\u2019s shoulder and started shaking her. \u201cTime to go home, you two.\u201d</p><p>Jason quirked a brow at her. \u201cI thought you wanted to let them rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cScrew that. Hurry up and help me wake them. I\u2019ll give you a bonus if you can get them out the door in less than five minutes.\u201d</p><p>Smiling in anticipation, Jason said, \u201cYou\u2019re on.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Beth and Nick fell face-first onto the bed when they got back to the apartment. Neither of them mentioned making love. My God, she was barely pregnant and already their sex life was starting to suffer.</p><p>Claire and Jason had smirked at them when they had shaken them awake. When Beth pulled herself from bed to brush her teeth she got a glimpse of the reason. She did not even recognize the woman in the mirror. Her hair was standing up in every possible direction, her clothes were wrinkled and her mascara had smeared, making her look like a raccoon. Ugh, just wash your face, brush your teeth, and try to tackle this in the morning. Nick probably looks like a million bucks.</p><p>Nick was still lying in the same place when she crawled back into bed. She nudged him with her elbow, trying to roll him onto his side of the bed. \u201cHey, babe, move over. I\u2019m hanging off the end over here.\u201d Suddenly, he sprang from the bed looking around the room wildly.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the baby? Oh, shit, we lost her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about? We don\u2019t have a baby yet.\u201d Suddenly, it hit her that he was still asleep. His eyes were open, but unfocused, and he was obviously upset. Lowering her voice to keep from startling him, she said gently, \u201cHoney, we\u2019re home now. Claire and Jason have Chrissy and she\u2019s asleep in her crib. We didn\u2019t lose her.\u201d He still stood there clasping and unclasping his fists. Great, what do I do now? Pour water over him? He\u2019ll probably punch me if I try to touch him. Let him stand there all night?</p><p>Finally, she decided a loud noise might jolt him out of his sleep. Hopefully, it wouldn\u2019t give him a heart attack. She grabbed a book off her bedside table and heaved it at the closet door. The resulting crash sounded like the walls were caving in. Maybe a little too much force behind the throw. Nick jerked and looked around the room in confusion. She was relieved to see that he was really looking at her now and not through her. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou were dreaming and I was trying to wake you up. Do you normally talk and walk in your sleep?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at her in disbelief. \u201cUm, no, I\u2019m pretty sure I don\u2019t. Are you sure you weren\u2019t asleep yourself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope, I was just coming back from the bathroom when you jumped off the bed and started trying to find the baby. I assumed you meant Chrissy.\u201d He still looked skeptical, but she was too tired to try to convince him. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed, why don\u2019t you get cleaned up, too.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt like his head had barely touched the pillow when Beth started moaning beside him. When he reached out to touch her, she jumped from the bed and ran into the bathroom. He winced in sympathy as he heard the now-familiar sound of her being sick. He hurried into the bathroom and lowered himself beside her. He pulled her hair back from her face and rubbed her back.</p><p>When she finally seemed to have nothing left, he picked her up and lowered her onto the sink counter where he washed her face and helped her rinse her mouth and brush her teeth. Seeing her like this made him want to cut his dick off. He really hoped that she was not sick like this the whole pregnancy because he didn\u2019t think either of them could survive. She\u2019s the one having to puke her guts out every day; you\u2019re getting off easy. She always allowed him to care for her after she was sick. She never complained as he cleaned her up and carried her to bed. He wrapped his arms around her and settled her against his chest. He kissed her neck and whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, princess. I\u2019d take your place if I could.\u201d</p><p>Tonight had been something out of a horror story at times, but he had loved it. Taking care of Chrissy with Beth had shown him a glimpse of something he never thought he would want: a family. He knew it would be hard, but he also knew that eventually they would hit their stride and, after a while, the small stuff like being peed, pooped, and puked on wouldn\u2019t throw them as much. Tonight they had resembled two circus monkeys, but it would not always be that way.</p><p>Now he just needed to keep his cool and show Beth that he could handle anything she threw his way. Calm, cool, and rational. He definitely had this.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cWhoa, where the hell are you putting that?\u201d Nick demanded. They were at her first doctor\u2019s appointment and Nick spoke up just as the ultrasound technician raised the condom-covered probe toward Beth. You\u2019re blowing it, buddy. What happened to calm, cool and rational? Get it together; they\u2019re staring at you. Nick plastered on his default grin that never failed to charm. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you at least buy her a drink before you bring that thing out?\u201d</p><p>Mindy, the ultrasound technician, chuckled and said, \u201cYou might as well get used to it, Dad. You\u2019ll have at least one more of the internal ultrasounds before we are able to switch to the external ones. The baby can only be viewed internally for the first few months. Remember, this is more uncomfortable for Mom than for Dad.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He really wished she would stop with the Mom and Dad stuff because it made them sound like her parents. He could tell by the smirk on Beth\u2019s face that she knew exactly what he was thinking.</p><p>Beth took a deep breath as Mindy inserted the probe. He quickly averted his gaze. \u201cOkay, Mom and Dad, if you look at the screen you\u2019ll now see an image of the uterus. I\u2019m just going to get some measurements and then we will continue on.\u201d After declaring Beth\u2019s uterus to be perfect, she continued. \u201cNow, here is the yolk sac and the fetal pole. I\u2019m just going to measure those as well so we can get an estimate of the baby\u2019s approximate age.\u201d</p><p>Confused, Nick asked, \u201cWhat are a yolk sac and a fetal pole? Where is the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baby gets nourishment from the yolk sac at this point. The fetal pole is another word for the baby right now. They go through several different stages in the pregnancy. If we are lucky today, we will see the heartbeat as well.\u201d</p> <p>Nick watched the screen in fascination as Mindy made her measurements. Beth looked shell-shocked. He took her hand, trying to give her the reassurance that she looked in desperate need of.</p><p>\u201cOkay, Mom and Dad, let\u2019s see if we can find the heartbeat. You should see a little fluttering on the screen.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Nick saw a flickering on the screen and the room filled with a thumping sound. He looked at Beth and she had tears running down her face as they looked at their baby\u2019s heart beating. \u201cOh, yeah, there it is,\u201d Mindy said. \u201cI thought so, but I wasn\u2019t sure until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere what is?\u201d Beth demanded. \u201cIs something wrong with the baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, Mom, the babies both look just fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe babies?\u201d Beth choked out. \u201cYou mean baby, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there are two babies in there. I thought I saw two yolk sacs, and there are definitely two heartbeats, see there?\u201d She pointed to the two areas flicking on the screen. \u201cCongratulations, you\u2019re having twins. How exciting!\u201d</p><p>Nick didn\u2019t think it was possible for someone to look as green as Beth did at that moment. He should know because he felt the same way she looked. Twins? Heaven help them.</p><p>Oh my God! What have we done? How can we possibly handle twins? One baby kicked our ass last night. This can\u2019t be happening. I\u2019ll be huge. Oh, crap, I cannot believe I\u2019m worrying about gaining weight. Focus on the big picture; you are having twins, with Nick!</p><p>\u201cPrincess, are you okay?\u201d Nick\u2019s voice pulled her out of the fog that had descended over her after the declaration of twins. She looked around, realizing that Nick and Mindy were staring at her, waiting for a reaction. I wonder what they would think if I passed out right here?</p><p>\u201cI . . . I\u2019m fine. Just a little surprised.\u201d Looking at Nick, she continued, \u201cWow, twins, right?\u201d Why does he look so unruffled and cool? I am practically a stuttering mess and he looks like Mr. Hot Father-to-be. Mindy can\u2019t take her eyes off him. Back off, cougar, he\u2019s with me.</p> <p>Suddenly all business, Mindy handed them their first picture of the baby\u2014or babies\u2014and helped Beth up from the table. Beth went behind the curtain to get dressed and then met Nick in the hallway. \u201cYou can go back to the waiting room now and the nurse will call you back for your first appointment,\u201d Mindy said.</p><p>Before she thought about it, Beth blurted out, \u201cOh, God, there\u2019s more?\u201d Mindy gave her a motherly pat on the shoulder and opened the door for them to the waiting room. She wasn\u2019t sure but she could have sworn that Mindy then gave Nick a not-so-motherly look of female appreciation.</p><p>They settled back into their seats in the waiting room. It seemed to Beth like every eye in the room was focused on Nick. Of course, it did not take much to figure out why. Most of the men who accompanied their wives or girlfriends were just Average Joes. Nick, on the other hand, looked like he could pose for Playgirl magazine. She hated to admit it, but she was proud to be sitting beside him. Amazing. I am not jealous of these skinny girls anymore. I have a man beside me that they would all love to have. Score one for all of the former fatties in the world!</p><p>Nick wrapped his hand around hers and brought it to his lips. \u201cYou know that everything will be okay, right? I know this is a lot to take in, but we can handle it. We need to look for a bigger place soon and we can hire some help if we need to. Claire and Jason will be happy to let us use Chrissy for more training. How about some of those baby classes, too?\u201d</p><p>Beth finally put her hand over his mouth and said, \u201cPlease stop talking. I appreciate the reassurances, but I really want to make it home before I freak and if you keep talking that isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Either you get me a bag to breathe in or we start talking about the weather. I cannot process things as fast as you can. Right now, all I can picture is my stomach dragging on the floor and my ass stuck in the door. You can solve all of our problems tomorrow; for right now just let me finish my panic attack.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cOkay, princess. I\u2019ll just read this breast-feeding magazine and keep my mouth shut.\u201d</p> <p>Beth thought he was kidding until she caught sight of some pictures. They could put National Geographic to shame. She jerked the magazine out of his hands and muttered, \u201cJust stare at the walls, please.\u201d</p><p>All too soon, the nurse was calling them back. Beth was mortified when the nurse stopped at a busy area and thrust a plastic cup in her hand. \u201cTake this in the restroom there and give me a urine specimen. When you\u2019re finished bring the cup out with you.\u201d Then, handing her two packets, she continued, \u201cPlease wipe from front to back twice before gathering your specimen.\u201d</p><p>Oh, dear Lord. Weren\u2019t there supposed to be medical privacy regulations? Now at least five people standing near her knew that she was going to pee in a cup and how she would be wiping before she did it. Nick leaned against the wall looking at her with amusement. She quickly entered the bathroom and shut the door. How can I possibly pee knowing they are waiting for me? I\u2019m a timid tinkler at the best of times. She finally turned on the water full blast, hoping it would inspire her to go, as well as block out the noise in the hallway. After what seemed like an hour, she managed to collect a small amount in the cup.</p><p>The nurse looked at the cup disapprovingly, saying, \u201cI hope this is enough.\u201d</p><p>Next, she was told to sit in a chair while the nurse drew three tubes of blood and stuck her finger. Finally, the nurse took a blood pressure cuff and wrapped it around her arm. Beth had so many bad memories about those things. When she was at her heaviest, the regular cuffs didn\u2019t fit. The nurses either tried to hold them on her arm, which ended with them popping open, or made Beth wait while they searched for a large cuff. The indignity of having that happen never got any less humiliating. Beth often wondered why all doctors didn\u2019t just use the larger cuff and save some of their patients from a lot of embarrassment.</p><p>Nick reached out to pat her shoulder, obviously picking up on her mood even if he didn\u2019t know the cause. She breathed a sigh of relief as the nurse finally let her up from the chair only to lead her directly to her ultimate nightmare: the scales. Why had she not realized that this would happen? She would have made Nick wait in the other room had she thought about having to weigh in in front of him. She knew the number on the scales was acceptable and in normal range, but it didn\u2019t lessen the nausea she felt every time she stepped on.</p><p>She looked wildly around the area, hoping there was a position that would give her some privacy. When she saw the large, digital display on the wall above the scales, she knew it was hopeless. I can\u2019t get on the scales in front of him, I just can\u2019t! The nurse was waving her forward impatiently as she looked at Nick. He raised an eyebrow as if to ask what was going on. She didn\u2019t want to voice her insecurities in front of the nurse, but if she delayed any longer, the nurse was going to forcibly pull her on the scales.</p><p>She felt Nick\u2019s hand at her back. \u201cHoney, do you mind if I walk down the hall to the water fountain while you\u2019re finishing up here?\u201d</p><p>Beth sagged in relief. She turned a grateful look on him and said, \u201cNo, that would be great, thanks.\u201d He gave her a smile of encouragement and walked quickly down the hall and out of sight. She jumped on the scale quickly and, as she always did in a doctor\u2019s office, turned her head to keep from looking at the number.</p><p>Nick quickly walked away from Beth and didn\u2019t stop until he rounded the corner, out of sight. His heart squeezed at the look of pure terror on her face as she tried to avoid getting on the scales in front of him. It had taken him a minute to figure out why she was hesitating, even though the nurse was trying to rush her to step on. When she finally looked at him, he could see the panic in her eyes and it finally hit him. She seemed so confident to him, especially sexually, that it was hard for him to imagine her suffering from confidence or body-image issues, but she clearly did.</p><p>Suzy had warned him when he first moved in with them at Gray\u2019s that he\u2019d better never say anything to Beth about her weight. Apparently, at one time, Beth had been overweight and Suzy was fiercely protective of her sister\u2019s feelings. It was a threat that was unnecessary. He had never been one to make fun of other people, even when he was in school, and he certainly would never do anything to upset Beth. She was a beautiful person, both inside and out, and, regardless of her size, she would still be a beautiful person to him. He had dated a variety of women in his time and, contrary to popular belief, not all of them were stick-thin models. He loved women with curves. He hated to take a woman to a restaurant and have them order water and a salad. It made him too self-conscious to enjoy his own meal.</p><p>Beth might never finish her meal, but at least she enjoyed all things in moderation. He knew she worked out regularly, which he admired. She had a stunning body and he practically drooled every time she walked by.</p><p>How would she be able to mentally handle the changes in her body that this pregnancy would bring? That was something that he hadn\u2019t even considered, but for Beth would it be more traumatic than the baby? He had never given a thought to how scared she might be to gain weight. Was there a way to recommend that she see a counselor without her blowing up at him? The terror in her eyes just a few minutes ago went far beyond the normal aversion that women had to telling their real age or weight. Maybe Suzy could give him some advice. Yeah . . . maybe. Unless she still wants to cut off your penis for getting her baby sister pregnant.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Nick and Beth drove straight to work from her doctor\u2019s appointment. The drive gave her some time to adjust to the shock of learning she was pregnant with twins.</p><p>Nick had been the loving partner that women dream of. When they met with her doctor, who was a very nice middle-aged woman who instantly made Beth feel comfortable, he had asked most of the questions. Since Beth was pregnant with twins, she would need to be more closely monitored as her pregnancy advanced. Nick had been intensely interested in everything the doctor had said. At one point, Beth found her head going back and forth just trying to follow the conversation between them. She had started to remind them that she was in the room, too. Dr. Winters clearly was charmed by Nick and thought Beth a lucky girl.</p><p>Ella was standing in the lobby of Danvers when she and Nick came in the front entrance. Beth gave him a quick kiss good-bye and walked over to join her friend. \u201cHey, Ella, are you just getting in, too?\u201d Ella continued to stare across the room and Beth followed her gaze, curious as to what was holding her friend\u2019s attention. Across the lobby stood Declan with a striking blond woman who looked about Beth\u2019s own age and a very handsome man, wearing what Beth was sure was an expensive suit. Turning back to Ella she asked, \u201cWho are those people with Declan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Ella whispered. \u201cShe\u2019s really pretty and she has her arm through Declan\u2019s. Do you think she\u2019s his girlfriend?\u201d</p><p>Beth heard the note of despair in Ella\u2019s voice and wondered again what her relationship with Declan was. She had walked in on them talking frequently. Actually, Ella seemed to be the only one with whom Declan made small talk. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen either of them around here before, but this is a big place so it could be a customer.\u201d As they continued to stand and stare, Claire walked through the door with Starbucks cups in hand. When she spotted them, she walked over with a smile on her face.</p><p>\u201cHey, you two. I was just bringing Jason some coffee. I\u2019ll admit he\u2019s getting pretty spoiled from me dropping in. Thank God Louise is back and was over to get her Chrissy fix early this morning.\u201d Finally noticing that they were looking across the room, Claire turned to look as well. \u201cHey, Ava and Brant are here. I better hurry up and deliver this coffee. I think they have a meeting with Jason soon.\u201d</p><p>Claire now had Beth and Ella\u2019s complete attention. \u201cWho are they?\u201d Beth asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s Declan\u2019s sister, Ava, and his brother, Brant. They own a company that makes one of the components that we use here.\u201d Then, lowering her voice, Claire continued. \u201cJason is interested in buying their company and bringing them on board. They\u2019re headquartered near Charlotte, North Carolina.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes Declan own part of their company?\u201d Beth asked curiously.</p><p>\u201cYeah, from what I gather, it was left to them by their father when he passed away. Ava and Brant run the day-to-day operations and Declan handles the troubleshooting. It\u2019s a very successful business and I know Jason would like to bring it into the Danvers family. Just as we did with Mericom and Gray and Nick, Ava and Brant would relocate to Myrtle Beach and work from the corporate office.\u201d</p><p>Beth saw Declan looking at Ella inquiringly. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019ve caught us staring; maybe we should go over and introduce ourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Claire agreed. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to take off like we are guilty of talking about them\u2014even though we are.\u201d</p><p>Ella reluctantly followed them as they walked across the lobby to greet Declan and his family. Claire stepped forward first and graciously offered a hand to each sibling. Beth followed her lead and then all eyes turned to Ella expectantly. Beth could see the slight flush on her friend\u2019s cheeks as she squared her shoulders and introduced herself to Ava and Brant. When she came to a stop at Declan, he gave her a soft smile and, if it was possible, she flushed even more.</p><p>Again, Beth wondered how Declan felt about Ella. She was sure that Ella had a crush on him. Maybe he was just being nice to her, but something in his eyes made Beth pause. She suspected there was something more than polite friendliness when he looked at Ella. Beth wanted to tell her to start running and never stop because Declan was more than Ella could handle. She needed a nice, dependable guy who would worship the ground she walked on. Declan would shake the very foundation under her, and Beth seriously doubted if Ella would ever recover. Nick might be a bad boy in the ladies\u2019 man sense, but Declan was just a bad boy, period.</p><p>They all loaded onto the elevator and Claire exited several floors later with the Stone family. Oh God. Ella just checked out Declan\u2019s ass as he left the elevator. I need to have a serious talk with her soon, even if I\u2019m not the best one to give advice. After all, I did get accidentally pregnant with Nick\u2019s babies. Maybe I should send Suzy to have a chat with her. It might scare the hell out of Ella, but she wasn\u2019t likely to soon forget it.</p><p>Beth parted ways with Ella at the reception desk and continued on to her office. She needed a few moments to come to grips with her doctor\u2019s appointment before she had to face Suzy. But just as she finished the thought, the door burst open and her sister strode in. She carefully bit back the groan before it escaped her lips. Suzy perched on the corner of her desk and leaned in closer to Beth.</p><p>\u201cSo when did you get in?\u201d Suzy asked.</p><p>\u201cA few minutes ago. I was just coming to your office,\u201d Beth lied.</p><p>\u201cSo, um, what happened at the baby doctor? Is it in the right place and all?\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled at Suzy\u2019s obvious discomfort talking about the pregnancy. You would think after Claire\u2019s pregnancy that she would be used to it, but she still looked nauseous whenever babies were mentioned. \u201cYeah, they are just as they should be.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Suzy said, \u201cOh, well, good, glad to hear it.\u201d Suddenly her head jerked up and she asked, \u201cThey? Shit, please tell me you didn\u2019t say that word.\u201d</p><p>Beth buried her face in her hands and mumbled, \u201cYou heard me right. I\u2019m having twins; can you believe it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoly shit, how did this happen!\u201d</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t help but smile at her sister\u2019s question. \u201cThe usual way, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Suzy stood up from the corner of the desk and slumped backward in the chair behind her. \u201cMy God, what are you doing to do? I mean\u2014two babies? Hell, just one freaks me out. I\u2019m not going to babysit, but I will at least pay for a babysitter on a regular basis for you, how about that?\u201d</p><p>Beth chuckled. \u201cThanks, sis. It hasn\u2019t really sunk in yet so I don\u2019t know what we will do. I just need some time to think.\u201d</p><p>Suzy jumped up and said, \u201cHey, I know just what you need: a distraction!\u201d</p><p>This can\u2019t be good. \u201cWhat kind of distraction?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need you to help me plan this wedding thingy. Apparently, Gray isn\u2019t going to settle for living together forever. He wants to make it official. I told him it would be something simple. I am not walking down the aisle in a church in a gown bigger than I am.\u201d</p><p>Beth clapped her hands in excitement. This was exactly what she needed to take her mind off her own problems. Of course, Suzy would probably give the term bridezilla new meaning, but it sounded like fun. Suddenly, another thought had Beth frowning. Unless we can pull this wedding together in a month, I\u2019m going to look like a whale. Poor Beth, always a bridesmaid, never a bride.</p> <p>While Beth was pondering that depressing thought, Suzy dropped another bombshell. \u201cThe parents are coming for dinner Friday night. I told them you would be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat! Have you lost your mind? I can\u2019t see them now; they\u2019ll know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, they won\u2019t. I\u2019m doing you a favor. We\u2019ll get the dog-and-pony show out of the way before you start showing and if they decide to skip the wedding, we probably won\u2019t see them again until after the babies are born. If it\u2019s any consolation to you, Gray is sweating bullets. I tried to tell him that our parents aren\u2019t the type to come in and try to defend their little girl\u2019s virtue. As long as he has a good IQ, they will be thrilled.\u201d</p><p>Beth snickered. \u201cHow will we know? Their facial expressions never change. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would swear they got Botox. So, should I bring Nick with me?\u201d</p><p>With an evil smile, Suzy said, \u201cOh, yeah, he\u2019s not getting out of this. Gray probably needs the moral support, too. He thought we should meet them at a restaurant so we could all go our separate ways afterward, but I insisted they come to the house.\u201d</p><p>Beth had to wonder where her sister\u2019s head was. \u201cDid you really think that through? Of course Nick and I can just go home after dinner, but you and Gray will be stuck with them until they decide to leave.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace, Suzy said, \u201cShit, I didn\u2019t think of that. If I get desperate, I\u2019ll have to turn on the television and find one of the comedies. You know how much they hate meaningless shows. I blocked the science channel long ago, so we should be safe.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed as Suzy stood to leave. Just as she opened the door, Suzy said, \u201cHey, I loved the picture of you and Nick passed out on the couch after your night of babysitting. It looked brutal. You guys are in so much trouble\u2014you know that, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth flipped one of her sister\u2019s favorite hand gestures back at her. Were there no secrets anymore? She didn\u2019t think they had done too badly watching Chrissy. No one had to go to the emergency room and they had managed not to panic . . . much. Suzy is right; we are in trouble.</p><p>Nick sat in his office chair staring out the window. He was proud of how well he had held it together through the doctor\u2019s appointment and the drive to work. Now that the shock was wearing off, panic was setting in. Twins? Dear Lord, what were they going to do? He could think of only one answer to the question. Mom, help! His mother always had an answer for everything and he sincerely hoped she would have some advice on fatherhood.</p><p>With that thought, he remembered the conversation he and his father had had when Gray thought he had fathered a child with Reva. His father had lectured him about safe sex and promised to revisit the conversation if he did something stupid. Now his father would have to break out that lecture again. How about not one grandchild but two? Oh, yeah, I have been a busy boy.</p><p>He had talked nonstop on the way to the office to fill the silence. He wasn\u2019t ready to have an intense conversation with Beth over their future, and he always talked a lot when he was nervous. But now that he was gathering his wits about him, he realized that not much had changed. Sure, there was another baby now, but he was still in it for the long haul. Seeing the heartbeats on the ultrasound had made it feel so real. Beth was carrying his babies inside her. Babies they had created together. He was both scared to death and strangely excited. He was going to be a father, something he had never imagined.</p><p>He was jerked from his thoughts when Gray walked in unannounced and raised an eyebrow at his expression. He imagined he looked like he was in shock. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>Clearing his throat, Nick said, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s fine. Beth had her first doctor\u2019s appointment this morning and, would you believe, we\u2019re having twins?\u201d</p><p>Gray rocked back on his heels, visibly taken aback by the news. \u201cDamn. I mean congratulations. Wow, that is some news. How are you two handling all of this?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed at his brother\u2019s attempt to sound excited. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had time to talk about it. We came straight to work. I thought I would piss my pants at first, but now I\u2019m down to just the slight urge to pass out. I think Beth is still reeling, too.\u201d Then, looking his brother in the eye, he added, \u201cI\u2019m with her, though. She won\u2019t do this alone. Those are my babies and I\u2019ll never leave them. She might try to force me away, but it\u2019s not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love her?\u201d Gray asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cLove? Hell, I don\u2019t even know what that is. I care about her. I can\u2019t keep my hands off her and I want to be with her. I don\u2019t need to label it. It is what it is and I\u2019m happy with that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if that\u2019s not enough for Beth? Don\u2019t you think she deserves the whole package? Plenty of people raise children that aren\u2019t together.\u201d</p><p>Jumping up from his chair, Nick walked over to his brother, snapping, \u201cWhat do you know about us? Your romance hasn\u2019t been too smooth, either, so I don\u2019t think we need any advice from you.\u201d</p><p>Instead of being mad at his harsh statement, Gray clapped him on the back and smiled. \u201cGood answer. I think you two will be just fine.\u201d</p><p>Without another word, Gray walked out the door and left him baffled.</p><p>It\u2019s official, the Merimon brothers have lost their minds.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Later that day, back at home, Beth shifted around uncomfortably and wondered if she was going to have to resort to \u201cbarbecuing alone\u201d as Nick called it. Why am I so horny? Even though they had slept together less than twenty-four hours ago, she felt like it had been years. If she had hit one more pothole in the road on the way home, she would have probably had an orgasm from the bump.</p><p>As soon as Nick walked in the door, she wrapped herself around him. He probably didn\u2019t even know what hit him. He had barely dropped his briefcase on the floor before she was thrusting her hands in his hair and pulling his mouth down to hers. She groaned as the heat of his mouth met hers. You had to give the guy credit; he didn\u2019t ask her any questions. Buttons were flying, hands were grabbing and mouths were clinging. She couldn\u2019t remember ever being this desperate to have a man inside her. This man.</p><p>Her hands wrestled with his belt and then the button at the waistband of his slacks. Finally, she had her hand inside his briefs and his erection swelled in her hand. She moaned low in her throat, desperate for his possession.</p><p>Nick grabbed the cheeks of her ass and squeezed them while his tongue nipped and sucked at her bottom lip and her tongue. Beth pushed him backward, aiming for the chair, but his feet got tangled in his pants and they ended up in a startled heap on the floor. Her breath left her in a whoosh and she could only imagine how Nick must be faring with the weight of her body pushing against his. As she started to shift to the side, he gripped her hips and whispered softly, \u201cOh no, baby, finish what you started.\u201d</p><p>That was all the encouragement she needed. She quickly pushed his briefs down and released his cock to her hungry gaze. Instead of raising herself to lower her panties, she slid them to the side. Circling her hand around his length, she raised herself above him and then lowered onto him slowly, inch by inch. She couldn\u2019t remember anything ever feeling better than the slide of his body into hers.</p><p>Nick groaned and raised his hips to meet hers. She threw her head back in ecstasy as he caught her newly sensitive breasts in his hands and rubbed the nipples between his thumb and forefinger. She felt a lightning bolt directly to her core as he continued to rub and tweak her nipples almost to the point of pain. With his next tug, she felt her body convulse around his as spasms of pleasure rippled through her body.</p><p>His hands moved from her breasts to her ass as he ground into her while she rode the crest of her orgasm. When the ripples subsided, Beth realized that he was still hard inside her. Looking down into his handsome, flushed face, she felt desire start to build in her again. Nick circled his hand around and palmed her mound. One of his fingers slid past her slit and flicked her tightly budded clit. Beth moaned as pleasure coursed anew through her body. She rocked her hips against him trying to rub against his hand while pulling him deeper inside her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard his breathing and shouts grow hoarse as they both strained for release. His fingers were relentless, drawing out a tidal wave of pleasure like she had never known, which washed over her. A scream loud enough to jolt the neighbors ripped from her throat, followed by a shout of release as Nick exploded inside her.</p><p>Still joined together, she wilted on top of him as stars continued to dance in front of her eyes. Sweat dripped off them as they gasped for breath.</p><p>She felt Nick\u2019s chest rumble against her own as he gently played with her hair. \u201cI could get used to this, princess.\u201d Then wincing, he continued, \u201cI have something sticking me in the ass that\u2019s killing me.\u201d</p><p>Gently separating from him, she got shakily to her feet so he could roll over. She was horrified when she saw his cell phone lying under him. Nick started laughing when he saw the phone. Grabbing it, he looked at the display and groaned. \u201cOh no, baby, we butt dialed my mom while you were riding me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Oh, my God, no!\u201d Beth felt all the blood draining from her face. \u201cDid she answer?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked over his phone muttering, \u201cYeah, looks like the call lasted for a couple of minutes.\u201d Giving her a hopeful expression he said, \u201cShe probably couldn\u2019t hear anything with the phone being under my butt.\u201d</p><p>Beth cringed as she imagined his mother hearing her yelling, \u201cOh, Nick, harder, oh yeahhh.\u201d She dropped to the couch in mortification. \u201cI can never face your mother now, you know that, right? You will have to take the kids over there by yourself. I\u2019m sure she would rather not have to face the slut that was doing her son while he called her.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, not looking the least bit concerned. \u201cDon\u2019t get all worked up over it. I\u2019m sure she had no idea what was going on. Hell, I can\u2019t hear half the time on the damn thing when it\u2019s directly against my ear.\u201d At that moment, his phone rang and he winced. \u201cIt\u2019s my mother. Just stay quiet and I\u2019ll tell her I\u2019m somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>Beth slumped in a nearby chair, her face flushed with embarrassment. With a smile of reassurance, Nick answered the call. \u201cHey, Mom, what\u2019s up?\u201d He was silent for a moment, apparently listening to her talk. \u201cOh, sorry about that. I just left the gym. I had my phone in my back pocket and I probably butt dialed you by accident.\u201d With an evil grin, he added, \u201cThey had the music on pretty loud, that\u2019s probably what you heard. A porn flick\u2014I wish. What kind of gym are you going to?\u201d he teased. He changed the subject on that note and Beth breathed a sigh of relief when he ended the call.</p> <p>\u201cOh, God, why did you say porn flick?\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cShe said my gym sounded like the soundtrack of a porn flick.\u201d Wiggling his eyebrows he laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty accurate, huh?\u201d She tossed a pillow at him that landed against the side of his head. Still grinning he said, \u201cSpeaking of porn, thanks for the mighty fine welcome home, princess.\u201d</p><p>She was surprised that she could still blush around him, but she felt her cheeks heat even more. \u201cBlame it on the babies. My hormones are going crazy and you are the lucky beneficiary.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly looking alarmed he asked, \u201cShould we be doing that? I\u2019m not going to hit them, am I?\u201d</p><p>Beth threw back her head and laughed. \u201cKind of flattering yourself there, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa-ha, you know what I mean. This is safe, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor said it was fine, remember? Of course, if you want to wait for nine months, I\u2019ll understand,\u201d she teased.</p><p>\u201cIf my welcome home was any indication, I don\u2019t think you could make it, princess.\u201d Rising from the floor, he held a hand out to her, giving her that signature grin she couldn\u2019t resist. \u201cLet\u2019s go shower off and have dinner. If you\u2019re a good girl, I\u2019ll let you wash my front.\u201d</p><p>She could have played hard to get, but why bother? They both knew that she would love to do his front, and she knew he would return the favor. It was a win-win for everyone.</p><p>Around four in the morning, she woke up feeling sick once again. Couldn\u2019t she have the normal morning sickness that happened after she actually got up? She lay in bed trying to fight off the waves of nausea consuming her. Finally, when she could delay no longer, she jumped from the bed and bolted to her second home: the toilet. She felt Nick\u2019s hand on her back soon after and sagged against him weakly. He didn\u2019t say anything for a few minutes; he just pulled back her hair and rubbed her back in between bouts.</p><p>When she had nothing left inside her, he picked her up as he usually did and sat her on the bathroom counter. She was surprised when he opened a new toothbrush for her. Seeing her questioning look, he said, \u201cI bought you a dozen of these. I know you don\u2019t want to use the same toothbrush after being sick.\u201d</p><p>Beth was surprised at how his small act of kindness moved her. His thinking of something so small touched her more than she could say. She gave him a smile of gratitude and quickly brushed her teeth. He wiped her face with a wet cloth and then carried her back to bed. They had developed a routine in the last week. He supported her while she was sick, cleaned her up, and tucked her back into bed. He then curved his body around hers, gently stroking her until she drifted to sleep. He made the sickness bearable and, during those times, she felt cherished.</p><p>When she awoke a few hours later, Nick was already up and drinking a cup of coffee. She quickly showered and walked to her closet to pull out a pair of slacks. When she attempted to button them, something happened that almost stopped her heart: they wouldn\u2019t zip. She felt the blood drain from her face as she noticed how tight the pants were. For someone terrified of gaining extra weight back, this was a nightmare come true. Nick walked in the bedroom as she was staring at herself in the mirror. He noticed her look of panic and came to a sudden halt. Alarmed, he took her arm and asked, \u201cPrincess, what\u2019s wrong? Are you sick again?\u201d</p><p>As tears started to roll down her cheeks, she shook her head no. Still looking worried, he asked, \u201cWhy are you crying then? Um, is this a hormone thing?\u201d With another shake of her head, she pointed to the opening of her pants.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have a clue what you are trying to tell me. Do you need me to zip your pants?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t zip,\u201d she wailed. \u201cI can\u2019t even pull them all the way together.\u201d</p><p>A man to the core, Nick said, \u201cWell, just pick another pair. You probably haven\u2019t worn those in a while.\u201d</p><p>The tears flowed harder and Beth gasped out, \u201cI wore them a few weeks ago! I\u2019m barely pregnant and can\u2019t wear my clothes anymore. I might as well invest in some big dresses because regular pants aren\u2019t going to cover this ass for long.\u201d</p><p>Stepping up behind her, Nick playfully cupped the cheeks of her butt in his hands before saying, \u201cYou have one fine ass, princess, and a few extra pounds isn\u2019t going to change that.\u201d When she whirled around and threw her hands on her hips, she could tell he knew he had said the wrong thing.</p><p>\u201cSo now I\u2019m carrying some extra pounds? Well, thanks so much for pointing that out. I thought maybe my body was just changing from the pregnancy, but now, thanks to you, I know that I\u2019m just overweight!\u201d</p><p>Nick threw his hands in the air as if trying to ward her off. \u201cPrincess . . . I didn\u2019t mean it that way. I was just trying to say that you are beautiful no matter what size you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet out, you big jerk!\u201d Taking off the pants that wouldn\u2019t zip, she hit him dead center in the back as he practically ran from the room.</p><p>When he reached the door, he risked a quick glance over his shoulder. \u201cAre you riding to the office with me?\u201d</p><p>My God, could he be more clueless? Did he honestly think she would get in the car with him this morning after all of his stupid comments? Deep down inside, she knew he had just been trying to make her feel better, but he had seriously botched it. Still, she needed some space. If she rode to work with him, she would probably force him to take her to McDonald\u2019s and watch her while she ate her way through the breakfast menu. Luckily, she was saved from replying as he took her silence as no and mumbled that he would see her later.</p><p>Returning to her closet in disgust, she pulled on a soft jersey dress, which was both comfortable and flattering. She didn\u2019t have the heart to try another pair of slacks. She took a few deep breaths, trying to fight the panic that had been with her since she tried to zip the pants earlier. No one who had never been seriously overweight could understand her paranoia over weight gain. She had worked so hard to get where she was today and being powerless to stop the pounds from piling on was enough to make her feel faint. Maybe she just needed to double her effort to watch what she ate. She wouldn\u2019t let pregnancy be a reason to let herself go. She couldn\u2019t go back to where she was before\u2014she wouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Nick walked into the lobby of Danvers International a few minutes ahead of schedule. He had a conference call at nine, which left him almost an hour to spare. He had been in such a rush to leave home this morning that he had missed breakfast. He was afraid that if he stayed, Beth might stab him with his fork.</p><p>He walked over to a private alcove in the spacious lobby and settled on a comfortable sofa. He picked up a copy of Newsweek and thumbed through it without reading the pages. His mind went back to the scene with Beth earlier. Could he have messed that one up any more? He couldn\u2019t understand why she was so upset over her pants not buttoning. He had been trying to tell her how beautiful she was and damn if he didn\u2019t keep sticking his foot in his mouth. What had happened to his magic touch with women? Beth always seemed to keep him off his mark. He could never be \u201cCool Nick\u201d around her. She turned him into a clumsy schoolboy.</p><p>He almost jumped out of his seat when he felt a hand on his shoulder. \u201cBoy, do I know that look,\u201d drawled an amused voice. Nick looked up and cringed at the sympathy in Jason\u2019s eyes. He sat in a chair next to the sofa and said, \u201cSo, what did you screw up?\u201d</p><p>Jerking his head in surprise, Nick asked, \u201cHow do you know I screwed something up? Maybe I\u2019m just relaxing for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>Jason laughed. \u201cYeah, right. I\u2019ve had my ass in the sling too many times not to recognize the look on your face. I imagine I look the same way when I\u2019m in the doghouse.\u201d</p><p>Grimacing, Nick admitted, \u201cIt was about her weight gain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn. Man, tell me you didn\u2019t go there. You never, under any circumstances, admit to a woman, especially a pregnant one, that you think she has gained weight. That\u2019s a rookie mistake and I never took you for one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Nick defended. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell her that she had gained weight. She was freaking out because her pants wouldn\u2019t button and I tried to reassure her that she would be beautiful at any size. She completely went off the deep end. I thought women dreamed of a man who liked them just the way they are.\u201d</p><p>Jason chuckled. \u201cWhat kind of dream world are you in? You should have avoided the whole conversation. I\u2019d have faked an urgent bathroom trip or whatever the hell it took to get me out of there pronto. You can\u2019t win those conversations. You said, \u2018You would look beautiful at any size.\u2019 What she actually interpreted from that statement is: \u2018Yeah, you\u2019ve gained a lot of weight, but you have such a pretty face.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Nick shook his head in disbelief. \u201cNo shit? How do you know all of this stuff?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there, man. And I have the battle scars to prove it. The first few months of Claire\u2019s pregnancy were rough. She was sick all the time and miserable. I kept trying to cheer her up and just ended up making her cry. I refer to it as the first trimester from hell. When I wasn\u2019t making her sad, I was pissing her off. She alternated crying on my shoulder and slamming the bedroom door in my face. Finally, one evening she asked me if she had a double chin. Just when I was about to give her what was probably another dumb answer, my cell phone rang and I answered it. By the time the call was finished, she had moved on to something else and I had avoided disaster. From that moment on, I used the distraction technique whenever I could. The Danvers household was back in harmony.\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed, shaking his head. \u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable and a lot simpler than the shit storm I created this morning. Thanks for the advice, man; you may well have saved my life.\u201d</p><p>Gray strolled through the lobby as he and Jason were walking toward the elevator. Nick had to admit, it was hard not to envy the contentment that seemed to radiate from Jason and his brother. It was obvious that they were both happy with their lives, maybe even thrilled.</p><p>\u201cGood morning.\u201d Giving them a questioning look, Gray asked, \u201cEverything okay?\u201d</p><p>With a smirk, Jason said, \u201cNick took the fat bait this morning.\u201d</p><p>Gray visibly recoiled. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t! How could you live with Mom for all of those years and not know any better?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick shook his head in disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t know what is worse here, the fact that you know what Jason is talking about, or having you both laughing at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve made that mistake before,\u201d Gray admitted. \u201cBoth of you know Suzy well, so you know it was a mistake I will never make again. There is only one answer when faced with any questions on weight: no comment. No matter what you have to do to avoid giving an answer, do it. Suzy is still harping on the fact that I agreed that she was too heavy when she was on . . . um, well, never mind when that happened, just heed the warning.\u201d</p><p>Both he and Jason laughed over Gray\u2019s near slip of the tongue. Suzy would probably choke him within an inch of his life if she knew that he had almost spilled on their sex life. As humiliating as it had been to have Jason and Gray laugh at him, he had at least learned a valuable lesson: where women were concerned, less is always more.</p><p>Flopping down in a chair in her sister\u2019s office, Beth sighed dramatically, \u201cWell, it\u2019s official; I\u2019m a fat-ass.\u201d</p> <p>Suzy propped her feet on her desk and crossed one black high-heeled ankle boot over the other. \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had to resort to wearing a dress today because my pants wouldn\u2019t button this morning. Nick kindly told me that I was beautiful no matter how huge I was.\u201d</p><p>Scowling, Suzy asked, \u201cHe said that to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. I don\u2019t remember his exact words, but he sure didn\u2019t have to ask what I was talking about. He even patted me on the butt just to make sure I knew what he was referring to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen are pigs,\u201d Suzy snorted. \u201cThey just walk around all day flexing their muscles and loving it when we stare at their ass. The sad thing is that it isn\u2019t just the hot ones. Even the unattractive, out-of-shape ones still think they are hot. Can you imagine Gray, Nick, and Jason sitting around saying, \u2018Hey, man, my ass is getting huge\u2019 or \u2018Does this suit make me look fat?\u2019 Hell, no, they would never lower themselves to that. Gray looks at me like a deer in the headlights when I ask him anything about my body. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to kill him or something if he tells me the truth. But he acts like I\u2019m speaking a foreign language.\u201d Finally noticing that Beth was laughing, she asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m still laughing over the mental image of Gray, Nick, and Jason discussing their body insecurities. Instead of asking each other if they look okay, it\u2019s more likely that they say stuff like, \u2018Dude, those jeans make your dick look huge.\u2019 They probably meet for lunch at least once a week to talk about what studs they are.\u201d Beth laughed.</p><p>Suzy snickered. \u201cI have taught you well. I think it\u2019s time to set you free and let you fly. Oh, yeah, the parents will be over Saturday at five. . . . I bet that brought you crashing back down to earth, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, are you really going through with this? Couldn\u2019t you just send them pictures after the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, it\u2019s not my fault. Gray has really been putting the pressure on me. I guess his parents want to meet my parents. I don\u2019t know why. When they get together and our parents analyze them all evening like a science project, they will be ready to run for the hills. Of course, you and Nick making the whole baby announcement should buy me a few minutes to slip off to the kitchen and down a bottle of Scotch in between courses.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed before her sister\u2019s words sank in. \u201cWh\u2014what? We aren\u2019t making a baby announcement Saturday night! Are you crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . come on, you might as well get it over with. I figure we wait until Mom and Dad get into one of their long speeches on climate change or fossil fuels and just drop the bomb. During all of the excitement, I offer to get some champagne from the kitchen. Gray will go along to give me a hand and we will lean against the counter on which you had nasty kitchen sex with Nick and drink until we get enough of a buzz to survive the rest of the evening.\u201d</p> <p>Beth looked at Suzy in surprise and admiration. \u201cWow, you have really thought this out, haven\u2019t you? You\u2019re willing to sacrifice your own sister to make your life easier. I can\u2019t even go to the kitchen and drink with you, so what exactly am I getting out of this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s called taking one for the team\u2014and you are the only one in a position to do it. They already know I\u2019m living in sin with Gray and that we are getting married. They don\u2019t know that their sweet little Bethie is living in sin with Gray\u2019s brother and that she is knocked up. Come on, just think of the entertainment value here.\u201d</p><p>Beth shook her head, laughing at Suzy\u2019s logic. \u201cSo while I am shocking my parents into speechlessness, what are Nick\u2019s parents doing? Don\u2019t you think they might have some kind of reaction over the news, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think they will be surprised, do you? I mean it\u2019s not like Nick is a choirboy or anything. They probably expected a grandchild from him long before now. I\u2019m sure they will just be thrilled that you aren\u2019t paid by the hour or something.\u201d</p><p>Groaning, Beth said, \u201cYou are terrible. If you weren\u2019t my sister, I would be terrified of you.\u201d As they were both laughing, Claire walked in and plopped in the other seat.</p><p>\u201cAhhh, it\u2019s great to see some people that don\u2019t need diaper changes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I hope that never happens, but if it does, it\u2019s nice to know that you will take care of it,\u201d Suzy said, smiling.</p><p>Claire turned toward Beth and asked, \u201cSo since Nick survived the babysitting the other night, does that mean you\u2019re going to give him a chance to do the family thing?\u201d</p> <p>With a sigh, Beth said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I still feel like he\u2019s going to cut and run when things get serious. I just don\u2019t know how else to test that theory, short of throwing him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm,\u201d Claire said. \u201cLet me think a minute.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need to think, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d Suzy announced with an evil smile. \u201cIt\u2019s time to commence Operation Clinger.\u201d</p><p>With a wary look, Beth asked, \u201cOperation what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOperation Clinger. It\u2019s time to see if Nick can handle having a noose around his neck. So far, Nick has mostly been coming and going as he wants so it\u2019s time to give him a glimpse into the future. You may not be a clingy woman, but fatherhood will certainly put some demands on him. Let\u2019s give him an early preview and see how he handles it.\u201d</p><p>Intrigued despite herself, Beth asked, \u201cSo how would we do that?\u201d</p><p>Claire jumped to her feet in excitement. \u201cYou will be the baby or babies, Beth!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will? You two are starting to scare me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time that you became clingy. All of the freedom he takes for granted needs to suddenly become a lot more difficult. You need to be waiting at the door when he comes home and hanging on his sleeve when he leaves. He shouldn\u2019t be able to walk more than a few feet without tripping over you. His swinging single days are over. Let\u2019s see if he is ready to say good-bye to them. If he can survive it for even a few weeks without running like hell, then he might be a keeper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I don\u2019t know if I can do it. I like my space just as much as he does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t think you can pull that off, I can let you babysit Chrissy every evening for a few weeks to see if that does it,\u201d Claire offered.</p><p>\u201cUm . . . no, that\u2019s okay. I think I can do clingy,\u201d Beth quickly added.</p><p>\u201cOkay, get started tonight and let us know how it goes tomorrow. Boy, I wish I could see his face,\u201d Suzy said, and laughed.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Beth almost laughed aloud when Nick slowly walked through the doorway that evening. He approached her with a wary expression. She had intentionally avoided him all day, knowing it would keep him on edge. Part of her thought she wasn\u2019t being fair to him, but then she remembered the babies she was carrying and how devastating it would be for all of them if he decided he didn\u2019t want to be involved later on. Nick was a good guy, but sometimes good guys hit the road when things got tough.</p><p>In her limited dating experience, each guy she had once hoped might be different had ended up disappointing her. She always thought if she were thin, they would stay, but was that really true? Seeing coworkers\u2019 marriages falling apart through the years seemed to indicate that even being slim couldn\u2019t make someone stay if they wanted to go. So if they were going to raise a family together she had to know that no matter what, he was going to be here. Maybe she still had issues from her fat days. In her experience, all men left her eventually. She was just somewhere they stopped until something better came along. It would kill her to let Nick into her heart and have him leave her, too. She just couldn\u2019t take the risk. She had to know that he was more than a fair-weather man.</p><p>Giving Nick her most charming smile, she patted the couch beside her. \u201cHey, honey, come sit with me. I didn\u2019t think you would ever get home.\u201d She hid a smile as he looked at her in surprise. The poor man was probably afraid she had forgotten she was pregnant and drank a bottle of wine. As he still looked at her uncertainly, she patted the couch again, saying, \u201cHurry up, I\u2019ve missed you.\u201d Boy, she must have really been bad this morning if he was so afraid to approach her. He finally walked over and sat beside her.</p><p>\u201cHey, princess. Are you . . . um . . . feeling better?\u201d</p><p>Giving him a confused look, she asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>Clearly stumbling now, he quickly said, \u201cOh, never mind. I just meant I\u2019m glad to see you so happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, thanks.\u201d Then giving him her most adoring look, she added, \u201cI ordered Chinese for dinner from that place down the street. I know it\u2019s your favorite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great, princess.\u201d He kissed her lightly on the mouth and started to stand. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a shower before dinner if you don\u2019t mind. As you can see, I came straight from the gym.\u201d</p><p>Beth stood up with him. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all. How about I sit in the bathroom with you and we talk about our day?\u201d Oh, God, look at him squirm. He has rubbed his forehead at least five times since he got home.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you need to wait for the delivery guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no. I just called before you got home. They only have one driver tonight so it will be at least an hour.\u201d</p><p>With a shrug of his shoulder, he walked toward the bedroom. Luckily, for an apartment, her bathroom was a good size. He rapidly removed his gym clothes and started the shower. She leaned against the vanity and brightly asked, \u201cSo when do you want to look at houses? I thought we could go ahead and start looking. We need some time to move in and decorate the babies\u2019 room.\u201d She covered a smile with her hand when she heard something hit the shower floor. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I just dropped the soap.\u201d Clearing his throat, he replied, \u201cSo why the sudden change of heart on moving?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I was just being silly. I think we should just go for it. Before long, we will be one big, happy family. You\u2019ve been trying so hard and it\u2019s only fair that I meet you halfway.\u201d The shower was quiet as he processed her statement. She looked at the outline of his body in the shower and decided to kick things up a notch. Quickly pulling her clothes off, she opened the back door of the shower and stepped inside. Nick jumped a foot when he turned and saw her standing there. She took the soap from his hands and began washing his breathtaking body without saying a word. She went down on her knees before him, making his eyes widen in surprise.</p><p>Nick sucked in a loud breath as she slid the soap down his hips and near his hardening length. \u201cPrincess, what\u2014\u201d</p><p>His next word was lost in his groan when she took him into her mouth without warning. She gripped his base firmly with her wet hand and started to pump it up and down his length in tempo with her mouth. He fisted his hand in her hair as he pushed his hips against her mouth. When she ran her tongue around the tip of his cock, his whole body jerked. \u201cShit, Beth, you are gonna be the death of me.\u201d</p><p>She moved her hand faster and faster, watching his whole body tighten. He suddenly jerked his hips, freeing his cock as he came against the shower wall. She put her hand around his cock and wrung every last bit he had left. Nick might always come in her body, but he always pulled back if he was in her mouth. She had never swallowed before, but she might be willing to try for him. He as always was too considerate to assume that she would.</p><p>Nick pulled her against the back of the shower and wrapped his arms around her. She knew from experience that he would recover in a few minutes and would make leisurely love to her. He was in for a surprise, though. Tonight was the start of what she would refer to as cuddling time. She didn\u2019t want it to be confused with sex. She kissed him on the chin and untangled herself from his arms. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the delivery guy so I better get dressed.\u201d Nick looked baffled. Normally by this point, she would have her legs wrapped around him and be panting for him to come inside her body. She did have the familiar ache between her legs, but she was determined to control herself. Women could go longer without sex than men, right? It was time to see if there was more to their relationship than sex. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Nick was sated, but uneasy. He didn\u2019t know what to make of the Beth that had been waiting for him when he came home. He had been prepared to shower her with compliments and make love to her until her toes curled. In his experience, both of those things solved most of his problems with women. He had also stopped at a jewelry store on the way home and bought her a diamond heart pendant just in case the first two things failed to get the desired response. The jewelry box was still in his briefcase because he had been so baffled since arriving home that he truly hadn\u2019t remembered it until just now.</p><p>Instead of the silent treatment or angry words that he had been expecting, Beth had been sweet and almost loving. He had never seen her act quite like this around him. Their relationship had been built on white-hot sex and the general enjoyment of each other\u2019s company. When she walked into a room, he wanted to rip her clothes off and despite her self-esteem issues, she gave her body to him completely and without inhibitions. He was tender with her because he genuinely cared about her and he would never want to hurt her.</p><p>When she had been so uncharacteristically affectionate earlier, it had almost rendered him speechless. He had tried to escape to the shower to regroup but then she had insisted on following him there and talking about buying a house together. He had almost fallen in the shower at her sudden change of heart. Of course, he couldn\u2019t complain about what happened next. Beth\u2019s beautiful mouth could literally bring him to his knees. He never took pleasure without giving it in return. It was something he prided himself in. He had been shocked when she had pulled away for the first time. She was a constant surprise to him. He had stayed off balance since the moment they met. Just when he thought he had her figured out, she changed just like the wind. He was coming to discover that if he lived a thousand lifetimes, he would never see all of the sides of Beth.</p><p>They had loaded the coffee table in the living room with the Chinese food that Beth had ordered. They had taken turns feeding each other with their chopsticks and laughing when more ended up in their laps than in their mouths. Afterward he had settled back onto the couch and pulled her into his arms. He had stroked her already changing stomach softly and marveled at the feelings that coursed through him as he imagined his children already growing inside her. About that time, he had had the urge to run like hell. His heart had started racing and he could feel sweat beading on his forehead. Luckily, Beth couldn\u2019t see his face and he focused on keeping his hands steady so that she wouldn\u2019t feel them shaking. He worked on slowing his breathing and warding off what was probably the first panic attack that he had ever had.</p> <p>He was grateful when Beth yawned and he was able to encourage her to go to bed. She insisted that he accompany her and soon they were settled on their sides with her spooned against him. His hand once again rested against her stomach and he felt the stirrings of panic return.</p><p>Everything was becoming so real. There really had been no time to think about the repercussions until now. In typical fashion, he had been running full steam ahead since finding out about the pregnancy. He handled stress by making plans, which worked well in business. Now he was faced with the reality of the week ahead. He would meet Beth\u2019s parents, who would probably think he was a sleaze for getting their daughter pregnant. He would also tell his own parents, which would earn him a lecture from his father about keeping it in his pants. His mother would probably be thrilled and be buying the babies tiny leather pants.</p><p>Why the panic now? Things were going better than expected and Beth seemed to be coming around\u2014so what was the problem all of a sudden? Had he offered her more than he could give? No! He refused to believe that he was one of those people who would try to avoid their responsibilities. These were his children for God\u2019s sake and he would be there for them. He would be the kind of father that he was lucky enough to have. He might not have the loving relationship with Beth that his parents had together, but he and Beth could make a good life together with their children. People did it every day. So what if they weren\u2019t in love? They cared about each other and had great sex, more than a lot of married couples have. He would do his best to give his children the parents that he had grown up with. Taking another deep breath, he pulled Beth closer and drifted off to sleep.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Oh, shit, they were coming down the walkway together! Beth looked out the window in Suzy\u2019s foyer and saw her parents walking alongside another couple that she assumed were Gray and Nick\u2019s parents. She felt butterflies in her stomach as she realized the time of reckoning was close. Despite all her protests, Suzy was still determined that Beth should announce her pregnancy while the parents were here tonight. Nick thought it was a good idea as well. He told her that his parents would be thrilled. She wished that she could say the same about hers.</p> <p>Gray and Nick came over to her looking unruffled and relaxed. Nick put his hand on the small of her back, offering her a quiet show of support. Suzy flung open the door before the bell rang and she put on her best game face. Her mother and father walked stiffly into the foyer followed by the Merimons.</p><p>Beth could see why Suzy liked Gray\u2019s mother so much. She was probably a carbon copy of what Suzy would be like in twenty years. They both had the same sense of style and flair. Suzy greeted their own parents with a simple, \u201cMom, Dad, good to see you.\u201d She then turned to Gray\u2019s parents and hugged them both with obvious affection. \u201cJohn and Vicky, I would like for you to meet our parents, Linda and Harris Denton. Mom, Dad, these are Gray and Nick\u2019s parents, John and Victoria Merimon.\u201d</p><p>Her parents extended their hands for a formal handshake from the Merimons. Gray stepped forward next and made the introductions of Nick and himself to Beth and Suzy\u2019s parents. Suzy then pulled Beth forward to stand in front of John and Vicky, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you have met my sister.\u201d</p><p>Vicky stepped forward and engulfed Beth into a hug, just as she had Suzy, and John gave her a warm kiss on the cheek. \u201cBeth, we have heard so much about you. It\u2019s great to finally meet you in person.\u201d Then, turning to Beth\u2019s parents, Vicky added, \u201cYou must be so proud to have these two lovely young women as daughters.\u201d Other than another tight smile, Beth\u2019s parents didn\u2019t comment on Vicky\u2019s statement. All too soon, Beth moved to stand in front of her parents.</p><p>Instead of a warm hug from them, her mother asked, \u201cHave there been any new developments in your job search, Beth?\u201d</p><p>Why did she always feel like a small child when talking with her parents? She flushed when she noticed all eyes in the room were on her. \u201cUm . . . no. Mom, I\u2019m really not looking for a teaching job right now. I\u2019m enjoying my work at Danvers with Suzy.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother wrinkled her nose in confusion. \u201cBeth, you have a teaching degree. Why would you want to be your sister\u2019s secretary? You should at least take this time to continue your education and possibly get your credentials to teach at a higher level. Your goal should be a position where you could achieve academic tenure.\u201d</p><p>Beth saw Suzy grimace over her mother\u2019s shoulder and mouth, \u201cWTF.\u201d She was extremely grateful when Suzy followed that by saying loudly, \u201cDinnertime.\u201d</p><p>Grateful for the distraction, Beth gave her mother a tight smile and turned to follow her sister to the dining room. Nick leaned down to whisper in her ear, \u201cDamn, you weren\u2019t kidding about them were you?\u201d</p><p>She nudged him with her elbow, muttering, \u201cBe quiet before they hear you. This can only get worse. Try to stay off their radar or you\u2019ll be next.\u201d</p><p>Gray pulled out a chair for Suzy beside him and then took the seat at the head of the table. Beth and Nick took the seats beside Suzy and their parents. Beth knew that the only thing worse than sitting next to her mother was sitting across from her.</p><p>Gray and Suzy had hired a catering company to prepare the meal. The table was laden with smoked turkey and ham, green beans, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and golden rolls. Beth felt her stomach rumble in appreciation; she didn\u2019t often have meals like this outside of Thanksgiving or Christmas.</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother clapped her hands in delight. \u201cThis looks great, I\u2019m starving. Did you two cook this on your own?\u201d</p><p>Suzy snorted. \u201cYou know me better than that. Your son may be talented in the kitchen, but that\u2019s about as far as it goes here. He did make dessert though and I licked the bowl afterward.\u201d</p> <p>Beth braced as she saw her mother shaking her head before adding, \u201cSuzanna has never been a cook so I hope you aren\u2019t marrying her expecting that, Grayson. She has always had a whimsical nature as is evidenced by her choice of professions.\u201d Beth could see her father nodding his agreement. Her mother might be the more vocal of the two, but her father always agreed with whatever she said.</p><p>Gray studied Beth and Suzy\u2019s parents and seemed to choose his words carefully. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if Suzy never cooks a meal. She gives her heart to everything she does and that is what I love about her.\u201d He clasped Suzy\u2019s hand in his own and brushed a kiss on her knuckles.</p><p>\u201cAw, thanks, baby,\u201d Suzy cooed. Clearly trying to change the subject, she looked at Gray\u2019s mother and asked, \u201cSo, Vicky, how was your trip to Italy?\u201d Gray\u2019s mother took charge of the conversation, telling everyone about their recent anniversary trip.</p><p>Beth was grateful to have a few moments of reprieve from further conversation with her parents. Nick reached under the table and rubbed her leg soothingly as if sensing her turmoil. They had barely made it through the first part of dinner and already she wanted to run and hide. It was starting to seem like a really terrible idea to tell everyone about her pregnancy tonight, but she knew Suzy was hoping for the distraction. She, however, didn\u2019t think there was any possible way to intentionally make herself a target for more undivided attention. A phone call or a text seemed like a much better way to let them know. All too soon, Vicky was finished telling about their trip, and Beth\u2019s father took advantage of the silence to make further, awkward conversation.</p><p>\u201cSuzanna, do you and Grayson plan to continue living here after you are married?\u201d</p><p>Gray spoke up for both of them. \u201cPlease call me Gray, Mr. Denton, and yes, we do intend to make this our home, at least for now.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s father frowned and she could see the wheels turning in his mind. \u201cGray, you do realize the risks of living this close to the ocean, don\u2019t you?\u201d Without giving Gray time to answer, he continued. \u201cThe risks of everyday flooding will continue to increase as global warming pushes the sea levels to rise. This whole area could be underwater in the not-so-distant future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad\u2014\u201d Suzy tried to interject.</p><p>\u201cSuzanna, you need to hear this. I know you don\u2019t like to think about world events, but the location of your home is very important and this one is a time bomb. You must also think about the biggest risk factor here: hurricanes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMyrtle Beach doesn\u2019t have many hurricanes,\u201d Gray\u2019s father offered helpfully.</p><p>Not to be deterred, her father leaned forward in his chair and presented his case. \u201cThis area does have an active hurricane history. All the way back in 1899, a hurricane called the Halloween Storm made landfall on the North Carolina and South Carolina border, causing extensive damage. Then, in 1906, a severe hurricane hit Myrtle Beach washing away homes and hotels. There were other glancing blows, but Hurricane Hazel in 1954 was one of the most memorable. It made landfall at the highest lunar tide of the year, making it that much worse. Hurricane Hugo in 1989 came ashore as a category four hurricane with up to a twenty-foot storm surge. Imagine living here under those conditions. It\u2019s just a matter of time before another catastrophic hurricane such as Hazel and Hugo occurs.\u201d</p><p>When her father paused to take a breath, Beth blurted out, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant with twins and Nick is the father.\u201d She knew she had picked a bad moment to make the announcement when Nick choked a sip of iced tea. She reached over to pat him on the back as he tried to take a breath. She risked a quick look around the table and saw everyone\u2019s eyes once again on her. Suzy looked grateful, Gray looked surprised but amused, and both sets of parents seemed to be in a state of shock.</p><p>Finally, Suzy jumped up from the table and grabbed Gray\u2019s hand. \u201cI think this calls for a celebration. Gray and I will get dessert and a bottle of champagne to celebrate.\u201d She dragged a surprised Gray out of the room with her, and Beth had a feeling that they would both be sampling the champagne before bringing it back to the table.</p><p>\u201cI thought they had decided against telling the parents about the pregnancy tonight?\u201d Gray asked in confusion.</p><p>Pulling a bottle of champagne from the refrigerator, Suzy said, \u201cDon\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth. This probably saved our ass.\u201d She handed the bottle to Gray and begged, \u201cPlease open this now. I need at least two glasses before I go back in there.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gray expertly popped the cork and poured two full glasses. \u201cBaby, if I didn\u2019t love you so much, I would be running for my life right now. If they start in on sex next, that\u2019s probably it for us. I don\u2019t think I would ever be able to get it up again.\u201d</p><p>Suzy leaned back against his muscular chest and chuckled. \u201cGod, you have no idea. This is actually good behavior for them. I have seen far worse.\u201d</p><p>With a look of disbelief, Gray said, \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. This is good behavior. I haven\u2019t had a lecture like that since I put a garden snake in my sixth-grade teacher\u2019s purse.\u201d</p><p>Rubbing her bottom against his crotch suggestively, Suzy laughed. \u201cI knew you were a bad boy.\u201d</p> <p>Gray swatted her bottom playfully. \u201cBehave yourself. I\u2019d prefer not to make out on the counter that your sister and my brother christened before us, and I sure can\u2019t risk your parents walking in on us. I don\u2019t think either one of us would survive that lecture or, God help me, instructions on what we\u2019re doing wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh, please don\u2019t say that. I agree on the counter, though. Of course, if Nick and Beth told us everywhere they\u2019ve made out in this house since they met, we would probably have to burn the place down.\u201d</p><p>With obvious reluctance, Gray murmured, \u201cWe should probably get back in there. Nick and Beth may be in desperate need of our help by now.\u201d</p><p>Suzy gave him her best pleading look while running the tip of her tongue around her lower lip suggestively. \u201cAw, do we have to?\u201d</p><p>Gray leaned down to capture her mouth in a kiss that curled her toes and sent liquid heat straight to her core. In a husky whisper, Gray said, \u201cI don\u2019t think a few more minutes will matter either way.\u201d With those words, he wrapped his body around Suzy\u2019s and tried to steal a moment of calm in the storm.</p> <p>At the dining table, John finally spoke to break the silence. \u201cSo, congratulations, you two. I had no idea that things were so . . . serious between you.\u201d</p><p>Vicky jumped up from her chair and came around the table to hug her. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be a grandmother for quite some time, but I\u2019m so happy for you. How exciting that my boys have fallen in love with sisters.\u201d Beth saw the quick look that she shot at Nick as she said the L word. Vicky hugged Nick next and then John walked over and hugged her as well.</p><p>John then clasped Nick on the shoulder and said, \u201cI think we may have missed a talk or two lately.\u201d</p><p>Nick smiled up at his father and said, \u201cMaybe one or two. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make up for them, though.\u201d</p><p>John laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that right, son.\u201d</p><p>Beth noticed her parents sat as still as statues on the other side of the table. Clearing her throat, she said, \u201cSo, Mom, Dad, big surprise, right?\u201d</p> <p>Her mother looked at her with disapproval in her eyes. \u201cYes, Beth, it is a surprise and not something we would have expected from you.\u201d</p><p>Suzy and Gray entered the dining room just in time to hear her mother\u2019s remark. Beth could tell by the slight stiffening of Suzy\u2019s shoulders that she knew their mother was actually saying that she would have expected it from Suzy. Gray pulled out a chair for her and then deposited the bottle of champagne on the table. He went back to the kitchen and returned with the strawberry cheesecake he had made.</p><p>Beth took the reprieve that the interruption had created and smiled at John and Vicky as they returned to their seats across the table. Suzy asked brightly from the head of the table, \u201cIs everyone ready for dessert?\u201d</p><p>Gray cut them all pieces of the cheesecake and Suzy walked around the table delivering the dessert and offering a glass of champagne, a refill of tea, or a cup of coffee. John, Vicky, Gray, and Suzy all opted for the champagne. Suzy and Beth\u2019s parents took coffee and, even though Beth knew that Nick wanted the champagne, he took a refill of iced tea just as she did. He was probably afraid that her parents would launch into a lecture on the hazards of alcohol if he indulged.</p><p>Beth took a big bite of her cheesecake and closed her eyes in bliss. When she opened them, her mother was staring at her. With a sinking feeling, Beth prepared for what was coming next.</p><p>\u201cYou do realize that the weight gain from this pregnancy, especially with twins, will be difficult for someone such as yourself?\u201d</p><p>Beth could feel the bite that she had taken threaten to come back up as she dropped her head in embarrassment. Yep, they are all looking at you. Your own mother just pinned the fat cow sign to your forehead for everyone to see. Would it be bad to wish for one of those hurricanes that Dad was harping on earlier? Now would be a good time to be washed away and never have to look at anyone at this table again.</p><p>Beside her, Nick set his fork down with a clatter. He looked her mother squarely in the eyes and softly asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, by \u2018someone such as yourself\u2019?\u201d</p> <p>Beth wanted to crawl under the table and hide. She appreciated his concern, but wanted him to just let it go, rather than make the situation worse. Now my mother will go into detail about my weight and I\u2019ll be humiliated in front of your parents.</p><p>Her father spoke up, obviously missing the edge that had entered Nick\u2019s voice. \u201cBeth spent most of her life clinically obese. Instead of taking control of the situation, as we encouraged her to do when she was young, she let it continue into her adult life, increasing her risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and coronary artery disease, just to name a few things. As Linda was trying to indicate, a pregnancy for someone with little willpower such as Beth could well cause her relapse into obesity.\u201d</p><p>Nick shoved his chair back from the table at the same time Suzy slammed her glass down. Beth looked at the usually cool Nick in surprise as he stood up and leaned over the table, looking at both of her parents. \u201cDo you even hear yourselves?\u201d he asked in a deathly quiet voice. Without giving her parents time to reply, he continued. \u201cI am constantly in awe of your daughters. They are smart, funny, intelligent, compassionate, and beautiful. Everyone who knows them loves them. I\u2019m starting to think they must be adopted. I can\u2019t imagine you two even having children, much less having two as outstanding as Beth and Suzy.\u201d</p><p>Beth\u2019s father sputtered, \u201cNow, listen here, young man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you listen here,\u201d Nick hissed. \u201cI have always wondered why someone as beautiful and special as Beth would have so many self-esteem issues, and now I know. Have you ever just once praised her or Suzy for anything? Did you actually try to help her eat healthier, or did you just ridicule her for being overweight? Didn\u2019t it ever occur to either of you that she might be using food to escape from her life? As my mother will tell you, Gray and I were both heavier when we were young. Not once did our mother insult or criticize us. Instead, we learned to cook our own healthy meals and we took up a lot of hobbies as a family such as biking and swimming. Never did she say we were doing it because we were obese.\u201d</p><p>Beth wrapped her hand around Nick\u2019s arm, trying to calm him down. She had never seen him this upset before. \u201cNick, it\u2019s okay. Really I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Nick looked down at her and cupped her face lightly with his hand. His gaze locked on hers and in a softer voice he said, \u201cNo, princess, it\u2019s not okay.\u201d Then, closing his eyes briefly, he murmured, \u201cI can\u2019t sit here and let them treat you like this. Are you ready to go?\u201d</p><p>She slid her hand into his outstretched palm and let him pull her to her feet. Her mother and father sat across the table staring daggers at both of them. Gray and Suzy stood at the same time. Gray looked around the table and settled his gaze on Beth and Suzy\u2019s parents. \u201cLinda, Harris, I completely agree with my brother. Your daughters are two of the most amazing women I have ever had the good fortune to meet, and I ask that you not upset either one of them in my home again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, see here, Grayson\u2014\u201d Harris began.</p><p>\u201cNo, sir,\u201d Grayson said firmly. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in continuing this conversation. Out of respect for your daughter, my fianc\u00e9e, I\u2019m going to let this go without further comment, and I expect you to do the same. There will never be any other remarks in my home that involve any type of negativity concerning Suzy or Beth.\u201d</p><p>Beth looked over to see that Suzy was suspiciously close to tears. She knew exactly what her sister was feeling. When had they ever had anyone stand up for them? To have the Merimon family defending them now was something that she would never forget. She and Suzy had learned to let their parents vent long ago. Suzy would rebel in some way later, but during a lecture, they just wanted it to be over. Vicky and John had remained quiet through the confrontation and she was surprised and relieved to see the smile of support that they bestowed on her.</p><p>Nick clasped Beth\u2019s hand and they walked to the head of the table to give Suzy and Gray a hug good-bye. Suzy whispered in her ear, \u201cSame old shit, different day.\u201d</p><p>Beth hugged her tighter and whispered back, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would make it through a meal without a fat comment.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother walked over to embrace Beth, and said, \u201cYou take care of those babies. John and I are here for you if you need anything.\u201d Vicky hugged Nick next and Beth couldn\u2019t hear what she said to him, but she saw his lips curve into a smile. Nick\u2019s father hugged them both next and invited them to Charleston for the weekend.</p><p>Beth then turned to her parents and gave them a tight smile. \u201cMom, Dad, it was good to see you again. I hope you have a safe trip home.\u201d Her parents gave a polite nod in return and Nick and Beth were soon out the door and walking to Nick\u2019s car. Even after the altercation with Nick, she knew her parents would stay until the official end of the evening. They might not say another word, but they would never disregard polite social rules and leave early. She felt sorry for Suzy, Gray, and Nick\u2019s parents, who could possibly have to endure another few hours of her parents\u2019 company.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Never had Nick felt more fortunate to have the parents that he did. He\u2019d always thought Beth and Suzy were kidding when they talked about how uptight their parents were. Hell, uptight was too good for them. They were downright obnoxious. He couldn\u2019t remember one polite word that they had uttered the entire evening. Every word and every eye roll from them was critical. No wonder Beth was so damn terrified to put a bite in her mouth. He could only imagine the criticism that she had endured growing up. It probably wouldn\u2019t have mattered if she had been thin; they would still have found something that didn\u2019t measure up to their standards. What was surprising was how well she and Suzy had turned out. They could have ended up being cold, uptight clones of their parents instead of the warm, loving people they were. Sure, they both had some quirky personality traits, but that only made them more unique.</p><p>Beth hadn\u2019t said a word since they had gotten in his car. He had let the silence linger, thinking that she probably needed time to come to terms with the evening. Truthfully, he was a little afraid of what her reaction was going to be. He had told off her parents without even realizing he was about to do it. There was that saying: I can talk about my family, but no one else can. He may well have pissed her off and caused a bigger rift between her and her parents. When he had felt Beth shrinking into herself as her mother and father told the entire table about her weight battles, he had just snapped. This beautiful woman was carrying his children and he would not allow anyone to humiliate her in any way, even her own parents.</p><p>He could tell that his own parents were appalled as well. When he had hugged his mother, she had whispered in his ear, \u201cMy mixing bowls will be waiting for you when you are ready.\u201d Almost every decision or heartache he\u2019d had when he was growing up had been talked over in the kitchen. His mother had taught Nick and Gray to cook at an early age, and they both continued to go home when their problems were overwhelming. They both knew that the baking pans, and their mother\u2019s and father\u2019s listening ears, were always there waiting for them. Damn, he was blessed.</p><p>As wonderful and understanding as they were, he knew that his parents had been blindsided with the pregnancy announcement. There would be more questions and more explanations to make there. He didn\u2019t really know why he hadn\u2019t told them he was practically living with Beth. Maybe because he knew his father would give him \u201cthe talk\u201d if he knew that Nick was dating Suzy\u2019s baby sister.</p><p>Everything had happened so fast between them. It still felt like there had been a whirlwind around him since he first met Beth. They had amazing sex\u2014a lot of it\u2014and then, in the blink of an eye, he was practically living with her. On the rare occasions that he had stopped to ponder it, he had been helpless to pull back. Her vulnerability and insecurities were so at odds with her wild, uninhibited abandon in the bedroom. The women he had dated were usually overconfident and had seduction down to an art form. Beth, on the other hand, would lose herself completely in their lovemaking, giving and taking with equal measure. She would purr with pleasure in his arms as he praised her body. Then, the next morning, when their clothes were on, she turned back into reserved Beth. It was like living with two different women. Maybe that was why the usual boredom had never come. He never knew what to expect from her next and he loved it. He walked around with a near constant hard-on at home, wondering when she would turn back into insatiable Beth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They arrived at Beth\u2019s apartment without either of them saying a word to the other. Nick jogged around and opened the door for her, helping her out of the low-slung car. He entwined his fingers with hers as they made their way up the stairs and into the apartment.</p><p>She gave him a tired smile, saying, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to turn in for the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth, I\u2019m sorry if I upset you.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, she started laughing. \u201cAre you kidding? You were great! I have never seen my parents puckered up that tight before. Thank you for interrupting because their fat talks usually go on for much longer.\u201d</p> <p>Nick felt his relief flow. \u201cSo, you\u2019re not mad?\u201d</p><p>With another snicker, she said, \u201cNo way. It was worth all the misery that it will eventually bring. The good news is that they probably won\u2019t be inviting us to dinner anytime soon.\u201d</p><p>With a laugh, he said, \u201cI can live with that. I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay with it.\u201d</p><p>Waving her hand, she said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Then with a sigh, she added, \u201cTheir delivery method may need some work, but they\u2019re right. I\u2019m not like normal pregnant women. I can\u2019t use this pregnancy as a reason to let go. I have to be more careful than ever.\u201d</p><p>Nick felt a ripple of unease as he studied Beth\u2019s determined expression. \u201cPrincess, you never let go. I don\u2019t think you have to worry about it. You barely eat enough to survive on now, and remember, you have to eat extra for the babies now, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI eat more than enough,\u201d she snapped. \u201cThe doctor didn\u2019t say anything about tripling the amount of my food to feed three people. If I did that, I would gain too much weight. The average weight of a baby when born is around seven pounds so if I gain eighty pounds, how much of it would actually be the babies?\u201d</p><p>Nick could tell by her defensive tone that it was time to shut his mouth and end this conversation. Hadn\u2019t Jason and Gray warned him to avoid talking about her weight? He was worried though that Beth didn\u2019t know when to stop. Was there such a thing as too thin to her anymore? Her parents had scored a direct hit tonight. She may have enjoyed his defense of her, but she quite obviously believed every word they said. But he decided to back off instead of forcing the issue. She had dealt with enough tonight and he knew the stress wasn\u2019t good for her.</p><p>Giving her a light kiss on the lips, he turned her toward the bedroom and said, \u201cGo ahead and get some sleep, princess. I\u2019m going to unwind some before I go to bed.\u201d</p><p>With a smile of understanding, Beth said, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d</p><p>How could anyone throw up as much as she had in the last week and still have gained five pounds? Hadn\u2019t Suzy, Claire, and Ella tried to warn her against weighing herself on the scales at the mall? Since they had been right there outside the food court, she hadn\u2019t been able to resist. She had been so sure she had lost weight. She had been so careful to watch her portion sizes this week and she had been sick every single morning, but still, her ass continued to expand.</p><p>Claire looked at her in sympathy. \u201cIt\u2019s just the water weight gain, Beth. I had the same problem. Sometimes I was too sick to eat anything but crackers for days and I would still gain weight. I kept asking Jason where it was all going, but he never had an answer. Of course, he always had to return a call or something when I was venting so he probably wasn\u2019t even listening.\u201d</p> <p>Shaking her head, Suzy said, \u201cHe was just avoiding you, Claire. I finally figured out that every time I say anything about my body other than \u2018do me,\u2019 Gray runs as if I\u2019ve got the plague. I thought he had irritable bowel syndrome or something until I finally figured out that the bathroom is his easiest escape route after a difficult question. It\u2019s the one place he is confident I won\u2019t follow him.\u201d With an evil smile, she added, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about testing my theory and going right in there with him the next time. Of course, if I\u2019m wrong, it will probably be the end of our sex life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Claire said, and laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk to find out!\u201d</p><p>Ella looked at them all with envy. \u201cI don\u2019t know why any of you would ever be worried about your body, you all look great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, Ella,\u201d Suzy began, \u201cis there a man on the horizon for you?\u201d</p><p>Flushing, Ella mumbled, \u201cYes, but I can\u2019t have him.\u201d</p><p>All conversation ceased as everyone zeroed in on Ella. \u201cAll right, girl, you can\u2019t leave us hanging like this. Who is the guy and why can\u2019t you have him?\u201d Suzy asked.</p><p>Clearly uncomfortable, Ella said, \u201cJust, um . . . never mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hell-to-the-no, Miss Goody Two-shoes, you aren\u2019t getting off the hook. You know all of our issues and all about our guys, so let\u2019s hear it,\u201d Suzy demanded.</p> <p>Beth wrapped an arm around her friend, giving Suzy and Claire a stern look. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Ella; you don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d Beth had a pretty good feeling that she knew anyway and didn\u2019t think any good could come of Suzy or Claire knowing about Ella\u2019s crush on Declan.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to side with Suzy on this one, Ella,\u201d Claire said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in the girls club, you can\u2019t hold back. We might be able to help you.\u201d</p><p>Suzy pulled Ella over to a seating area in the corner of the mall and, after they were all settled, she said in a surprisingly gentle voice, \u201cOkay, Ella, let\u2019s hear it. Claire is right; maybe we can help.\u201d</p><p>Ella turned an even brighter shade of red as she whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s Declan.\u201d</p><p>Suzy and Claire stared at her blankly. \u201cUm, you don\u2019t mean our Declan, do you?\u201d Suzy asked.</p><p>Nodding her head miserably, Ella said, \u201cYes, but he treats me like his sister.\u201d</p><p>With a snort, Suzy said, \u201cOh, baby, you are way out of your league. How can I explain this? You\u2019re like Nemo swimming around in the ocean without a care in the world and Declan is like the piranha who comes along and eats you without warning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzy!\u201d Beth shouted.</p><p>\u201cWhat? It\u2019s the truth. Declan has been around the block a lot and Ella hasn\u2019t taken her training wheels off yet. I know the man is sexy in a dark sort of way, but, sweetie, he would eat you for breakfast and not in a good way.\u201d Suzy smirked.</p><p>Claire laughed under her breath before she could stop herself. \u201cElla, I think what Suzy is trying to say is that you don\u2019t have much in common with Declan. Jason said that he served a couple of tours in the military. He has probably seen things that most of us never will. He seems haunted, for lack of a better word.\u201d</p><p>Ella\u2019s shoulders slumped in defeat. \u201cI know, but he is so sweet to me. I\u2019ve mentioned different things that I like to eat and drink a few times and he always shows up with whatever I mentioned a few days later. That means something, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d Claire sighed. \u201cThat is surprising. I can\u2019t imagine him doing that. He\u2019s always polite, but holds himself apart from everyone else. It\u2019s amazing that he talks to you regularly, much less brings you things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I scared him away,\u201d Ella confessed.</p><p>Suzy perked up with interest. \u201cDid you make a pass at him?\u201d</p><p>Ella flushed again, saying, \u201cNo, of course not. I kind of asked him to dinner at my place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou little tramp!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzy!\u201d Beth groaned, clearly horrified.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kidding, sis. Get your panties out of a wad.\u201d Suzy reached over and cuffed Ella on the shoulder with her knuckles. \u201cYou go, girl. You\u2019re going to make him dinner before you hit on him.\u201d</p><p>Beth looked on helplessly as Suzy openly laughed. Claire tried to keep a straight face, but snickered at poor Ella. If embarrassment could kill, Ella would be dead on the spot. \u201cAll right, everyone, give Ella a break. We are supposed to be helping her, not harassing her.\u201d Turning to her friend, she asked gently, \u201cWhat happened when you asked him for dinner?\u201d</p><p>Staring down at her hands, Ella said, \u201cHe looked surprised and then he said that he already had plans. I was going to suggest another night, but he said he was late for a meeting and took off. That was days ago, and I haven\u2019t seen him since then. I . . . I think he\u2019s avoiding me now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, come on now, Ella, maybe he\u2019s out of town. He travels a lot, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>Everyone looked at Claire since she usually knew when any of the main group was out of town. Claire gave a grimace and said, \u201cNo, I know Declan is in the office this week because he\u2019s been working on a contract with Jason.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head in disgust, Suzy said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to soft-pedal this to you, Ella; he is avoiding you. He\u2019s been sniffing around your feet, but when you started sniffing back, he packed his toys and went home. To someone like Declan you must seem like the ultimate forbidden fruit. He\u2019s probably used to women he can screw and then slip out before they wake up. Most of his women have probably been ridden hard and put up wet.\u201d</p><p>Claire started laughing. \u201cWhere do you come up with this stuff?\u201d Then, turning to Ella, she said, \u201cI think what Suzy means is that Declan has a lot more experience than you and maybe he is afraid of hurting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come on.\u201d Suzy snorted. \u201cElla doesn\u2019t need everything I say explained to her. She knows what I\u2019m talking about. Okay, give me a few days to think on this one. I\u2019m sure we can come up with a plan for you to land Declan if you really want to. Look at Beth; she landed her man through wild sex on my kitchen counters and all over my damn house. I\u2019m sure I can come up with something for you. Maybe Claire could loan you her house, though. I don\u2019t think I can stomach any more naked bodies sliding across my granite countertops.\u201d</p><p>When everyone got their laughter under control, Suzy added, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a barbecue on Saturday to rid our house of the evil from our last dinner party. I promise that my parents will not be there so you don\u2019t have to make excuses.\u201d Wiggling her eyebrows at Ella, she said, \u201cI promise that Gray will make sure Declan is there so wear something hot. Oh, crap, never mind, I don\u2019t trust you to know what that is, so let\u2019s go pick out something for you right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d Beth said, \u201cI thought we were going to look at wedding dresses for you and make some plans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, we can do that next week. Ella is our priority now.\u201d</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at Ella\u2019s terrified expression. Putting her arm around her friend, Beth whispered in her ear, \u201cJust go with it. If you argue, it will get more painful. It\u2019s better to give in now because you can\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>Beth stood in front of her bedroom mirror studying her body. She had tried to laugh off the scales in front of the girls at the mall today, but the number still stung. It had to be the late dinners with Nick, because otherwise she thought she had been eating really well lately. Since he usually stopped at the gym on the way home, it was usually around seven before they ate. Maybe she could start skipping dinner completely. She could just tell Nick that she was too hungry to wait, and he would never know the difference. He had been making comments on her small portions lately and she didn\u2019t want him to know that she planned to miss a meal. It was unreal how when you\u2019re fat the world seems interested in every bite you put in your mouth, and when you lose the weight, they still seem just as interested.</p><p>First, her parents wanted to make sure she didn\u2019t eat too much and blow up, and Nick wanted to make sure she ate enough. Would there ever be a time in her life when no one gave a damn what she ate? Why couldn\u2019t she enjoy her pregnancy like other new first-time mothers-to-be?</p><p>She was excited and nervous about being a mother. When she could rise above the panic of gaining weight, she thought a lot about the type of mother she wanted to be. One thing she was certain of, she would never be as cold and distant as her mother. Her children would be allowed to have dreams and they would have the childhood that Suzy and she had always dreamed of.</p><p>She heard the door slam in the other room and she quickly stepped away from the mirror. It wouldn\u2019t do for Nick to think that she was worrying about her weight. She didn\u2019t want him to be suspicious when he didn\u2019t see her eating.</p><p>Beth walked back into the living room as Nick tossed his keys on the table and dropped his gym bag on the floor. She could feel her heart kick into gear as her eyes slid hungrily over his body. Athletic shorts hung low on his lean hips and narrow waist. His biceps glistened with sweat and his tank top outlined his muscular chest. Oh, girl, you are in trouble. There is no way you can settle for cuddling again tonight with that sitting next to you. When did you become obsessed with sweaty guys? Shouldn\u2019t you want him to shower first?</p><p>Cocking a brow at her, Nick asked, \u201cHey, princess, what do you want for dinner?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou,\u201d Beth moaned. \u201cI mean . . .\u201d</p><p>With a grin, he asked, \u201cCould you be a little more specific?\u201d</p><p>Beth walked over to him and slid a hand across one of his hard butt cheeks, giving it a firm squeeze. \u201cIs that specific enough for you?\u201d</p><p>Giving her a sexy grin, he said, \u201cI\u2019m still not clear on your meaning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHmm, well, let me make myself a little clearer for you.\u201d Leaving one hand on his ass, she brought her other hand in front and found him rock hard against the flimsy material of his shorts. She traced her hand up his shaft, gripping him firmly. \u201cGet the picture now?\u201d</p><p>Heat blazed in his eyes as he pushed himself against her hand. \u201cOh, yeah, I\u2019ve got it, baby, and I would be more than happy to give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Nick lifted her suddenly and laid her on the table, knocking his keys to the floor. He jerked up her skirt to her waist and, through her panties, he cupped his hand over her mound. Feeling the moisture on the fabric, he gave her a rakish grin. \u201cSomeone has been waiting for me to get home.\u201d</p><p>Beth could only moan as he continued to caress her through the fabric. She bucked her hips against him, wanting his fingers on her bare flesh, but he continued to deny her. He stroked along her slit, edging the panty-covered tip of one finger inside her. Beth groaned deeper in frustration. He only chuckled. Then, frustrating her even more, his hand left her completely and wandered up to unbutton her blouse. He pulled her bra down and her breasts spilled from the top of the cups. He moved in tighter between her legs, rubbing his erection against her core as he took one puckered nipple inside his mouth and nipped it lightly with his teeth. Pain and pleasure converged as his teeth and tongue worked her nipples. Each tug on their sensitive peaks caused an answering surge of heat to blaze through her sex.</p><p>He lowered his head to her ear and ran the tip of his tongue around the shell. Then he whispered, \u201cIs this what you had in mind?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God, yes,\u201d she moaned. She locked her legs around his waist and bucked against his cock. \u201cNow, Nick, stop teasing me!\u201d</p><p>The teasing light was gone from his eyes as the friction of their bodies rubbing together finally pushed him into the same frantic mode that she was in. He pulled back enough to lower his shorts and briefs. His erection sprang forward in all of its glory. Beth could feel her body moisten further in anticipation. He pulled her legs loose and raised them into the air. He slid her panties off quickly and lowered her legs over his shoulders. Her bottom was elevated in the air as he positioned his large cock at her entrance. He rubbed the head back and forth, lubricating himself with her moisture. \u201cOh, princess, you are so wet.\u201d Without warning, he plunged forward and buried his cock deep inside her.</p><p>\u201cAgh! Oh, that feels so good,\u201d Beth shouted. He set a fast, relentless pace. The sound of their bodies slapping together as she rose to meet his thrusts filled the room. She felt like she would explode if she didn\u2019t reach the peak that she was driving toward. Without warning, he pulled out of her body and flipped her over onto her knees. As she started to protest the loss of his heat, he slammed back into her from behind. Her head fell forward as he drove deeper than she\u2019d ever thought possible. He grabbed her hips as his cock surged into her again and again. Just when she thought she couldn\u2019t take the unbearable ache any longer, she felt his fingers between her slick folds rubbing against her sensitive clit. Stars exploded behind her eyes as the first waves of her orgasm started to rush through her. Her body clenched around his cock, seeming to pull him deeper inside her.</p><p>From behind her, she heard Nick\u2019s hoarse shout as his powerful body started to jerk. Her orgasm seemed to set off his and soon they were both moaning and shaking in ecstasy. She felt him rest his forehead on her back as he fought to regain control. \u201cShit,\u201d he muttered shakily. \u201cThat was freaking off the charts, princess.\u201d</p><p>A tired laugh escaped her at his statement. \u201cNot too shabby, Mr. Merimon. All of that working out that you do is really paying off. If all the guys at the gym have that much stamina, I might have to start spending more time there.\u201d</p><p>Nick playfully swatted her exposed behind. \u201cHa-ha. I think I can take care of everything you need. Now, let\u2019s go shower off and have dinner.\u201d</p> <p>Beth tried to look nonchalant as they walked toward the bathroom. \u201cThe shower sounds good, but I\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? What did you have? Are there any leftovers for me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, no. I just made a sandwich when I got home. I think I\u2019m going to start eating earlier. Maybe these late meals are causing me to get sick in the night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, well, maybe. I\u2019ll start grabbing something before I hit the gym, then. I usually just wait so we can eat together, but if you think it will help you to eat earlier, then you should.\u201d</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty when he admitted that he waited to eat with her. What else could she do, though? No one understood the struggle she faced every day. Those who knew her when she was heavy were just waiting for her to fail, and those who only knew the thin Beth couldn\u2019t understand why she was so careful about what she ate. If she let it happen, she could gain a huge amount of weight with her pregnancy and, after the babies were born, she would never go back to the way she was now. All of her hard work would be over and Nick would be gone. No way would someone like him stay with the person she had been.</p><p>There was no one she could talk to. She would eat small amounts when people were around, but when she was alone, she wouldn\u2019t eat. She would drink a lot of water instead to feel full. Surely, that would slow down the weight gain. If the babies averaged seven or less pounds at their birth, there was no reason that she had to gain more than fifteen or twenty pounds at the most. Everyone would be impressed at how soon she was back to her normal weight after the babies were born.</p><p>She walked into the bathroom just as Nick was stepping out of the shower. \u201cHey, slowpoke, what took you so long?\u201d he asked.</p><p>With a chuckle, she said, \u201cI was just taking a break. For some reason, I\u2019m completely worn out. Oh, by the way, Suzy and Gray are having a barbecue Saturday night.\u201d</p> <p>Nick swung around to look at her. \u201cPlease tell me your parents aren\u2019t going to be there. I don\u2019t think I can stomach that two weekends in a row.\u201d Then, lowering his voice in a perfect imitation of her father\u2019s, he said, \u201cOh, Gray, you better move before a huge cyclone hits your house and knocks the blocks right out from under it. Suzy, where did you get that trampy-looking shirt that you\u2019re wearing? It looks like a sheer tablecloth. Beth, how could you get with child? You know we raised you to believe that people should never, ever have sex. You mother and I conceived you in a test tube on our lunch break.\u201d</p><p>Beth fell against the counter, laughing hysterically. \u201cGod, please stop! I\u2019m going to pee my pants if you don\u2019t shut up and leave this bathroom now!\u201d</p><p>They continued to laugh, but Nick took the threat seriously and made a hasty retreat. Suddenly, the door opened again and he had a questioning look on his handsome face. Shaking her head, she said, \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t coming.\u201d</p><p>Giving her a devilish grin, he said, \u201cSweet!\u201d and slammed the door.</p><p>The remainder of the week passed in a blur of work and sex. How had she ever believed she could deny herself the pleasure of sex with Nick? If the man had one specialty, it had to be in the bedroom\u2014or the kitchen, living room, bathroom, hell, pretty much everywhere. She couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of him.</p><p>He was also on his best behavior outside the bedroom. As she continued to get sick almost every morning, he was right there holding her hair back, and cleaning her up after it was over. They had also settled into a new routine for their meals. He ate most days before he got home and she continued to let him think that she was eating earlier. The few times he had brought her something sweet, she had nibbled on it until she could discreetly throw it away. Her new diligence seemed to be paying off because she had actually been down a pound that morning for the first time.</p><p>Even though her weight seemed to have stabilized, her clothes were still getting tighter and tighter. She was wearing more dresses because the waistbands of her slacks were no longer buttoning. She had resorted to holding the last pair that she had worn to the office together with a rubber band. Due to her pregnancy she could now see the faint outline of a tummy that hadn\u2019t been there a month ago. She was waiting for Nick to say something stupid like \u201cMore woman to love.\u201d If he did, she would probably sit down and cry for an hour since her hormones were out of control. Luckily, he seemed to have good self-preservation instincts and had been unusually sweet and supportive.</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother had called her yesterday and they had talked for a long time. She was so different from her own mother. If Beth combined all of her phone conversations with her mother in the last ten years, they probably wouldn\u2019t add up to the length of this one call with Nick\u2019s mom. Vicky was so funny and excited about the baby, and she didn\u2019t mention Beth\u2019s relationship with Nick or ask if they were getting married at all. Vicky wanted to give her a baby shower when she was further along because, as she put it, \u201cWe have a lot of friends with money who love nothing better than to spend it.\u201d Vicky also made it clear that she and Nick\u2019s father were completely supportive and were there if she and Nick needed anything. Beth had promised that they would go to Charleston for a weekend soon to spend some time with his parents. She had a feeling that she was going to like them immensely.</p><p>Beth decided she should probably start lining up replacement parents anyway because her own weren\u2019t likely to ever speak to her again. Vicky and John were going to be at Gray and Suzy\u2019s this evening and Beth was looking forward to spending some time with them without her own parents ruining the evening.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Suzy was nowhere to be seen when Beth and Nick arrived for the barbecue. Gray answered the door and ushered them into the living room. Due to a last-minute \u201cmeeting\u201d with Nick on the sofa, they were the last ones to arrive. Nick\u2019s mother and father hugged her warmly and then Nick and Beth walked over to talk with Jason, Declan, and Claire.</p><p>\u201cWell, Declan and Ella are both here, but things look a bit tense,\u201d Claire whispered.</p><p>Nick was talking to Jason and Declan and Beth motioned Ella over to where she was standing with Claire. \u201cI love the dress we picked out. You look wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Blushing with pleasure at the compliment, Ella said, \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think anyone else has noticed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I think he noticed all right. I just saw him checking you out,\u201d Claire said. \u201cJust play it casual and let him come to you. I\u2019m betting that before the evening is over he won\u2019t be able to resist at least talking to you. He might not drag you behind a bush, but conversation is a starting point, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth looked around the room and asked, \u201cWhere is Suzy? We know she isn\u2019t in the kitchen cooking.\u201d</p><p>Shrugging her shoulders, Claire said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s usually the center of attention. I asked Gray and he just said that she had a few calls to return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know of anything major that we have going on at work so I can\u2019t imagine what it could be,\u201d Beth replied.</p><p>At the other side of the room Nick clapped his brother on the shoulder and asked, \u201cSo, are we eating tonight? If not, you might want to pass the drink tray around.\u201d</p><p>Gray laughed. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m just waiting for Suzy.\u201d</p><p>Beth had to admit that Gray looked the best she had ever seen him. Contentment seemed to radiate from him. It was obvious that he was very happy with Suzy. All was right in their world, and Beth couldn\u2019t think of anyone who deserved it more than her sister.</p><p>Suddenly, Gray looked at his watch and cleared his throat. \u201cOkay, everyone, why don\u2019t we head outside. We decided to do something a little different this evening, so we set up everything on the beach in back of the house. It\u2019s a mild evening, so we might as well enjoy it. Suzy will meet us there when she\u2019s ready.\u201d</p><p>Does anyone else think this is weird? If I didn\u2019t know Gray better, I\u2019d be in the kitchen checking the freezer for Suzy\u2019s body. What could possibly be keeping her from being here with everyone? Was she even at home? Maybe she\u2019d had a fight with Gray before the party. But if that were so, surely Gray wouldn\u2019t look so happy.</p><p>Beth was glad to know that it wasn\u2019t just her when Claire leaned over and asked, \u201cDoes this seem a little strange to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it sure does. But you know Suzy. It could be anything. Maybe her leather pants had a run and she\u2019s in the bathroom cussing up a blue streak.\u201d</p><p>Claire chuckled as they walked onto the patio and started down the stairs. When they turned the corner, and the beach came into sight, everyone froze. Beth heard Nick mutter, \u201cEither someone\u2019s getting baptized or married.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, my,\u201d Claire breathed. \u201cThey\u2019re getting married! I can\u2019t believe it. Hey, she picked out a dress without us.\u201d</p><p>Everyone slowly made their way forward. Beth could see tears rolling down Gray\u2019s mother\u2019s cheeks as she clasped her husband\u2019s hand tightly.</p><p>Suzy stood next to a white arbor with white tulle woven through it. She was simply breathtaking. Her long red hair was loose and the wind made it look like a halo around her. She was wearing a white lace gown with spaghetti straps and a sweetheart neckline. A long train flowed behind the fitted dress and the detailed beadwork glistened in the early evening sunset. Beth smiled as she saw Suzy\u2019s bare feet peeping from beneath the hem of the dress. She had never seen her beautiful sister more radiant.</p><p>A man whom Beth didn\u2019t recognize stood beside Suzy, smiling as they all came forward.</p> <p>\u201cSince Suzy and I have never done anything in our relationship in the normal way, why start now?\u201d Gray said, and laughed. \u201cYou are our dearest friends and family and we want to share this moment with you and no one else. Suzy\u2019s parents had a previous engagement and we regret that they couldn\u2019t be here to round out the circle.\u201d</p><p>Nick choked. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he got that last part out with a straight face.\u201d</p><p>Beth elbowed him in the ribs and continued to listen to Gray. \u201cWe apologize that we sprung this on you, but I think you know that Suzy loves surprises and, truthfully, I love her and this idea. I hope that the men in the group will be my unofficial groomsmen, and I know Suzy wants the women to be her bridesmaids.\u201d</p><p>Beth ran forward and gave her sister a hug. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you for not telling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Claire chimed in. \u201cHow could you deny us the torture . . . um, I mean pleasure of planning your wedding?\u201d</p> <p>Ella stepped forward and gave Suzy a tentative hug next. \u201cYou look so beautiful. Your dress is so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me?\u201d Suzy asked.</p><p>Ella stammered, \u201cNo, I mean, it\u2019s just so . . . soft.\u201d</p><p>Claire stepped in to bail out Ella. \u201cI believe Ella means that the dress is different from your usual style, but I love it. You make a beautiful bride and I\u2019m so happy for you.\u201d</p><p>Suzy did a twirl in the dress, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I loved this dress as soon as I saw it. I wanted to look different for my wedding day and this is drastic for me. Ella was right, the dress is soft and that\u2019s why I liked it so much. Gray makes me a softer version of myself, so it\u2019s fitting.\u201d</p><p>Gray\u2019s parents stepped forward to hug Suzy, and they all lined up for the informal ceremony.</p> <p>Mr. Maxwell, the justice of the peace and the man Beth hadn\u2019t recognized, had agreed to perform the private ceremony. He started with the standard wedding passages, and then said, \u201cGrayson and Suzanna have written their own vows and will be exchanging them now.\u201d</p><p>Suzy looked into Gray\u2019s eyes while holding on to his hands and said, \u201cI, Suzanna Denton, take thee, Grayson Merimon, to be my lawfully wedded husband. I promise that from this day forward, your life will never be predictable or boring. I promise to limit our family dinners and rescue you anytime my parents have you cornered, and I promise to tell you when you are being uptight, and forgive you when you apologize. You are every fairy tale that I dreamed of and the forever after that I never dared to hope for. My heart is finally at home with yours, and it will remain there as long as we both shall live and into the beyond.\u201d</p><p>Gray brushed a tear from Suzy\u2019s cheek with his thumb as he looked into her eyes. \u201cI, Grayson Merimon, take thee, Suzanna Denton, to be my lawfully wedded wife. I promise never to use starch in my underwear again. I promise to attend all the Gamecock football games with you, and I promise to learn all of the words to every Bon Jovi song. You are my soul mate, the love of my life, and the woman of my dreams. Never will there be another woman for me. Our hearts and our paths will forever be intertwined.\u201d</p><p>Beth sobbed quietly as she watched her sister marry the man of her dreams and was relieved to feel Nick gently slip in behind her and pull her back into his arms. \u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay, princess,\u201d he whispered into her ear as his lips gently grazed her neck.</p><p>When the couple were pronounced husband and wife, Gray swept Suzy into his arms in an elaborate dip and kissed her until Mr. Maxwell cleared his throat and said, \u201cI am pleased to present Mr. and Mrs. Grayson Merimon. May every happiness in life be bestowed upon your union.\u201d</p><p>Tears and hugs flowed freely as everyone rushed to congratulate the happy couple. Beth threw her arms around her sister, whispering in her ear, \u201cI\u2019m so happy for you, sis, and I\u2019m sorry that Mom and Dad didn\u2019t come.\u201d</p><p>Suzy looked at her with a smile. \u201cHey, it doesn\u2019t matter. If we had parents like Gray\u2019s, then I would have been upset, but our parents would have ruined the day and you know it. Besides,\u201d she joked, \u201cthey gave me some funny lines for my vows, so it\u2019s all good.\u201d</p><p>Leave it to Suzy to see the bright side of anything. Gray had mellowed her wild-child sister and it was amazing. She was still the same outspoken, edgy person, but Gray had softened those edges to where they were no longer razor sharp. He had finally shown her the unconditional love that Beth had come to think was a myth. Looking at them now, so deeply in love and so at peace with each other, caused a pang of emptiness in Beth\u2019s heart. Would that ever happen to her? Her relationship with Nick was both exciting and comfortable, but would it ever grow to be love?</p> <p>Nick made it a point to be the first in line to kiss the bride at any wedding he attended, but the bride\u2019s sister beat him today. But if he had to lose, then who better to prevail over him? Beth\u2019s eyes were still misty from the ceremony. She was a lot more emotional these days than when they had first met. He found that he secretly liked this softer side she had started to show him. She had never been jarring like Suzy, but she could cut you off at the knees when she wanted to.</p><p>Nick still worried about the situation with her parents. There had been no contact since he had blown up at them at the last dinner, and although he didn\u2019t miss them, he wasn\u2019t so sure about Beth. She usually changed the subject when he brought them up. She assured him that she wasn\u2019t bothered by their ugly words about her, but he wasn\u2019t sure about that. Her eating habits had changed since then and he suspected that her parents were the reason. He never saw her eat anymore. She seemed to avoid meals with him altogether, and the few times they did eat together, he couldn\u2019t recall anything actually going in her mouth.</p><p>Maybe he was worrying over nothing. Her parents may have made her too self-conscious to eat in front of him now, which was a damn shame. She said she was just trying to lessen her morning sickness and he hoped that was all it was, although something about it gave him a feeling of unease. This was a tough time for a woman and she probably needed more support and compliments from him. He could definitely step things up in that area. He would ask Suzy to keep an eye on her as well. There was no way he was going to allow the poisonous words of her parents to shed a single doubt on what a beautiful woman she was.</p><p>The women finally had a moment to themselves. A catering service had arrived a few moments after the wedding and, by the time they reached the patio, a buffet and tables had been set up for the guests. Beth wanted to groan when she saw the array of mouthwatering food.</p><p>She loaded a small plate with a piece of fish and some green beans. Beside her, Suzy was on her second plate of food. Oh, how she envied her sister\u2019s ability to eat anything and never worry about it.</p><p>Like Beth, Ella seemed barely to be nibbling at her food, but for altogether different reasons. Declan had yet to seek her out and she was starting to despair that it would ever happen. Beth hated to think it, but maybe it was for the best. She didn\u2019t like imagining how badly he could hurt her friend, if given the chance. Ella was a very special person but Beth still felt like she would be out of her league with someone as worldly wise as Declan. He wasn\u2019t the right man for her.</p><p>\u201cSo I made sure Gray got Declan here just for you, Ella. I made a special effort, despite all the wedding planning, to get that man here, and you\u2019re still sitting in the corner. You\u2019re wearing the dress and he\u2019s looked at the merchandise, so what the hell are you waiting on, an engraved invitation?\u201d Suzy asked.</p><p>\u201cEvery time I get near him, he goes the other way. I don\u2019t know what else to do. He doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me and I might as well accept it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, horseshit! Do I have to do everything around here? I\u2019m going to set up some dancing and you are going to dance with him. Leave the details to me. I will make sure it happens. You just push those girls up there in his face and give it all you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p><p>Claire burst out laughing. \u201cOnly you could be at your own wedding, Suzy, and be trying to hook up your friend. Shouldn\u2019t you be basking in the moment with your groom and not worrying about Ella\u2019s girls being on display?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt might be my wedding, but when someone is so obviously in need of my expert services, I can\u2019t turn them away. Just hang on, Ella, and I\u2019ll take care of it as soon as we cut that big-ass cake that Gray ordered. There are only a few of us; what does he think we\u2019re going to do with the rest of it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, Beth,\u201d Claire said. \u201cHow are things working out with Operation Clinger? Has Nick resorted to begging yet?\u201d</p><p>Beth turned a shade of red usually reserved for Ella. \u201cUm . . . I couldn\u2019t make it past the second day. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I want sex all the time. I don\u2019t want to cuddle with him; I want to jump his bones . . . all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Suzy interjected. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong. Shouldn\u2019t you be nesting or something and not doing our boss nine ways \u2019til Sunday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI knew you would never make it.\u201d Claire laughed. \u201cI was the same way when I was pregnant. Jason refers to it as the glory days. I didn\u2019t even need him around to get off.\u201d</p><p>Looking from Claire to Beth, Suzy asked, \u201cWhen did you both turn into me? If Ella suddenly starts talking about sex and orgasms, I will know the world is on the verge of collapse.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly, Beth had a thought. \u201cHey, where are you two going on your honeymoon? Since we didn\u2019t know anything about the wedding, I think we at least deserve to know where you\u2019re going ahead of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I really hate to admit this, but I don\u2019t know. Gray wanted to surprise me. I just hope it doesn\u2019t horrify me instead. It had better not be some hiking trip somewhere. I like to chill in my downtime and put forth very little effort.\u201d Then, giving a saucy grin, she added, \u201cWell, unless it\u2019s between the sheets, and then it\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Beth and Claire laughed and Ella turned her usual shade of crimson, but gave a shy smile. The poor girl would probably be high-fiving them soon if she continued to spend so much time around Suzy.</p><p>Gray walked over at that moment and leaned down to kiss Suzy on the top of her head. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know what you three are laughing about. I think it\u2019s time for our dance, Mrs. Merimon.\u201d Suzy took the hand that Gray extended and pulled him aside. Beth saw Gray shake his head and give her an indulgent smile. They walked to the center of the patio and Gray said, \u201cExcuse me for a moment, everyone.\u201d When all eyes were on him, he continued. \u201cAs you all know, my wife is very shy and doesn\u2019t like to be the center of attention.\u201d As the hoots of laughter finally died down, Gray continued. \u201cSince my wife is so shy, we would both love it if everyone would join us in our first dance as a married couple. So Mom and Dad, Jason and Claire, Nick and Beth, and Declan and Ella, we would consider this the perfect wedding if you would join in as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, brother,\u201d Claire murmured. \u201cThat girl is evil and she even has Gray in on the action. All right, Ella, don\u2019t just stare at him, get up and make your move. Suzy probably had to promise Gray something illegal tonight in order to pull this off for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if he doesn\u2019t want to dance with me?\u201d Ella asked timidly.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, Ella,\u201d Beth added, \u201che does. I caught him staring at you at least a dozen times tonight, so go for it. Give him a chance to see or feel what he\u2019s missing.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled as the opening notes of a song from one of her sister\u2019s favorite bands started up. \u201cThank You for Loving Me,\u201d by Bon Jovi began to play as Suzy and Gray wrapped their arms around each other. Nick pulled Beth from her chair and swung her into his arms, joining his parents who were obviously experienced dancers. Claire and Jason followed them, leaving only one couple who had yet to join the dancing. Beth looked over her shoulder to see Declan offer his hand to a shy Ella. She could see the beaming smile that Ella bestowed on Declan as he too pulled her onto the patio\u2019s informal dance floor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMy sister is an evil genius,\u201d Beth whispered into Nick\u2019s ear.</p><p>Nick looked at her in question. \u201cOther than the usual things, is there any particular reason for you to say that tonight?\u201d</p><p>Beth cut her eyes to Declan and Ella. Nick looked, and understanding came into his eyes. \u201cThose two? Are you kidding me? Your sister has missed her mark; they have, like, zero in common. I like Declan, but he is . . . way out of her league.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut she really likes him, and he seems to feel something for her. Have you ever known him to have casual conversations with anyone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope,\u201d Nick said. \u201cHe\u2019s direct and blunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee, that\u2019s just it. He isn\u2019t like that with her. He seeks her out. He brings her things and it just seems like he\u2019s different with her. I have seen it with my own two eyes or I wouldn\u2019t believe it. She asked him over for dinner last week and he\u2019s been avoiding her ever since.\u201d With a sigh, Beth shrugged. \u201cMaybe he just sees her like a sister.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve met his sister and he isn\u2019t all warm and fuzzy with her. I can\u2019t imagine he ever was.\u201d He glanced over at Ella and added, \u201cShe\u2019s very pretty and it looks like he knows that. Maybe he\u2019s trying to do the right thing and not bring his shitload of baggage to her. He\u2019s been to some bad places in life and it would probably scare Snow White to death if she had seen half of what he has. I think Suzy should leave this one alone, and if Ella is your best friend, then you should tell her to find another guy to wear her heart on her sleeve for. Declan might try not to, but he will crush her.\u201d</p><p>Beth followed his gaze and studied the two of them together. Ella looked up at Declan in adoration and he looked down at her with an expression that was clearly torn and conflicted. It was plain to see that he felt something for Ella. Beth had a feeling that Nick was right, and that if she were any kind of friend, she should tell Ella to run and never look back. The bad thing was that Ella probably wouldn\u2019t listen. Maybe at some point in every woman\u2019s life she has to have her heart broken by a bad boy so she can appreciate the good ones when they came along. Looking up at Nick, Beth had to wonder if he was a bad boy or a good guy. She had always assumed he fit neatly into the bad-boy column, but now she wasn\u2019t so sure. Nick had some of the same traits, but deep down she knew he was a good man. Was that also true of Declan, or was he past saving? She also knew that if anyone could save him, Ella could.</p><p>The party lasted until well into the morning, when Suzy finally stood up in front of everyone and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you people know when to go home? It\u2019s my wedding night, and if you would pack it up and leave, I would make my new groom a very happy man.\u201d</p> <p>Gray stepped forward smoothly and curled his arm around Suzy. \u201cYour new groom is already a very happy man, but I like where you\u2019re going with this.\u201d</p><p>Clearing her throat, an emotional Suzy said, \u201cOn a serious note, I want to thank you for being here on the happiest day of my life. I know I bust your chops on a regular basis, but I love you all and this has been the perfect night for me because the most important people in my world are here.\u201d With a very un-Suzy-like sniff, she whispered, \u201cI love you guys to the moon and back.\u201d</p><p>Gray pulled her deeper into his arms and kissed her tenderly in front of all their guests. Then, with misty eyes of his own, he said, \u201cI agree with Suzy. Each of you here is now family to us. No one here should ever doubt our dedication to each other or to each of you. We hope this is always somewhere you call home.\u201d With a cough, he looked at Nick and added, \u201cWe would be happy if some of you didn\u2019t make yourself so much at home.\u201d</p><p>Embarrassed, Beth turned her face into Nick\u2019s side and said, \u201cHe is never going to get over that whole sex-in-his-house thing, is he?\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s body shook in laughter. \u201cNope. When you decided to confess to your sister, you should have told her we had sex at a Howard Johnson or something. Did you have to specifically mention the kitchen counter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, my bad.\u201d Beth laughed.</p> <p>Then everyone said good-bye to the newlyweds, and Vicky pulled Beth away from Nick, tucking Beth\u2019s arm through hers. \u201cWe are so happy to have our families officially joined now. John and I couldn\u2019t love Suzy more if she were our own daughter.\u201d Then, with a laugh, she admitted, \u201cI would love to raid her closet. Your sister and I seem to have the same taste in clothing.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled, enjoying the easy conversation with Nick\u2019s mother. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve always admired Suzy\u2019s unique style. No matter what she wears, she looks great. I could never pull off stuff like she does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding? Beth, you are gorgeous, and a paper sack would look good on you. I really admire you. I don\u2019t think anything in your life has come easy, and look at you today. You have accomplished so much. I can see why Nick is attracted to you.\u201d Then, with a sly laugh, she added, \u201cWe won\u2019t mention the obvious reasons that you turn his head. I have a feeling that you could give my son a run for his money any day of the week and he needs that. I don\u2019t know your plans for the future or even if you and Nick have discussed them, but John and I look forward to you and the babies being a big part of our life always.\u201d</p><p>Beth was starting to tear up when Nick and his father walked up. His father pulled her into a warm hug and then put his arm around his wife. \u201cHoney, we need to go. You know my parents will be in first thing tomorrow and we probably both need some sleep for that.\u201d</p><p>With a dramatic shudder, Nick\u2019s mother said, \u201cGreat, thanks for ruining a perfectly good evening with that reminder.\u201d Turning to Nick and Beth, she said, \u201cOkay, I need to get home and have a stiff drink or four before tomorrow. You two are more than welcome to come for a visit, like right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no.\u201d Nick laughed. \u201cNothing but love for you, Mom, but you are on your own there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to pretend I don\u2019t hear this conversation about my parents,\u201d Nick\u2019s father said wryly.</p><p>As they were getting into their car, Beth saw Declan walking Ella toward her car. She urged Nick to leave quickly to give them some privacy. Maybe this would be the night that Ella\u2019s dreams came true as well. Of course, she also couldn\u2019t deny that the phrase Be careful what you wish for kept running through her mind as she worried about Ella\u2019s situation.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>Beth walked up to the receptionist\u2019s desk on Monday for her usual morning chat with Ella. The depressed expression on her friend\u2019s face told her all she needed to know. Smiling brightly, Beth said, \u201cHey, girl, how was your weekend?\u201d</p><p>Ella gave her a wan smile in return. \u201cIt was all right. I really enjoyed the wedding. Do you know where Suzy and Gray went for their honeymoon yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick said they are in Bora Bora.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow,\u201d Ella gasped, clearly impressed.</p><p>\u201cYep. As long as they have a beach, my sister will be in heaven. You would think she\u2019d get tired of the ocean since she practically lives on top of it. So, how did things go with Declan Saturday night?\u201d</p><p>Ella laid her head in her hands and sighed. \u201cThe dance was wonderful and we talked, but I felt like he wanted to walk away the whole time. I caught him looking at me funny a few times so I tried to ask if he had something on his mind. He said he was thinking about something at work. I just don\u2019t understand why he suddenly won\u2019t talk to me anymore. I have gone over and over it in my mind and I can\u2019t think of anything I said that would have offended him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Ella, I don\u2019t think you said or did anything. I saw him looking at you Saturday night and he clearly feels something toward you. What, I don\u2019t know, but there is something there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what should I do?\u201d</p><p>Giving her friend a hug, Beth said, \u201cI know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but do nothing. Declan is nervous or scared of something. Give him some time and space. When he does come around, be friendly. See if you can get back to a comfortable relationship with him. Don\u2019t ask him for anything, most of all for a date. You need to see if he will let his guard down again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGeez, maybe life was easier when I was clueless about men. It\u2019s hard to play all these games. I have bought every book and every magazine and I still don\u2019t know what I should be doing,\u201d Ella admitted.</p><p>Beth hid a smile behind her hand. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard, and I\u2019m far from an expert. I don\u2019t have much more experience than you do. Nick is my longest relationship ever. Before I met him, I had never been involved with anyone more than a month. I wish I could tell you that it will get easier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is easier for you now with Nick, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth pondered Ella\u2019s question. \u201cHmmm, well I guess parts of it are. I\u2019m comfortable with him and he\u2019s a straightforward guy. There are times he still puzzles me though, and I know I confuse the hell out of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, great. When do things get easier, then?\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed. \u201cIf you\u2019re lucky . . . never!\u201d</p><p>Beth worked her ass off for the two weeks that Suzy was on her honeymoon. She went into the office early and fell exhausted into bed every evening. The one positive was that she had replaced her morning sickness with sex. Since she barely saw Nick in the evening, she made sure she woke him in the morning.</p><p>Her hectic workload had also made it easier to manage her eating. Several days, she worked straight through lunch without eating. Her stomach continued to round slightly, but the scales remained stable.</p><p>Nick had caught her in a lie the previous evening. Since she was no longer eating in the evening, she hadn\u2019t bothered to check the usual staples in the refrigerator. Nick had come home earlier than usual and had asked if she wanted to go out to dinner. She told him that she had already eaten. When he asked what she\u2019d eaten, she said a ham sandwich because she always kept that for a quick meal. She could still remember his next words, \u201cHmmm, really? We\u2019ve been out of sandwich makings here for a week.\u201d</p><p>She had tried to play it off. \u201cOh, I know. I have been meaning to get by the store. I just picked a sandwich up on the way home since we didn\u2019t have anything here.\u201d She could tell by the look in his eyes that he didn\u2019t believe her. She had changed the subject, asking when Suzy and Gray were due back and he had let it go. She had noticed his eyes on her a few more times during the evening. She was ashamed to admit it, but that one night she had used sex to distract him.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>\u201cOh, God, can\u2019t I even be back at work for a day without being called to a covert meeting?\u201d Suzy complained.</p><p>Nick hugged his new sister-in-law, not put off in the least by her abrupt manner. He knew that Suzy was a ton of bark and, luckily, only bit when she had to. \u201cOh, come on, you love it. It must have been rough being out of the loop for the last couple weeks.\u201d When an unusual blush colored Suzy\u2019s face, he rolled his eyes. \u201cI know how much you like to share, but please spare me whatever you are thinking because the man is my brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTsk, tsk, jealousy is so last year, Nicky. Now that you dragged me out of my house early this morning, get to the point. I have a ton of crap lined up at work, so our tea party will have to be fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Beth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, duh. I assumed it was since you didn\u2019t want to invite her and tell her that we were meeting. So, what gives? Did she throw you out? Just suck it up and say you\u2019re sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not it. She . . . I don\u2019t think she\u2019s eating, Suzy.\u201d</p><p>Giving him an impatient look she said, \u201cCome again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019s skipping meals and lying about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she do that and how do you know?\u201d</p><p>Nick shifted in his seat, wondering where to begin. \u201cI think it all started with the dinner with your parents a few weeks ago, when your mother and father were going on and on about her weight. She acted as if it didn\u2019t bother her, but I think it hit a panic button somewhere inside her. At first she told me she was eating earlier to avoid getting sick in the mornings, which sounded reasonable. Then I noticed that anytime we were together for a meal or snack, she would pick at it, but never really eat more than a few bites. I still just put that down to her not feeling well.</p><p>\u201cSuzy, she just doesn\u2019t look healthy now. Last night she told me that she had a sandwich for dinner and then when I mentioned that we were out of sandwich makings, she looked really funny and said she had gotten the sandwich on her way home. When I was going to push it further, she ripped my clothes off to change the subject.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, shit, must you go there every time? Can\u2019t I be around you two without having to talk about your sex life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, sorry about that. I was trying to make a point.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, how about making it with less detail next time? I have already been scarred for life by the crap I know about you and my sister.\u201d Suzy rubbed her temples as if a headache was brewing.</p><p>Nick hated to pounce on her on her first day back to work, but he needed backup. \u201cWill you just talk to her today and see what you think? I hope I\u2019m wrong, but I have a bad feeling about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll see if I can feel her out without her knowing that you said anything to me. She might kick you out for real then, buddy. So, how are things between you since the whole baby-on-board thing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Nick smiled, completely at ease. \u201cWe are good. I\u2019m happy about the babies, and I think Beth is starting to get excited, too. She actually bought a few baby books, so that\u2019s a start.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, good. We can stop right there before you move on to intimate details that will have my coffee screaming back up my throat.\u201d Then, squeezing his arm, she added, \u201cThanks, though, for telling me. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re watching out for Beth. As you know, we only have each other, and with her being pregnant, I could use the help.\u201d</p><p>Nick drove off feeling guilty for talking to Suzy behind Beth\u2019s back, but he was also relieved. If Beth was in trouble, Suzy would sniff it out and take care of it. He was damned glad to have Gray and Suzy back.</p><p>\u201cHoly scarecrow, when was the last time you ate?\u201d Suzy demanded as soon as she saw her. So much for subtle. Damn, I shouldn\u2019t have blurted that out like that, but look at her. I leave for two weeks and return to a sister who looks like a stick figure. I hate to admit it, but Nick is right. There is a problem here.</p><p>Beth laughed as she settled into the seat in front of Suzy. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Suzy rubbed her temple again, feeling the headache that had begun during her conversation with Nick pick up momentum and start to pound. It was like the end of vacation and the beginning of hell. \u201cYou look sick. Have you been to the doctor lately?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNope. I have to go again next week. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still getting sick a lot? You look ill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, thanks. Do you have any more compliments for me?\u201d Beth snapped.</p><p>Suzy took a deep breath and tried to be something she had little experience with: gentle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just worried about you. You look like you\u2019ve lost weight since I\u2019ve been gone. Are you eating?\u201d Suzy didn\u2019t miss the defensive look on her sister\u2019s face or the squaring of her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m eating. What is it with you and Nick? Why does everyone assume I\u2019m skipping meals? You know how often I have thrown up since I\u2019ve been pregnant. If I\u2019m thinner, it\u2019s for that reason and nothing more.\u201d</p> <p>Yep, classic denial. Thank you so much, Mom and Dad, for causing this big old mess. Did you have to screw with your daughter\u2019s head? Hey, let\u2019s give you another award for parents of the year. \u201cBeth, I know the parents said some crazy shit to you at my house and I hope that you didn\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><p>Beth stood up and gave her a blank look. \u201cI don\u2019t even remember, sis. Let\u2019s just forget about it. I need to make some calls and I know you have a ton of stuff to do so I\u2019m going to let you get to it. We can catch up later. I\u2019m glad to have you back.\u201d</p><p>When Beth pulled the door shut behind her, Suzy knew that her sister had never been less happy to see her. Despite all the work that littered her desk, Suzy swung her chair toward the window behind her and wondered how to help Beth when she so clearly didn\u2019t want it. She wanted to call their parents and tell them off, but what good would it do? They would never believe that they had done anything wrong. Facts and figures were their life and there wasn\u2019t room for anything outside that. If she told them that they had contributed to Beth\u2019s eating problem, they would roll out the statistics of women with eating and mental disorders. There was simply no room in their lives for emotion or guilt. Suzy was eternally grateful that they had chosen a work conference over attending her wedding. At least everyone was able to enjoy it without them ruining the day.</p><p>Tapping a pen on her desk, she tried to think of ways to help her sister. Beth had seriously pissed on the talking option, so what was next? An intervention? Yeah, that will go well. Maybe we could all lecture her and stuff food in her mouth. Ah, hell. There were certain times in everyone\u2019s life when being an only child would rock, and this was one of those times.</p><p>Beth leaned weakly against the door of the restroom stall. She felt dizzy and frail. She had rushed to the restroom thinking she was having a delayed bout of morning sickness, but so far, nothing had happened. She wobbled over to the sink and wet a paper towel to wipe her face. Her skin was clammy and she couldn\u2019t decide if she was hot or cold. The cell phone in her jacket pocket went off, sounding like a bomb exploding in the quiet restroom. She fumbled and finally pulled it out. Pressing the button to answer the call, she sighed in relief when she heard Nick\u2019s voice. \u201cHey, princess. How about lunch with a hot stud today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, yeah. Who were you expecting? Is there another hot stud that you lunch with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNick, I . . . I\u2019m sick.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly all the teasing left his voice, as he demanded, \u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBathroom,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, baby. Is anyone with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Hurry, Nick, I don\u2019t feel good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHang on, I\u2019m on the way. If you aren\u2019t sitting down, princess, then do it before you fall down. Shit, are you in the restroom on your floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYe\u2014 Yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m in the stairwell now. I won\u2019t take the elevator because we would lose our connection. Are you sitting down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm, hmmm.\u201d</p><p>The restroom door started opening and Beth vaguely recognized a woman from the advertising department as she started in. She looked surprised at Beth sitting on the floor. Suddenly, Nick flung the door open and ushered the woman back out. He ran over to Beth\u2019s side and squatted on the floor. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, baby? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust sick, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you to the hospital. Put your arms around my neck while I pick you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo hospital. Please take me home. I\u2019m just dizzy. It\u2019s morning sickness.\u201d Beth could see the uncertainty play across his handsome face. \u201cPlease, Nick, I\u2019m okay. I just need to rest for a while.\u201d</p><p>He trailed a gentle finger down her pale cheek before gently lifting her into his arms. \u201cAll right, princess, but if you aren\u2019t feeling a lot better soon, we\u2019re going straight to the hospital. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Beth laid her cheek against his hard chest, grateful to have him to lean on. When had she started depending on him to take care of her? She knew in her heart that Nick would protect her with everything that he had, just as he would their babies. Why was she resisting being a family with him? He might not love her, but he would love their children, of that she was certain. You may never admit it to anyone else, but admit it to yourself. You love him. No, no, no! Oh, God, no! There was nowhere left to hide. All of the denial in the world wouldn\u2019t change the fact that she had fallen in love with Nick Merimon, just as countless women before her had.</p><p>Now the dizziness that she felt had nothing to do with being sick. She risked a quick glance at his face, hoping he hadn\u2019t noticed the sudden tension in her body. He could never know how she felt about him or it would be over. Worse yet, he would stay because of the babies, but she would have to live with his pity. She couldn\u2019t be another woman who pinned all her hopes and dreams on landing him. She knew that he wanted her and they both genuinely enjoyed each other, but never once had there been any mention of feelings. How could I have been so stupid? I let him in.</p><p>They were attracting a lot of attention as Nick carried her from the building to his car. She knew that Suzy would know within minutes and would be frantic. As soon as she finished that thought, her cell phone trilled. Without looking at the caller ID, she handed the phone to Nick. She heard him assuring Suzy that he was taking care of her and not to rush after them. After a few more moments spent convincing her, Nick handed the phone back to Beth, and said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do that to me again. Your sister just made some new and disturbing threats that involved certain body parts and sharp instruments.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed weakly, still trying to shake off the shock of the realization that she loved him. She felt like it was plastered on her face for the world to see. Luckily, he didn\u2019t seem to notice anything out of the ordinary. \u201cStill okay, princess? We can go to the hospital now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, let\u2019s just go home. I feel a little better.\u201d</p><p>Without further argument, Nick had the car in gear and was soon carrying her into the apartment. He settled her on the couch and grabbed a pillow and a blanket to wrap her in. \u201cHave you eaten this morning?\u201d</p><p>At that point, she was too tired to lie to him and too hungry to care if she gained a pound from a meal. \u201cNo, I was planning an early lunch.\u201d So maybe that was technically a lie, but she would have had something to eat, right?</p><p>He pursed his lips in disapproval and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see what I can find. Call me if you need anything.\u201d</p><p>Beth closed her eyes and was soon drifting off. She startled awake when she felt a hand pushing her hair back from her eyes. Nick was perched on the coffee table in front of her with a tray containing some type of soup and crackers. \u201cI\u2019m sorry; this was all I could find. When you\u2019re settled and feeling a little better, I\u2019ll make a run to the supermarket and stock our shelves.\u201d Her stomach rumbled from the mouthwatering aroma of the soup. \u201cIt\u2019s just chicken noodle,\u201d Nick said, \u201cbut it was that or rice cakes so I took a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt smells amazing; thank you.\u201d She sat up against the cushions and Nick settled the tray on her lap. Any other time she would have been embarrassed at how fast she consumed the bowl of soup, but once she started, she couldn\u2019t seem to stop. It was the best meal she could remember having in ages and she ate until the tray was clear.</p><p>Nick gave her a smile of approval when he removed the empty tray. \u201cGood girl.\u201d He took the tray to the kitchen and she was surprised when he came back to the couch and lifted her up so that he could slide in behind her. When he had her settled in his arms to his satisfaction, she snuggled into his warmth. His hands settled on her temples and she moaned in bliss as he rubbed them gently. The combination of the meal and the massage was more than her tired body could handle. Within moments, she felt herself slipping away. How could love be any better than what she felt right now in his arms? It was just the icing on the cake. She could live with this. It was enough, wasn\u2019t it?</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>Beth lay in his arms sleeping peacefully, but sleep wouldn\u2019t come for Nick. So many thoughts swirled in his head. He had little doubt that her sickness earlier was brought on by not eating. She had devoured the soup as if she hadn\u2019t eaten in a week, and she probably hadn\u2019t. What was he going to do with her? He couldn\u2019t force-feed her, but his days of accepting her word that she had already eaten were over. It was time to make things more difficult for her to try to cover up skipping meals. He would stop going to the gym in the evening. Making sure she was okay was more important than working out. Come to think of it, he would start matching his office hours to hers as much as possible. He could work at home in the evening if he needed to. If they rode to and from work together, she couldn\u2019t say that she had picked up something on the way home.</p><p>He was worried about what she was doing to the babies, but he was more terrified of what she was doing to herself, mentally and physically. Not for the first time, he longed to strangle her uptight parents. What must they have put his beautiful girl through in her life to make her feel this way? His gut clenched as he imagined something happening to her. He couldn\u2019t comprehend a world without Beth in it. Somewhere along the way, she had become home to him. They laughed together, they played together, and she could drive him to the edge with just one look. There were moments he wanted to kiss her and moments he wanted to strangle her, but the one thing stayed constant: the want. They might not have the white-picket fence or traditional relationship like Claire and Jason, but they could come pretty damn close.</p><p>The only problem left was how to convince Beth of that. Was she truly ready to be a family\u2014with him? He knew women wanted love, hearts, and roses, and he could give her two of those three things. Wasn\u2019t that enough? It was more than a lot of people started off with or ever had.</p><p>The ringing of Nick\u2019s cell phone made him cringe. He knew without looking who it was. Which body part would she threaten this time? He felt sorry for Gray, the poor bastard. He was likely to have his dick cut off sometime during his life unless he kept his wife happy. He had pissed off a few women in his lifetime, but none that made the colorful type of threats that his new sister-in-law made. Sadly, he knew she wasn\u2019t bluffing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHey, sis, what\u2019s shaking?\u201d That\u2019s real wise, Merimon. Go ahead and piss her off. She will be over here with a knife and a pair of scissors before you can say \u201cballs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not your sis, doofus. How is Beth? Oh, and thanks for calling me back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave some of that charm for my brother. Your sister is asleep and seems fine now. I think she just went too long without eating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit! I tried to talk to her today, but she got pretty pissy with me. You\u2019re right though, there is something wrong with her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Nick taunted. \u201cCould you repeat that part about me being right again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, yeah, shut-to-the-up and let\u2019s figure out what we\u2019re going to do, pretty boy.\u201d</p><p>He really hated to admit it, but he was crazy about his new \u201csis.\u201d She was rude, crude, and irreverent, but funny as hell. Even with the constant threats of bodily harm, he could see why Gray fell so hard for her. \u201cI\u2019m going to make it hard for her to skip meals. I plan to change my schedule around so I can keep an eye on her more. I do have to go to Charleston tomorrow, but I\u2019ll come back instead of staying over. We have an appointment next week with her doctor, and I hope they give her hell if she has lost weight.\u201d</p><p>With a deep sigh, Suzy said, \u201cOh well, I guess it\u2019s a starting point. When you aren\u2019t around, I will force her to go to lunch with me so I can keep an eye on her. I can hit the Krispy Kreme every morning on my way in and buy a few dozen donuts to tempt her. Of course, I\u2019ll probably get attacked on the elevator before I even make it to the office with them.\u201d</p><p>Nick chuckled. \u201cThat sounds like a plan. Why don\u2019t you swing by here and pick her up on your way to the office tomorrow? I need to leave early and I don\u2019t want her driving until we know that she\u2019s okay.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, no problem. Just let her know. Um . . . thanks, Nick, I really appreciate you looking after her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, man, I bet that hurt. You don\u2019t need to thank me. Beth is, well, you know . . .\u201d</p><p>Suzy laughed. \u201cYeah, I do know, Nick. The question is, do you know?\u201d</p><p>With that parting shot, she was gone. What the hell was she talking about? Maybe she had taken to drinking at the office. That would explain a lot.</p><p>Beth could barely remember anything from the previous evening. She seemed to recall Nick coaxing her to eat more food before she stumbled into bed. Apparently, she had been more tired than she\u2019d thought. He had woken her briefly before he left, saying he was going to Charleston for Mericom for the day and that Suzy was picking her up in a few hours. She had tried to argue, but he was adamant.</p><p>She expected the worst when she stepped on the scales after eating more than normal the previous day, but she was pleasantly surprised to see that she was down a pound. This day was already starting out better than yesterday. She pulled on her new standard pregnancy attire: a dress. She needed to go shopping for some slacks that she could wear. She was starting to dress like Ella before her makeover.</p> <p>Suzy burst into the apartment without knocking and walked into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cI know I gave you that key, but could you please knock before barging in? You almost made me pee my pants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEwww, must we go there this morning?\u201d Suzy groaned. \u201cYou know, since you got knocked up, I\u2019m hearing entirely too much about bathroom issues, horniness, and the whole \u2018I\u2019m gonna cry any minute\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>Beth laughed at her sister\u2019s martyr expression. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is tough on you, but your understanding and your compassion mean so much to me.\u201d</p><p>Suzy made a face and flipped her off. \u201cAre we ready here or what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYep, lead the way.\u201d Beth followed Suzy out and locked up. God, how did her sister wear her platform shoes as easily as someone wears a pair of running shoes? Beth liked her high heels, but she had to draw the line at anything that would land her on her ass. She climbed into her sister\u2019s SUV and strapped on her seat belt, and they were away like a shooting star. When they suddenly pulled into the parking lot of an IHOP, she looked at Suzy in surprise.</p><p>Shrugging her shoulders, Suzy said, \u201cWhat? I missed breakfast this morning since I had to come pick you up and I\u2019m starving. I love their Grand Slam Breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Denny\u2019s has the Grand Slam Breakfast, not IHOP.\u201d</p> <p>Suzy grabbed her hand and pulled her toward the door. \u201cI just call them all the same thing, eggs are eggs, right?\u201d</p><p>Beth hid her grin as Suzy walked over to a booth and plopped down as if she were a regular. The table full of men beside them almost fell out of their seats. Suzy flashed them a big smile and went back to looking at her menu. When the waitress walked up to take their order, Suzy said, \u201cWe\u2019ll both have the Breakfast Sampler, coffee, and juice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBu\u2014but I was going to have fruit,\u201d Beth stammered.</p><p>Suzy raised an eyebrow at her and then turned back to the waitress. \u201cWe\u2019ll take some fruit with our breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, is this some Make-Beth-Eat thing?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean. Can\u2019t a girl have some breakfast without the third degree?\u201d</p><p>Beth had to give her sister props; when the mountain of food arrived, Suzy dug in as if it were the best meal ever. Much to the delight of the men at the next table, she even licked syrup from her finger. Suzy also watched like a hawk as Beth ate. \u201cIs there something wrong with your food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m just not used to eating such a heavy breakfast; it might make me sick.\u201d</p><p>Suzy took another big bite of her pancakes and said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got all day, so take your time.\u201d</p><p>Beth had a bad feeling that they weren\u2019t going anywhere until she put a dent in the huge mound of food in front of her. She started with the eggs, thinking they had the least number of calories. When Suzy still looked ready to camp out for the duration, Beth moved to the bacon and one of her pancakes. She wasn\u2019t lying when, a few minutes later, she pushed her plate back and said, \u201cPlease, Mom, I\u2019m full. I can\u2019t eat another bite.\u201d</p><p>Suzy gave her a satisfied smile and pushed back her clean plate. \u201cNow, that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it? That will tide us over until lunch. I\u2019m thinking Mexican food or some nice buffet somewhere, what do you think?\u201d</p><p>I think I\u2019m in trouble.</p><p>Operation Feed Beth seemed to be well under way. How in the world was she going to keep from gaining ten pounds this week with her sister determined to eat like a lumberjack for the entire day or, hell, probably the entire week?</p><p>Nick smiled when he pulled in front of the house that he could find with his eyes closed. There wasn\u2019t one bad memory that he could associate with the place or the woman inside. She kept him grounded, and he loved her more than his own life. The smile on his face got wider as he rang the doorbell and waited for his first love to answer. When the door opened, he knew he was home.</p><p>\u201cHello, Nicky-boy. Fancy seeing you here.\u201d</p><p>Nick enveloped his mother in a bear hug, twirling her lightly in the foyer. \u201cHey, Mom. I guess you\u2019ve been expecting me, huh?\u201d</p><p>She held up the spatula and motioned him in. \u201cAfter you, baby boy.\u201d</p><p>Nick walked into the kitchen and smiled at the array of bowls sitting on the center island. Gray had a fondness for red velvet cake, but Nick was a chocolate man. He could make a mean chocolate pound cake and his mother knew it. He pulled an apron from the drawer in the island and grabbed butter, eggs, and milk from the refrigerator.</p><p>His mother sat quietly while he mixed his dry ingredients. Finally, he broke the silence saying, \u201cSo, I guess you were surprised to find out about Beth and the babies.\u201d</p><p>She laughed quietly and said, \u201cWell, your father was shocked as hell, but me, not so much. I knew something was going on with you, Nicky. I always know when something is different with you or your brother.\u201d</p><p>Flashing a smile, he asked, \u201cHow do you do that? We never could get anything past you. I always thought you had about ten sets of eyes that were constantly swiveling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey, a mother just knows. You and your brother are creatures of habit, and when that changes, it\u2019s a pretty big tip-off that something new is happening. With Gray, every time he went to Danvers in Myrtle Beach, he came home glowing. Within a few days, he was trying to find reasons to go back again. His moods were all over the place. I knew he was in love. I was just waiting to see who the woman was. As different as they are, Suzy is his true north.</p><p>\u201cThe first tip-off with you was the break in your dating pattern. You have always loved the ladies and they have always loved you,\u201d she said fondly. \u201cEver since the merger with Danvers, you continued to travel between Myrtle Beach and Charleston frequently because of the, um . . . connections that you have here. When you stopped coming home, I knew there was a woman involved. Of course, that sex dial confirmed it.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, Nick jerked his head.</p><p>\u201cOh, please, Nicky. I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. Pick some better excuse than butt dialing me while you were working out. If there was a gym around with moaning like I heard on that phone, I\u2019d be a lifetime member!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God. Mom, please don\u2019t go there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019d take your father too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf possible, that picture is even worse.\u201d Nick groaned.</p><p>\u201cAll right, As I was saying, I knew you were involved with a woman and I figured it must be different if you were staying in one place. She is different for you, isn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, sure, Mom; she is going to be the mother of my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean, Nicky, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly defensive, he kept his head down as he poured his cake batter into the pan. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same as my brother, so don\u2019t even go there. I care about Beth, but we aren\u2019t a great love story like Suzy and Gray.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, my sweet, dense boy. I see you are in the second stage of grief.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>With a sympathetic smile, she said, \u201cThe three stages of grief are: shock, denial, and acceptance. You need to get past your denial stage and move on to acceptance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMom, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Do I need to check the dessert wine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNicky, you are grieving over your old life. It\u2019s a big change to go from being a confirmed bachelor to having babies. You have to be reeling from the shock.\u201d</p><p>The spoon in his hand clattered to the floor as, stunned, he looked at his usually rational mother. \u201cI\u2019m not in love with Beth and I\u2019m not in some stage of grief. I fully accept our relationship and that we are going to be parents. I think I\u2019m doing pretty well at accepting the change. Why would you think that I love her? You\u2019ve barely even been around us together. I don\u2019t \u2018do\u2019 love\u2014you know that. I don\u2019t love her, I don\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>His mother continued to sit there, giving him a pitying expression. Why was everyone so sure that he felt something that he didn\u2019t? I guess if you get a girl pregnant, everyone wants to believe that you fall instantly in love and together you ride off into the sunset. Hell, now his own mom was on the deluded train as well.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to push you, Nicky, but I know I\u2019m right. The next time you\u2019re with Beth, just think about how you would feel if she moved on with her life\u2014without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely to happen, Mom\u2014we are having a family together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Nick. She\u2019s having your children. That doesn\u2019t automatically make you a family. Beth could move on, marry someone else, and you could become a weekend father. How would you feel about another man raising your children full-time while you took a part-time role?\u201d</p><p>For the first time in his adult life, Nick yelled at his mother. \u201cNo one is taking my family!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really mean that no one is taking Beth from you, don\u2019t you? Honey, I don\u2019t want to upset you, but I do want you to realize, before it\u2019s too late, that you aren\u2019t guaranteed a life with Beth unless you\u2019re ready to give her everything she needs and deserves. You deserve it, too. Just don\u2019t close your mind to the future. If you can\u2019t imagine Beth not being in your life every day, then you need to make sure that you give her a reason to stay\u2014before it\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>Nick dropped his head to the counter, while his mom ruffled his hair as she had when he was a boy. \u201cStop sulking and get the cake out of the oven; I think we both need some chocolate.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t make me go to IHOP again tomorrow morning,\u201d Beth begged. Suzy had insisted on having their morning meeting over breakfast for the entire week. If she never saw another piece of bacon, it would be too soon.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I think it\u2019s been good to shake things up a little bit. Besides, Bonnie enjoys seeing us every day,\u201d Suzy said, referring to their regular IHOP server. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not stupid.\u201d Beth huffed. \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing. Suddenly you\u2019re making time for breakfast and lunch every day and a snack, and Nick hasn\u2019t missed dinner since he got back from Charleston. You\u2019ve got Operation Feed Beth in full swing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFull of yourself much?\u201d Suzy laughed. \u201cIf you must know, I\u2019m working off a lot of calories every night being a newlywed and all so I have to put some of them back on during the day. Marathon sex really takes it out of a girl.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, Beth couldn\u2019t contain the giggle that slipped out. \u201cYou\u2019re full of it, but I\u2019m gonna stop there before you insist on telling me any graphic details about your nights. I need to be able to look Gray in the eyes without further intimate knowledge of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, suit yourself. Intimate knowledge of Gray is the best kind. That man has so many talents.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy, sis, that sounded almost dreamy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, bite me,\u201d Suzy snapped.</p><p>\u201cWow. I knew you would come begging, but I never thought it would be in front of your sister.\u201d</p><p>Beth whirled in her chair to see Nick leaning against the doorway with his usual sexy grin. Is it wrong that I want to jump on him, roll him down the hallway, and rip his zipper open with my teeth? She only half listened as he continued to trade barbs with Suzy. When Beth\u2019s gaze finally locked with his, she could tell that he knew exactly what she was thinking. Shifting uncomfortably in her seat, she tried to look away before Suzy noticed the heat between them.</p><p>Nick cleared his throat and asked, \u201cAre you ready to go, princess?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm . . . I just need to finish up a few things with Suzy.\u201d</p><p>Waving her hand toward the door, Suzy said, \u201cUh, please, just go. I can\u2019t get anything done while you make puppy-dog eyes at each other. Just don\u2019t make out in the damn elevator, please. I have to ride in that thing.\u201d</p><p>When Nick smirked and opened his mouth, she held her hand up to stop him. \u201cForget I said the word ride.\u201d With a satisfied grin, Nick shut his mouth and followed Beth out the door.</p><p>\u201cSo, where to for dinner, princess? How about Italian?\u201d</p><p>Did these people ever miss a meal anymore? She felt like she spent her entire day, every day, planning her next meal. She had given up getting away with not eating breakfast and lunch. Suzy watched her like a hawk, so there was no hiding anything. Nick, however, was a different story. As long as they ate at home, she could get away with eating very little. She distracted him using a usual male weakness: ESPN. She insisted on eating in front of the television, saying it was more relaxing and, being a guy, he couldn\u2019t turn it down.</p><p>She was ashamed to admit that she had resorted to hiding food in the couch cushions and going back later to throw it away. Within a few minutes of settling in front of Sports Center, Nick was totally oblivious to everything around him. She could pop out a boob and he wouldn\u2019t notice. As long as she stuck with food such as sandwiches, which were easily slipped under a cushion, he was none the wiser. He didn\u2019t say anything, but she knew he was happy when he looked at her empty plate.</p> <p>Part of her knew that it was wrong, but what could she do? She was eating more than she had been, so couldn\u2019t everyone just be happy about that? The scales showed that her deception was working. Despite the meals during the day, she was still maintaining her weight. Instead of being filled with dread, she was actually looking forward to tomorrow\u2019s doctor\u2019s appointment. The number on the scales would be something to be proud of for once.</p><p>\u201cHellooo? Italian?\u201d Nick asked again.</p><p>Oh, crap. How am I going to get around that? Even if we get takeout, it\u2019s going to get messy hiding spaghetti or pizza in the couch. Think fast . . .</p><p>\u201cHey, what about the place down the street, Manzoli\u2019s? I don\u2019t want pasta, but they have great subs. We could get it to go. Wasn\u2019t there a game on that you wanted to watch tonight?\u201d</p><p>Nick beamed his approval at her. \u201cGood idea, babe.\u201d</p><p>I\u2019m a rotten person. The man is looking at me like I\u2019m a rock star while I plot to buy a sub that will fit under the cushions without causing too much mess. The acting award for the most convincing liar goes to Beth Denton!</p><p>Beth woke to a hand gently rubbing her stomach. At first, she thought that Nick was trying to wake her up in the way that they both enjoyed. She wasn\u2019t sure why she didn\u2019t move to let him know that she was awake, maybe curiosity. When his hand didn\u2019t move past her stomach, she was intrigued. He caressed the slight swell of her belly softly, almost reverently. His fingertips explored every inch, as if memorizing her new shape.</p><p>Normally, this type of scrutiny would have made her uncomfortable, but something was different in his touch. There was nothing sexual, nor did she feel like he was having any negative thoughts about her changing body. The opposite seemed to be true. She lay there while he explored her for what seemed like hours, but was probably only minutes. Just when she was planning to move, signaling that she was awake, he leaned over her and softly kissed her stomach. She held her breath and tried to will away the tears that were gathering in her eyes. She was thankful when he slid out of the bed and walked to the bathroom, shutting the door behind him.</p> <p>What had just happened was so out of character for the Nick that she knew. His actions made it appear that he was happy about her pregnancy. But he never really mentioned it other than asking her how she was feeling, so she assumed that he was in denial. Now she had to wonder if Nick was handling her pregnancy better than she was. Did he think he would freak her out if he talked about the babies or showed excitement? Was she depriving him of her pregnancy by trying to protect him? Maybe it was time to stop acting as if it wasn\u2019t happening and see where Nick stood.</p><p>Pregnancy was supposed to be one of the most exciting times in a couple\u2019s life. Just because Beth and Nick weren\u2019t married didn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t be that way for them as well. After her doctor\u2019s appointment, she would drag him into Babies \u201cR\u201d Us and see how he took it. She had to smile at the image of a ladies\u2019 man like Nick in a baby store, where he would either sink or swim.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>When they were settled into the waiting room at the ob-gyn\u2019s office, Nick looked around and whispered, \u201cThese women here hate men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d she whispered back.</p><p>\u201cJust look around. Most of them are giving me evil looks. Is this like when you have a baby and you start screaming obscenities at the father because you\u2019re in pain?\u201d</p><p>Trying to hide her smile, she said, \u201cYeah, maybe.\u201d She didn\u2019t bother to add to his inflated ego by telling him that most of the women were looking at him as if he were the last piece of cheesecake on a buffet. Let him continue to think they were staring for a different reason. He would probably send one of them into labor if he turned his sexy grin on them.</p><p>\u201cSo, how about breakfast after this? We left home before we had a chance to eat.\u201d</p><p>Beth couldn\u2019t contain her groan. \u201cCould we at least get through an hour without someone mentioning food?\u201d</p><p>Nick gave her an innocent smile that didn\u2019t fool her for a minute.</p><p>\u201cBeth Denton.\u201d</p><p>They both stood as the nurse called her name. As if trained, Nick walked past the scales and to the end of the room. She almost called him back since she was pleased with what she knew the number would be, but thought better of it. If she had lost any weight, he wouldn\u2019t be happy about it and would redouble his efforts to feed her.</p><p>The nurse frowned as she recorded the number. \u201cYou are two pounds lighter than your last appointment. Have you been experiencing morning sickness?\u201d</p><p>With a rueful smile, Beth said, \u201cYes, I have.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, make sure you replenish your fluids, dear. You can talk to the doctor about taking something to lessen it.\u201d</p><p>Beth gave Nick a bright smile as the nurse led them into a room and helped her up onto an examination table. He gave her a puzzled look, clearly expecting the same response she\u2019d had at her last weighing in public. When the doctor came in a few moments later, she asked about her morning sickness and Nick mentioned her dizzy spell from last week.</p><p>\u201cThat can happen in pregnancy if you don\u2019t have regular meals and snacks. You have to remember that your body is processing food faster and it\u2019s easier to have dips in insulin levels.\u201d Nick shot her a smug grin as she promised the doctor to eat small meals throughout the day. \u201cNow, if you would lie back, we will listen to the babies\u2019 heartbeats. The Doppler should pick them up now.\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped closer as if fascinated. \u201cYou can actually hear the heartbeats through that?\u201d</p><p>The doctor smiled, charmed as everyone seemed to be with Nick. \u201cWe sure can.\u201d Then the doctor put the small probe against Beth\u2019s stomach. Soon, a loud, galloping sound filled the room. The doctor smiled as Nick jerked in excitement. Beth found herself lost in the moment as well, moved to tears at the evidence of the lives she carried. The doctor frowned and continued to move the probe as if searching for something. \u201cI can only detect one of the heartbeats, which happens. Sometimes it can be hard to get in the right position to hear them both. Just as a precaution, I\u2019m going to send you for an ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>Both she and Nick turned to the doctor in alarm. \u201cIs . . . Is something wrong with the babies?\u201d Beth asked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just routine, Miss Denton. When you\u2019re pregnant with twins, you\u2019re followed more closely, plus I\u2019m sure you would enjoy seeing your babies again.\u201d</p><p>Nick gave her hand a reassuring squeeze as he helped her up from the table. She could feel her body trembling as she walked down the hall to the ultrasound room. Despite the doctor\u2019s reassurance, she was terrified, and she could tell that Nick was as well, despite how much he tried to hide it from her. She hadn\u2019t realized how much she wanted these babies until she was faced with the thought of losing them. Oh, God, please let them be okay. Please God, please.</p><p>The ultrasound technician was overly cheerful, as if trying to set their minds at ease. Nothing would do that though until she saw that both babies were fine. When the black-and-white screen came to life and the technician started looking at different angles, Beth held her breath. Nick gripped her hand tightly, as if he were on the verge of a nervous breakdown. When the technician removed the probe and stood, Beth knew something was wrong. \u201cI\u2019m going to get the doctor to check this, if you will excuse me for a moment.\u201d</p><p>Beth turned to look at Nick. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She could see the effort it took for him to smile as if he wasn\u2019t worried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing, princess. Just harder to see two babies than only one. Please relax. I will have you at a breakfast buffet before you know it.\u201d</p><p>The doctor came in alone and took the seat that the technician had vacated. Beth asked her the question she had asked Nick. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d</p><p>The doctor didn\u2019t answer right away. Instead, she continued to look at the monitor as if searching for something. Finally, when Beth was certain she wasn\u2019t going to answer, she removed the probe, but left the lights dimmed. \u201cMiss Denton, the ultrasound shows only one fetus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo why did you think I was carrying twins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMiss Denton, you were carrying twins. I\u2019m afraid you have experienced what we call vanishing twin syndrome.\u201d</p><p>Nick stood up, still holding Beth\u2019s hand. \u201cWhat exactly is that?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s when two heartbeats and fetuses are detected on your first ultrasound, indicating twins, and on your next ultrasound visit, one no longer exists. Due to doctors requesting ultrasounds earlier in pregnancies, this is detected much more than it used to be.\u201d</p><p>Beth sat forward and, in a panic, grabbed her stomach. \u201cBut where is my baby? How could it just not be there? It\u2019s only been a month since my last appointment.\u201d</p><p>The doctor laid a hand on her arm, trying to calm her down. \u201cMiss Denton\u2014Beth\u2014since it was so early in your pregnancy, one twin was just reabsorbed by the other one. There is little evidence when this happens that the other twin ever existed, other than the first ultrasound.\u201d</p><p>Choking back tears she asked, \u201cDid I do something that caused this to happen?\u201d</p><p>The doctor looked at her in sympathy and patted her hand again. \u201cNo, Beth, there is nothing you did that caused this to happen. The usual cause is a chromosomal defect. It\u2019s nature\u2019s rather harsh way of handling a pregnancy that isn\u2019t viable.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Beth\u2019s agitation, Nick sat back down beside her and gripped her hand. \u201cWhat about the remaining baby?\u201d he asked. \u201cWill Beth have problems with the pregnancy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything looks perfectly normal with the baby you are carrying. Since the loss of the twin happened in your first trimester and you had no bleeding or cramping, there is no reason to believe that your pregnancy won\u2019t continue on normally.\u201d The doctor rose to her feet and said quietly, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you some privacy. When you\u2019re ready, the nurse will bring you to my office and I can answer any other questions you might have. Please take all the time you need.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>When the door shut behind her, Nick helped Beth off the table and pulled her into his arms. She stood stiffly, unable to feel anything other than the darkness that was descending on her. Sensing her detachment, he pulled back to study her face. \u201cHoney, it\u2019s going to be all right. Let\u2019s get through this and then we\u2019ll go home.\u201d</p><p>Beth turned vacant eyes on him and said, \u201cI caused this. I\u2019ve hid, lied, and avoided eating, and I starved one of my babies to death to keep from proving my parents right. I killed our baby, Nick. What kind of person does that? I was supposed to take care of them, but all I could think about was myself. What kind of mother does that? You should hate me; I hate myself.\u201d</p><p>She saw Nick\u2019s face pale as he started shaking his head in denial. \u201cStop it. You didn\u2019t do this. You heard what the doctor said\u2014this happens so much it has a name. Don\u2019t do this to yourself. Let\u2019s go talk to the doctor and she can tell you that you didn\u2019t cause this.\u201d</p><p>Beth pulled her arm out of his grip and walked to the door. \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to the doctor; I\u2019m going to the car. You can go if you want to. Hurry, though. We need to eat on the way home. I\u2019m not going to starve my last baby, like I did my other one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBeth . . . princess.\u201d Seeing that there was nothing he could say at this point that would get through to her, Nick handed her his car keys and told her he would be out after he talked with the doctor. As she walked out the door, he slumped back into the seat.</p><p>Nick dropped his head as tension raced through his body. \u201cFuck!\u201d What in the hell had just happened? He had barely recovered from the shock of finding out they were no longer having twins when Beth threw him for an even bigger loop. The blank look on her face threw him more than the doctor\u2019s words had. She truly believed that she had killed one of their babies. The look on her face went beyond grief. It was the look of someone who had become their own judge, jury, and executioner. She had found herself guilty of something so heinous that she couldn\u2019t deal with it without shutting down.</p><p>He knew in that moment that pushing her to voice her fears to the doctor was hopeless. At this point, she wouldn\u2019t believe a word that anyone said. He should probably be grateful that she mentioned breakfast, but somehow that only made things more eerie. Someone in a normal frame of mind would be too upset to think of food. For Beth to want to eat now, after what had just happened, gave credence to her belief that she had starved her baby to death.</p><p>Getting to his feet, he opened the door and followed the nurse to the doctor\u2019s office. She probably assumed that Beth would be coming back to accompany him, but he didn\u2019t see the need to explain it to her. He would tell the doctor about Beth\u2019s eating problems and, hopefully, get some reassurances from her that it had not affected the babies. At this point, he would never admit anything otherwise to Beth. Whether the doctor knew it or not, Beth was so fragile that one more blow might break her, and that was something that he could never allow to happen, even if he had to save her from herself.</p><p>When he left the doctor\u2019s office and settled in the car beside a still-quiet Beth, he, at least, had answers that he could share with her when she was ready to listen to them. He would give her a few days to deal with her grief. They both needed that. He was more upset than he could have imagined. Somewhere along the way, he had gotten very possessive of Beth and the babies and it was a huge blow to realize that there were no longer two babies. Yeah, he could give her a few days, but after that, she was going to listen to him. After they had a meal that he no longer had any desire for and after Beth was settled, he would call Suzy to get her support, too.</p> <p>Beth would probably want to take a few days off. Everything was going to be fine. Really? Then why don\u2019t you believe it? He only had to look at the stiff profile of the woman sitting next to him to know that, despite his pep talk to himself, it wasn\u2019t going to be a simple matter to bring her back to herself again.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a week, Nick. What is going on over there?\u201d Suzy demanded.</p><p>Nick ran a hand over the back of his neck, trying to ease some of the tension gathering there. \u201cNothing has changed, Suzy. She eats, she drinks, she walks around the block, and then she goes back to bed. She takes care of every basic need that the pregnancy book tells her to and then she blanks out until the next meal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you tried talking to her again?\u201d</p><p>Releasing a pent-up breath, Nick snapped back, \u201cOf course! I talk to her constantly. She either gives me a one-word answer or ignores me. I fix her meals, fix her snacks, trail her on her walks . . . and I might as well be invisible. If I mention anything about the doctor\u2019s appointment and it not being her fault, she walks off. I thought she was grieving, but she never cries or shows any emotion. It\u2019s pretty damn scary.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScrew this; I\u2019m coming over. You need help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Suzy, please don\u2019t. The last time you were here, she locked her door for the rest of the evening, which drove me up the wall. We just need to give her some more space. She\u2019s eating and taking care of herself so we can\u2019t risk upsetting her right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit, yeah, okay. I\u2019ll give you a few more days, but this can\u2019t go on forever. I\u2019m worried about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are. So am I. I\u2019m just trying to keep her calm. It hasn\u2019t been that long since we found out, so she just needs more time.\u201d</p><p>Beth ate on autopilot. She didn\u2019t taste food anymore; she didn\u2019t care what it was. The only thing that mattered was saving the baby that she still carried in her womb. If not for that, she felt sure she would curl into a ball and never come out again. The only emotion she felt was anger at herself. The sorrow had dimmed as the blame intensified. Had it been a boy or girl, before she ended its life?</p><p>The one thing she could remember about the doctor\u2019s appointment now was how proud she had been of losing weight. All those weeks of denying herself had seemed worth it as the number on the scale flashed. How far would she have gone if her appointment had been a few more weeks away? Would she have starved both babies in her paranoia of gaining weight?</p><p>Nick tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t her fault, but surely he must blame her. He had to be lying to reassure her. A part of her knew that she was being unfair, but that fairness no longer seemed important to her. Her life now revolved solely around taking care of this pregnancy. She didn\u2019t want to return to work, she didn\u2019t want to talk to friends or family, and she only tolerated Nick because he took care of the things that she wasn\u2019t willing to, like grocery shopping and anything that would require her to rejoin the outside world.</p><p>She vaguely remembered Suzy coming by. Just as Nick had, she\u2019d tried to reassure her that she wasn\u2019t to blame for the loss of the baby. Beth had tolerated her until her sister had finally given up and gone away. After that, Beth had locked the door, afraid of who would be visiting next. She didn\u2019t want pity, sympathy, or understanding. No one understood what she was going through or where her head was, and it pissed her off when they acted as if they did.</p> <p>When the baby was born, she would leave Myrtle Beach and relocate somewhere away from all the prying eyes. Nick could go back to his old life and she would raise the baby on her own. Who would really miss her? Suzy had her life with Gray now, and her parents certainly wouldn\u2019t shed a tear. Just thinking about them made her body burn with rage.</p><p>If there was anyone other than herself that she blamed, it was them. They had set the wheels in motion and she, unfortunately, had followed right along behind them. She was finished with trying to win their approval. She fully planned to never see them again, and knowing their level of parental involvement, it wouldn\u2019t be a hard plan to carry out.</p><p>She loved her sister, but Nick would be the hardest one to walk away from. In those moments when her resolve wavered, she missed being in his arms. After the first few nights, he had given up sleeping with her and had taken spare blankets from the closet and slept on the couch. She expected him to pack his bags any day . . . and leave. Their whole relationship was based on sex, so why was he still here? Maybe some misplaced sense of guilt.</p><p>The days had long since started to blur together and she no longer knew how long she had been away from work and her regular life. Her focus was on the baby she carried. She laid a palm against the noticeable swell of her stomach. No longer was she concerned about the number on the scale. If she was never as thin as she was before her pregnancy, it didn\u2019t matter. She ate regular meals and made sure that she nourished the life within her.</p><p>Beth walked to the bathroom and looked at the reflection in the mirror. She barely recognized the woman looking back at her. Her face was pale and devoid of makeup. The long tank top she was wearing hugged her stomach and left little doubt that she was pregnant. Her yoga pants were the only thing she could still wear besides her dresses and tops. None of her slacks would button any longer, and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>When the bedroom door slammed behind her, she squared her shoulders and hardened her heart. No matter how much she missed him, she couldn\u2019t let Nick see her weakness toward him. It was better for them to both make the break and move on.</p><p>\u201cIs this a private pity party or can anyone join?\u201d Beth spun around to see Suzy with her hands on her hips, standing in the doorway. \u201cI\u2019m really surprised you haven\u2019t put up some black curtains or started burning incense.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat . . . How . . . did you get in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, your guard has also lost his mind, so I snuck in while he was gone. He\u2019s probably getting himself chewed up and spit out.\u201d</p><p>Wary now, Beth asked, \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about? He went to the store.\u201d</p><p>Shaking her head, Suzy said, \u201cOh, no, he\u2019s not. He is gone to protect his princess from the root of all evil: our parents.\u201d</p><p>Beth walked back into the bedroom and fell heavily onto the bed. \u201cWhy would he go see them?\u201d</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Suzy said, \u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps because they pushed the woman that he loves off the deep end, and he blames them for everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe blames them?\u201d</p><p>Suzy flopped on the bed and asked, \u201cOut of that whole sentence, you only picked up on the blame thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard the rest, but Nick doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d she said dismissively.</p><p>\u201cOh, God, was I as stubborn as you are? The man wouldn\u2019t have done half the crazy shit he\u2019s done if he wasn\u2019t in love with you. Wake up!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuzy, I really don\u2019t feel like arguing over this. All he has done is fix some meals and walk with me. How does that spell love? I could probably pay the guy from Domino\u2019s to do the same thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth! The man hasn\u2019t been to work in weeks. He shops for you in the middle of the night after you go to sleep so you won\u2019t need anything while he\u2019s gone. He has refused to travel so Declan is doing most of it. He sold his Audi and got an SUV with a car seat. He bought a damn baby monitor and hid it in your bedroom so he would hear you if you need him. He has parenting books stacked to the ceiling in the living room and he hasn\u2019t shaved in weeks. The entire family divides their time between worrying about him and worrying about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI . . . I can\u2019t believe that,\u201d Beth whispered.</p><p>\u201cWell, you better believe it. You need to get out of whatever funk you\u2019re in and help the poor guy. He\u2019s grieving, too, and you are shutting him out. He needs you, sis. You know men are horrible at this crap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has really gone to see Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>Suzy fell backward on the bed in defeat. \u201cBoy, you are fixated on that part, aren\u2019t you? Yes, I think he\u2019s there right now. He called Gray this morning, seriously pissed off. He has been stewing on the things they said to you. He said they needed to know what had happened and that if they didn\u2019t clean up their acts, they wouldn\u2019t be a part of the baby\u2019s life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo kidding. The man means well, but they are probably chewing him up and spitting him out right now.\u201d Suzy pulled Beth down beside her, hugging her tight. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, sis. This whole thing just sucks.\u201d</p><p>Beth allowed Suzy to pull her close. It felt so good to be with her sister again. They lay there in comfortable silence for what seemed like hours until Nick\u2019s voice startled them both.</p><p>\u201cAny other time, this moment would have been a dream come true,\u201d Nick said, as he motioned to them in the bed with their arms around each other. \u201cNow that you\u2019re married to my brother and are like an annoying sister, this just seems wrong.\u201d</p><p>With a sniff, Suzy sat up and said, \u201cIn your dreams, Nicky. So you survived a parental visit without any visible wounds. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s eyes were locked on Beth as he answered Suzy. \u201cYeah, I think we reached an understanding.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Suzy looked at Nick and her sister, and hopped off the bed. \u201cSo, I think I\u2019m going to head out. Gray will be wondering if I\u2019m working a street corner again.\u201d When neither Beth nor Nick showed any surprise over her last sentence, she smiled. \u201cNo, please stop begging me to stay. I told you, I have things to do.\u201d When she still got no reaction, she walked toward the bedroom door. \u201cCall me when you two come up for air.\u201d With another smirk, she was gone.</p><p>Nick couldn\u2019t take his eyes off the woman in front of him. She was now standing before him, looking like Beth again. Her eyes were no longer empty. Instead, an emotion that he hoped was love shone from them. She looked young, fragile, and beautiful. The deep breath he took stuck in his throat when he saw her hands resting against the curve of her stomach. She usually wore a jacket when they walked so he hadn\u2019t noticed the evidence of her advancing pregnancy. He felt his legs go weak at the miracle growing inside her. Dropping to his knees, he placed his hands over hers and tears blurred his vision. Lowering his head, he laid a tender kiss on her stomach.</p><p>\u201cAh, princess. Please tell me you\u2019re back, because I can\u2019t stand to lose you again.\u201d</p><p>Beth dug a hand in his hair, rubbing his head soothingly. \u201cI\u2019m here, Nick. I . . . I just need you to hold me for a while.\u201d</p> <p>Nick gathered her in his arms and settled them on the bed. She spooned against his front while his arms came around her, linking gently over her stomach. His lips trailed down her neck as he breathed in her famililar scent. How he had missed having her in his arms. He never wanted to go to sleep or wake up again without her lying beside him.</p><p>He took a deep breath and hoped he didn\u2019t scare her away. \u201cSo I know Suzy told you I went to see your parents today.\u201d He felt her nodding against him and he continued. \u201cI talked to your mom and dad for quite a while. I told them how damaging their comments on your weight have been to you. I also told them about our loss and, you may find this hard to believe, princess, but they were devastated.\u201d</p><p>Beth jerked around to look at him. \u201cNo way. That\u2019s not possible, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHoney, it is. It seems that my words to them that night at Suzy\u2019s had gotten them thinking. I\u2019m not saying that they have suddenly became Ward and June Cleaver, but they want to do better. I don\u2019t think they really know how to be typical parents, so it may be a long road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to see them!\u201d Beth said fiercely.</p> <p>\u201cI know, princess, and they aren\u2019t going to push you. Let\u2019s just file it away for another day, okay?\u201d</p><p>He felt Beth relax against him. \u201cThey still insisted on calling me Nicholas or young man, though. Well, except for when I was leaving.\u201d</p><p>Beth started giggling. \u201cThey were so glad to get rid of you that they slipped and said, \u2018Good-bye, Nick\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Smiling, Nick said, \u201cNope. When I told them how much I loved their daughter, your father said, \u2018Take care of my girl, son.\u2019\u201d</p><p>The room was deathly quiet and Beth had gone stiff in his arms. Maybe he should have tried a more romantic declaration of love. \u201cHe called you son?\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled her around to face him. \u201cYou did catch the other part, right?\u201d</p> <p>Beth gave him an innocent smile, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I did. Could you repeat it?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her indulgently as he said, \u201cI love you, Beth Denton. Please be the woman by my side, the mother of my children, and the siren that I adore for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Next, Nick pulled Beth on top of him and asked, \u201cSo, do you have anything to tell me, princess?\u201d</p><p>Beth looked down at him just as her stomach growled. \u201cI\u2019m hungry?\u201d</p><p>Nick dropped his arms in defeat. \u201cOh, God, I give up.\u201d</p><p>Laughing, Beth lowered her lips to his and teased her tongue along his mouth\u2019s seam. Just as his lips parted, she pulled back and said, \u201cI love you, too, Nick. I was afraid I would never be able to admit that to you, or even to myself. But I do love you, so much. There is no one else on this earth that I would rather have as the father of my baby than you.\u201d</p><p>Nick reached up and cradled her head with his hands to finish the kiss that she had started. Food was soon forgotten as they made up for the weeks they had been off course. Nick tried to take it slow but Beth urged him deep inside her as she wrapped her legs tightly around his hips. He was powerless to deny her anything and soon his hips were pumping in a hard rhythm. His heart melted as she told him several more times how much she loved him. Would he ever get tired of saying it or hearing it?</p><p>He now knew he had spent his whole life going from woman to woman never involving his heart because it was already taken. He was born to love this woman in his arms and to be the father of the child she carried . . . and all of the other children they would have. No matter where they were, she would always be home to him.</p> <p>Beth snuggled against Nick as they ate a late dinner on the couch. She even turned on ESPN so he could watch football while they ate. She admitted that she had been hiding food in the couch. Nick paused with his slice of pizza hovering near his mouth. He dropped the pizza back to his plate and turned off the television. Pulling her onto his lap, he rested his forehead against hers. \u201cAh, baby, I had no idea. I wish you could have talked to me about what was going on in your head.\u201d</p><p>A tear rolled down her cheek at the emotion in his voice. \u201cMe too, but I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s still hard. I . . . I have a problem, Nick. I would like to think that the trauma of what happened has cured me, but I can\u2019t be sure. The fear has always been there just below the surface since I lost the weight. I could blame it on my parents, and they do deserve some of the blame, but not all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk to me then, princess. Tell me why you feel the way you do because I see nothing but beauty regardless of what size you are.\u201d</p><p>With a sniffle, Beth took a deep breath and admitted, \u201cI\u2019ve never liked myself. For a big part of my life, I was overweight and disgusted by the reflection in the mirror. I became so obsessed at avoiding mirrors that I only kept a small one to apply makeup. I avoided seeing my full body; it was too horrible. Finally, several years ago, I went to the mall to buy a dress for a friend\u2019s wedding. The dressing room was made of floor-to-ceiling mirrors. Suddenly, I could no longer escape the person looking back at me. I begged out of my friend\u2019s wedding and, from that moment on, I only ate enough to get by. There was nothing healthy about the diet I put myself on, but it worked. I lost the weight and I lost it fast. If I thought my parents were critical before, it got even worse. They badgered me about regaining weight. I completely stopped eating in front of them. I moved out of their house and got my own place just to escape their scrutiny.\u201d</p><p>Nick rubbed her back and waited quietly for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cI finally found a happy balance with food. I found if I exercised every day, I didn\u2019t have to exist on just the bare minimum. No matter what number the scales showed though, I still cringed every time I stood in front of a mirror. I wore small clothing sizes, but I still felt like one meal could change that immediately. I have lived in terror of gaining back the weight\u2014as my parents predicted\u2014and of never regaining control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pregnancy pushed you to the brink, didn\u2019t it?\u201d Nick asked quietly.</p><p>\u201cYeah, it did. When I found out, that is all I could think about: that I would gain weight and destroy everything I had worked for. I was still doing okay though, until that dinner with my parents. That pushed me right off the deep end. Having them voice all my fears, and pound away at my hard-won confidence snapped something inside me. From that moment on, my entire focus was avoiding food. I lied, I hid it, I did everything short of gagging myself, and I\u2019m not sure how far away that was. I\u2019m scared to know what the breaking point would have been for me, Nick.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeth, you didn\u2019t cause what happened. I told the doctor everything and she assured me that, although it could have caused you problems eventually, your diet had nothing to do with vanishing twin syndrome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but in the back of my mind I will always wonder, and there is no way to change that. It was a wake-up call that I never wanted to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t make you mad, but I have been doing some research and there are some great groups in the area for people with eating disorders.\u201d When Beth opened her mouth, Nick held his hand up and continued. \u201cI would go with you, princess. You don\u2019t have to decide right away, but I want to help you.\u201d</p><p>Seeing Nick visibly braced for her answer made her heart melt. \u201cThanks, baby. I think that\u2019s a good idea. I do have a problem and I can\u2019t continue to believe that I can handle it on my own. I don\u2019t want to pass on this type of body-image problem to our children. I need to learn to like myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, you need to learn to love yourself, just as I love you. I love you for you. Whatever size you feel comfortable with is for you to determine. I never want you to think you have to resort to starving yourself for me. You are Beth to me, not a number on the scales.\u201d</p><p>Beth wrapped her arms around Nick and wondered how it was that every painful moment in her life had brought her to this point. She might have a long road ahead of her, but with Nick by her side, the only thing that was important was the ride.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>Beth climbed in Nick\u2019s new SUV and buckled her seat belt. They usually rode to work together a few days a week when they had the same schedule. Tonight they were going to dinner before heading home. When Nick turned away from the city, Beth looked around curiously. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to run by Gray\u2019s. I still have his garage door opener and he\u2019s raising hell about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just give it to him or Suzy at the office today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I just forgot. So we\u2019ll drop it off and then go to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Even for Nick, that was a strange explanation, but Beth had learned long ago to just go with it. Suzy probably sent him a nasty text message and threatened some other body part if he didn\u2019t return it immediately. When they pulled in a few minutes later, she stayed in the car, thinking Nick would just run it in and they would be on their way. When he opened the door for her, she looked up in surprise. \u201cI can just wait here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, come on in for a few minutes. I . . . I need to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>Oh geez, have we reached the point in our relationship where we talk about our bathroom habits? \u201cWell, okay. I guess I can wait inside.\u201d Nick took her hand and pulled her into the kitchen. When he turned around and swung her up in his arms, she thought he had lost his mind. \u201cNick, what are you doing?\u201d</p><p>He sat her on the counter and stepped back. Was it her imagination or did he look nervous? \u201cPrincess, you know I love you.\u201d</p><p>My God, is he going to break up with me in my sister\u2019s house? \u201cYeah, I know, and I love you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood, good,\u201d he said, fidgeting. \u201cSo most people spend anniversaries where they had their first date. They, um, also do other things where they had their first date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, sure.\u201d Why does he look so terrified? When he suddenly dropped to one knee, the breath left her body. Oh my God!</p><p>\u201cBeth, I\u2019m worried that we didn\u2019t have our first date in a more romantic location, but since this is where it all started, then it had to be the start of the rest of our lives together. I love you more than I ever thought it was possible to love someone. My life was empty until you stormed into it. Please do me the honor of being my wife and the mother of my children. Also, please protect me from your sister\u2019s threats for the rest of our lives.\u201d</p><p>Nick pulled a ring box from his pocket. He opened the box, revealing a large princess-cut diamond ring sparkling against black velvet. He was looking at Beth as if his life depended on her answer.</p><p>Beth was crying, but she managed to nod her head, and then yelled, \u201cYes!\u201d Nick slid the ring onto her finger and pulled her from the counter and into her arms. \u201cI love you, Nick.\u201d Beth sobbed as he twirled her in his arms.</p><p>When he placed her back on her feet, she pulled back and asked, \u201cHow in the world did you get Gray to give you his kitchen again?\u201d</p><p>Nick laughed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy and I had to promise not to compromise the counters again. He said Suzy was going to the gym after work so she wouldn\u2019t find out until it was too late. Apparently, she hasn\u2019t forgiven us for our first \u2018date\u2019 in her kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I still regret telling her that. She sure does hold a grudge.\u201d Then, placing her arms around his neck, she said, \u201cOf course, if that should happen again, I would never make the mistake of telling her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrincess, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea . . .\u201d</p><p>Beth pushed her body closer to his, running her hand down lightly and grazing his growing erection. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAhhh, baby, don\u2019t look at me like that. You know I have no control where you are concerned. We need to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Suzy is going to the gym, she\u2019ll be a while. Where is Gray?\u201d</p><p>Nick was having a hard time forming words with her hand stroking him through his slacks. \u201cUgh, drinks . . . client.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect,\u201d she purred.</p> <p>\u201cAh, hell,\u201d Nick moaned as he lifted her back to the counter. \u201cIf your sister ever finds out about this, I\u2019m blaming it all on you.\u201d</p><p>Beth choked on a laugh as Nick lifted her shirt and started to suck on a nipple through the thin fabric of her bra. All thoughts left her mind as they re-created their first coupling on her sister\u2019s granite counter. It was hot and furious. The possibility of getting caught made the thrill even greater. When it was over, Nick collapsed against her while Beth leaned against the cabinets and panted.</p><p>\u201cThat was freaking amazing,\u201d Nick wheezed.</p><p>Beth stroked her fingers through his thick hair, nodding her agreement. Who would have thought that what began in this kitchen would eventually bring them full circle here? When she had given in to her desire for Nick Merimon in this very spot, she never imagined that she would be the woman to tame the playboy. She had no doubt in her heart that he was completely hers, body and soul. What she ever did to deserve him, she didn\u2019t know, but she liked to believe that one of the stars she had wished upon so long ago had finally heard her plea.</p><p>Nick shifted off her and helped her off the counter. \u201cWe\u2019d better get it together and get out of here.\u201d He pulled up his slacks and zipped them, leaving his dress shirt hanging out. He pulled Beth\u2019s shirt down and helped her button her new maternity slacks. Beth knew that eating in a restaurant was no longer an option. It was going to be takeout. They both looked like they had just made out in the backseat of a car.</p> <p>Giggling like teenagers, they walked out the kitchen door and ground to a stop as Suzy stood in front of them with her hands on her hips. Beth heard Nick groan as she gave her sister a sheepish grin. \u201cI know you two horny goats didn\u2019t just deface my kitchen yet again!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell . . . we were just leaving your garage door opener,\u201d Nick offered.</p><p>\u201cReally? So you broke in and had sex in my kitchen so you could return it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. Gray knew we were coming so we didn\u2019t break in,\u201d he defended.</p><p>Beth winced, as Suzy\u2019s voice got higher. \u201cGray said you could have sex in our kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at her and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, princess, but I told you that this one was on you if we got caught, so good luck.\u201d</p> <p>Beth rolled her eyes as he stepped behind her. \u201cCoward.\u201d As Suzy glared daggers at them, the door slammed and Gray walked in. He appeared to assess the situation in one glance and gave a wry grin.</p><p>Suzy turned toward him with an innocent, sweet expression. \u201cBaby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, dear?\u201d Gray answered.</p><p>\u201cDid you tell your brother that he could make out in our kitchen again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . not exactly.\u201d</p><p>Beth stepped forward and shoved her ring finger in her sister\u2019s face. Since both men seemed to be terrified of her, she thought it was time for a distraction. Suzy\u2019s mouth curved into a smile as she looked at the engagement ring.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be damned. I have no idea why you needed to return to the scene of the crime for this, but congratulations! Nicky, couldn\u2019t you have at least taken my sister to a nice restaurant to propose?\u201d</p><p>Nick looked at Suzy sheepishly and said, \u201cThis was our first . . . date, so it had to be here. I was planning to take her somewhere nice afterward.\u201d</p> <p>Suzy and Gray hugged them both. With a dramatic shudder, Suzy said, \u201cIf you will give me a minute to get my rubber gloves and Clorox out, I\u2019ll grab us a drink from the kitchen to celebrate.\u201d Suzy walked gingerly to the kitchen wrinkling her nose in distaste.</p><p>Gray clapped his brother on the shoulder and said, \u201cYou do realize when you two are on your honeymoon, Suzy and I are going to christen every surface in your apartment.\u201d</p><p>Beth could feel her face turning red as Nick snickered. \u201cSorry, Gray,\u201d Beth mumbled.</p><p>Gray laughed softly, \u201cNo worries, Beth. Welcome to the family. I\u2019m happy for you guys and so is Suzy. She just needs to recover from the shock of another kitchen violation.\u201d</p><p>Suzy returned from the kitchen with a tray of drinks. Beth drank her glass of apple juice as everyone else sipped a glass of wine.</p><p>Suzy cleared her throat and raised her glass. \u201cCongratulations, baby sister. Nicky is a handful, but I know you can manage him. May you have everything you have always wished for. Gray and I are here for you and, with the exception of babysitting, we will help with anything that you need. Our home, with the exception of the kitchen, is always open to you.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled as she looked at her sister leaning with such contentment against Gray. Nick stood beside her with his arm curved around her waist and his hand resting against the swell of their child inside her. It hit her in that moment that this was it. This was what she and Suzy had searched for their whole lives: a family. Despite being told repeatedly that they didn\u2019t exist, they had found their Prince Charmings. From this moment on, it was no longer Suzy and Beth against the world. They were part of the Merimon family where dreams were encouraged and anything was possible.</p><p>I have no idea what I\u2019ve done in my life to deserve the love of the man beside me or the support of the family surrounding me, but I have it. I feel it. I\u2019m completely in love with everyone in this room and for the first time in my life, I\u2019m falling in love with me as well.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s going to be fine. This is our second ultrasound since . . . The last one was fine and we\u2019ve felt the baby kicking.\u201d</p><p>Beth wrapped her arms around Nick\u2019s waist, allowing him to pull her into an embrace. \u201cI know, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever not be nervous.\u201d Their follow-up ultrasound last month had been normal and the baby was right on schedule. They hadn\u2019t been able to see the sex of the baby since he or she had stubbornly kept his or her legs closed. They were having a 3-D ultrasound this morning, and she was both excited and terrified to see the baby.</p><p>Nick had been wonderful and, outside of pushing her to get married, he had been more than she could have ever hoped. He was fully involved with every area of her pregnancy. He pampered her, he worried about her, and he treated her exactly like the nickname he used for her: princess. He was ready to get married as soon as possible, but she wanted to enjoy being engaged and to plan the girly wedding of her dreams.</p><p>They had also attended two meetings at Eating Disorders Anonymous. Nick had been incredibly supportive and he knew that each day was a struggle to accept the number on the scales. It would be a lifelong process, but she was happy with the progress that she had made.</p><p>Nick brushed a kiss on her forehead and led her out of the apartment and to the car. Another thing that Nick had been pushing for was buying a house. He was scared that she would fall on the stairs, and she had to admit that they were getting taxing. She promised him that they would start looking soon. He wanted a house on the beach and, although she loved the ocean, she still enjoyed living in the city and having everything nearby.</p><p>She felt the familiar tightness in her chest as they walked into the doctor\u2019s office. She signed her name and took the seat beside Nick. He wrapped his hand around hers and whispered, \u201cThese women in here still hate me.\u201d</p><p>Beth smiled because she knew that, as usual, they were checking out her man and ogling him like a piece of candy. When her name was called, Nick squeezed her hand reassuringly and followed her to the ultrasound room. He helped her onto the table and whispered in her ear, \u201cI love you, princess,\u201d before sitting down. No matter how calm he tried to act, she knew he was nervous, too.</p><p>She was vaguely aware of the bubbly technician chatting, but her eyes were glued to the monitor, waiting to see signs of life from the blurry image. When she saw the image of their obviously active baby, Beth let out a breath that she didn\u2019t know she had been holding. Nick pressed his lips against her temple as they both gazed in wonder at the beautiful 3-D image.</p><p>\u201cOhhh,\u201d said the technician.</p><p>They both jerked their eyes to her, alarm evident on their faces.</p><p>\u201cDo Mom and Dad want to know the sex of the baby because it\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d the technician teased.</p><p>Unable to speak, they nodded their heads in agreement. \u201cCongratulations, it\u2019s a boy!\u201d The technician pointed to what looked like an extra arm and Nick started chuckling.</p><p>By now, Beth\u2019s silent tears had become more of a loud sobbing. Nick handed her some tissues, but couldn\u2019t tear his eyes from the picture of his son, who appeared to be attempting some in-utero acrobatics. The technician handed them pictures and a DVD to keep, then left them alone in the room. She probably thought they needed to get control before they saw the doctor.</p><p>Nick helped her from the table and pulled her down into his lap. \u201cThank you, princess.\u201d</p><p>Surprised, she asked, \u201cFor what, honey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor giving me this moment, for loving me, and for carrying our baby. I can\u2019t think of another time in my life when I have been this happy or this content.\u201d</p><p>Beth stroked her hand down the face of the man she loved and said, \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure, Mr. Merimon. Heavy emphasis on the pleasure part.\u201d</p><p>Beth dropped her fork on her plate with a contented sigh. Nick had insisted on breakfast after their doctor\u2019s appointment and she was more than happy to join him. The doctor had been pleased with the ultrasound, and the baby continued to measure on target. Nick paid their bill and took her hand as they crossed the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cYou know, princess, since we\u2019re having a boy, I would like to name him after my grandfather, my mother\u2019s father. I was crazy about him. He died when I was ten. I know he would love for my son to carry his name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a great idea. I know it would mean a lot to your mom. So, what was his name?\u201d</p><p>Nick kicked the ground with his shoes, refusing to make eye contract.</p><p>\u201cHoney, what was his name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHerman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, what?\u201d Beth asked, thinking she had heard him wrong.</p><p>\u201cHerman.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and shook her head. \u201cHoney, I love you, but I\u2019m not naming our child Herman. Didn\u2019t he have a middle name?\u201d</p><p>Nick continued to look down and finally muttered, \u201cWinston.\u201d</p><p>Beth jerked around in surprise. \u201cYour grandfather\u2019s name was Herman Winston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. We can call him Hermie, for short.\u201d</p><p>Beth looked at him incredulously. \u201cYou think that sounds better than Herman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, princess. It\u2019s just a name; what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is a big deal. I\u2019m not having our son beaten up in school all the time for having the name Herman Winston. Did his parents not like him?\u201d</p><p>Nick put his hands on his hips and glared at her. \u201cPrincess, this is half my son and I\u2019m naming my half Herman. You can name your half whatever you want to.\u201d</p><p>Beth crossed her arms and glared right back at him. \u201cOh, really? Well, I think your half is already getting named Merimon so that leaves the other names to me.\u201d</p><p>He opened her car door and motioned her in. When they got in he said, \u201cBuckle up, we\u2019re going to settle this the Merimon family way.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in confusion, but buckled her seat belt, curious to see what he was talking about. The Merimon way had better be pretty damn good if he thinks he\u2019s going to convince me to name our son Herman.</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother looked surprised when she opened the door. \u201cWell, hello, you two.\u201d Then worry played across her face as she studied their expressions. \u201cYou had your doctor\u2019s appointment today\u2014was everything okay?\u201d</p><p>Nick stepped forward to give her a kiss on the cheek as he ushered Beth into the foyer. \u201cIt was good, Mom. We found out we\u2019re having a boy.\u201d</p><p>His mother squealed and folded them both in a hug. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled, but you could have called me. You didn\u2019t have to drive all this way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t drive here to tell you, we are here for your kitchen. Break out the cookware, Beth and I need to make a decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm . . . ok. Is there anything I can help you with?\u201d his mother offered.</p><p>Nick sensed the perfect ally in his mother. She would surely back him on naming their son after her father. Maybe he could end this argument right here without ever entering the kitchen. \u201cI want to name the baby after Grandpa Norton, but Beth doesn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Nick\u2019s mother gave her son a proud smile and then looked at Beth with a questioning look.</p><p>Beth squirmed as she tried to justify her decision. \u201cVicky, I think it\u2019s a wonderful idea, but I just think it would make it hard on the baby when he\u2019s older to be named Herman Winston.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Beth heard a chuckle as Nick\u2019s father joined the group. He hugged and congratulated them both. She was relieved when Nick\u2019s mother gave her a bright smile of encouragement before turning back to her son. \u201cNicky, I think you two need to bake this out. Go in the kitchen and suit up. You know that\u2019s where we solve our problems and make our decisions.\u201d Then, smothering a laugh behind her hand, she said, \u201cYour dad and I will be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Beth let Nick pull her through the foyer, toward the kitchen. She couldn\u2019t understand why Nick\u2019s mother and father seemed so amused by their argument over the name. She was relieved though that Nick\u2019s mother no longer seemed offended by her desire not to name the baby Herman. She let Nick tie an apron on her and smiled when he also put one on himself. The man could even make baking look sexy. Down, girl. You are already banned from your sister\u2019s countertops; don\u2019t repeat that mistake with your future in-laws. Beth smiled and vowed to control herself, but she stood firm on two things: she was not naming their baby Herman and she was going to attack Nick Merimon as soon as they got home.</p><p>John Merimon looked at his wife as she dissolved in a fit of laughter. \u201cWhy does Beth think that Nick wants to name their baby Herman?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, honey,\u201d Vicky said, laughing, \u201cyou missed the best part. Nicky wants to name the baby after my father, Herman Winston.\u201d</p> <p>John looked even more confused as he said, \u201cBut your father\u2019s name was Henry, not Herman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, I know,\u201d she gasped. \u201cRemember how Dad was always picking on the kids and calling himself different names and saying he was from different places? Well, apparently our son bought in to it. He thinks Dad\u2019s name was Herman and he\u2019s determined to convince Beth to name their son after him.\u201d</p><p>John started laughing too after finally getting the joke. \u201cHe was pretty young when your dad died so I guess it never came up after that.\u201d Pulling his wife into his arms, he whispered in her ear, \u201cSo are you planning to tell them what your dad\u2019s name really was?\u201d</p><p>Vicky leaned back in her husband\u2019s arms, with her eyes dancing in mischief. \u201cWell, of course. Just as soon as they have those cakes finished. I\u2019m a little hungry, how about you?\u201d</p><p>John laughed as he squeezed her tight. \u201cWhat difference will an hour make? I hope one of them is making lemon pound cake.\u201d</p>  </body></html>"]
