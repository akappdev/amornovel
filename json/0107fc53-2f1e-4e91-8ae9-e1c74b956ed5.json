I can\u2019t let you waste another evening chatting with dowagers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLord Killigrew would dislike being identified as a dowager,\u201d Eleanor protested. \u201cSlow down, Anne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cKilligrew\u2019s not eligible either, is he? His daughter is at least your age.\u201d Her sister turned a corner and peered at a group of noblemen. \u201cVilliers won\u2019t be in that nest of Whigs. He doesn\u2019t seem the type.\u201d She set off in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Lord Thrush called after them, but Anne didn\u2019t even pause. Eleanor waved helplessly.</p><p>\u201cEveryone knows that Villiers came to this benefit specifically to meet you,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI heard it from at least three people in the last half hour, so he might have been civil enough to remain in the open where he could be easily found.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would deny most of London the pleasure of realizing just how desperate I am to meet him,\u201d Eleanor snapped.</p><p>\u201cNo one will think that, not given what you\u2019re wearing,\u201d her sister said over her shoulder. \u201cRest assured: I would be surprised if you attained the label interested, let alone desperate.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor jerked her hand from her sister\u2019s. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like my gown, just say so. There\u2019s no need to be so rude.\u201d</p><p>Anne swung around, hands on her hips. \u201cI consider myself blunt, rather than rude. It would be rude if I pointed out that at first glance any reasonable gentleman would characterize you as a bacon-faced beldam, rather than a marriageable lady.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor clenched her hands so that she didn\u2019t inadvertently engage in violence. \u201cWhereas you,\u201d she retorted, \u201clook as close to a courtesan as Mother would allow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I point out that my recent marriage suggests that a more tempting style might be in order? Your sleeves are elbow-length\u2014with flounces,\u201d Anne added in disgust. \u201cNo one has worn that style for at least four years. Not to mention that togas are de rigueur, since your hostess requested the costume.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not wearing a toga because I am not a trained spaniel,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd if you think that one-shoulder style is any more flattering to you than my flounces are to me, you are sadly mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t about me. It\u2019s about you. You. You and the question of whether you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your time in dowdy clothing simply because you were spurned in love. And if that sentence sounds like a clich\u00e9, Eleanor, it\u2019s because your life is turning into one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy life is a clich\u00e9?\u201d Despite herself, Eleanor felt a tightness in the back of her throat that signaled tears. She and Anne had amused themselves for years with blistering fights, but she must be out of practice. Anne had been married for a whole two weeks, after all. With their youngest sister still in the nursery, there was no one to torment her on a daily basis.</p><p>Anne\u2019s face softened. \u201cJust look at yourself, Eleanor. You\u2019re beautiful. Or at least you used to be beautiful, before\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Eleanor interrupted. \u201cJust don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you take a good look at your hair this evening?\u201d</p> <p>Of course she had. True, she had been reading while her maid worked, but she certainly glanced in the mirror before she left her chamber. \u201cRackfort worked very hard on these curls,\u201d Eleanor said, gingerly patting the plump curls suspended before her ears.</p><p>\u201cThose curls make your cheeks round, Eleanor. Round, as in fat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not fat,\u201d Eleanor said, taking a calming breath. \u201cA moment ago you were insisting that I\u2019m out of fashion, but these curls are the very newest mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey might be among the older set,\u201d Anne said, poking at them. \u201cBut Rackfort\u2019s inadequate use of powder makes them anything but. For goodness sake, didn\u2019t you notice that she was using light brown curls, even though your hair is chestnut? It\u2019s oddly patchy where the powder has worn off. One might even say mangy. No one would think that you are the more beautiful of the two of us. Or that you\u2019re more beautiful than Mother ever was, for that matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot true!\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d her sister said indomitably. \u201cI\u2019ve begun to wonder why our mother, so very proud of her glorious past, allows you to dress like a dowager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this sourness the effect of marriage?\u201d Eleanor said, staring at her sister. \u201cYou wed barely a fortnight ago. If this is the consequence of wedded bliss, I might do best to avoid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage gives me time to think.\u201d Anne smirked. \u201cIn bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel truly sorry for you if your bedtime activities involve consideration of my wardrobe, not to mention Rackfort\u2019s lackluster hairdressing,\u201d Eleanor said tartly.</p><p>Anne broke into laughter. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why you dress like a prissy dowd when underneath you are quite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not\u2014\u201d Eleanor flashed, and caught herself. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t understand why you are wasting time fussing over me when you have the very handsome Mr. Jeremy Bouchon claiming your attention.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, Jeremy and I discussed you. In a slow moment, as it were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both agree that men don\u2019t look past your dowdy clothing. Jeremy says he never even considered the possibility of courting you. He thought you an eccentric, too pious and haughty even to take notice of him. You, Eleanor! He thought that of you. How ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor managed to bite back her opinion of her brother-in-law. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of a ball,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you be more comfortable sharing Jeremy\u2019s charming commentary later, in private?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo woman here has eyes like yours, Eleanor,\u201d her sister said, ignoring her comment entirely. \u201cThat dark blue is most unusual. I wish I had it. And they turn up at the corners. Don\u2019t you remember all those absurd poems Gideon wrote comparing your eyes to stormy seas and buttercups?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot buttercups,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cBluebells, though I don\u2019t see how this is relevant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mouth is just as lovely as it was years ago. Back before the buttercup king himself left for greener pastures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about Gideon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve obeyed you for three, almost four, years, but I\u2019m tired of it,\u201d Anne replied, raising her voice again. \u201cI\u2019m a married woman now and you can\u2019t tell me what to do. Granted, you fell in love\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Eleanor implored. \u201cKeep your voice down, Anne!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou fell in love with a man who turned out to be a bad hat,\u201d her sister said, albeit a bit more quietly. \u201cBut what I don\u2019t understand is why Gideon\u2019s rejection has resulted in your becoming a squabby old maid. Do you really intend to wither into your grave mourning that man? Will you have no children, no marriage, no household of your own, nothing, all because Gideon left you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eleanor felt as if the air actually burned her lungs. \u201cI shall probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust when are you planning to marry? At age twenty-five, or thirty? Who will marry you when you\u2019re that old, Eleanor? You may be beautiful, but if you don\u2019t make an effort, no one will notice. In my experience, men are not terribly perceptive.\u201d She leaned forward, peering. \u201cYou aren\u2019t wearing even a touch of face paint, are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cNone.\u201d Of course she wanted children. And a husband. It was just that she wanted Gideon\u2019s children. She was a fool. Seven times a fool. Gideon was not hers, and that meant his children wouldn\u2019t be either. How on earth had the years passed so quickly?</p><p>\u201cI am not finished,\u201d her sister added. \u201cThere\u2019s not a bit of your bosom to be seen, and your skirts are so long they\u2019re practically dragging in the mud. But it\u2019s your attitude that really matters. You look like a prude, and you jest and poke at men. They don\u2019t like it, Eleanor. They flee in the other direction, and why shouldn\u2019t they?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo reason.\u201d Eleanor resorted to praying that Anne would run out of words, though she saw no sign of it.</p><p>\u201cEveryone thinks you\u2019re a snob,\u201d her sister said flatly. \u201cAll of London knows that you swore not to marry anyone below the rank of a duke\u2014and they don\u2019t think well of you for it. At least the men don\u2019t. In one fell swoop you made almost every eligible man in London think you are a condescending prig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely intended\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut now there\u2019s a duke on the market,\u201d Anne said, overriding her. \u201cThe Duke of Villiers, no less. Rich as Croesus and apparently just as snobbish as you are, since everyone says he\u2019s intent on marrying a duke\u2019s daughter. That\u2019s you, Eleanor. You. I\u2019m married, Elizabeth is still in the nursery, and there isn\u2019t another eligible lady of our rank in London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI realize that fact.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who announced that you\u2019d marry no one below the order of a duke,\u201d Anne continued, scarcely pausing for breath. \u201cYou said there were no eligible dukes and then one appeared like magic, and everyone says that he\u2019s thinking of marrying you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see anything particular to celebrate in that,\u201d Eleanor retorted. \u201cThose same people describe Villiers as quite unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou said you\u2019d marry no one but a duke,\u201d her sister repeated stubbornly, \u201cand now there\u2019s one fallen into your hand like a ripe plum. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the duke were as broken down as a cart horse, or so you always said.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor opened her mouth and then realized with some horror that the Duke of Villiers was standing just behind her sister\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>\u201cRemember dinner last Twelfth Night? You told Aunt Petunia that you\u2019d marry a man who smelled of urine and dog hair if he had the right title, but no one below a duke.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had never met the Duke of Villiers; nay, she had never even seen Villiers, but she had no doubt but that she was facing him now. He was precisely as described, with the kind of jaw and cheekbones that wavered between brutish and beautiful. By all accounts, Villiers never wore a wig, and this man didn\u2019t even wear powder. His black hair was shot with two or three brilliant streaks of white and tied back at the neck. It couldn\u2019t be anyone else.</p> <p>Her sister just kept going, with the relentless quality of a bad dream. \u201cYou said that you would marry a duke over another man, even if he were as stupid as Oyster and as fat as Mr. Hendicker\u2019s sow.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Villiers\u2019s eyes were a chilly blackish-gray, the color of the evening sky when it threatened snow. He didn\u2019t look like a man with a sense of humor.</p><p>\u201cEleanor,\u201d Anne said. \u201cAre you listening to me? Aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d She turned. \u201cOh!\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>The Duchess of Beaumont was standing beside Villiers, obviously fighting to suppress her laughter. \u201cGood evening, Lady Eleanor. And Lady Anne, though I really must call you Mrs. Bouchon now, mustn\u2019t I? I have been looking everywhere for the two of you. May I present to you His Grace, the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Eleanor said, sinking into a deep curtsy before the duchess. Anne gave something of a bob, since she was hampered by her toga. \u201cAnd Your Grace.\u201d Eleanor curtsied again, this time before the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>Like herself, the duke had eschewed the compulsory toga, presumably with the same insouciance with which he refused to wear a wig. Instead he was wearing a coat of heavy, brandy-colored silk. The cut was simple, but the embroidered vine in coppery silk that danced among his buttons and around the hem turned simplicity to magnificence.</p><p>\u201cLady Eleanor,\u201d Villiers said. He looked at her from head to foot, his eyes pausing for a moment on the curls next to her ears. A blaze of humiliation went down her spine, but she raised her chin. If the duke wanted nobility, she had it. Elegance, no. Blood, yes.</p> <p>When Eleanor had fixed on the idea of insisting that she marry a duke or no one, she wasted no time imagining a potential suitor. She had intended her proclamation to reach the ears of one duke\u2014a married duke\u2014so he would realize that even though he had been untrue to her, she would hold true to him. It was a stupid strategy that had hurt no one but herself, obviously.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers was altogether a different order of duke from Gideon. She had not known, would never have been able to imagine, such a potent mix of elegance and carelessness. It wasn\u2019t the silk embroidery, or the sword stick, or the careless power about him. She hadn\u2019t imagined the pure raw masculinity of him: the brooding look in his eyes, the jaded lines around his mouth, the width of his chest.</p><p>If Gideon looked like a prince in a fairy tale, Villiers was the tired, cynical villain who would try to usurp the throne.</p><p>\u201cI gather that you heard my sister teasing me about my childhood wish to marry a duke,\u201d she said. \u201cI do apologize if you felt your consequence reduced by comparison to Mr. Hendicker\u2019s sow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Villiers never experiences such awkward emotions, do you?\u201d the Duchess of Beaumont said, laughing.</p><p>\u201cI was more intrigued by the idea of being stupider than an oyster,\u201d Villiers said. He had a deep voice, the kind that made Eleanor instinctively wary. It wasn\u2019t the voice of a man who could be led; he would always lead. \u201cHow does one determine the intelligence of such a silent creature?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOyster is Eleanor\u2019s puppy,\u201d Anne put in.</p><p>\u201cIn that case, it would depend on Oyster\u2019s breed,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cUnless you have a pet poodle, I am fairly sure that I exceed expectations on both counts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can also assure Lady Eleanor that you never smell like urine, although I gather she is gracious enough to overlook that in a spouse,\u201d the duchess said with a giggle. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll forgive me, I must introduce Mrs. Bouchon to my second cousin\u2019s daughter; the poor dear hardly knows a soul in London. And you must tell me all about your marriage and the wonderfully successful season you\u2019ve had...\u201d She drew Anne\u2019s arm through hers and began leading her away without further farewell.</p><p>\u201cIt appears that we are both looking for the same thing,\u201d Villiers observed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA spouse?\u201d Eleanor still felt so shaken by her conversation with her sister that she could hardly formulate a coherent thought. She had thought of herself as presenting a modest appearance. Demure. Virginal. But Anne made her feel like a balding old maid.</p><p>\u201cA spouse of a certain rank,\u201d Villiers qualified.</p><p>Eleanor felt a stomach-churning qualm of embarrassment and took recourse in sarcasm. \u201cNow all that is left is to assess each other against such criteria as the weight of a sow, or the brains of a poodle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn truth, I would rather not marry someone with less intelligence than the aforementioned Oyster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI never pee on the floor when irritated,\u201d Eleanor told him.</p><p>\u201cYou can have no idea how pleased I am to hear that,\u201d Villiers said. Perhaps his eyes weren\u2019t quite as frosty as they first appeared. \u201cIn that case, I have no cause to query the intelligence of our future offspring.\u201d</p><p>Her sister was wrong. She could talk to men without sniping at them. Absolutely she could. \u201cYou play chess, don\u2019t you?\u201d she ventured. It was one of the few things she knew about Villiers: that he was ranked number one in the London Chess Club.</p><p>\u201cYes. Do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used to play with my brother when we were young.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cViscount Gosset? He\u2019s a decent player.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor personally thought that her brother was a terrible player, but she smiled anyway.</p><p>\u201cI am more curious about why you set your cap for a duke, to use the vulgar phrase,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cWhen I first heard of your requirement, I assumed you were driven by pride. But you don\u2019t appear to be quite as high in the instep as a young woman with such stringent ambitions ought to be.\u201d</p><p>Anne was right. Her foolish comment had given her the reputation of a turkey cock. She managed a smile. \u201cDucal marriages are a matter of precedence and fiscal responsibility. Since I am uninterested in forging an alliance based on anything less practical, I decided quite early that I would like to marry a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmirably succinct.\u201d</p><p>If quite untrue. Eleanor raised an eyebrow. \u201cAnd you? Why do you care for the status of your wife, given that you will make her a duchess by marriage?\u201d</p> <p>He looked her directly in the face. \u201cI have six illegitimate children.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt her mouth slip open, and snapped her teeth together. Was she supposed to congratulate him? \u201cOh,\u201d she ventured.</p><p>\u201cI wish to marry someone who will not only mother my bastards, but launch them into proper society when the appropriate time comes. The Beaumonts have assured me that no woman below your rank will be able to cow the ton to the extent that I demand. You needn\u2019t look so surprised. I assure you that many men at this ball have a bastard or two being raised in the country.\u201d</p><p>There was something extraordinarily annoying about the way he paused after that, as if expecting her to scream and faint. \u201cOne or two...versus six,\u201d she said musingly. \u201cI gather you have led a life of rather extraordinary dissipation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not as young as I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look very young,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re not expecting to charm your way into a title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGiven your family situation, I think most people would agree that the burden of charm falls on you. Are you planning to legitimize your children?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that without marrying one of their mothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one mother is involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDear, dear,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThat was almost a yelp, Lady Eleanor. We seem to be attracting some attention; perhaps we might stroll down a path.\u201d</p><p>She glanced to one side, only to meet the avid eyes of Lady Fibblesworth standing with the Earl of Bisselbate. Of course, their meeting would be extraordinarily interesting to most of London, given the rumors about Villiers\u2019s hunt for a wife. She threw the couple a stiff smile and tucked her hand into the duke\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cI had assumed that the children were the offspring of your mistress,\u201d she said a moment later, when they were far enough away to be out of earshot.</p><p>\u201cOh, they are,\u201d he said. \u201cFour mistresses. Have you examined the baths yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe baths are not open to the public until after restoration,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI understand that the tiles are in delicate condition.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you know that marriage to a duke allows one to flagrantly ignore rules of this sort?\u201d he asked, turning toward the ruined baths at the entrance to the gardens.</p><p>\u201cMy father is quite punctilious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo breaking the rules constructed for ordinary mortals?\u201d He sounded bored.</p><p>\u201cAnd no illegitimate children,\u201d she said, allowing her voice just a touch of frost.</p><p>\u201cTouch\u00e9!\u201d</p><p>The Roman baths were guarded by a phalanx of footmen, but apparently they knew the duke. At any rate, they moved silently to the side as Villiers approached. Eleanor looked about her with some curiosity. The baths had been fully enclosed at some point in the past, of course. But now a wall had fallen in and was replaced by a thick hedge of what seemed to be lilac, though it wasn\u2019t blooming.</p><p>The duke led her across cracked tiles scattered higgledy-piggledy on the ground. Eleanor slipped her hand from his arm and stooped to pick one up. It was indigo blue and painted with a silver arabesque.</p><p>\u201cHow lovely!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat deep blue color seems to be rare,\u201d Villiers said. He looked around on the ground. \u201cPity; I don\u2019t see more of the same.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor sighed and bent to put it carefully in its place.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake it.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor raised an eyebrow. \u201cWe\u2019re at a ball to benefit the baths\u2019 restoration. As I recall, the king just described it as one of the nation\u2019s greatest unknown monuments. And you\u2019re telling me to steal part of the floor?\u201d She began walking forward again.</p><p>There were fewer torches here, and the sound of a minuet being played by the orchestra grew fainter as they walked among the pillars. Some were broken, but many remained, the starry sky seeming to offer a fanciful roof.</p><p>\u201cThe actual bath is down here,\u201d the duke said, taking her arm again to steer her down a shallow flight of stairs.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s delightfully warm.\u201d Moist air was rising from below. Eleanor walked down the last step and stopped. \u201cAnd beautiful. Like a purple sea.\u201d</p><p>The bath was a large square basin, surrounded by soft cushions. Its entire surface, every square inch of water, was covered with violets. Their scent rose gently from the warm water.</p><p>\u201cI gather that Elijah plans a private celebration this evening,\u201d Villiers said behind her.</p><p>She turned her head. \u201cElijah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you don\u2019t know his personal name since he married years ago and thus wasn\u2019t eligible as a husband.\u201d His voice was silky but annoying.</p><p>She cast him a glance. \u201cI don\u2019t know your name either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat seems remarkably careless,\u201d he remarked. \u201cNarrowing your choices to dukes, and then not bothering to investigate their personal details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t so very many of you,\u201d she observed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut I would have expected that fact might make your research on the subject more passionate. After all, you are no debutante, Lady Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>Apparently he also shared Anne\u2019s opinion of her advanced age. \u201cI am two-and-twenty. I will be three-and-twenty in a matter of a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you reached this age without investigating the limited group of men into which you had vowed to marry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d She walked down the last few steps. Pulling back her skirts, she scooped up a few violets in her hand.</p> <p>He followed her. \u201cYou\u2019re not really interested in marrying a duke, are you, Lady Eleanor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot particularly.\u201d She pretended to smell the wet blossoms in her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>The words hung in the damp air. She instinctively looked about the baths to see if there was anyone who might be able to hear them.</p><p>Villiers descended another step and stopped beside her. \u201cAre you already married?\u201d</p> <p>She smiled faintly. \u201cNo.\u201d She met his eyes. \u201cQuite the opposite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe opposite?\u201d He knit his brow. \u201cAm I to understand that you have announced your intention to marry a duke so as to lower expectations regarding your availability for marriage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you are willing to consider matrimony with me? After all, you didn\u2019t turn on your heel, not even after my alarming revelation.\u201d</p><p>She let one of the flowers drift from her fingers, watching it rather than meeting his eyes. \u201cI was young and impetuous when I announced my ambition to marry a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you knew that the chance of a nobleman of the correct rank declaring himself was slim.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou declared that you would marry a duke or no one, knowing full well that no one was likely to propose, since there are so few of us. I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you reminded me, I\u2019m not young. I have seen a great deal and I certainly understand desire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Eleanor was a bit uncertain about what had happened to the subject of their conversation. \u201cAre you saying that you understand my desire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should not throw your life away, Lady Eleanor, simply because you love elsewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know that?\u201d She looked up at him.</p><p>\u201cYou just told me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI did?\u201d He had remarkably heavy-lidded eyes, lazy and seemingly uninterested, and yet apparently they saw everything.</p><p>\u201cI am not a conventional man,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>With a start, Eleanor realized that if she did decide to marry the duke, she\u2019d have to discuss the question of virginity or, specifically, her lack thereof. \u201cGiven your promiscuous progeny, I agree that you have no claim to conventionality.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth quirked up. It had a remarkably beautiful shape, actually. \u201cOh, you\u2019d be surprised. Men do the most interesting things in their private time and yet disparage women who commit even a tenth of the follies they enjoy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Gideon was the only man she knew who was punctilious as a Puritan when it came to virtue, as passionate about his honor as he had been about her.</p><p>\u201cMy point is that I am not a prude when it comes to human desire. I know how inconvenient it can be.\u201d</p><p>Inconvenient was an odd word for the way love for Gideon had shaped her life, but she saw his point.</p><p>Villiers tipped up her chin. \u201cIf you help me with my children, rear them, be kind to them, and fight society\u2019s belief that they are unworthy of the huge settlements I intend to give them, I will be lenient with regard to your personal life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would ask you to tolerate me only long enough to produce an heir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, I want children,\u201d she said. She did want children. And for all Villiers\u2019s tolerance, she had no intention of straying from her marital vows, once she made them. After all, Gideon showed no interest. He had barely met her eyes these last three years. She knew he was at the ball tonight only because Anne told her. He hadn\u2019t searched her out, and of course she hadn\u2019t looked for him.</p><p>And more to the point, if she took vows, she would keep to them. Just as she had tried to keep to the vows she and Gideon had said to each other, private though they were.</p><p>Villiers smiled and the shape of his mouth caught her eye again. \u201cI appreciate your saying so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou appreciate it?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cLike any other duke, I need an heir. But other than that, I must say that I have no deep desire for children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you have so many,\u201d she observed.</p><p>\u201cCarelessness,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cStupidity,\u201d she said, before she could bite her tongue.</p><p>\u201cThat too,\u201d he agreed. \u201cI need an heir, but I would be perfectly happy to live an amicable existence with a wife who had no interest in my charms, such as they are. Although I would ask that you be discreet.\u201d</p><p>Without question this was the most shocking conversation she had ever had. Her mother would have fainted a good five minutes ago. \u201cWill you do the same?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill I add even more miscellaneous children to the household?\u201d And, when she nodded, \u201cAbsolutely not. I am keenly aware of the idiocy of my imprudent attitude toward conception.\u201d He paused. \u201cYou might not be aware of this, but there are ways to prevent conception; as a young man, I simply didn\u2019t care to employ those methods.\u201d</p><p>She nodded again. She knew them.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cWhat an interesting young lady you are, Lady Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy have you decided to house your own children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI nearly died last year of a wound sustained in a duel.\u201d His voice was flat, uncommunicative. \u201cI fought that duel for the honor of my fianc\u00e9e, and lost.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, you lost the fianc\u00e9e as well,\u201d she put in dryly, trying to avoid any sort of melodramatic revelation.</p><p>Sure enough, his mouth eased. \u201cTrue. The Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s brother, the Earl of Gryffyn, won the girl and the duel, leaving me with a wound that nearly carried me off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhereupon you made a deathbed vow to marry?\u201d</p><p>His eyelashes flickered. They were very long eyelashes.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she guessed. \u201cYou made a deathbed vow to rear your own children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was it,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cThe damnable thing about it was that I turned out to be not entirely sure where those children were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeyond carelessness,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had been paying for them.\u201d He abruptly stooped down and snatched up a handful of flowers, sending a small wave across the pool. \u201cWhen I demanded their addresses, my solicitor handed me a partial list and disappeared, along with many hundreds of pounds, I might add.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow very odd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt seems that he had gradually removed the children from their lodgings and placed them elsewhere, pocketing the money I provided for their upkeep.\u201d Villiers threw the blossoms back toward the pool. They rained down into the blanket of violets.</p><p>\u201cNot the workhouse!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLess scrupulous places,\u201d he said evenly. \u201cA workhouse might have explored parentage, after all. To this point I have located my son Tobias, who was working as a mudlark, gathering valuables from the bottom of the River Thames.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDamn,\u201d she said.

I recently found Violet, who is six, living in a brothel. I believe she is too young to know what lay in wait for her. She is untouched.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor shuddered. \u201cHorrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColin is eleven years old, and had been apprenticed to a weaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s three...where are the others? And where are their mothers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you see,\u201d he said grimly, \u201cI offered to take the children away from their mothers at birth. I thought that they would be better off under my care than they might be under the care of a courtesan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe irony is rather distressing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of those mothers refused; Genevieve lives with her mother in Surrey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Genevieve is well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. My solicitor had ceased to pay support for the child, but her mother managed to scrape by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn her former employment?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cTaking in washing.\u201d</p><p>There was something quite hard about his voice, the kind of hardness that concealed deep shame, she guessed. Since he deserved every ounce of that shame, she didn\u2019t bother with soothing pleasantries.</p> <p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Tobias, Genevieve, Colin, and Violet. What fanciful names. There are two more? Why haven\u2019t you fetched them?\u201d Which was a tactful way of asking why he was at the ball at all, under the circumstances.</p><p>\u201cThey are twin girls. And I\u2019ve been looking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t find them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have Bow Street Runners searching for them. They did find the woman who originally cared for them, but she has no idea where they were taken. She was merely told they were being sent to an orphanage. It turns out there are a great many orphanages in England, and a surprising number of twins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely...their surnames, their parentage?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy solicitor, Templeton, never shared information as to their parentage. Apparently that is common practice, as it does not allow the nurse to appeal directly to the father, who prefers to ignore the child\u2019s existence.\u201d</p><p>She sighed and walked back up the stairs. The air was too moist, and the last thing she needed was for her inadequately powdered hair to start curling in all directions.</p><p>Villiers kept pace with her, his long legs sending him effortlessly upward. \u201cI heard just this morning that twins of approximately the right age are living in an orphanage in the village of Sevenoaks, in Kent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Lisette Elys, daughter of the Duke of Gilner, lives nearby and might be able to help you. She does a great deal of work with the poor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow...\u201d He paused. \u201cHow odd. I had considered paying a visit to the duke.\u201d</p><p>She said the obvious. \u201cLisette is the only other eligible duke\u2019s daughter of whom I\u2019m aware, given that my sister Elizabeth is only fourteen. Ducal progeny is quite rare, and when one is shopping for a wife, one ought to inspect all the available merchandise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you encouraging me to pay a visit to the Gilner estate?\u201d he asked curiously.</p><p>She looked up at him. He wasn\u2019t beautiful. He was the opposite of Gideon, the man whom she loved with all her heart. Gideon had golden ringlets that curled at his neck like angel kisses. In fact, Gideon wasn\u2019t like any other man she knew, more like a true angel, with his ethical heart and his serious blue eyes.</p><p>This duke...this one was no angel. Villiers was all human, in his flaws, in the deep lines by the side of his mouth, the crinkles at his eyes that didn\u2019t look as if they came from smiling. He talked without shame of his illegitimate children. He was a man. No angel, a man.</p><p>And not even a very good man.</p><p>\u201cI am fond of Lisette. Perhaps she would be a better duchess than I.\u201d She couldn\u2019t make herself care very much what Villiers decided. Though Anne\u2019s prickly comments were in the back of her mind, poking her, reminding her that she ought to make an effort to marry. Why not marry this duke?</p><p>\u201cI would be a very comfortable type of husband,\u201d he said, clearly trying to be persuasive, though he sounded merely repetitive. It was a typically foolish male comment, because no one could look twice at the Duke of Villiers and imagine that living with him would be comfortable.</p><p>\u201cI begin to think that you protest too much,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI suspect you\u2019re a tyrant in private life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever having had anyone to tyrannize, I can hardly defend myself. Did you know that your eyes are the exact color of wet violets? You must trail a string of broken hearts, given your provocative declaration as regards marriage.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor discovered that she had accidentally crushed the few blossoms she had carried away with her, and dropped them. \u201cNot provocative as much as overly proud. And I have never found that men experienced a great deal of sorrow at the idea of not marrying me.\u201d She had been stupid to think that modest clothing would attract the right man, an honorable man. Perhaps just the right man had been in London, but had rejected her, based on her starchy reputation.</p><p>She could flaunt her bosom and chase men up and down shady alleys. Or she could just marry the duke in front of her, since he was there. At hand. Women had married for worse reasons.</p><p>\u201cAre yours nice children?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He blinked. \u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that three of them are now in your nursery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you have visited them? I would imagine that moving from brothel to ducal town house would be rather shocking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid your father pay visits to the nursery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, he did. Though more often we were summoned to the drawing room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t got around to summoning them yet,\u201d Villiers said, an uneasy look in his eye. \u201cMy housekeeper found some nannies and I assume everyone is comfortable.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor didn\u2019t like the sound of that. She thought it unlikely that the duke\u2019s household had simply absorbed the presence of three bastard children without significant upheaval. Servants tended to be far more conservative than their masters. The ton would surely look askance at the presence of such children under the duke\u2019s roof once they learned of it, which meant that his servants were probably mutinying belowstairs. Not that it was her business. Still...</p><p>\u201cI have meant to visit Lisette these past two years,\u201d she said, surprising herself.</p><p>He bowed. \u201cPerhaps I might meet you in Sevenoaks.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor put her fingers on his outstretched arm. \u201cI shall have to ask my mother, Your Grace. She may not be free to accompany me to Kent.\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. He knew as well as she did that her mother would throw all her engagements to the wind in order to further a marriage between the Duke of Villiers and her daughter, but he was polite enough not to point it out. \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe will not be happy to learn of your family,\u201d she observed, in a coda to the unspoken question of her mother\u2019s approval of any prospective betrothal.</p><p>\u201cWhich makes it all the more surprising to discover that you are so calmly accepting of their existence. It seems you resemble neither your father nor your mother, Lady Eleanor.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI am certainly temperamentally different from my parents. And you, do you resemble your parents?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are both dead. I hardly knew my father, and had very little to say to my mother.\u201d There was something in his voice that did not welcome further enquiry on that front.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your country seat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He looked down at her and said, \u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything about me, do you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy should I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so few dukes that I know quite a lot about them without even trying. I believe your brother is great friends with young Duke of Astley, for example.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d She climbed the stairs.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen Astley in a few years,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI suppose you know him well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you say, he is friends with my brother. He spent a great deal of time with us while we were all growing up,\u201d Eleanor said steadily. \u201cOf course now that he\u2019s married, we see him much less frequently. I believe we shall find my mother in the refreshments tent.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou should probably remove this curl,\u201d he said. With a start, she realized that one of the fat curls Rackfort had pinned into her hair was dangling by one pin alone. Villiers\u2019s fingers brushed her cheek; he twisted and the curl lay in his palm.</p><p>\u201cIt looks like a country slug,\u201d Eleanor said. She pulled off the other one as well.</p><p>\u201cAs opposed to a city slug?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA city slug would be wearing powder,\u201d she said, smiling at him. She tossed the slugs into a nearby hedge.</p><p>He almost smiled back. She could see it in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to escort you to your mother?\u201d</p> <p>If the duke arrived at her mother\u2019s side, with Eleanor on his arm, rumors of a betrothal would flare through London. \u201cI believe not,\u201d she said. \u201cI shall consider the matter, Your Grace. Perhaps, if I decide to continue our acquaintance, I shall pay a visit to Kent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are truly a very interesting woman,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cI assure you that you are quite mistaken. I am positively tedious in almost every respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so. Do you know how unusual it is for a duke\u2014myself\u2014to speak to an eligible young lady without the woman in question making an overt expression of fierce interest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do apologize if I insulted you again,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst I compared you to an incontinent canine, and now I have apparently not marshaled the proper enthusiasm.\u201d</p><p>His eyes did smile, even though his mouth didn\u2019t curl. \u201cDoes that apology mean you are mustering enthusiasm for my charms?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect we feel precisely the same way about each other,\u201d she said. \u201cCautiously interested. It appears that I suit your criteria, and you seem to suit mine, such as they are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA group of people is coming our way,\u201d he said, moving back slightly into the shadow of a pillar. \u201cIf you wish to retreat to your mother\u2019s side without being observed with me, you ought to leave.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to go and his deep voice stopped her. \u201cI set out for Sevenoaks in two or three days, Lady Eleanor. I would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be quite sorry not to meet you there.\u201d</p><p>She curtsied. \u201cGood evening, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy name. It\u2019s Leopold.\u201d And with a quick glance at the group wandering toward them, he melted backward between the pillars and was gone.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>Lady Eleanor might not have caught the connotations of that pool full of violets, but the Duke of Villiers certainly did. Once this party was over, his friend Elijah planned to lure his wife, Jemma, down into that fragrant bathtub and seduce her.</p><p>Villiers found himself smiling into the dark. He didn\u2019t give a damn what Elijah and Jemma got up to. After spending months mooning over Jemma like a sick calf, it was a pleasure to think of her without a surge of desire and jealousy.</p><p>Lady Eleanor Lindel, daughter of the Duke of Montague, might well complete his cure. She was certainly Jemma\u2019s opposite. Jemma was tall, slender, and duchess-like. Her every move signaled patrician blood enhanced by beauty, intelligence, and exquisite taste in clothing.</p><p>But Eleanor? She wasn\u2019t proud, as he had assumed when he heard of her express desire to marry a duke. Her clothing was abominable. And she clearly didn\u2019t give a damn about her appearance, considering the way she had tossed those curls into the bushes.</p><p>If Jemma was slender, Eleanor was curvy, with lush lips that resembled those of a naughty opera dancer. He could have sworn she wasn\u2019t wearing lip color, although her mouth was a deep rose that hardly seemed possible in nature.</p><p>People\u2019s faces tended to match their attire: a woman with a severe profile generally adorns herself with equally stern clothing, even though he himself chose to emphasize the rough character of his nose and chin by wearing outrageously luxurious garments. But Eleanor\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t match her prim attire and absurd curls. She was as mismatched as he was, albeit in a different key.</p><p>She looked acerbic. Peppery. Delectable. As if she\u2019d get bored with chess, toss the board to the side, and climb into a man\u2019s lap.</p><p>Though presumably she\u2019d be unlikely to climb into his lap, since she was pining for another man. In truth, he had given up hope of that sort of adoration. And certainly he had never wanted it from a wife.</p><p>He pushed himself away from the wall. He ought to go home and plan his trip to Sevenoaks. He was itching to be on the road, but the Bow Street Runner had sent the name of the orphanage only that morning. After the third disappointment, he\u2019d learned to wait until the presence of twins was confirmed before haring off to check their lineage.</p><p>\u201cVilliers!\u201d</p><p>He turned to find Louise, Lady Nevill, waving at him. She was standing with his former fianc\u00e9e, Roberta, now the Countess of Gryffyn. That betrothal had been a profound mistake, but, thank God, one from which he\u2019d escaped. And now that Roberta was happily married, they exchanged civil conversation on occasion.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d Roberta cried, holding out her hand. \u201cI am so happy to see you looking so well. You were still terribly thin last time we met.\u201d</p><p>Lady Nevill gave him a lazy smile, accompanied by an appreciative survey from head to foot. \u201cRoberta, darling,\u201d she drawled, \u201cthe man certainly isn\u2019t looking thin. Though I wouldn\u2019t call him precisely padded either.\u201d Her gaze lingered for just a second at his crotch.</p><p>Louise was wearing what he thought must be the only low-cut toga in existence. Her lush breasts threatened to spill free at any moment. \u201cRoberta and I are amusing ourselves by comparing men to types of food,\u201d she announced.</p><p>\u201cLouise says that Albertus Vesey resembles a stick of asparagus,\u201d Roberta said with a gurgle of laughter.</p><p>Villiers raised an eyebrow. \u201cGiven his girth, I would suggest a melon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBelieve me,\u201d Louise said, \u201cyou should be thinking about asparagus. That rather exotic white kind.\u201d Her eyes twinkled wickedly. \u201cPale, slim...overcooked. Limp.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush, Louise,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make Villiers blush. Now what kind of food would the duke be?\u201d They both looked him over. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNeither of you has sufficient knowledge to assess my vegetable,\u201d he told them.</p><p>\u201cThen you describe it for us,\u201d Louise suggested with a twinkle.</p><p>Roberta laughed and changed the subject. But it made him think just how long it had been since any woman\u2014at least an available woman\u2014had greeted him with Eleanor\u2019s profound lack of interest. In truth, it had been years since he encountered indifference.</p><p>He did not have pretentions when it came to his appearance. His face was ugly, to put it bluntly. But his title was beautiful, and the shine of his gold even more attractive, and the combination had delivered to him woman after woman.</p> <p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d Lady Nevill said, tapping him on the arm with her fan. The lazy, sweet tone of her voice put her in the interested category, though in this case it was not for his gold or his title. Louise was married, after all, although her husband was incapacitated. \u201cI have been told that you are looking for a wife.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never cease to be amazed at the triviality of conversation amongst the ton,\u201d Villiers said, by way of reply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful for the early warning; it gives me time to rehearse my condolences once you find an appropriate lady,\u201d his former fianc\u00e9e said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cWell, I would admit to being surprised,\u201d Louise put in. \u201cAfter Roberta threw you over, I thought you would never succumb to the parson\u2019s mousetrap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is a man,\u201d Roberta said to her friend. \u201cBy definition he is in need of someone to look after him.\u201d She turned back to him. \u201cI heard a rumor that you are considering no one below a duke\u2019s daughter. Should I be complimented, since I was apparently eligible last year, even given my lowly birth?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI just had a conversation with Lady Eleanor, the Duke of Montague\u2019s daughter,\u201d he admitted, ignoring her question. \u201cAnd I\u2019m traveling to Kent later this week.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Eleanor would be an admirable choice. But Lady Lisette...\u201d Louise\u2019s tone cooled. Apparently, she didn\u2019t care for Gilner\u2019s daughter.</p><p>\u201cAnd I intend to retrieve two of my six children and bring them back to be reared under my own roof.\u201d He knew he shouldn\u2019t enjoy Louise\u2019s dropped jaw quite as much as he did. But there it was: he had learned to enjoy the petty pleasures of astonishing the ton.</p><p>\u201cGood for you!\u201d Roberta said, without turning an eyelash. Since she was raising her husband\u2019s illegitimate son, he would expect no less. \u201cIt seems you are combining business with...business while in Kent. While I am all in favor of your rearing your own children, Villiers, I\u2019m not quite as sanguine about your method of courting. You are as deliberate as Damon when he surveys mares he thinks to buy. Did you choose me with equally rigorous logic?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were an impulse. And a lovely one.\u201d</p><p>She liked that. \u201cI haven\u2019t met Lady Lisette. Of course, I\u2019ve heard\u2014\u201d She broke off.</p> <p>Louise shook open her fan so it hid her mouth. \u201cOne has to imagine that the rumors regarding Lady Lisette\u2019s witlessness are exaggerated. After all, so many people in London fall under that description.\u201d</p><p>A finely nuanced statement, Villiers thought. Guaranteed to make the point that the lady\u2019s mental state had been called into question. \u201cIs that why she hasn\u2019t been presented at court?\u201d he asked with some interest. \u201cAs far as I know, she\u2019s never been presented, nor yet appeared in London at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone wishes to meet the queen,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cAnd certainly there are many who consider occasions of this nature to be a waste of time.\u201d</p><p>From what he was hearing, meeting Lisette would be a waste of his time. He wanted a wife who would wield sufficient social clout to introduce his illegitimate children to society. Choosing a woman who hadn\u2019t bothered even to introduce herself to society could hardly fit the bill, especially if she were deranged.</p><p>Roberta\u2019s husband, the Earl of Gryffyn, strolled up and gave Villiers an insouciant grin. \u201cAh, my favorite dueling partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly because you managed to trounce me,\u201d Villiers replied. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think it will ever happen again.\u201d</p><p>Gryffyn laughed and dropped a kiss on his wife\u2019s ear.</p><p>\u201cJust think, darling,\u201d Roberta said. \u201cVilliers has six illegitimate children and he\u2019s going to Kent to bring them all home to live with him. Are you quite certain about that decision, Villiers? We have only one, and even with two nannies, I have a strong belief that another child would give me hives. This morning Teddy trimmed the stable cat\u2019s whiskers. I would advise stowing your children in a French monastery and picking them up ten years hence.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI doubt it was his illicit birth that gave the lad criminal tendencies,\u201d Villiers murmured, cutting his eyes to the earl. \u201cInheritance takes so many forms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix?\u201d Gryffyn asked, looking rather more shocked than a man raising his own bastard had a right to be. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all in Kent? Why Kent?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly two children live in Kent,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you will be able to persuade their mother to give them up?\u201d Roberta asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been Teddy\u2019s mother for only something over a year, and I would take after you with a dagger if you tried to separate us.\u201d</p><p>Louise had apparently recovered from her shock, since she jumped into the conversation. \u201cMothers are such an intriguing question. Lord Gryffyn, you do realize how much passionate interest we all have in discovering the identity of your son\u2019s mother, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI fail to see why,\u201d Gryffyn said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you contemplate Villiers instead? Teddy has but one mother, whereas Villiers\u2019s children will afford six times the pleasure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, but there\u2019s a difference,\u201d Louise said. \u201cWe all know about Lady Caroline\u2019s unfortunate situation...Villiers, you are raising her child, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find this conversation most objectionable,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>Louise fluttered her fan as if he hadn\u2019t spoken. \u201cNot that all of us believe that Lady Caroline told the truth about the parentage of her child...\u201d She paused. Villiers didn\u2019t deign to answer, so Louise rattled on. \u201cAs to the parentage of the duke\u2019s other five children...\u201d She shrugged. \u201cOne has to believe that the mothers are not one\u2019s next door neighbors. Yet everyone is quite convinced, Lord Gryffyn, that your child\u2019s mother is well-born. There is nothing more fierce than an English lady with a nose for scandal and a mystery that involves her peers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTeddy shows no interest in the question, and he\u2019s the only person with the right to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven I don\u2019t know,\u201d Roberta said, giving her husband a mock scowl. \u201cDamon promised to tell me on our wedding night, and then he reneged.\u201d</p><p>The earl tightened his arm around his wife and dropped another kiss on her head. \u201cI remembered that it wasn\u2019t my secret to tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you two are supposed to be one body and soul now,\u201d Lady Nevill put in, just the faintest edge to her voice implying the impoverished nature of her own marriage.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to know her identity,\u201d Roberta said, leaning against her husband. \u201cThat way I needn\u2019t think of her as a real person. Teddy is mine now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Damon was smiling down at Roberta with such a foolishly loving look that Villiers felt nauseated.</p><p>Louise caught his eye and laughed. \u201cI gather you plan to indulge in marriage, but not for love, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarriage is for the courageous, but love is for the foolish,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI have doubts regarding my own bravery, but I have long been convinced that I have at least a modicum of intelligence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn that case you will fall in love quite soon,\u201d Roberta announced. \u201cSuch monumental arrogance must necessarily be answered by the gods.\u201d</p> <p>Villiers walked away thinking of marriage. He could imagine nothing more repellent than the idea that his wife might fall in love with him. Or worse, far worse: that he might lower himself to worship a woman the way Gryffyn apparently did his wife.</p><p>A civil, practical union was far preferable to a messy pairing involving adoration.</p><p>That was an obvious point in favor of Lady Eleanor. She was in love with someone else. There was a courteous indifference about her that was remarkably peaceful.</p><p>It could be that he\u2019d found his perfect match...as long as she decided to pay a visit to Kent, of course.</p><p>If not, he\u2019d be stuck with the lady rather indelicately referred to as witless.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p><p>Eleanor found her mother in the refreshment tent, surrounded by her friends. The moment the duchess caught sight of her eldest daughter, she rose with the air of a mother cat shaking off a litter of nursing kittens and bustled Eleanor to the corner.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cIt seems quite possible that Villiers will offer for me,\u201d Eleanor admitted. \u201cHe implied as much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am astonished,\u201d her mother cried, releasing her grip on Eleanor\u2019s arm. \u201cAstonished!\u201d She dropped into a chair in a dramatic flourish of her hands. \u201cThis will surprise you. I thought you were a fool.\u201d</p><p>The response that sprang to her mind seemed rather abrasive, so Eleanor said nothing.</p> <p>\u201cAll these years, I thought you were a fool,\u201d her mother continued. \u201cAnd yet here you are, marrying a duke, just as you always insisted you would. I suppose one is never too old to correct one\u2019s mistakes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Eleanor murmured.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake!\u201d the duchess announced, patently dumbfounded at the very idea. \u201cIt never occurred to me, not even once, that you would have a chance at Villiers. For goodness sake, child, he is among the richest men in the kingdom.\u201d</p><p>At least until he endows all those illegitimate children, Eleanor thought to herself.</p><p>\u201cHe must be very high in the instep, given his search for a woman of equal rank. Everyone has been predicting that he will have to widen his focus to include the daughters of marquesses. But I always insisted that you should be the one, even given your age. Oh Eleanor, I am so very grateful to you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what, Mother?\u201d Eleanor sat down.</p><p>\u201cFor not putting him off, of course. When I think of all the matches you could have made over the past four seasons! Here you are, past your first blush, and still dodging gentlemen. I was fearful, Eleanor. I know I kept my fears from you, as a mother should, but I was frightened for your future.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor smiled, as much from the idea that her mother kept any emotions to herself as anything else.</p> <p>\u201cI just couldn\u2019t bear the idea that I, the most beautiful woman of my year, would produce an ape leader for a daughter!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s smile withered.</p><p>\u201cThank goodness, you are the only eligible duke\u2019s daughter this season. I must write to your father and brother immediately and order them to return from Russia for the wedding. And we must order a new gown tomorrow morning. In fact, we should probably\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers plans to pay a visit to Sevenoaks,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>Her mother frowned. \u201cSevenoaks, in Kent? Why? What\u2014No!\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette.\u201d Eleanor nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut Lisette is mad. Poor girl,\u201d she added, but then returned to her main point: \u201cThe girl is mad as a March hare. Cracked. Moonstruck. And I say that not merely because I know the girl. Everyone knows it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not precisely mad,\u201d Eleanor protested. \u201cShe\u2019s merely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s mad,\u201d the duchess repeated flatly. \u201cThat will come to nothing.\u201d A frown crinkled her brow. \u201cOf course she is quite pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLovely,\u201d Eleanor supplied helpfully. \u201cHer eyes are a lovely blue, if you remember.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes narrowed even further. \u201cBy now she must be fit for Bedlam. People never get better, only worse. Look at your uncle Harry. We used to think it rather charming that he believed he was a general. But now that he\u2019s taken to thinking that he\u2019s a Russian prince, your aunt Margaret has such an uncomfortable time. He\u2019s always insisting she wear furs and trundle about in a sleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette has improved. She sends me quite cheerful letters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers plans to visit Knole House, you said?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told him that I had been planning to pay Lisette a visit.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s head snapped up. \u201cEleanor! That\u2019s the first intelligent thing I\u2019ve seen you do in years!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor involuntarily twitched but didn\u2019t reply.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave tomorrow. Well, at the latest by the following day. I wonder if Gilner himself is home, though it hardly matters. I\u2019ve lost touch with Lady Marguerite over the past few years, ever since Lisette\u2019s mama died. What an unfortunate life dear Beatrice had! Only one daughter, and the child deranged.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette has improved,\u201d Eleanor repeated.</p><p>\u201cNonsense! Pretty is as pretty does, and your Lisette is not fit to be a duchess. I trust the duke will realize that himself, but just in case, we\u2019ll be there as well.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor hated the times when the world gathered itself up and began hurtling toward a goal that she hadn\u2019t envisioned a mere five minutes before. She\u2019d had the same feeling back on Gideon\u2019s eighteenth birthday, when he paid a sudden visit, his face as white as a sheet of paper. She remembered being surprised that he had sent in his card and requested a formal visit. Gideon had never been formal...</p><p>Gideon was always formal now that he was married to another woman.</p><p>Which was fine, because she, Eleanor, was going to be married to the Duke of Villiers. Just then her mother squealed with delight. \u201cDuke!\u201d she caroled, springing to her feet with a huge smile.</p><p>Eleanor jerked her head up, expecting to see Villiers\u2014but it was Gideon. Gideon, the Duke of Astley, who never approached her if he could possibly avoid it.</p><p>A combination of kindness and genuine affection on the part of Eleanor\u2019s mother had caused her to insist that her son\u2019s closest friend, a poor motherless boy, spend his school holidays with them. Which was why Eleanor felt as if Gideon had grown up with them, scrabbling and squabbling around the estate as if he were another brother\u2014until the day they looked at each other and he wasn\u2019t. He just wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Now he walked toward them, as lean and beautiful as ever. When he was just a boy, he had been rail thin. Later, muscles started to conceal his ribs. Her memory gave her an unbidden and unwelcome recollection of how soft to the touch the first dusting of hair covering his chest had been. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It was practically a sacrilegious thought. The man was married.</p><p>\u201cWhere is your lovely wife?\u201d her mother was demanding. \u201cDo tell me that she\u2019s indisposed due to an interesting event?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid the duchess was too tired to leave her chambers tonight,\u201d Gideon replied in his calm voice. He nodded to Eleanor and bent to give her mother a kiss that made the duchess beam. It was the sort of kindness that marked his ways.</p><p>Eleanor held out her hand to be kissed. He bowed, touching his lips lightly to her glove. She considered whether he gave it a special pressure, but she couldn\u2019t delude herself.</p> <p>Since the very moment that Gideon had discovered his father\u2019s will included a marriage contract wrought between the late duke and Ada\u2019s father, he had never touched her in any sort of intimate way. Never.</p><p>\u201cWe have such exciting news for you!\u201d her mother burst out.</p><p>\u201cMother!\u201d Eleanor protested. \u201cIt isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh tush, Eleanor, the duke is part of our family.\u201d And, turning again to Gideon, \u201cOur own Eleanor is finally going to take a husband.\u201d She caught herself. \u201cNot that I mean finally as it sounds. Of course, Eleanor could have married any time in the last few years, but she\u2019d never chosen to do so. And now she has agreed to a husband.\u201d</p><p>A courteous smile shaped Gideon\u2019s lips, but Eleanor thought she saw pain in the depths of his eyes. It made her feel better.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems I owe you felicitations, Lady Eleanor,\u201d he said.</p><p>An uncertain smile wavered around her own lips. She could hardly say, I would have waited forever. \u201cI am grateful for them, Your Grace.\u201d There. That was dignified.</p><p>\u201cSurely you heard that the Duke of Villiers is looking for a wife?\u201d her mother burst out.</p><p>\u201cI had heard that rumor, but I could not believe that Lady Eleanor would consider such a spouse.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was starting to feel quite cheerful. After years of trying not to watch Gideon with longing eyes, of trying to erase him from her dreams, it was satisfying to see that flash of fire in his eyes.</p><p>Let him experience what she had endured, watching him wait at the altar to marry Ada.</p> <p>\u201cYes, the Duke of Villiers,\u201d she confirmed, giving him a lavish smile. \u201cI am persuaded the two of us will be remarkably suited. You do remember how I used to beat you at chess, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know how foolish my Eleanor has always been,\u201d her mother put in, laughing. \u201cShe announced years ago that she would marry a duke or no one. I was beginning to worry, I don\u2019t mind telling you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere was never any reason to worry,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Lady Eleanor has her pick of eligible men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wanted only a duke,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd that meant so many men were ineligible. I suppose it was a foolish restriction to set for myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLife does not always give us the choices that we might wish.\u201d</p><p>He was growing furious, and she rejoiced in every involuntary signal, in the rigid way he held his shoulders, in the firmness of his jaw.</p><p>\u201cLuckily for me,\u201d she said cheerfully, \u201ca duke came along just at the moment when I had decided to put away my childish feelings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildish,\u201d he repeated.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You know what it\u2019s like when one is very young. One believes in such foolishness...in men who will throw away the world to be at one\u2019s side. Fairy tales. I had just decided to discard all those romantic notions when, to my great surprise, a duke appeared who seems as charming as I could possibly wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does your childhood have to do with anything?\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou two were always talking in riddles, but you\u2019re far too old for that sort of thing now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFar too old,\u201d Eleanor said, with a rueful smile just for Gideon. \u201cThose riddles are nothing more than nursery rhymes, to be put away as one matures, along with childish emotions.\u201d</p><p>His jaw was clenched. \u201cI was under the impression that the Duke of Villiers suffered a grievous injury last year after losing a duel.\u201d</p><p>Gideon didn\u2019t approve of duels, which was no wonder, since he\u2019d lost his father as a result of one. When he and Eleanor were young, they had talked for hours about how unlawful and dangerous these confrontations were. And, since ascending to his seat, he had made it his life\u2019s work to convince society to see the duel as an indefensible and horrific act. She was always reading about speeches he\u2019d given on the subject.</p><p>The duel alone would make him despise Villiers. Which was just as well, she thought, because once she married that dark-eyed fallen angel, she didn\u2019t want to think about Gideon ever again.</p><p>\u201cSo is dear Ada increasing?\u201d her mother was asking. \u201cI do hope you don\u2019t mind my inquiring. I adore her, of course, but she\u2019s so fragile. I must have my cook make up a good strengthening lettuce soup for her.\u201d</p><p>Gideon started to reply, but Eleanor\u2019s mother wasn\u2019t to be stopped.</p><p>\u201cI expect that she is quite nauseated. When I had my first, I was so sick that I could barely stir out of the bedchamber for days. I drank lettuce soup morning and night. I shall send some over tomorrow. Nay, I shall send over my cook tomorrow to train your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour Grace.\u201d Gideon\u2019s quiet voice cut across her mother\u2019s rush of speech. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that Ada is not increasing. She\u2019s merely suffering a lung complaint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor knew she should feel sorry for fragile little Ada, who always seemed to be in her bed or on a settee, coughing delicately. But try though she might, she still resented her. Ada\u2019s father had paid for Gideon, had sewed him up in a marriage contract when Gideon was only eight years old.</p><p>Which meant that Ada had the one thing that Eleanor had ever wanted in the world.</p><p>\u201cPlease sit down and tell me all about it,\u201d her mother said, patting Gideon on the hand. \u201cThat poor angel. Did she take a chill?\u201d</p><p>The worst of it was that Ada didn\u2019t even care for Gideon, as far as Eleanor could tell. She had paid Ada dutiful visits over the past three years and seen the polite, uninterested manner with which Ada greeted her husband.</p><p>If she had been Gideon\u2019s wife, she would have leaped from the settee to greet him when he walked into the drawing room. In the first year or so after he married Ada, it was all Eleanor could do to keep herself frozen in a chair when he entered a room, and to stop a besotted smile from spreading across her face.</p><p>But Ada just held out her hand to be kissed and then turned away.</p><p>And Gideon...Gideon had gone from being Eleanor\u2019s closest friend, the confidant of her heart and the lover of her body, to bowing as if she were nothing more than a remote acquaintance.</p><p>\u201cThe duchess\u2019s cough has taken a turn for the worse in the last few weeks,\u201d he was saying now. He was endlessly solicitous of his sickly wife.</p><p>It was admirable. Really.</p><p>Perhaps it was just as well that they hadn\u2019t married. She could never be as punctilious as Gideon, not even if a dead father\u2019s will required it of her. She would have fought bitterly to marry him. She would have climbed a balcony in the middle of the night and lured her beloved into a clandestine elopement, and be damned with the consequences.</p><p>She would have...she would have gone anywhere with that lovely, golden boy. In fact, now that she thought on it, she came perilously close to giving up her whole life, remaining unmarried, and never having children merely because he wasn\u2019t free. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What\u2019s the good of being Juliet when Romeo shows no sign of killing himself for love, but instead prances off with Rosalind?</p><p>She felt as stupid as Oyster.</p><p>There was an audible hum of interest in the room, just as she sensed someone at her shoulder. \u201cAstley,\u201d came the drawling voice of the Duke of Villiers. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d He was bowing before her mother.</p><p>The duchess held out her hand to be kissed, doing a magnificent job of pretending that Villiers\u2019s appearance meant little, and that every pair of eyes in the tent wasn\u2019t focused on their little group. \u201cI understand that we might well see each other in the country,\u201d she said, dimpling. \u201cI\u2019m not certain that I can spare the time for such frolicking, but I always try to please my daughters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLondon is so tiresome at the tail end of the season,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd you are so much in demand, Duchess. You must long to escape the throngs of your friends and admirers.\u201d</p><p>Since her mother loved nothing more than an admiring horde, Eleanor thought he was overdoing his praise. But her mother giggled, and might even be blushing underneath the permanent blush she had painted on earlier in the day. \u201cThat is so true,\u201d she agreed, fluttering her fan madly.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re planning a trip to the country, Duke?\u201d Gideon said in his measured, formal tones.</p><p>\u201cI have some business in Kent.\u201d Eleanor held her breath. She was hoping to break the news about his motley family to her mother at some later date. Preferably after the duchess had drunk two brandies. But Villiers said nothing further.</p><p>She caught sight of Gideon\u2019s still-clenched jaw out of the corner of her eye. \u201cWe are meeting at a house party,\u201d she said, favoring the three of them with a huge smile.</p> <p>\u201cI expect you\u2019ll be busy in the House of Lords,\u201d Villiers said to Gideon. \u201cSuch a pity; the countryside is beautiful at this time of year. But there you are...we grasshoppers will frolic, and the ants must needs keep slaving.\u201d There was a trace of scorn in his voice. Just a trace.</p><p>A second stretched to twenty before Gideon said, \u201cExactly so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a pity you\u2019ve never taken up your seat, Duke,\u201d Eleanor\u2019s mother said to Villiers, showcasing her profound deafness to conversational undercurrents.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why I would,\u201d Villiers said lazily. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself in a room full of bantam roosters strutting and squawking at the dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne could describe them as caring for the business of the country,\u201d Gideon snapped.</p><p>\u201cNonsense. The business of the country is shaped by two forces: the king and the market. As it happens, I know a great deal about the market. I can assure you, Astley, that quite frequently the market trumps the king.\u201d</p> <p>Gideon\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cThe market can do nothing when it comes to serious problems. In the House of Lords we fight ethical lapses such as the slave trade.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe slave trade is entirely governed by money: those with it, and those who wish they had more. And it has long been my opinion that the only way to end it is to cut it off at the root. You can make all the proclamations you wish, but it\u2019s only by cutting profit that that damnable practice will end.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful!\u201d Eleanor\u2019s mother said brightly. \u201cI can see that you\u2019re both working toward the same goal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo to speak,\u201d Villiers said. His eyes slid to Eleanor, and suddenly she knew that he had guessed her most private secret. He knew.</p><p>\u201cI doubt we have ever had similar goals,\u201d Gideon said.</p><p>\u201cGiven that my intentions are entirely honorable, I believe you,\u201d Villiers said with a faint smile.</p><p>Gideon drew in his breath sharply. The insult flashed by like a poison dart, so sleek and so pointed that Eleanor almost missed it. Her mother just smiled.</p><p>\u201cThat must be a novel sensation for you,\u201d Gideon said, making something of a rejoinder.</p> <p>Apparently he had heard rumors of Villiers\u2019s illegitimate children. Both men were tall, but Villiers\u2019s physique was so much broader that Gideon looked willowy in comparison. Villiers didn\u2019t say a word, but all of a sudden he looked...dangerous.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s mother apparently decided the same thing, since she suddenly shrieked, \u201cGoodness me, just look at Mrs. Bardsley\u2019s absurd wig. It\u2019s tilting to the side!\u201d</p><p>Villiers paid her no attention at all. He turned from Gideon as if the duke were no more than an impudent servant, bowed before Eleanor, and smiled at her.</p><p>That smile...</p><p>It could have seduced Cleopatra out of her golden boat. It would have lured Bathsheba from her bath. It was the smile of a wicked man, a man who didn\u2019t bother much with honor, but promised to bother a lot about...other things.</p><p>\u201cI know that you prefer I spare you a storm of gossip.\u201d His voice caressed her like a touch of his hand, just loud enough to be heard by Gideon. \u201cI fully meant to stay away from you, but when I glanced across the room and saw you, I could not resist.\u201d</p><p>He took her hand. Then, without smiling at her, without saying a word, without doing anything other than meeting her eyes, he slowly peeled off her glove. It was utterly surprising\u2014and scandalous. She heard her mother make a small huff of disapproval as he drew it off.</p><p>But Villiers didn\u2019t look away from her eyes, just lifted her bare fingers to his lips as if they were entirely alone. His gesture was the antithesis of Gideon\u2019s polite greeting. Villiers\u2019s kiss was slow and deliberate, giving everyone in the tent more than enough time to enjoy the spectacle.</p><p>For Eleanor, the world tilted\u2014and changed. She suddenly saw the man before her in focus: his thick lashes, his deep bottom lip, the hard line of his chin, the thick hair tied back and defiantly unpowdered. The maleness of his shoulders. The coiled strength of his body.</p><p>A sultry warmth spread from her cheeks and flooded down her body. Yet it wasn\u2019t the kiss that did it. It was something in those black eyes that made heat rise in her cheeks...and in her body.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers was notorious for his chilly, indifferent eyes, famed for surveying the world from a height defined by his disdain and his title. What she discovered at that moment was a rather terrifying truth: when the duke\u2019s cold eyes turned voluptuous, it would be a rare woman who could resist him.</p><p>She was not one of them.</p><p>It was the first time in years that she\u2019d felt a melting sensation course through her body, the very kind that had persuaded her to throw her chastity to the wind and seduce Gideon\u2014but she knew it. She recognized it. And some treacherous part of her body welcomed it joyously.</p><p>Villiers saw; he knew. There was laughter in his eyes now, competing with a dissolute, and altogether enthusiastic, invitation to pleasure.</p><p>In one swift gesture he turned her hand over and pressed a burning kiss on her palm, a touch so fast that she didn\u2019t see it, though her hand curled instinctively, as if to protect the kiss itself.</p><p>She didn\u2019t have to see it to understand it.</p><p>It was the kiss of a man who was staking a claim.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a man or woman in the tent who could possibly have misunderstood that.</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>London residence of the Duke of Villiers</p><p>15 Piccadilly</p><p>June 15, 1784</p><p>To the boy\u2019s mind, the duke looked almost sleepy, despite the fact that he was holding a rapier with a dagger-keen edge. He padded in a slow circle, holding that blade as casually as another man might an enameled snuffbox. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But there was something about the way Villiers lazily watched his opponent...The silent boy slipped through the door, keeping his eyes fixed on his father.</p><p>Even so, he almost missed the opening foray. The duke\u2019s blade slashed forward with such quick force that the boy expected blood to splatter the floor. The ballroom rang with the clear, high notes of clashing steel.</p><p>\u201cSharpen the angle of your arm, Your Grace!\u201d Tobias had heard that kind of accent before. French, he thought. A Frenchman had hired him to hold his horse once, but afterwards he rode off without giving him a penny.</p><p>This particular Frenchman had a chiseled nose and an excitable look to his wide-set eyes. He wore no wig, and his short hair stood around his head like the needles of a pine tree. He was perspiring so heavily that Tobias could see the wet on his upper lip, even from the side of the room.</p> <p>Tobias looked back at the duke. Villiers had raised his right elbow, but even so, the Frenchman seemed to be beating him back, step by step. Tobias slid quietly down the wall onto his heels. His heart was pounding, which was stupid, because he knew it was only practice. It looked violent, but that was nothing more than pretense.</p><p>\u201cI would advise\u2014\u201d The Frenchman\u2019s voice broke off.</p><p>In one lightning quick motion, the duke slipped through his opponent\u2019s guard. His right arm was poised high in the air; his rapier just touched the Frenchman\u2019s throat.</p><p>The only sound to be heard in the ballroom was the panting of the two men.</p><p>Then the Frenchman fell back a step. \u201cYour cavazi-one is still too easily countered.\u201d He sounded peevish. He turned to the large glass on one side of the ballroom and readjusted the hang of his waistcoat.</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m covered in sweat!\u201d Villiers complained. He put his sword down, hauled his shirt over his head and threw it to the side.</p><p>Tobias\u2019s eyes widened. The duke was all taut muscle in his middle, and above his waist those muscles widened to a broad chest. He had never seen anything akin to the duke\u2019s stomach. It was covered with ridges formed of muscle.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t help a glance at his own skinny limbs. He looked better than he had a month or two ago, remarkably well, considering he\u2019d spent the last few years in a \u201chighly undesirable situation,\u201d as Ashmole the butler had described it. Tobias didn\u2019t quite see how \u201cundesirable\u201d covered wading through sewers filled with muck, fishing for silver spoons and lost teeth, but he got the idea.</p><p>The men started circling each other again. He had never seen his father without a shirt before now. In fact, he\u2019d never seen him in less than formal attire, clothed from head to foot in silk or velvet adorned with fantastical embroidery.</p><p>Just this morning the duke had paid a visit to the nursery, and the children had all sat about, staring at his coat. It was made of red velvet with a pattern of small flowers, the whole of it covered with twining vines made from gilt thread with pearls sewn here and there.</p><p>Even one of those pearls could keep a family in meat pies for weeks. Months, maybe. He was getting used to Villiers\u2019s extravagant clothing, but his little sister, the one whom the duke had fetched a fortnight ago, and his brother Colin, who had arrived a mere week before, had been struck dumb.</p> <p>Suddenly, Tobias realized that the duke was staring straight at him. He quickly came to his feet, back against the wall. The duke opened his mouth as if to say something, and then pivoted to parry a thrust from the Frenchman.</p><p>Tobias felt his heart beating in his throat again. Their swords clashed until his ears rang. Then the duke twisted his wrist sharply and his blade darted forward. His opponent\u2019s blade flew down and to the side, skidding to a halt a foot or two away.</p><p>The Frenchman broke into a string of incomprehensible curses, but the duke walked away as if nothing were being said. He plucked up a linen cloth from the bench and walked toward Tobias.</p><p>Tobias pulled his shoulders back. It was hard to imagine that someday he too might have a body like that, all gleaming muscle. Like that of a wild animal, really, he thought, remembering the body of his former employer. Grindel was flabby and soft, even though he had terrible strength in the swing of his arm. But Villiers was stronger.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, barely inclining his head. The butler, Ashmole, had instructed him to bow whenever he met the duke, but he couldn\u2019t make himself do it. Bowing was for\u2014for people who bowed. He had a strong feeling that if he started bowing to people, he might just find his head down all the time.</p><p>That was what life was like for bastards, he reckoned.</p><p>Villiers answered in that dusky voice that Tobias knew well enough was an older version of his own. \u201cThat was bloody hellish in the nursery this morning,\u201d he said, pulling the ribbon from his hair and rubbing his head all over with the linen cloth.</p><p>Tobias quelled an impulse to grin. You weren\u2019t supposed to smile around a duke. Ashmole had made that clear too.</p> <p>\u201cAre those children always so quiet?\u201d</p><p>Given that Tobias had fled the nursery an hour ago because Violet\u2019s happy, high-pitched screaming was threatening to drive him out of his mind, he could answer that. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The duke pulled his shirt over his head again. \u201cI have met a lady whom I\u2019ll probably marry. Clearly, we need a woman in the house. And since I\u2019m going in a few days to look at an orphanage in Kent, and there\u2019s another appropriate candidate living close by, I\u2019ll meet her as well. I can choose between them.\u201d His head reappeared through a billow of white linen.</p><p>\u201cA\u2014A wife?\u201d Tobias stammered.</p><p>\u201cYou and I could probably just rub along together, but I\u2019m no good with girls. They need a mother.\u201d</p><p>Tobias just stared at him.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Villiers snapped. \u201cI\u2019m no good with boys either.\u201d</p><p>He strode off before Tobias could say another word, but he paused next to the Frenchman on his way out the door. \u201cNaffi, I have a feeling my son might have a talent for the rapier. I think he would benefit from some lessons. See Ashmole about arranging it.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Tobias had learned a lot about the natural order in the months since Villiers plucked him out of a back street in Wapping and brought him to the mansion. Dukes were gods, and servants were rubbish; gentlemen were somewhere in between. Bastards were at the very bottom of the heap.</p><p>But as far as Tobias could tell, Villiers treated everyone as if they were rubbish. He had walked straight past Naffi without waiting for an answer, even though the Frenchman had lost two bouts in row. The man was quivering with annoyance, and Villiers\u2019s abrupt command could only have made things worse.</p><p>Tobias watched warily as the Frenchman walked over to him, rapier in hand. His lower lip was curled so savagely that Tobias could see the pink flesh inside. \u201cSo I\u2019m to teach the by-blow to fence,\u201d he said in a low, dangerous tone, picking up his wig and jamming it onto his sweaty hair. \u201cI, the great Naffi, lauded in three courts, am to waste my time teaching a trollop\u2019s bit of rubbish. As if you would ever have cause to defend your honor. What honor?\u201d He threw his head back, laughter erupting from his mouth like a horse\u2019s whinny. \u201cHonor! I hardly think so. Bastard begot, bastard in mind, bastard in valor, I say!\u201d</p><p>Tobias had learned that watching people silently made them uneasy: it was only after he moved into the duke\u2019s house and observed his father\u2019s chilly eyes that he realized it was a family talent. So he said nothing, just let his eyes rest on the sweaty hair sticking out from under Naffi\u2019s wig, the red patches high in his cheeks. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care even to cross my sword with a whoreson like yourself,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cTo contaminate my blade jousting with a bastard. I, who jousted with His Grace the Duke of Rutland only last week? You don\u2019t need to learn proper conduct. Blood tells, and your sort will always end in the gutter.\u201d</p><p>Tobias didn\u2019t give a fig about insults to himself, but \u201cwhoreson\u201d was different. Naffi was saying something about his mother. He never thought all that much about his mother until he met the gilded, glittering duke. Then he realized that it wasn\u2019t her fault, what had happened to him. It was the duke\u2019s fault.</p><p>\u201cIf blood is a reliable guide to conduct, it would explain your father\u2019s horns,\u201d he said, spacing the words so that Naffi would understand.</p><p>It took a moment for his insult to sink in. Then the Frenchman\u2019s voice rose. \u201cYou impudent little goat! You dare imply my maman\u2014\u201d His voice broke off as he unexpectedly shot forward, like a cork from a bottle.</p> <p>Tobias jumped to the side just in time as Naffi bashed against the wall and rebounded, his nose gushing startlingly red blood.</p><p>Ashmole, Villiers\u2019s ancient butler, grinned at Tobias. In his right hand he held a large golden staff with a huge knob, with which he had apparently jabbed Naffi in the back. The Frenchman lurched around, clutching his nose with one hand and screaming incoherently.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019ll teach you to insult the young master,\u201d Ashmole said, his voice cracking only once.</p><p>Blood was splattered down Naffi\u2019s white shirt. \u201cHow dare you lay a hand on me, you disgusting imb\u00e9cile!\u201d he shrieked.</p><p>Tobias began to laugh, when he suddenly realized that Naffi still had a rapier in his right hand, and that if the man would hesitate to assault a son of the house\u2014even a bastard\u2014he would feel no such compunction about a servant.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to touch your betters!\u201d Naffi snarled, bringing his blade up.</p><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Tobias cried.</p><p>But the Frenchman was already poking the old butler hard in the chest, prodding him with the button-covered tip of the rapier. His lips curled happily, and Tobias could see that he was enjoying Ashmole\u2019s squawking protests and the way the old man stumbled back each time he was struck.</p><p>Villiers had left his rapier on the bench, and Tobias picked it up.</p><p>Naffi swung to face him, uttering his horsey laugh. \u201cYou dare to face me with a sword? Moi, the great Naffi? The man whom even the Duke of Villiers begs to train him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat duke beat you twice this morning,\u201d Tobias observed.</p> <p>\u201cI could slash you,\u201d Naffi hissed. \u201cSuch a regrettable accident. Yes, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. A little slash to the face that will mark you as the gutter rat you really are.\u201d</p><p>Naffi had spittle around his lips, which made Tobias feel faintly nauseated. He tossed the rapier to the ground between them. The man broke into that donkeylike laughter again, throwing his head back so his chin pointed to the ceiling. \u201cSo you\u2019re not so stupid but that you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Tobias snatched the staff from Ashmole\u2019s hand and slammed its large knob under Naffi\u2019s chin. The man fell straight backward without a word.</p><p>The thump echoed in the empty ballroom. \u201cI doubt you kilt him,\u201d Ashmole said. He prodded the man with his toe. Naffi made a snorting noise but his eyes stayed shut.</p><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Tobias agreed. He picked up the duke\u2019s rapier and twisted the button off its tip. It was sharp as a needle\u2019s point.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to kill him now?\u201d Ashmole inquired. He didn\u2019t sound terribly scandalized. \u201cIt\u2019ll make a terrible mess.\u201d</p><p>Tobias put the rapier in position and brought it carefully straight down. \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d</p><p>Ashmole cursed and jumped back. \u201cYou\u2019re set to ruin the polish on my floor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d Tobias was concentrating. The rapier was heavy, and employing it as precisely as a knife took all his attention.</p><p>Ashmole peered over his shoulder. \u201cNo blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re putting a cut in his coat? What\u2019s the good of that?\u201d</p><p>Tobias looked at him incredulously. \u201cHave you been wearing the duke\u2019s getup your whole life? This fool is wearing all his money on his body.\u201d</p><p>Ashmole cackled. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d</p><p>They both looked down at the floor. Naffi\u2019s mouth hung open; he was breathing heavily through it. His brocaded waistcoat was now vented like an apple pie.</p><p>Ashmole raised an eyebrow. \u201cYer leaving him with his breeches, lad?\u201d</p><p>Tobias raised the rapier again.</p><p>\u201cCareful around them jewels of his,\u201d the butler commanded. \u201cWouldn\u2019t want to be responsible for changing him from a rooster to a hen.\u201d</p><p>Tobias cut a slice down the right leg of Naffi\u2019s pantaloons.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get one of the footmen in here to drag off the riffraff,\u201d Ashmole said with palpable satisfaction. \u201cHe won\u2019t wake up for a while, from the look of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA blow beneath the chin can put a man out for hours,\u201d Tobias said. He was wiping the duke\u2019s rapier carefully. \u201cThis blade might have been slightly dulled by slicing that brocade. Perhaps you should have it sharpened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrosty, that\u2019s what you are,\u201d Ashmole said. \u201cYou\u2019re yer father\u2019s son all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duke is leaving in a few days for Kent,\u201d Tobias said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s got to follow up on them twins,\u201d Ashmole said. \u201cNot that we need more brats around this house.\u201d He started rubbing his chest. \u201cI\u2019ll have bruises tonight, so I will, thanks to that French varmint. The duke\u2019ll never take you with him. You stay at home with the little girl. It\u2019s sweet the way she\u2019s taken to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat time of day does he usually call for his carriage?\u201d</p><p>Ashmole peered at him. \u201cThink you\u2019ll beg him to take you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never beg,\u201d Tobias stated.</p><p>\u201cFather\u2019s son,\u201d Ashmole cackled. \u201cFather\u2019s son. He\u2019s prone to leaving early, for him. He\u2019s not one to see the sun rise. Likely around ten of the clock. So you can make your case, but I wouldn\u2019t hold your breath. He\u2019s like you, if you see what I mean. Not going to take you up just out of the goodness of his heart.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>London residence of the Duke of Montague</p><p>Same day</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pack all your best gowns,\u201d the duchess announced at luncheon. \u201cAnd your riding habit. It is the country, and one must make the effort, I suppose. But not that trimmed habit you were wearing in the park last week. Trimming suddenly looks rather tawdry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlain is best,\u201d Anne agreed. \u201cLady Festle wore such a cunning riding habit the other day. It had a waistcoat of ribbed white dimity...\u201d</p><p>Eleanor wasn\u2019t listening, which didn\u2019t matter, as her mother didn\u2019t consider conversation to be an occasion for interaction. Her sister Anne had appeared that morning in a costume that Eleanor would never have dreamed of ordering: a close-fitting coat of sky-blue taffety with a low neckline. It flared into folds at her hips, with a short petticoat of white linen underneath. In short, Madam Bouchon looked like the dashing and delectable young matron she was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Whereas her own gown was a perfectly good stone-colored muslin. It was definitely serviceable. In fact, she thought it had served her for at least two or three seasons. The petticoat had a deep flounce, which was all one could say for its claim to fashion, especially since it also had the dreaded ruffled sleeves.</p><p>\u201cI do not wish to pack my best gowns,\u201d Eleanor interrupted, putting her fork down.</p><p>Anne raised an eyebrow.</p><p>Her mother just kept talking. \u201cI shall send a message to Madame Gasquet and beg her to deliver the costume we ordered a few weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI no longer want that particular gown,\u201d Eleanor said, thinking of its long sleeves and longer petticoat.</p><p>\u201cYou simply must make an effort,\u201d her mother scolded, finally looking up from the head of the table. \u201cAnne took me to task this morning for allowing you to look so pass\u00e9, and she\u2019s right. You have shown so little interest in your appearance that I had lost heart for the battle. But now you are to be a duchess. You must dress \u00e0 la mode.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI intend to,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cThe problem is that I own very few gowns that are akin to what Anne is wearing this morning. I would like to be as fashionable as she is at this moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only thing that could make my jacket more modish would be tassels on the collar,\u201d Anne said, with a complete lack of modesty. \u201cI am considering the alteration. Did Villiers effect this miraculous change in your attitude? His coat was rather magnificent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has little to do with it. Your assessment brought me to my senses.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBrought you to your senses?\u201d their mother intervened. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been comfortingly sensible, Eleanor. Unlike Lisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat Eleanor means,\u201d Anne said, \u201cis that she\u2019s agreed to stop hiding her beauty. She intends to dress like a desirable lady instead of a frump.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo daughter of mine could be a frump,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t allow it.\u201d Still, Eleanor could see that the idea was sinking into her mother\u2019s head. She picked up her lorgnette and frowned through it at her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to dress like trollopy slattern. I find some current styles unacceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Anne, who prided herself on wearing the most risqu\u00e9 fashions in all London. \u201cYou needn\u2019t worry, Mother. I\u2019ll send the footman for an armful of my gowns. Another footman must go to Madame Gasquet because I have three gowns on order, and I\u2019ll donate them to the cause. Perhaps she will even have time to adjust for Eleanor\u2019s bosom. If not, the necklines are quite low, and I doubt it will matter much.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor bit her lip. She was apparently going from modest to decadent overnight.</p><p>\u201cWhat we must consider,\u201d the duchess announced, \u201cis that your sister made a splendid match in her very first year. She turned down a marquis for Mr. Bouchon; he may not have an illustrious title\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut darling Jeremy has that lovely land in the dells,\u201d Anne pointed out. \u201cAcres and acres and acres, all filled with sheep. I am very expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is certainly true,\u201d her mother agreed. \u201cI do believe that your wardrobe this year cost double mine and Eleanor\u2019s put together. Your father complained bitterly.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had never been expensive. If her mother indicated that a new gown was in order, she got through the fitting without fuss and with only one dictate: that she didn\u2019t resemble a hussy.</p><p>\u201cYou and I are not so dissimilar,\u201d her sister said now, apparently guessing exactly what was going through Eleanor\u2019s mind.</p><p>\u201cThere I disagree,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cFrom the moment you debuted, Anne, I lived in fear that you would be compromised, whereas I\u2019ve never had a moment of worry about Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor is certainly prudent,\u201d Anne said with a little snort that her mother didn\u2019t hear.</p><p>\u201cYou must try to look more like your sister,\u201d their mother said, nodding at Eleanor. \u201cNow I think on it, Anne, you\u2019ll have to accompany us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I couldn\u2019t leave Jeremy!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you can. There\u2019s nothing better for marriage than farewells. Your father and I rarely quarrel, a fact I attribute entirely to our lengthy separations.\u201d</p><p>Since their father was prone to travel and spent most of his time in foreign climes, it was true that the opportunities for marital strife were limited.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t come with me,\u201d Eleanor said to Anne. \u201cI\u2019ll just inform Rackfort that I wish to pay more attention to my attire.\u201d There was a moment of silence as her female relatives examined her. Eleanor raised a self-conscious hand to her hair. \u201cI thought it looked quite nice, given that Rackfort was complaining of a toothache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, Mother,\u201d Anne said decisively. \u201cI shall come, and I shall bring my maid. No, I shall do even better. I\u2019ll give you Willa for the trip, Eleanor. It will be a true sacrifice and I expect I\u2019ll gain a halo just for it. Let no one say that I don\u2019t love my sister!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor rolled her eyes. \u201cCouldn\u2019t Willa just give Rackfort a lesson or two?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRackfort is worse than no maid at all,\u201d Anne stated. \u201cYou shall have Willa, and I will make do with my second maid, Marie. I\u2019ve been training her, and she\u2019s quite good with hair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suspect you want to travel with us just for the sake of gathering gossip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomeone has to make sure that you look your best,\u201d Anne said virtuously.</p><p>\u201cI can lend you one of my gowns, if need be,\u201d their mother said. \u201cLuckily, I have retained my figure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor is not going to wear your gowns,\u201d Anne stated, \u201cthough I know you meant it kindly. She already has the knack of dressing like a dowager; now she needs to learn a different style.\u201d</p><p>By nine in the morning two days later, the redoubtable Madame Gasquet had sent the gowns ordered for Anne, as well as a deep blue brocade designed for some soon-to-be disappointed lady who happened to have appropriate measurements.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s utterly perfect,\u201d Anne said with satisfaction. \u201cI happened to wander into the back room, and the moment I saw the girls stitching I knew that the color was just right for your eyes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou snatched it away from whomever had ordered the gown?\u201d Eleanor asked, eyeing her sister.</p><p>\u201cSnatched has such unpleasant connotations,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI offered Madame Gasquet three times the price. Of course, she was lavishly grateful and practically threw the gown at me. You do know how much your patronage will mean once you are the Duchess of Villiers, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause the duke is so fashionable?\u201d Eleanor asked, with a pang of misgiving.</p><p>\u201cPrecisely,\u201d Anne said with a nod.</p><p>Eleanor opened her mouth to say that she couldn\u2019t imagine herself achieving Villiers\u2019s splendor when their mother called from the entrance hall. \u201cI just need to say good-bye to Oyster,\u201d she said, looking about for him. \u201cHe was here a moment ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no, Oyster will come with us,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI\u2019ll tie a bit of white lace on his collar so that he\u2019s more fashionable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d their mother said, appearing in the doorway. \u201cOf course Eleanor is not bringing her potbellied little horror of a dog.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe must,\u201d Anne explained. \u201cShe and Villiers had a laugh about Oyster at the benefit the other night. He\u2019s a joke between them, you see. An intimacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing could make Oyster look fashionable,\u201d Eleanor said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll pin one of my ostrich feathers into his collar. Queen Charlotte herself adorned her dog with ostrich feathers. Or was it peacock feathers? This will show Villiers that you are truly \u00e0 la mode. Everyone has a pug these days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I am not \u00e0 la mode,\u201d Eleanor began. \u201cAnd more to the point, Oyster is not a pug.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPart of him is a pug,\u201d Anne said, patting the dog. \u201cWait until you see how wonderful he looks with an ostrich feather.\u201d She was wearing a wildly fashionable chip hat lined with sarcenet, with a cluster of white feathers on one side. Without pausing for breath, she plucked one of her plumes and knelt beside Oyster.</p><p>\u201cHe is a pug,\u201d her mother announced. \u201cMr. Pesnickle said so, and although he might have been more tidy in his dog\u2019s domestic arrangements, we must take him at his word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo pug has those ears,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd more to the point, Oyster will not add to the occasion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister, young though she is, is much better at understanding men,\u201d her mother ruled. \u201cYou have never shown the faintest interest in attracting a man\u2019s attention, Eleanor; now you must accept advice from a younger sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVoil\u00e0!\u201d Anne cried. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing his feather \u00e0 la conseilleur. See how it tilts sideways?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho could miss it?\u201d Eleanor asked, leaning down to give Oyster a pat. He panted enthusiastically, looking up at her with adoring eyes. She was very fond of Oyster. But he was one of those odd dogs who just missed being attractive. His body was cream, and his nose and muzzle were black, and then he was pop-eyed. The feather didn\u2019t help.</p><p>\u201cThe point is,\u201d Anne told her, \u201cOyster gives you something to talk about.\u201d</p><p>Oyster\u2019s incontinent habits certainly did generate conversation. \u201cI don\u2019t think he likes that feather, Anne.\u201d It curled over his back and brushed his tail. Not the brightest of dogs, Oyster was convinced a fly was trying to bite him and so he began twisting around to snap at his own tail.</p><p>Though he was far too fat to actually reach his tail.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fashionable,\u201d Anne said stubbornly. \u201cMother, don\u2019t let her take the feather off. Oyster will get used to it, and the queen\u2019s dog wears one precisely the same. Though I seem to remember hers does wear a peacock feather.\u201d</p><p>A pug wearing a peacock feather. That would be a conversation piece, all right.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we arrive, you must go down for a nap immediately, Eleanor,\u201d the duchess stated. \u201cI want you to look your best by the time Villiers appears. Certainly better than Lisette!\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cLisette is a friend of mine. There\u2019s no reason to use that tone.\u201d</p><p>Her mother narrowed her eyes. \u201cEleanor, you are such a fool that it\u2019s a miracle they\u2019re calling Lisette cracked instead of yourself.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor said nothing.</p><p>Her mother gave a faint shriek. \u201cI\u2019ll be blessed if I haven\u2019t forgotten to take your grandmother\u2019s silver combs! I want to arrange them on your bedside table.\u201d She trotted from the room.</p><p>\u201cDoes she think that I\u2019ll invite the duke into my bedchamber to examine my combs?\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>Anne gave her hand a squeeze. \u201cMother is accustomed to overstating her opinions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t mean to call you stupid.\u201d</p><p>But she did mean it. Eleanor had always been a puzzle to her mother, and not a pleasant one. Part of the problem was that the duchess had never known about Gideon, never known about the glorious year in which they grew closer and closer, fell in love, told each other everything, and finally, in that last delirious month before his birthday, made love.</p><p>Because her mother never knew that, she knew nothing about her.</p><p>The greater problem was that Eleanor simply didn\u2019t fit in. She said the wrong things. She was too sarcastic.</p><p>Eleanor had figured out long ago that her mother was oblivious to her feelings and didn\u2019t mean most of her insults. But the knowledge didn\u2019t help. Every time her mother called her stupid, she felt more bitter, like a knife sharpened in the cold.</p><p>Then she would say something sarcastic again, exasperating her mother with her stupidity.</p><p>\u201cMother and I saw Gideon at the Duchess of Beaumont\u2019s benefit ball,\u201d Eleanor said, needing to tell someone. \u201cHe was in the refreshment tent and he came up to speak to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas he with Ada?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is ill again.\u201d</p><p>Anne wrinkled her nose.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t! It\u2019s not her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think she likes to lie about on a sofa and court attention,\u201d Anne said with the relentless lack of sympathy that only a young healthy person could feel.</p><p>\u201cI was there once when she had a coughing attack,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cIt sounded terribly painful. She couldn\u2019t straighten up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t say that! It\u2019s not her fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that. It\u2019s not her fault,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>Eleanor blinked.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mean her illness: I mean the rest of it. It\u2019s Gideon\u2019s fault, Eleanor, and now that you\u2019re finally considering another man, I\u2019m going to say it. He shouldn\u2019t have left you like that. He should have broken that will. He never, ever should have behaved with such dishonor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDishonor!\u201d Eleanor cried. \u201cWhy, that\u2019s the opposite of what he did. He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe dishonored you,\u201d Anne said, steadily, holding her eyes. \u201cDidn\u2019t he, Eleanor?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had never been quite sure whether her sister knew the extent of that summer\u2019s folly. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dishonor,\u201d she said haltingly. \u201cWe are\u2014we were in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf a man falls in love to that tune,\u201d Anne said, \u201cthen he incurs some responsibility in the matter. Gideon is a cad, Eleanor. A louse. I\u2019ve thought so forever, but I couldn\u2019t say it because you made him into a saint, and yourself nothing more than a worshipper at his worthless shrine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a louse,\u201d Eleanor protested. \u201cHe\u2019s honorable, and good. But once he learned of that will, it all became so complicated\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a hoity-toity prig,\u201d Anne interrupted. \u201cDo you think he would have broken that will if you hadn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She paused. \u201cYou might hate me for this, Eleanor, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway. If you hadn\u2019t given your virginity to Gideon, don\u2019t you think he would have broken that will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a wretched thing to say!\u201d Eleanor snapped. \u201cWe were in love! You may not know what that is like, but\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree with our nanny,\u201d Anne said, overriding her. \u201cWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Eleanor felt rage rising in her chest and she tightened her grip on Oyster\u2019s leash so suddenly that he gave a sharp yelp. The thought that Anne might be right was heartbreaking, literally. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that if you want to marry Villiers, you shouldn\u2019t let him in your bedchamber to look at your combs\u2014or anything else. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were in love,\u201d Eleanor repeated.</p><p>\u201cHe sneaked about, and did secret things with you,\u201d Anne retorted. \u201cHow would you feel about him if you heard that he had been tupping one of the second footman\u2019s daughters? You were a young girl, not old enough to know better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just don\u2019t understand. We were both young. I was lucky to have loved like that for a time.\u201d She said it stoutly, even though she didn\u2019t really believe it.</p> <p>Anne snorted. \u201cI hope I\u2019m never so lucky.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor managed to summon up a crooked smile. \u201cI won\u2019t invite anyone into my chamber to examine my silver combs, I promise you that.\u201d It was an easy enough promise to make.</p><p>She and Villiers had an utterly different sort of relationship in mind. If she and Gideon had married, they would have been like twigs caught in a forest fire. They had made love barely ten times, and she remembered every single time. Every single moment.</p><p>\u201cStop smiling like that,\u201d Anne commanded. \u201cGideon is married, remember? Think about Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was, actually,\u201d Eleanor said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, you weren\u2019t,\u201d Anne said sourly. \u201cI\u2019ve been your sister for eighteen years. I know what that daffy look means, and it has got nothing to do with the Duke of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really think that I\u2019ve been worshipping at Gideon\u2019s shrine?\u201d Eleanor wrinkled her nose. \u201cHow wet I sound.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were unlucky. He is a debaucher who took the first chance he could to leave you in the dust and marry the oh-so-pretty Ada.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor bit her lip.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d Anne said hastily. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty too, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my own way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Ada has that heart-shaped face and seems so fragile. She\u2019s like a fairy princess. Irresistible, for a man who loves to think of himself as a knight in shining armor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe truly is fragile\u2014and sweet,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI\u2019m not, and I can\u2019t pretend that I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you\u2019re not. And Gideon knows it now,\u201d Anne said with unmistakable satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean that he\u2019s tired of Ada and her fainting and coughing and carrying on. I saw it last time Mother took me there for tea and he stayed with us for barely a moment or two. I think he probably fell in love with the idea of saving her, poor fragile little darling that she was, but now he\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go on,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cYou\u2019re making everything in my life, everything I care for, seem shabby and nasty. I know you don\u2019t mean it, but I want you to stop now.\u201d</p><p>The door bounced open again. \u201cGirls! Don\u2019t keep me waiting, if you please!\u201d Their mother stood in the doorway, ringed by three maids. \u201cHobson, gather that lace shawl, if you please. Eleanor, hand the dog to Hobson; he can travel with the maids. Oyster may be a source for conversation, but I\u2019d rather arrive without urine on my skirts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in a moment, Mother,\u201d Eleanor said. Her mother swept back into the entryway, demanding her gloves.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said to Anne. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be unkind. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you were right,\u201d her sister said, darting over to give her a hug. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem with me. I see everything in the darkest possible light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you think I\u2019d know it if Gideon had showed the slightest interest in me after marrying Ada? He has rarely spoken to me since hearing his father\u2019s will read.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you would never consider adultery, would you?\u201d Anne asked, sounding truly scandalized.</p><p>\u201cOf course not! I would never do anything so depraved.\u201d</p><p>Anne kissed her. \u201cI want you to be married, Eleanor. You\u2019ll be a wonderful mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall. That is, I already like Villiers, and that\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary for a sound marriage.\u201d</p><p>Their mother\u2019s voice shrieked from the entry. \u201cOyster has peed on the marble again, Eleanor!\u201d There was a smacking noise and a yelp. \u201cYou bad dog! Hobson, make him sit down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have to rescue poor Oyster,\u201d Eleanor said, hastily straightening her bonnet and snatching up her gloves. \u201cPoor thing. I\u2019m afraid that when Mother is excited it all gets worse, and smacking does not help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to make sure he doesn\u2019t get nervous on Lisette\u2019s carpet. Or on Villiers\u2019s boots. It might be enough to ruin your chances of being a duchess. Men are absurdly attached to the shine on their boots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think you know everything about men, don\u2019t you, little sister?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI consider myself a naturalist of the male species,\u201d Anne said loftily. \u201cI have made a study of their habits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall wear your clothing,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cBecause the truth is that I don\u2019t want to appear like a frump, and I didn\u2019t really understand that I was. But I can tell you this: a new gown won\u2019t make Villiers burst into my bedroom and assess my silver accoutrements. We plan to have a quite different kind of relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAfter I transform you, you can choose whatever sort of relationship you wish\u2014but Villiers won\u2019t have the same freedom of mind. I\u2019ll guarantee you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no naturalist,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cThen what am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA hunter. Poor Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Their mother appeared. \u201cEleanor, I\u2019ll thank you to use what intelligence you have and follow me to the carriage. At this rate, Villiers will appear before you, and Lisette will snap him up without a moment\u2019s remorse.\u201d</p><p>Anne leaned over and ripped the lace fichu straight out of Eleanor\u2019s bodice.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are you doing!\u201d Eleanor looked down. Without its lace kerchief, her neckline was shockingly low.</p><p>\u201cPreparing you for the trip,\u201d Anne said, standing back and nodding with satisfaction. \u201cI must say, it doesn\u2019t seem fair to me that you inherited those eyes and that bosom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why I must display every inch of my inheritance,\u201d Eleanor retorted.</p><p>\u201cBecause you wish to present a delicious contrast to Lisette,\u201d her sister said. \u201cUnless Lisette\u2019s shape has changed a great deal, she is less fortunate than you are. Think of it as a generous toss of corn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe corn will draw the pheasants,\u201d Anne said with a wicked grin. \u201cAnd then the hunters can take them down.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>London residence of the Duke of Villiers</p><p>15 Piccadilly</p><p>June 17, 1784</p><p>Tobias had made up his mind to go to Kent with Villiers by hook or by crook. In the beginning, he had been happy simply to eat whatever he wished. But that paled quickly, and now he was bored. The other children were babies. Colin was obsessed with learning how to read, and Violet had found an old doll that she talked to all the time.</p><p>The only dilemma was how to stow away on Villiers\u2019s coach without being caught. If he could just sneak inside, one of the seat cushions concealed a large box meant for storing blankets. He knew because he\u2019d been cold on the way from Wapping, and the duke had thrown one at him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But he would have to time his escape perfectly, before the duke\u2019s four grooms emerged from the stables.</p><p>After breakfast he strolled casually out the door. Likely, Ashmole would have seen through him, but he had taken care of that by asking Violet to create a diversion. The fire she had started on the nursery floor ought to keep Ashmole busy. She needn\u2019t have thrown Colin\u2019s book onto the blaze, however. He could still hear Colin\u2019s howls from the front doorstep.</p><p>None of the footmen knew how to treat him\u2014as a child of the house, or as a by-blow? Their dilemma just made Tobias grin: he didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass how they treated him, as long as they danced to his tune. A solitary groom standing at the horses\u2019 heads gave him a bored glance but said nothing until Tobias pulled open the door to the carriage.</p><p>\u201cHere, you!\u201d the man bellowed. Tobias stuck his head back out of the carriage and gave him a cheerful smile. \u201cJust doing an errand for Mr. Ashmole,\u201d he said. \u201cGetting a blanket he asked for.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAn errand for Mr. Ashmole?\u201d He could see the concept slowly trickling into the groom\u2019s mind. An errand put Tobias into the category of servant. And that meant he could kick Tobias into shape if he wanted to. It was obviously a comforting thought.</p><p>\u201cI like to help Mr. Ashmole whenever I can,\u201d Tobias said, ladling it on. \u201cPerhaps someday I can be a butler just like him.\u201d He tried for a soulful look, which probably made him look like a sick calf.</p><p>The groom thought this over. Tobias could almost see him relaxing: if Tobias wanted to be a butler, well then he wasn\u2019t getting above his place in life. Much.</p><p>\u201cLike to see you a butler!\u201d the groom said, guffawing as he would at any beggar who expressed the same wish.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make it someday,\u201d Tobias said, putting on the brave and cheerful face of an orphan. \u201cI don\u2019t mind hard work. That\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to help today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d best get on with it, then,\u201d the groom said, waving him on.</p><p>\u201cCould I do something for you, next?\u201d Tobias asked. \u201cHold the horses for a moment, maybe? I do love horses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could take a piss,\u201d the man said. \u201cBring that there blanket to Ashmole and come back here, smart-like.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Tobias said, pulling the blanket out of its place and trotting up the steps back to the house. \u2019Course, it wasn\u2019t a normal blanket. It was soft as a baby\u2019s backside, and trimmed in some sort of fur. Ermine or suchlike. He handed the blanket to the footman stationed in the hallway and told him that it was to be sent to the laundry.</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using the front steps like that,\u201d the groom told him a moment later, as he handed over the reins. \u201cAshmole will whup you if he sees you at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think he said something about that,\u201d Tobias said vaguely, stroking one of the horses\u2019 noses.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll be back in a minute,\u201d the man said, heading around the side of the building. \u201cMr. Seffle will be coming to drive the coach around the block again. Doesn\u2019t like the horses to get antsy.\u201d</p><p>The moment he disappeared around the side of the building, Tobias called to the footman just inside the door. When he appeared, Tobias shouted, \u201cTell Mr. Seffle I took the horses around the block.\u201d</p><p>By the time the duke\u2019s coachman, Seffle, rushed around the side of the house, Tobias was already hidden in the coach. The horses hadn\u2019t even had time to realize that they were free to trot off. From inside the blanket box, Tobias could faintly hear Seffle swearing, followed by a shouting match between Seffle and the groom and the ensuing search for himself, but after a few minutes it all settled down and Seffle jumped on the coach to drive it around the block.</p><p>Tobias wasn\u2019t overly uncomfortable. He could sit with his arms clasped around his legs. They trundled around the final corner and pulled to a halt again. He heard the duke\u2019s drawling voice. \u201cAre you saying that Ashmole asked my son to run errands for him?\u201d</p><p>Tobias couldn\u2019t help grinning. He hadn\u2019t made up his mind about his father. Villiers was like some sort of weird exotic bird with nasty eyes and a strange way of talking. He wasn\u2019t friendly. Or warm.</p><p>But Tobias still thought about the way Villiers had knocked over Grindel, the man who forced him to root around in the mud to pick up things like human teeth. Grindel had hit the ground with an enormous crash. And now there was a tone in Villiers\u2019s voice that said Ashmole was in danger of losing his job if he confused Tobias with a footman.</p><p>Villiers seemed to think he could make everyone forget that his son was a bastard. Which was idiotic, though Tobias appreciated the thought.</p><p>Finally the coach lurched to a start. Tobias planned to wait until they were on the outskirts of London before he announced his presence. But they couldn\u2019t have gone more than a block when the wooden roof over his head suddenly flew open.</p> <p>He raised his head slowly, and met his father\u2019s eyes. He had learned long ago to stay silent in awkward situations, so he said nothing.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seemed his father adhered to the same lesson, and after an uncomfortable moment Tobias couldn\u2019t take it any longer. \u201cAshmole didn\u2019t ask me to do an errand for him. How did you know I was in here?\u201d</p><p>The duke arched an eyebrow. \u201cA blanket carried into the house followed by a missing boy hardly posed much of a conundrum. And there was the fire in the nursery as well.\u201d</p><p>Tobias climbed out of the blanket box, pushing the flap back down. Surely the duke would shout to the coachman, stop the carriage, and send him back in the care of the furious groom, who would likely give him a clip on the ear, if not worse.</p><p>But his father said nothing at all, simply turning his eyes to a small book he held in his hands.</p><p>After a while Tobias asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to send me back?\u201d</p><p>The duke looked up. \u201cI assume that you have some desire to accompany me.\u201d</p><p>Tobias opened his mouth, but Villiers raised a hand. \u201cYou needn\u2019t embellish. I gather that after a few years chasing through a muddy riverbed in danger of life and limb, you find the nursery tedious. I suspect,\u201d he added, \u201cthat the addition of a six-year-old girl to that nursery has not improved matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was quite good this morning,\u201d Tobias said fairly.</p><p>\u201cAh, the fire. I do wish that you had told her that the embroidery samplers from the west wall were not for burning. Ashmole seems quite distressed by their demise. They were over one hundred years old.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably moldy, then,\u201d Tobias pointed out. \u201cI didn\u2019t specify the sort of fuss she should make. I would have told her not to burn Colin\u2019s book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe burned all the books in the nursery,\u201d Villiers remarked.</p><p>Tobias didn\u2019t believe in apologizing, as a matter of course. But somehow he found his mouth opening and something along those lines emerging.</p><p>Villiers merely shrugged. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to watch her on Guy Fawkes Night.\u201d</p><p>Tobias began to feel more comfortable. \u201cAre we really going to Kent to meet your wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not my wife yet. I\u2019ll choose whichever of the two women seems likely to be the better mother to the lot of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a mother,\u201d Tobias said.</p><p>\u201cViolet does.\u201d His father turned a page. \u201cAnd so do the twins. They are much younger than you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBoys or girls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you know that I was a boy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat was my mother like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExtremely pretty.\u201d</p><p>Tobias froze, hoping that he would continue. But Villiers turned another page.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being an ass,\u201d Tobias said, dropping the words into the silence of the carriage with great precision.</p><p>At first his father didn\u2019t move. Then he looked up again. \u201cAm I to gather you believe this is an unusual occurrence, or merely that I should be concerned by your assessment?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you marry my mother?\u201d But he knew. He knew even as he asked it.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t marry your mother because she was an opera singer, and my mistress. She was also Italian, and quite beautiful, and rather mad. She was not a lady in the strict sense of the word.\u201d</p><p>Tobias hated him, from the tip of his polished boots to the sheen of his heavy silk coat.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t care to rear you,\u201d Villiers said, putting his book down. \u201cShe was not a motherly type. But she thought you were beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnlike the other children, you were born on my estate. She was on tour through England, and when her confinement interrupted that tour, she and the rest of the troupe stayed with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn the house? With Ashmole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith Ashmole, but at one of my country estates.\u201d</p><p>Tobias couldn\u2019t imagine that. \u201cDid you ever see her again?\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked at him straight in the eyes. \u201cShe was a very famous opera singer, Tobias.\u201d</p><p>Tobias felt his blood running cold. But it was no more than he already knew, had known for years. There was no one for him in the world.</p><p>\u201cShe died in Venice of an ague. She had stayed out too late after singing a special concert for the doge.\u201d</p><p>Tobias shrugged. \u201cShe means nothing to me. Just a doxy who was too pretty to wed.\u201d</p><p>His father met his eyes until Tobias dropped his. \u201cShe thought I would keep you safe. You should be angry at me, if anyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s all right with you, I shall take a nap,\u201d Tobias said, closing his eyes.</p><p>He thought he heard his father say, \u201cToushay.\u201d What did that mean, Toushay?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>Late afternoon</p><p>June 17, 1784</p><p>The Duke of Gilner\u2019s estate lay deep in the green hills of Kent. It was a square house with aggressively symmetrical wings, the whole of it arranged with every bit of mathematical rigor that could be summoned to the task. Windows marched around the wings like soldiers on parade.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>If everything about the house celebrated the ideals of reason and rationality, the rest of the estate seemed to express the opposite. The gardens and the avenue had undoubtedly been calculated with algebraic excellence. Years ago, trees probably marched down that avenue at precisely calibrated intervals. Moreover, those trees had been chosen for their melancholy regularity, like the tall skinny mourning trees that surrounded Italian cemeteries.</p><p>But now the geometric skill of the architect was defeated by chaos. The avenue had begun with a series of oaks, now grown to stately proportions. A few had been lost to wind or were cut down. Missing oaks had been replaced with a beech here and an apple tree there. A short squat tree that looked like nothing so much as a claret bottle tipped gently to the right between two dignified trunks.</p><p>And the grounds! Worse and worse. Someone had apparently planned a hedge maze to the right of the house. Eleanor could see the vestiges of its lanes and alleys, but the hedges had withered and been cut down in places. A ramshackle cottage off to the left might have been called a folly, but only by those who were truly charitable. The untidiness of it all was exacerbated by several faded archery targets. They were stuck around the lawn with a permanent look to them; one had a rambler growing up its post.</p><p>\u201cThe estate looks even more disreputable than I remember,\u201d she said, stepping down from the carriage with the help of a groom. \u201cWhy did we stop visiting? I remember when we used to pay a visit every year. Did you and Lisette\u2019s mother quarrel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not! As if I would ever be so ill-bred as to quarrel with someone,\u201d her mother replied, magnificently ignoring the many squabbles that enlivened her days. \u201cAnd certainly not with poor Beatrice. I was one of her dearest friends; we were presented in the same year. And then when we both became duchesses, well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Anne prompted, hopping out of the carriage. \u201cGoodness me, I\u2019m happy to be out of that vehicle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette is a few years older than Eleanor,\u201d her mother said, gesturing to one of the grooms, who trotted off to bang the knocker. The household appeared not to have noticed the arrival of a coach-and-four on the drive, let alone the second coach carrying three maids and a quantity of trunks. \u201cThere was a catastrophe. Beatrice quite lost heart, and when she was carried off with pneumonia a mere year later, I knew the real cause.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat catastrophe?\u201d Eleanor asked patiently. The footman was thumping the knocker but apparently having no success.</p><p>The duchess hesitated. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for Anne to know, since she\u2019s married. Though I suppose you\u2019re a woman now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have been reconciled to that status for several years,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cHow queer you are,\u201d the duchess snapped. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll make it blunt, then. Lisette formed an unfortunate attachment to a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe never seemed very interested when we were girls,\u201d Anne observed.</p><p>\u201cThat could be due to the fact that she is unable to hold an interest in any subject for more than a day or two,\u201d Eleanor pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a man holding sway. She certainly never mentioned anything in her letters. Although to be fair, she has developed what seems to be a long-term interest in helping orphaned children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI blame Beatrice,\u201d their mother said darkly. \u201cI have done my duty by you girls. Neither of you would ever shame me by an illicit liaison.\u201d She shuddered.</p><p>\u201cWas the gentleman ineligible?\u201d Eleanor asked, thinking it best to draw her mother\u2019s attention quickly away from the putative chastity of her own daughters.</p><p>\u201cI shall never reveal that,\u201d the duchess announced, taking on the tone of a martyr facing a hostile crowd. \u201cI promised Beatrice that I would take the truth to my grave. But\u2014\u201d She relented suddenly, lowering her voice, \u201cI will tell you that the child\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cChild!\u201d Eleanor exclaimed. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say there\u2019d been a child!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said a catastrophe,\u201d her mother replied. \u201cAnd believe me, in cases such as these, the words are one and the same. We shall speak no more of it. Look at this house! Beatrice would be horrified by the muddle. But I am not one to criticize; I understand the difficulty of keeping household help.\u201d It was certainly true that the duchess\u2019s acerbic comments had a tendency to drive said household help straight out of said household.</p><p>Finally the groom\u2019s repeated bangs on the door produced a response. A butler was trotting down the main steps, bowing slightly from the waist as he came, as if he wanted to get a head start on his salutations. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d he said, swinging into a deep bow like a marionette. \u201cThis is such a pleasure, such a pleasure. I\u2019m afraid that the Duke of Gilner is not at home, but I shall send him a message.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Eleanor\u2019s mother declared with a wave of the hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t come to see Gilner, but his daughter. This is nothing more than a pleasant little visit, a matter of a few days at the most. Between friends.\u201d</p><p>Because the butler was still blinking at her rather than escorting them directly into the house, she said, \u201cLady Lisette is in residence, is she not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid that Lady Marguerite is paying a visit to a relative. She\u2019ll be back tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, then, bring us to our chambers so that we can refresh ourselves after this journey,\u201d the duchess commanded. \u201cIt may be only a few hours from London, but you would not countenance the dust. At one point I thought I was sure to suffocate.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was interested to see how distressed the butler appeared to be. He was literally wringing his hands. \u201cPerhaps there are no free chambers?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>He rushed into speech. Apparently, there were more than enough chambers, but in Lady Marguerite\u2019s absence\u2014</p><p>Her mother lost her patience immediately and waved him quiet. \u201cEleanor, did I not instruct you to write a note announcing our visit?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did, Mother. Perhaps Lady Lisette neglected to inform you?\u201d Eleanor said, giving the butler a smile.</p> <p>\u201cBe kind enough to escort us to some chambers, my good man,\u201d the duchess said before he could answer. \u201cI am not used to parrying words with a butler in the open air!\u201d</p><p>The man tore back up the stairs as if the devil were behind him. Eleanor, Anne, and their mother followed, trailing a phalanx of groomsmen carrying their trunks, the sheer number of which belied the question of a visit of a mere day or two.</p><p>The moment they entered the house the source of the butler\u2019s distress became obvious. If the estate\u2019s grounds were somewhat disorganized, the entrance hall was a jumble.</p><p>The hall was designed in a graceful circle stretching to the second floor, which was encircled by a banister. But at the moment that banister was apparently serving as an impromptu place for dirty laundry. It was hung with sheets that swayed in the breeze of the open door.</p><p>\u201cAn odd way to manage your linens,\u201d the duchess said, turning in a stately circle and craning her neck. \u201cI can\u2019t say I recommend it. And these sheets are disgracefully unclean. What is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopper, Your Grace,\u201d the butler said, looking miserable. \u201cThey\u2019re not laundry, Your Grace, but backdrops for the play.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThose appear to be trees,\u201d Eleanor said, pointing to a sheet marked with blotches that might have represented a forest in a high wind.</p><p>Her mother narrowed her eyes. \u201cMore likely a field of carrot tops.\u201d</p><p>A peal of laughter answered her, and they all looked up and saw Lisette lightly running down the stairs. For a moment they just stared up at her, and then Eleanor gave a little wave. She hadn\u2019t seen Lisette in seven or eight years, but if anything, she had grown only more exquisite. Eleanor had always envied her hair; it was pale, pale blond, and naturally formed beautiful ringlets. Her face was the peaceful oval of a medieval madonna. Most of the time.</p><p>\u201cEllie!\u201d Lisette dashed down the stairs and gave Eleanor a hug, and another hug. She turned with a similar cry to Anne.</p><p>The duchess stiffened at the first hug, and became rigid by the third. When Lisette finally dropped her arms from Anne, Eleanor said hastily, \u201cMy mother, the Duchess of Montague.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been years, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Lisette said, smiling at the duchess with sunny charm as she dropped a shallow curtsy. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t forget such a beautiful chin as you have, Your Grace. Your skin has loosened slightly, around the jowls, but really, hardly at all.\u201d</p><p>Her mother appeared stunned into silence, so Eleanor put in, \u201cSurely you remember that Lady Lisette is an enthusiastic painter, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, please, no ladies here,\u201d Lisette said. She waved her fingers in the air and they saw that they were splotched with red, blue, and purple. \u201cI have been painting backdrops for a village play. I can find you a role, if you\u2019d like.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor couldn\u2019t help smiling. That was just like Lisette. She would hop out of a seven-hour carriage ride and throw herself into painting backdrops, and it wouldn\u2019t occur to her that others might not be so eager.</p><p>\u201cI must return to the back garden,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to dining together. Popper, do put our guests somewhere, won\u2019t you?\u201d Without further ado, she turned and left.</p><p>Her mother\u2019s face contorted in such a manner that Eleanor knew precisely what she thought of Lisette\u2019s manners.</p><p>Popper wrung his hands again. \u201cIf I\u2019d known you were coming, Your Grace, I would have made sure that the house was decent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you would be so good as to allow me to retire,\u201d the duchess stated with a quiet ferocity. \u201cI have a powerful headache coming on. I expect it has something to do with the reek of paint in this house. And I\u2019ll thank you to take those sheets down, Popper. I hardly think Lady Marguerite would approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Popper said. \u201cOf course, Your Grace. Please, follow me.\u201d</p><p>A few minutes later Eleanor, Anne, and Popper tiptoed out of the duchess\u2019s bedchamber, leaving her in the tender care of two maids, who were busy fanning her forehead and mixing various restorative powders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I shall have to put you in the other wing,\u201d Popper said anxiously, as he and Eleanor walked down the corridor, having deposited Anne in a room next to their mother. \u201cWe don\u2019t often have visitors, and many of the rooms are draped in Holland cloths. I shall remove the sheets immediately, of course. The look on the Duchess of Montague\u2019s face!\u201d He shuddered. \u201cI arrived here from the household of the Marquess of Pestle. I am not ignorant of a well-ordered household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not,\u201d Eleanor said soothingly. She had a sudden thought. \u201cI do believe that the Duke of Villiers may pay Lady Lisette a visit today or tomorrow, Mr. Popper, so you might want to prepare another chamber.\u201d</p><p>He turned even paler, if that were possible. \u201cAnd her aunt\u2019s gone visiting! Perhaps I\u2019ll send a note to Lady Marguerite and beg her to return this very evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely a good idea,\u201d Eleanor agreed. \u201cWould you mind having my dog brought to my chamber, Mr. Popper?\u201d</p><p>He starting wringing his hands again. \u201cA dog? There is a dog?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cMy dog. He\u2019s a small pug, cream-colored with a black muzzle. One of our groomsmen has him, no doubt.\u201d</p><p>The butler took a step closer. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my saying so, Lady Eleanor...\u201d</p><p>Eleanor put on her mother\u2019s best quelling expression, and Mr. Popper shifted back immediately. \u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lisette is frightened by dogs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t be afraid of Oyster. He\u2019s a pug, the kind that doesn\u2019t grow very big. He\u2019ll be far more afraid of Lisette than she will be of him. Everyone loves Oyster.\u201d She waved him off toward the stairs. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was true, too. Except for the people he peed on, of course. But there hadn\u2019t been all that many.</p><p>By the time Eleanor bathed and Oyster had arrived, she was feeling better. She put on a dressing gown and scooped Oyster into her lap to sit by the fire. He was really too fat to sit comfortably in anyone\u2019s lap, but he loved it, and she loved it. So they sat together while he squirmed and wriggled, and got short bristly hairs all over her lap.</p><p>\u201cYou need to grow up and stop this indiscriminate peeing,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t much of a talker, more of a nuzzler, so he nuzzled and begged for more scratching until Eleanor decided that she ought to dress. It would be a disaster if Villiers arrived before she was downstairs to blunt her mother\u2019s ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cWhat if I wear the cherry cotton with the gauze overlay?\u201d she asked Willa. It was one of her old gowns, rather than Anne\u2019s, but she felt too tired to achieve decadence.</p><p>Willa had spent the last two hours emptying the trunks that Eleanor had brought with her for this short, casual trip to the country. \u201cThere\u2019s no cherry cotton here, my lady,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cMy mistress selected your gowns herself and she had to remove some garments in order to accommodate those she brought for you to wear.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor sighed. \u201cI have nothing to wear that wasn\u2019t handpicked by my sister?\u201d</p><p>Willa shook her head.</p><p>She might as well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb. \u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you choose something for me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe figured silk,\u201d Willa suggested. \u201cYou can wear it with small side panniers.\u201d She held it up.</p><p>\u201cIt is beautiful, but there isn\u2019t much of it,\u201d Eleanor pointed out. \u201cIf I lean over, the bodice might open almost to my waist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not comfortable, we can pin some lace at the neckline,\u201d Willa said reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019ll put lace in your hair as well. We needn\u2019t put a touch of powder in your hair; did you see Lady Lisette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette never wears powder,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cNor wigs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen we shan\u2019t either,\u201d Willa said, snapping her small white teeth together. Obviously Anne had filled her in on the matrimonial sweepstakes, so to speak.</p><p>An hour or so later Eleanor wandered down the stairs. It was some comfort to know that she truly was looking her best. Her hair would never be the spun gold color of Lisette\u2019s. But she liked the way it glowed, with a kind of brandy burnish. It was thick too, thicker than Lisette\u2019s, and would hold a curl, or fall sleek and straight, whatever she wished.</p> <p>Willa had piled it on top of her head, with gorgeous little silk twists among the curls. And even though she still felt that the gown would look better in a candlelit drawing room, it was exquisite. The lace had looked foolish, so there she was with her breasts on view, which was clearly what Anne had in mind.</p><p>She brought Oyster down with her too. He had been very good the last few hours, but he was just a puppy. He couldn\u2019t stay in the room all day. Willa had treated him like an accessory and tied little knots of silk on his collar so that he matched her dress.</p><p>The sheets had disappeared and the house was as silent and ordinary looking as any gentleman\u2019s country house, barring a complete lack of servants. She poked her head into the sitting room, and then wandered into the library. The shelves were crammed with books reaching the ceiling, though on close inspection most of them turned out to be books about music, which was disappointing.</p><p>At length, Oyster gave a little yelp, and she realized that it would be an unfortunate way to begin her visit if he were to anoint the library rug.</p><p>The library opened to the garden, so she tugged open the tall doors and walked out onto the terrace. To her surprise, the entire household was clustered on a grassy slope at the bottom of the garden, maids in white aprons and footmen in livery, all seated on what appeared to be the backdrops that had formerly hung in the entryway. There even seemed to be some children tucked in front.</p><p>At that moment the door at her back opened and a deep voice drawled, \u201cPerhaps they\u2019ve all been taken by the fairies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers!\u201d she exclaimed, turning. And there was Anne as well, smiling with gleeful pleasure.</p><p>The duke bowed and kissed her hand. Eleanor found herself sorry that she\u2019d left her gloves upstairs, if only so he could strip one off again. Then she met his eyes and colored. He was damnably good at guessing her thoughts.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there, in the gardens. Do come onto the terrace. There is a very pleasant arrangement of chairs and\u2014Oh, no, I dropped Oyster\u2019s leash!\u201d</p><p>Sure enough, a plump little figure was tearing across the lawn, yipping madly.</p><p>\u201cThe famous Oyster,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cHe can be a trifle overenthusiastic,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cHe sheds,\u201d Anne said disloyally. \u201cAnd he seems to think he\u2019s irresistible. Let\u2019s not even mention the fact that he sprinkles constantly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just a puppy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, no squabbling,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>There was a piercing shriek from the lawn, followed by another. The little group seemed to explode, children running and wheeling.</p><p>\u201cWhat the devil?\u201d Villiers said, starting forward.</p><p>Anne laughed. \u201cHe\u2019s already peed on someone, Ellie.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor began running after Villiers. As she grew closer she saw with a sinking heart that Oyster did appear to be the center of the fracas. He was dashing madly in a circle, yapping with the sort of strained excitement she associated with household accidents.</p><p>There were a great many children, at least seven or eight, milling about in blue pinafores. And still the screaming: she just couldn\u2019t see who was doing it. Oyster ran toward her, barking hysterically, his ears flopping. He was trying to tell her something...</p><p>The butler was dashing after Oyster. \u201cPopper,\u201d she called, \u201cwhat on earth\u2014\u201d</p><p>But then the screaming stopped, the knot of people separated, and Eleanor saw the heart of the matter. Lisette was nestled in Villiers\u2019s arms, one arm around his neck, head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m very much afraid that Lady Lisette was surprised by your canine,\u201d Popper said, breathing hard. \u201cAs I mentioned, she is afraid of dogs.\u201d</p><p>Long ago Eleanor had decided that what made Lisette truly beautiful was that she rarely showed emotion. There was nothing to prevent appreciation of her blue eyes, her perfectly straight nose, her pale rosebud lips.</p><p>Even now, when she was apparently terrified by Oyster, her face was expressionless: no anxiously squeezed eyes or pursed mouth, or ungraceful pant. Instead she was curled in Villiers arms, looking like a portrait come to quiet life.</p><p>Eleanor reached down and picked up her squat little dog, which at least made him stop yapping. \u201cScared?\u201d she said. \u201cShe is frightened by Oyster? He must have startled her.\u201d</p><p>Brushing past Popper, she walked over to Villiers. \u201cHello, Lisette.\u201d</p><p>Lisette didn\u2019t answer. Her eyes were now closed. \u201cSurely she didn\u2019t faint?\u201d Eleanor said to Villiers, not believing it for a moment.</p><p>He looked down at Lisette with a rather queer expression on his face. \u201cI think she\u2019s recovering from the shock. When I came up, she was utterly beside herself with terror. Of course, I swept her up and out of harm\u2019s way, but it took a moment to sink in.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOut of harm\u2019s way,\u201d Eleanor said, looking down at Oyster. He lay along her arm like a particularly warm, heavy baby, which, in fact, he was. Barring the fact that he had all four paws in the air and was panting, he could have been taken for a fat and hairy newborn.</p><p>Well, perhaps that wasn\u2019t true. Eleanor had to admit that her preference for pugs was not shared by all.</p><p>\u201cI can see you\u2019re listening, Lisette, so please open your eyes,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cI\u2019d like to introduce you to my puppy.\u201d</p><p>Lisette opened her eyes, but the moment she caught sight of Oyster, she screamed again and shuddered closer to Villiers. \u201cHe\u2019s so ugly!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not\u2014\u201d Eleanor began. But there was no getting around the fact that even a creamy white coat and a midnight black muzzle couldn\u2019t make a pug precisely beautiful. \u201cHe\u2019s not ugly,\u201d she stated firmly. \u201cHe is a fine dog.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am afraid of dogs,\u201d Lisette said, shuddering visibly. \u201cAnd that one is monstrously shaped. There is something wrong with its eyes! They look like\u2014like disgusting fish eggs!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked around at the circle of rapt children. \u201cYou\u2019re not setting a good example, Lisette. This is Oyster,\u201d she said to the children. \u201cHe\u2019s a very sweet puppy who wouldn\u2019t dream of hurting anyone. And his features are completely appropriate for the kind of dog he is.\u201d</p><p>Naturally, given Lisette\u2019s revulsion, the children were eyeing Oyster as if he had three heads.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s grotesque,\u201d Lisette said breathily.</p> <p>\u201cOur hostess is afraid of dogs,\u201d Villiers pointed out, rather unnecessarily to Eleanor\u2019s mind. \u201cPerhaps you might keep the animal in your bedchamber during your visit.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor blinked down at Oyster. He certainly wasn\u2019t beautiful. But he was no bulldog either. \u201cLisette,\u201d she said incredulously, coming a step nearer. \u201cAre you really saying that you\u2019re afraid of a dog who weighs less than a stone? He still has his milk teeth, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am,\u201d Lisette said, a gasp breaking her voice. \u201cI know I\u2019m an idiot. I\u2019m so stupid. I know it. Just please\u2014please\u2014will you take him away? Please?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eleanor said, stepping backwards again. Oyster snorted and reached up to lick her chin. She turned around and marched back to the house, feeling her ears burning red with rage.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t just the way Lisette had shuddered. Or even the way her eyes had started to bulge so that she actually resembled Oyster. It was the way that Villiers had looked down at her, as if he were protecting her from a man-eating crocodile.</p><p>Ridiculous. They were both utterly ridiculous.</p> <p>Anne was comfortably seated on a small settee, powdering her nose. \u201cLet me guess,\u201d she said as Eleanor came up the steps to the terrace, clutching Oyster. \u201cLisette turned into the trembling maiden, but luckily a big, strong duke was there to rescue her? Wait\u2014haven\u2019t we heard this story before?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor plumped down beside her and turned Oyster free to scrabble about. \u201cAre you implying that Lisette is akin to Ada?\u201d she demanded, still furious. \u201cBecause I can assure you that Ada would never behave in such an unreasonable manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth are all those children doing out there?\u201d Anne asked. \u201cDo you suppose one of them is the child to whom Mother referred so darkly? Perhaps Lisette didn\u2019t stop with one.\u201d She giggled madly. \u201cPerhaps she is a female match to Villiers!\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be foolish. They\u2019re wearing pinafores. I assume they\u2019re from the orphanage,\u201d Eleanor said, shrugging. \u201cI know that Lisette\u2014\u201d She sat upright. \u201cThe orphanage!\u201d</p><p>Anne raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cTwo of those children may be Villiers\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a naughty boy,\u201d Anne said, without showing the faintest bit of shock.</p><p>\u201cFor having two?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI already heard that he had some illicit offspring. No, rather, for stowing them in an orphanage. That\u2019s not acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe lost them,\u201d Eleanor said, finding it very queer to defend the duke, even as she did so. \u201cHe had a crooked solicitor, and the man ran off with his funds. It turned out he\u2019d been defrauding the children of their support.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the duke\u2019s offspring were plunked in an orphanage. It sounds like a bad play.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor narrowed her eyes. Across the lawn, Villiers had placed Lisette back on her feet, but she was still clinging to him. \u201cMaybe he has decided to marry her so he can defend her from wild animal attacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could do much worse. After all, she\u2019s already met his children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot all of them,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cApparently he has six.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrust Villiers to double the common allotment of iniquity,\u201d Anne said placidly. \u201cThe poor man must be desperate to prove his virility. I wonder why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it was just carelessness,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cOh, look. Popper has lined up all the orphans and is marching them off somewhere. If I\u2019d known Lisette had turned her estate into an orphanage, I wouldn\u2019t have come, even for you, darling. I am not fond of children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think they live in the village, not on the grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you see how she is leaning on Villiers as she gracefully limps back to the house?\u201d Anne inquired. \u201cWe could all take lessons there, I think.\u201d She gave Eleanor a meaningful look.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps she hurt her toe running away from nasty Oyster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would explain why I can tell from here that the supposedly chilly Duke of Villiers is tying his heart in knots over the defenseless girl he just rescued from certain death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he really?\u201d Eleanor refused to look. \u201cToo bad. He seemed halfway sensible. If you think that I might transform into a trembling maiden to catch a husband, Anne, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, you\u2019d have trouble with the maiden part,\u201d her sister said, chortling.</p><p>Eleanor threw her a quick frown as Villiers and Lisette neared the terrace. She looked around for Oyster, and realized to her relief that he\u2019d collapsed into his favorite position and was engaged in his favorite activity: sleeping. Thankfully, well-hidden under the sofa.</p><p>Lisette perched on the arm of the sofa and bent to give Eleanor a little kiss. Her slipper was a hairbreadth away from Oyster\u2019s chubby paw.</p><p>\u201cThat was such a turmoil that I never got to say how wonderfully happy I am that the two of you are paying me a visit,\u201d she exclaimed, as if the whole event had never happened. Eleanor suddenly remembered how hard it was to stay angry at Lisette. Since she forgot her own emotions so quickly, it felt churlish to say a cross word to her. And that, of course, was how she got away with such outrageous behavior.</p><p>\u201cI should have visited you before this,\u201d Eleanor said, feeling a mild pang of guilt. \u201cI can\u2019t believe so many years have passed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopper tells me that we must all prepare for dinner. But I just wanted to say...\u201d Her voice trailed off and she twisted her hands together.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI know some people loathe dogs. If I\u2019d known, I wouldn\u2019t have brought him with me, Lisette.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I was attacked by a dog once,\u201d she said in a rush. \u201cI was just telling Leopold all about it.\u201d</p><p>Leopold? She was already calling the duke by his first name?</p><p>\u201cI was younger than I am now, and even less brave,\u201d she said with a charming catch to her voice. \u201cI was knocked over, you see, and\u2014\u201d She thrust out her arm.</p><p>Eleanor saw to her horror that the skin was puckered by fang-shaped scars. \u201cOh, Lisette, that\u2019s awful!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think the fear is worse than the actual bite,\u201d Lisette said, sounding almost practical.</p><p>Anne murmured something that sounded like encouragement.</p><p>\u201cBecause fear doesn\u2019t go away, and bites do,\u201d Lisette added.</p><p>At that moment Oyster made a woofing sound in his sleep and moved his bristly little paw closer to Lisette\u2019s slipper. Eleanor hastily coughed.</p><p>\u201cI must take a bath,\u201d Lisette said, rising with all her usual grace. \u201cIt was such an exciting afternoon\u2014oh, not because of your dog, Eleanor. We were discussing the play the children were to put on, and then I had the sudden realization that what we really ought to do is a treasure hunt, rather than a play. It\u2019s so much more interesting for the children, and they\u2019re the ones who matter, after all. I simply insisted that the whole household hear my new idea, though Popper did protest. After all, you had your maids if you needed something.\u201d She gave a charming shrug.</p> <p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Eleanor said, not getting up. If she rose, Oyster would realize his nap was over and likely offer up his squeaky bark to remind her of his presence.</p><p>\u201cI do believe I\u2019ll just sit here and enjoy the last bit of sunlight,\u201d Anne said. \u201cEleanor, stay with me.\u201d</p><p>Lisette danced off with a wave of her hand.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cwhat did you think of the children?\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cChildren?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmall creatures, wearing blue pinafores,\u201d Anne prompted helpfully. \u201cI didn\u2019t stir from the portico because of them. At least Oyster has the good manners to occasionally silence himself. Children never do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cChildren,\u201d Villiers repeated. \u201cYou mean the village children?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe orphan children,\u201d Eleanor prompted.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cThose were orphans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gather your attention was elsewhere,\u201d she said sweetly. \u201cI can certainly understand that. Poor Lisette was so afraid of the big bad wolf named Oyster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now,\u201d Anne said. \u201cI don\u2019t see you with a disfiguring scar on your arm, Eleanor, so don\u2019t mock it until you have it. Have you never been afraid of anything?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor didn\u2019t need to think hard about that. She was afraid of important things, like people being ripped away from her without warning. Never of spiders or puppy dogs or thunderstorms. \u201cOf course I\u2019m not mocking Lisette. I was merely sympathizing with the duke. Lisette\u2019s alarm engaged him so deeply that he didn\u2019t notice he was surrounded by orphans, two of whom might well have been his own children.\u201d</p><p>Villiers was likely trying to frighten her with that scowl. She smiled right back at him.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know they were orphans?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>\u201cWhat else did you think they were?\u201d</p><p>Anne interjected. \u201cI suggested that Lisette had started a family, but that was too scandalous even for Eleanor to consider. I don\u2019t know if you realize this about my sister, Villiers, but she\u2019s very hard to shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have learned that already,\u201d Villiers said. He had a white line around his mouth that almost made Eleanor feel sorry for him. But not quite.</p><p>\u201cDo you have any idea of the age of the children you\u2019re looking for?\u201d she asked, needling him and enjoying it.</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. If you\u2019ll excuse me...\u201d And he left without another word. And without a parting bow either.</p><p>\u201cDear me, Eleanor. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve made your future spouse very happy,\u201d Anne said meditatively. \u201cRemember how I suggested you might try to be a wee bit more conciliatory toward the male sex?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may be my future spouse, and he may not,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cMy chest is quite chilly at the moment, I might add. You\u2019ll have to be satisfied with my sartorial transformation and leave my personality alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like you to marry him. He\u2019s terribly rich. And I do like those shoulders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not a good enough reason to marry someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, what would you say is a better reason? Not, I hope, the sort of frantic passion you and dear Gideon shared. Besides, you know perfectly well that his choirboy looks played a part in that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne doesn\u2019t marry a man for his shoulders,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cBrains ought to rank high on the list, and anyone who looks at Lisette with such a look in his eye is stupider than Oyster. I have standards.\u201d</p><p>Oyster grunted at the sound of his name and inched out from under the chair so he could put his chin on Eleanor\u2019s slipper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Villiers,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>\u201cMore importantly, I shan\u2019t underestimate Lisette!\u201d Eleanor retorted. \u201cShe\u2019s perfected her trembling maiden act since I saw her last.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not an act,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so successful. Goodness me, Eleanor, you sound as if you care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure whether Lisette should marry him either. After all, he does have a thoroughly disreputable number of children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot just children\u2014bastards,\u201d Anne said with her usual bluntness. \u201cWait until Mother hears that little detail. Lisette may have a brain as empty as a washhouse on Sundays, but I agree with you. She doesn\u2019t deserve the kind of scandal broth that will follow those children. She has her own to cope with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know Lisette. She changes her mind every five minutes. She may be smiling at him now, but wait until tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an interesting visit this shall be,\u201d Anne said, coming to her feet. \u201cWake up that dog, Eleanor. Did you know there\u2019s a puddle under our settee?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor shrugged. \u201cI should have taken him for a walk on the lawn, but I was so rattled by all the screaming that I forgot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBastard children or not,\u201d Anne announced, \u201cVilliers really does have beautiful shoulders. I married Jeremy in large part because he has such a beautiful nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNose?\u201d Eleanor had never noticed her brother\u2019s-in-law nose one way or the other.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful other things too,\u201d her sister said impudently.</p><p>Eleanor sighed.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Villiers walked up the stairs to his chambers, exasperation pulsing through his body. He couldn\u2019t believe that he was considering marriage to Eleanor. She had actually laughed at him for not realizing that those children were orphans. Laughed at him about something as sensitive as his children.</p><p>A moment after she taunted him, he had realized that none of the orphans could possibly be his. The twins were only five years old, and every child he\u2019d seen was at least seven. But did he really know the difference between the sizes of five-year-olds and seven-year-olds?</p><p>Something in his gut twisted. It was absurd, humiliating and absurd. He hadn\u2019t given a damn about the existence of his children for the whole of his thirty-five years. And now, all of a sudden, he was consumed by them? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>It made him feel as if he should just cut off his own head and be done with it.</p><p>Tobias was curled in a chair in his chambers. \u201cThe nursery is useless,\u201d the boy said, staring at him unblinkingly. \u201cThere\u2019s an old nanny up there who used to care for Lady Lisette. She tried to feed me gruel, so I left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you tell her where you were going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Tobias said with a patent lack of interest.</p> <p>Really, Villiers thought, wasn\u2019t that precisely what he himself would do? He never informed servants or anyone else about where he was going or why.</p><p>Though he\u2019d always taken that as the prerogative of being a duke. Tobias was no duke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a book about this Cosmo Gordon, see? He killed someone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn a duel. I know. He killed Frederick Thomas in Hyde Park last year. How did you learn to read?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMrs. Jobber taught us. I can write too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI meant to get you a tutor but I forgot,\u201d Villiers said, frustration licking at him again. So far fatherhood felt like an exercise in failure. \u201cWhere\u2019s my valet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopper is so cross about Lady Eleanor\u2019s dog that Finchley went off to try to calm him down.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRidiculous. That animal is so small that it can hardly be called a dog. It\u2019s more like a stuffed cat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish I\u2019d seen it frighten Lady Lisette,\u201d Tobias said wistfully. \u201cLook at this.\u201d He held up a small bronze horse with a tail that whisked in the air.</p><p>Villiers hauled on the bell cord, wishing that Finchley would drop the errands of mercy and stay where he was supposed to be. \u201cWhere\u2019d you get it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was sitting around in the nursery,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had any children there in a long time. Everyone knows that Lisette won\u2019t have any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe is Lady Lisette to you,\u201d Villiers pointed out. \u201cWhy won\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe loves babies. But her father says she needn\u2019t marry until he dies. You aren\u2019t thinking of marrying her, are you? Is she the one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Villiers said decisively, putting Eleanor out of his mind. \u201cShe is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s potty,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cCracked. They all say so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho says so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer old nanny. The maid said the same. And Popper said that once she starts that screaming, there isn\u2019t anyone who can stop her. Except you, I guess. He said you picked her up and she settled down just like a baby with a bottle of gin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBabies don\u2019t drink gin,\u201d Villiers said, pretty sure that he was right about that.</p> <p>Tobias shrugged. He obviously had about as much interest in baby care as Villiers did.</p><p>Lisette had been surrounded by children from the orphanage. She clearly adored children, and even more importantly, his children\u2019s illegitimacy wouldn\u2019t disturb her. It was unlikely that any of those orphans had parents whose domestic arrangements could be termed regular.</p><p>By now Finchley had reappeared. \u201cWould you like the young master to return to the nursery now?\u201d he asked as he pulled off Villiers\u2019s boots.</p><p>Villiers glanced over at Tobias. The boy was listening, of course, though he was pretending to read. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look as if he\u2019ll be shocked by the sight of my pump handle.\u201d</p><p>Tobias\u2019s face didn\u2019t even twitch. Passed on my poker face, Villiers thought with some satisfaction. And without further ado he dropped his breeches and stepped into the bath.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you ought to marry someone who\u2019s cracked,\u201d Tobias offered a few minutes later.</p><p>\u201cLisette is not mad,\u201d Villiers said impatiently. \u201cShe was just afraid of that ugly little pug belonging to Lady Eleanor. She was terrorized by a dog as a young child.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maid told me all about it,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so long ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat explains it, then,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThe fear is still fresh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe maid said that Lisette insisted on jerking a puppy away from its mother, and the puppy was nursing. So the mother dog bit her. Then her maid\u2014not the one who was telling me, but another one\u2014tried to drag Lisette away, and she got bitten as well. And she\u2014the maid\u2014lost her finger. Or maybe two fingers. The nanny said that her hand is just disgusting looking now,\u201d Tobias said with relish. \u201cShe has to work in the kitchens because it turns Lisette\u2019s stomach just to look at her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome back in ten minutes,\u201d Villiers told Finchley. Normally he never spared a thought for conversation in front of his servants. In fact, he\u2019d once boasted that his servants were so well trained that he could tup a woman on the dining room table and they wouldn\u2019t turn a hair.</p><p>But chatter about the future duchess was another matter.</p><p>The moment Finchley closed the door, he said, \u201cGet over here, you turnip, so I can see you while we talk.\u201d</p><p>Tobias came around. \u201cI\u2019m not a turnip,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Juby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJuby, juicy, that sounds like a garden vegetable. Your name is Tobias.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been Juby since I can remember. It\u2019s too late to change over now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s never too late for anything,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cMore to the point, I think I\u2019m going to marry Lisette, so you need to stop telling stories about her, particularly ones that are obviously untrue.\u201d He raised a hand as Tobias opened his mouth. \u201cAnd if it wasn\u2019t untrue, it was definitely unkind. I\u2019m sure that Lisette had no idea that the mother dog might attack her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEven the most buffle-headed fool knows that,\u201d Tobias said scornfully.</p><p>\u201cWelcome to the world of well-bred ladies,\u201d Villiers said, sinking a little farther down in the bath. \u201cWhat they know and don\u2019t know will never cease to amaze you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like ladies,\u201d Tobias said.</p><p>\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Villiers agreed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you have to marry one, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of being a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m not a duke.\u201d Villiers was queerly glad to see that Tobias\u2019s eyes looked clear as he said that. \u201cI\u2019ll never get married, not if it means you have to marry a cracked lady who doesn\u2019t know beans about anything,\u201d Tobias continued.</p><p>\u201cLisette is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Tobias curled his lip. Villiers was startled: over the years he\u2019d caught sight of that precise gesture on his own face a time or two.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like beautiful ladies?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should marry the one with the dog,\u201d Tobias said firmly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause she\u2019s got a dog. And she\u2019s not too pretty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she is beautiful, in her own way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Lisette looks like one of those missionary ladies. All clean and gold-spun. You\u2019d never know where you are with her because nobody is really like that. Not inside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t?\u201d Villiers was suffering from a terrible fascination. Even though his water was cooling and he knew he should cut off the flow of unsolicited advice, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to. \u201cWhy not?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLikely no better than she should be,\u201d Tobias concluded. \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of sitting in all that dirty water?\u201d</p><p>The truth was that he was used to Finchley handing him a towel. He stood up and plucked it off the back of a chair. \u201cIt\u2019s not dirty water. It\u2019s clean bathwater.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnce you\u2019re in it, it\u2019s dirty. Better get in and out quick.\u201d He said it with the tone of a boy who had never bathed more than once a month before coming to Villiers\u2019s house and had taken to the practice only reluctantly.</p><p>Finchley slipped back through the door with the wounded look of someone barred from the family home on Christmas morning. \u201cIt is time to dress, Your Grace. The pale rose or the black velvet?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe rose,\u201d Villiers said at the same moment Tobias said, \u201cThe black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy the black?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>\u201cBecause you look a proper fright in those fancy coats,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cEven if you decided on Lisette\u2014and I\u2019m not saying you should\u2014she\u2019d never take you looking like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA posy. You look like a blooming posy. Like you don\u2019t care for your bag.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour potato-finger. Your holy thistle!\u201d</p><p>Villiers was aware that Finchley had stopped feeling insulted and was trying to suppress a smile. Finchley never smiled. \u201cIf I understand you, you\u2019re saying that my pizzle doesn\u2019t show to best advantage in the rose coat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if you\u2019re talking about that pink one, no.\u201d Tobias pointed at the offending garment. \u201cOnly a man who had a withered pear would wear that.\u201d</p><p>Finchley snorted, and Villiers cast him a glance. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing withered about me,\u201d he said, pulling on the rose-colored coat over his sleek, skintight breeches.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the one you need to convince of that,\u201d Tobias said, plopping down into his chair again. \u201cIt\u2019s your wife who\u2019s going to wonder if you\u2019re a molly or not.\u201d He turned back to his book.</p> <p>Villiers felt his lips twitch. No one had ever called him a molly. Or implied he had a limp potato-finger.</p><p>Finchley looked at him sympathetically and, quite wisely, kept his mouth shut.</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>\u201cYou look exquisite,\u201d Anne said, popping into Eleanor\u2019s bedchamber. \u201cThe color suits you better than it does me. The woven silk is beautiful. And the lace accents...\u201d She kissed her fingers. \u201cExquisite!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked down at her skirts. The fabric was rose-red silk, with trails of white flowers woven throughout. The bodice and sleeves were edged with a splash of rose lace sewn with tiny spangles. \u201cThe bodice doesn\u2019t fit properly.\u201d She gave it an irritable pull.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch it,\u201d Anne gasped. \u201cYou\u2019ll tear the lace. Look, there are gold threads among the silk. Father swore I bankrupted him with that one gown alone. You shouldn\u2019t do more than breathe on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy breasts are almost entirely exposed. Maybe you haven\u2019t noticed, but the only thing between the open air and my nipple is a mere inch of lace!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did notice,\u201d Anne said happily, \u201cand more to the point, so will every man in the room.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking about Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe ordered you to wear my clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but what looks merely saucy on you looks utterly debauched on me,\u201d Eleanor pointed out.</p><p>\u201cAre you implying that\u2019s a disadvantage? Believe me, you should thank God for every inch you have. Where\u2019s the dog?\u201d Anne said, cautiously dusting off a chair before she sat in it.</p><p>\u201cWilla took him to the kitchen for the evening. She\u2019ll bring him up the back stairs later.\u201d</p><p>Anne wrinkled her nose. \u201cHe sleeps with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Eleanor was unapologetic about that. \u201cHe\u2019s a puppy. He\u2019s lonely at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you planning to wear some lip color? You look like the ghost of Lady Macbeth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never wear face paint,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are so lucky that I\u2019m your sister,\u201d Anne said. She placed her net bag on the dressing table.</p><p>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cKohl black, for your eyes,\u201d Anne said. \u201cHold still or I\u2019ll blind you.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor froze.</p><p>\u201cYou can open your eyes now.\u201d She stepped back. \u201cYou have lovely eyelashes, Eleanor. Who knew?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re the color of my hair,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cNondescript.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow some rouge, and then a little lip color. And I\u2019m going to put just a touch of black at the outside corner of your eyes. Your eyes are already large, but this will make them mysterious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMysterious?\u201d Eleanor snorted. \u201cNo one with my name could possibly be mysterious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEvery woman is mysterious to men,\u201d Anne said, dabbing more color on Eleanor\u2019s lips. \u201cVilliers is the kind of man who takes appearances very seriously. You do him dishonor by just throwing yourself together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t throw myself together,\u201d Eleanor said indignantly. \u201cI give the process a reasonable amount of time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you never try to make yourself attractive to a man,\u201d Anne said.</p><p>Eleanor was silent.</p><p>\u201cI was shaken by the bastard children, I don\u2019t mind admitting. But now I\u2019ve decided that Villiers is definitely the one for you. You don\u2019t mind a dog in your bed, so I assume a bastard or two in the wings of your household will be equally acceptable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChildren are not dogs,\u201d Eleanor pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOf course not. They\u2019re a good deal easier to take care of. One never sees children when they\u2019re at the stage of peeing on the floor, for instance. Whereas everyone seems to think that dogs can\u2019t be hidden in a nursery and trained by servants, the way offspring are.\u201d She started tweaking Eleanor\u2019s curls.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking you look more rumpled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRumpled? I don\u2019t want to look rumpled!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you do. If Lisette\u2019s appeal is that of the fragile young maiden, yours is going to be pure sensuality. And the lovely thing about that, Eleanor, is that you actually have an appetite for the bed. Many women don\u2019t, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll this advice assumes that I want to be a duchess,\u201d Eleanor noted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m assuming that you\u2019d like the choice,\u201d Anne retorted. \u201cThere! Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor started to turn toward the glass but her sister grabbed her shoulder. \u201cNo, don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat have you done to me?\u201d Eleanor asked with a wave of misgiving.</p><p>\u201cYou are absolutely beautiful,\u201d Anne said. \u201cBut if you see yourself, you\u2019ll want to pin your hair back like a shepherdess in a bad play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you saying that I normally look as if I\u2019m tending sheep? With straw in my hair? As if I might yodel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spend a lot of time looking like a virgin,\u201d Anne said. \u201cAnd may I point out that you haven\u2019t had claim to that title since you were, what...fifteen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSixteen. And in fact I stopped dressing like a debutante long ago. You\u2019re being unfair. I don\u2019t believe I even own a white gown.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAnd yet you cling to clean-scrubbed modesty, as if you were going to fall in love with the evil landlord and end up throwing yourself off a cliff.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor thought about the implications of Anne\u2019s description. \u201cI have not been wandering around in a melancholy daze,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if Gideon stole all the life out of you, those years ago.\u201d Anne reached in her net bag and brought out a thin silver box, flicked it open and displayed a row of cigarillos.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think that tobacco is good for you,\u201d Eleanor observed.</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me, but for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. You\u2019re going to offset Lisette\u2019s pallid brand of perfect Englishwoman by appearing absolutely wicked. Lusciously licentious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWicked? Me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only way to stay young is to try new things,\u201d Anne said. \u201cGod knows virtue never shaved off anyone\u2019s years. On second thought, I\u2019ll wait to give you a cigarillo until after supper. But then you, Lady Eleanor, are going to have a glass of wine and smoke tobacco. I shall tutor you myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPah!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to smoke it. I\u2019ve found that merely holding a cigarillo catapults one from tedious virgin to something far more interesting. Here\u2019s my point, Eleanor. Gideon the Godless stole more than your virginity when he turned his back and married Ada instead. Now could we please go downstairs? I need something to drink, and so do you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMother believes drinking spirits before meals causes mental instability,\u201d Eleanor said, following her.</p><p>\u201cRatafia promotes mental instability: that\u2019s why there are so many silly women in the ton. Rum is what you need,\u201d Anne said. She breezed into the drawing room, paused for a moment on the threshold so as to draw all eyes, and then moved to the side, pulling Eleanor forward.</p><p>Lisette beamed at them, of course. Lisette was always happy to see her friends. Their mother opened her mouth and snapped it shut, for all the world like a beached fish. Villiers said nothing, nor did his face change.</p><p>Anne tucked her arm through Eleanor\u2019s. \u201cGood evening, everyone.\u201d She turned to Popper, who was proffering a silver tray. \u201cIs that ratafia, Popper? And orgeat? Absolutely not. We know exactly what we\u2019d like. Rum punch, if you please.\u201d</p> <p>Lisette came to her feet as if she had just remembered she was their hostess. She was wearing a charming gown of cream silk, embroidered with tiny forget-me-nots. Her bosom was chastely covered, and her panniers equally modest. Eleanor felt like the Whore of Babylon by comparison, dressed in crimson and painted to match.</p><p>Her mother appeared at her side. \u201cWhy?\u201d the duchess whispered, horror in her voice. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am wearing Anne\u2019s gown, precisely as you bade me,\u201d Eleanor said to her, sacrificing her sister without guilt. \u201cYou instructed me to listen to her advice as regards men, Mother. You said that I must learn from her experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014But\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t Eleanor look absolutely ravishing?\u201d Anne put in.</p><p>\u201cShe does!\u201d Lisette crowed, joining them. Lisette had never expressed a stick of jealousy, as far as Eleanor knew. \u201cI wish that we had more visitors to admire you.\u201d The smile fell from her face. \u201cWe never seem to have visitors anymore. My aunt, Lady Marguerite, tends to discourage our neighbors from joining us for dinner. Oh, I know!\u201d She waved madly at Popper.</p><p>He was mixing rum punch at the sideboard.</p><p>\u201cPopper! Popper!\u201d</p> <p>The butler turned around. \u201cYes, my lady?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend a footman to Squire Thestle immediately, if you please. Do beg him the courtesy of joining us for supper, he and his lovely wife. And Roland, if he\u2019s at home.\u201d She turned back to Eleanor, smiling. \u201cSir Roland would be perfect for you, dearest. He has a Roman nose. Yes, and a Grecian chin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you could turn him to currency and trade him on the Exchange,\u201d Anne remarked. \u201cVilliers, how kind of you to finally decide to greet us. You appeared frozen in your place, as if you had turned into a Roman statue yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was struck dumb by your beauty,\u201d Villiers said, bowing.</p><p>Eleanor just stopped herself from rolling her eyes.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Popper was saying in some distress. \u201cI am not sure...in Lady Marguerite\u2019s absence\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor goodness sake,\u201d the duchess burst out. \u201cYou\u2019ll forgive me, dear Lisette, if I observe that a strong hand is needed in training this household.\u201d She rounded on Popper without pausing for breath. \u201cI do hope that you are not questioning Lady Lisette\u2019s direct order? We will, naturally, wait for supper until the squire and his family arrive. I am not hungry, although I trust your cook can bring us something to nibble on.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was hungry, but she took a sip of her rum punch instead. It was surprisingly good, rather sweet and fruity. She had always thought men drank fiery drinks, meant to straighten the backbone.</p><p>Popper had a noticeably wild-eyed look, but he trotted into the hallway. \u201cThat looks very good,\u201d Lisette said, noticing Eleanor\u2019s glass. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRum punch,\u201d Anne said. \u201cIt\u2019s utterly delicious, which is why gentlemen tend to gulp it all themselves. Here, darling, you may have mine. I haven\u2019t even touched it. Villiers, you know none of us can match you at chess, and besides, it\u2019s such a deadly boring game that we would fall over with fatigue if you started a match with one of us. Do you know any other games, perhaps something all of us might play?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Villiers said. He wasn\u2019t the sort of man who could be easily flirted with, Eleanor noted.</p><p>Anne didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201cI expect we have at least an hour before the squire arrives,\u201d she observed. \u201cWe could have an interval of improving conversation.\u201d Her tone made it clear that she\u2019d rather jump into a lake.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what we should do to amuse ourselves,\u201d Lisette said.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you propose?\u201d Villiers asked, bending solicitously toward her.</p><p>Eleanor drank some more of her rum punch.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll play knucklebones!\u201d Lisette said, smiling at him.</p><p>There was a moment\u2019s silence. \u201cKnucklebones?\u201d the duchess asked. Her tone was not friendly, but Lisette was oblivious.</p><p>\u201cYou might know it better as dibs,\u201d she said happily. \u201cIt\u2019s no end of fun.\u201d She waved at a footman and a moment later was holding a pile of knobby bones and a small wooden ball.</p><p>Eleanor peered at the bones with some interest. It went without saying that her mother had never allowed a game so unsanitary and altogether common in the ducal nursery.</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d Lisette said, \u201cwe must make ourselves comfortable. Of course we need to be able to toss the bones properly, and that means a wood floor. Perhaps I should have that big rug taken up.\u201d She looked over at the remaining footman as if about to order him to get to work on the spot.</p><p>\u201cNot tonight,\u201d Anne said. She looked distinctly amused. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of bare floor; we are standing on some at this moment. But where do we sit, Lisette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn the floor, of course,\u201d Lisette said.</p><p>\u201cOn the floor,\u201d Anne repeated. \u201cOf course.\u201d Without hesitation, she gracefully sank to the ground, and beamed up at them from the wide circle of her skirts. \u201cDo join me.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The duchess cleared her throat with a sound of utter disbelief.</p><p>Eleanor didn\u2019t want to sit on the floor. Her side panniers were likely to spring into the air and throw her skirts over her head. On the other hand, she didn\u2019t want to align herself with her mother, especially given that Villiers was apparently finding the whole idea charming.</p><p>At least, that was what she gleaned from the laughter in his eyes. Naturally, he said nothing. Lisette, meanwhile, had dropped to the floor, scattered the bones, and was now practicing throwing the ball in the air and catching it.</p><p>\u201cKnucklebones is a game for children,\u201d the duchess pointed out.</p> <p>Lisette\u2019s mouth drooped. \u201cI know. I do wish we had children in the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut we do have a child in the house,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Lisette blinked up at him. \u201cThey all went home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy son is here.\u201d</p><p>Being Lisette, she didn\u2019t wonder how Villiers had a son, given as he had no wife. \u201cLeopold, how wonderful you are,\u201d she crowed, as if he had produced that son solely for her pleasure.</p> <p>Eleanor\u2019s mother had been occupying herself by glaring at Anne\u2019s bent head, but now she jerked around to stare at Villiers instead. She, if not Lisette, knew perfectly well that Villiers had never married.</p><p>\u201cA ward perhaps?\u201d she asked, her tone just this side of glacial. \u201cSurely the word son was a slip of the tongue, Duke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn fact, Tobias is my son,\u201d Villiers said. He turned to the footman. \u201cSummon my son from the nursery, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow lucky you are!\u201d Lisette said wistfully. \u201cI do wish I had children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBe still!\u201d the duchess snapped.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Eleanor said, feeling a pulse of sympathy. She had realized long ago that her mother found situations even slightly out of the ordinary to be frightfully upsetting. It wasn\u2019t that the duchess had a puritanical attitude toward sin, precisely\u2014but she had a positive loathing for irregularities of any sort.</p> <p>\u201cHush,\u201d her mother said, rounding on her. \u201cYou are far too innocent to understand the implications of this\u2014this\u2014of\u2014\u201d She ground to a halt, and then said, \u201cYour son should not be in the vicinity of decent gentlewomen, Villiers. I should not have to emphasize such a common point of decency. You have offered your hostess a monstrous insult.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s gray eyes rested thoughtfully on the duchess and then moved on to Lisette. \u201cI have an illegitimate son,\u201d he explained. \u201cI apologize for insulting you by bringing him under your roof.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt like applauding. Villiers\u2019s voice was so composed that not even a tinge of irony leaked into his words.</p><p>Since Lisette cared nothing for irregularities and indeed created them on a regular basis, she smiled up at Villiers. \u201cYou\u2019re very lucky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see what you are doing?\u201d the duchess hissed at Villiers. \u201cContaminating the ears of the innocent. She doesn\u2019t even understand your effrontery.\u201d If Villiers had himself under such tight control that he appeared emotionless, her mother was on the verge of losing her temper altogether.</p><p>Eleanor glimpsed the bleak look in Villiers\u2019s eyes, and the unmindful\u2014though not innocent\u2014smile playing around Lisette\u2019s lips. She hated the choking sense of inferiority she felt whenever her mother was about to call someone stupid. It didn\u2019t even matter that she herself was not the subject of the diatribe.</p><p>What she hated, and had hated since childhood, was the moment when her mother lost control of her temper and flayed all those in her path.</p><p>\u201cI have half a mind to leave this house immediately,\u201d Her Grace said now, her voice rising. \u201cVilliers, you are a fool if you believe that\u2014\u201d</p> <p>Something snapped inside Eleanor: that same frail thread of patience that had carried her through twenty-two years of her mother\u2019s bouts of irritability. She was tired of hearing people called stupid. She was tired of agreeing with her mother\u2019s pronouncements simply because opposition took effort.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d she said, stepping forward to put a hand on Villiers\u2019s arm. \u201cThe duke has done me the inestimable honor of asking me to marry him.\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of frozen silence. Even the gentle rattle of Anne\u2019s tossing the knucklebones ceased. The only sound Eleanor heard was the muttering of two footmen stationed in the hallway.</p><p>\u201cI have accepted,\u201d she added, just to make everything clear.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s eyelashes flickered as he glanced around the group. Really, his eyelashes were too thick for a man. \u201cI was overcome by joy,\u201d he said solemnly. \u201cI shall never forget the moment that she accepted my hand.\u201d</p><p>He drew Eleanor\u2019s hand under the crook of his arm and gave her a smile. She retaliated by giving him a little pinch.</p><p>Lisette looked between them. \u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re going to be a duchess, Ellie?\u201d</p><p>Since her mother was still paralyzed, trapped between outrage and ambition, Eleanor smiled down at Lisette. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Anne leaped to her feet and gave Eleanor a kiss. \u201cWhat a surprise!\u201d she cried, throwing a soulful look at Villiers. \u201cAh, Duke, you\u2019ll never know what a treasure you\u2019re stealing from those of us who love Eleanor best.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor wished she had her hand free so she could pinch Anne as well.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that lovely,\u201d Lisette breathed, rising as well. \u201cI adore weddings. So pretty. So festive.\u201d She waved at the footman who had just entered the room. \u201cChampagne, James!\u201d</p><p>James obediently trotted back out.</p><p>Apparently, that was the extent of Lisette\u2019s interest in Villiers\u2019s announcement. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we start our game?\u201d she asked, dropping back to the floor. Anne immediately sat back down, skirts spreading in an elegant circle around her.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s mother cleared her throat and turned to Villiers. \u201cI will be blunt. I am not particularly pleased, given the circumstances.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have six illegitimate children,\u201d Villiers informed her, not kindly.</p><p>She visibly paled.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cI know this has been a terrific shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy daughter is marrying a duke,\u201d the duchess said between clenched teeth. \u201cTrue, he apparently has the morals of a squirrel, but that\u2019s my cross to bear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, the children will be Eleanor\u2019s cross to bear,\u201d Villiers said all too cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cI gather you have this particular boy with you for a purpose,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cI must suppose you are conveying him to an appropriate household in the country. Surely you need not have effected this errand in person?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor intervened before Villiers could deliver a death blow by informing the duchess that he intended to raise the children under his own roof. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to discuss such particulars now.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s eyes snapped to her. \u201cEleanor, you must forget that you ever heard this discussion. If your father were here, he would talk to the duke himself. But since he is ungrateful enough to be in Russia with your brother, I shall undertake that task myself. Duke, we shall discuss this tomorrow. In private!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in anticipation,\u201d Villiers drawled.</p><p>His future mother-in-law gave him a look of extreme dislike, but she held her tongue. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo join us!\u201d Lisette called from the floor.</p><p>\u201cAre you suggesting that I sprawl about on the floor?\u201d the duchess demanded.</p><p>At that moment the door opened and a thin boy in a brown velvet suit entered. He was dressed like any boy of the aristocracy, Eleanor thought, though he clearly wasn\u2019t one of them. There was something wild and proud in his face, as if he were more duke than the duke.</p><p>He walked forward and bent his head.</p> <p>\u201cBow,\u201d his father said, though not sharply.</p><p>He bowed.</p><p>Anne and Lisette both looked up. \u201cSit next to me!\u201d Lisette caroled, patting the floor. \u201cI am having a terrible time catching this little ball.\u201d</p><p>The boy was like a miniature version of Villiers, from his cool gray eyes to his extreme self-possession. \u201cMay I present my son,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHis name is Tobias.\u201d</p><p>The boy turned his head and looked at his father.</p> <p>\u201cHe prefers to be called Juby,\u201d Villiers added.</p><p>It was the first time she had ever seen Villiers bested, and by someone less than half his weight. Eleanor stepped forward and smiled.</p><p>\u201cLady Eleanor,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cMy future wife.\u201d There was just the slightest edge of irony in his tone.</p><p>Eleanor dropped a curtsy. The boy bowed his head again. He was fiercely beautiful in the way some young males are, as if their whole life were being lived through their eyes, and their large noses, and their ungainly limbs.</p><p>\u201cBow,\u201d his father said unemotionally.</p><p>He bowed.</p> <p>\u201cLady Eleanor\u2019s mother, the Duchess of Montague.\u201d</p><p>This time Tobias bowed without being told, which made Eleanor feel better. If this wild boy interpreted her mother\u2019s murderous gaze properly, then perhaps she herself wasn\u2019t such an incompetent coward for having given in to her so many times in the last twenty-two years.</p><p>\u201cOn the floor are Lady Lisette and Mrs. Bouchon,\u201d Villiers continued. \u201cBow.\u201d</p><p>Tobias bowed. Lisette looked up again and patted the ground. Naturally, Tobias dropped instantly into the place she indicated.</p><p>\u201cI shall retire until supper to compose myself,\u201d the duchess announced, her voice indicating that she was on the very edge of a swoon. She paused, clearly to allow Villiers and Eleanor to chorus their protests. Their eyes met.</p><p>\u201cYou must be exhausted by the long trip, Mother,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cThough one certainly couldn\u2019t tell,\u201d Villiers put in. \u201cYou look as exquisite as ever, Duchess.\u201d</p><p>She automatically raised one shoulder in a coquettish gesture. \u201cOh, how can you say so!\u201d she said, though without her usual vigor. \u201cThe dust! The dryness. We were easily half a day in the carriage.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly a woman of remarkable fortitude could look as fresh as you do after a journey,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you to the stairs, Mother,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cA footman will inform you the moment that the squire and his family arrive.\u201d</p><p>As they walked into the entrance hall they came face-to-face with an enormous gilded mirror. Eleanor saw herself and stopped short.</p><p>\u201cJust look at yourself!\u201d her mother snapped. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve done to your eyes makes you look shameless.\u201d She clutched Eleanor\u2019s arm a little tighter. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say such a thing, but I\u2019m not certain you should marry Villiers, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>She kept talking, but Eleanor wasn\u2019t listening. The kohl black that Anne had put on her lashes and smudged around her eyes made them look twice as large as they normally did. She looked...</p><p>Beautiful. Mysterious. Sensual. Anything but a virgin.</p><p>\u201cYour curls are in terrible disarray,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYou shall come upstairs with me, Eleanor, and I shall have a word with Willa. That sort of tawdry effect she\u2019s created simply won\u2019t do. If we do decide that you should accept Villiers\u2019s proposal, you\u2019ll have to find someone who understands the consequence of your position.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eleanor stated. She couldn\u2019t pull her eyes away from her own face. Her small, ordinary face was transformed. Her lips looked naughty, like a woman who kissed in corners and laughed inordinately, rather than with the kind of constrained emotion that befit a duke\u2019s daughter.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like the kind of woman who stood around, moping after her former lover. She looked like the kind of woman whose former lover pined for her.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth do you mean?\u201d her mother demanded.</p><p>She turned to her mother, chin high. \u201cI like the way I look, Mother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t look like a duchess.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor knew perfectly well that her mother loved her, and that she only wanted the best for her daughters. But she was finished with the pretense that she was a perfect daughter.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to look like a duchess,\u201d she stated.</p><p>\u201cVilliers pays more attention to his appearance than the queen herself does. You wouldn\u2019t catch him going about with his hair falling out of its ribbon. I\u2019ve never even seen his neck cloth in less than pristine condition. He must assign a footman to follow him with spare cloths.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite likely,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cBut if he wants to waste his time being perfect in dress, he\u2019ll have to do it alone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d</p><p>It was harder to withstand her mother when she was pleading rather than browbeating. But Eleanor didn\u2019t want to dress like a wilting virgin any longer. \u201cYou\u2019ve often criticized me for not being appealing enough to gentlemen,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI never criticize,\u201d her mother said stoutly. And the worst of it was that she believed it.</p><p>\u201cYou have called me foolish,\u201d Eleanor replied. \u201cAnd you were right. I simply wasn\u2019t interested in getting married. I couldn\u2019t picture myself doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil Villiers changed your mind. I suppose every gentleman has peccadilloes. I\u2019ll just have to impress upon him that he may never mention those children in your presence or mine again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t Villiers who changed my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever it was, I don\u2019t see why that change entails dressing like a shameless wagtail,\u201d her mother said, reverting to her former theme.</p><p>\u201cWagtail, Mother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know precisely what I mean!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor smiled at her reflection. \u201cI like that word.\u201d She gave an experimental wag of her hips. \u201cAnd more to the point, Villiers likes the way I look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is true that he proposed to you immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s the evidence, Mother,\u201d Eleanor said, cheerfully ignoring the truth of the matter. Unfortunately, Villiers hadn\u2019t turned a hair when he saw her transformation. He must have noticed her face paint, but it certainly hadn\u2019t warmed his heart, given the way he had been hovering over Lisette.</p><p>As if her mother read her mind, she gave her a little shove. \u201cYou\u2019d better go back in the sitting room, now that I think of it. Lisette is the same as she ever was, but she\u2019s so pretty that one hardly notices at first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoor Lisette,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>Her mother snorted and headed up the stairs.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>Villiers looked down at his son\u2019s head. Tobias\u2014he\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d ever call him Juby\u2014was sitting on the floor throwing the knucklebones. The boy had inky black hair that was just like his own. He\u2019d have to warn him about the white streaks; they\u2019d showed up just past his eighteenth birthday. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>At first, as a boy, he\u2019d been afraid that he would turn as white as an ostrich. Then he realized that the ducal picture gallery held a portrait of an ancestor from years back, who had the same hair. The same face too. Nasty cold-eyed bastard, he looked, and so Villiers didn\u2019t have any illusions about his own visage.</p><p>The whole idea that Tobias had his hair and eyes gave him a queer feeling.</p><p>Lisette looked up and gave him the lavish smile with which she seemed to greet everyone. He\u2019d seen many beautiful women\u2014his former fianc\u00e9e, Roberta, was exquisite\u2014but Lisette was extraordinary. She was like some sort of chaste and joyful goddess.</p><p>\u201cJoin us,\u201d she cried, gesturing toward the floor. She was seated in the middle of a puddle of shimmering silk, looking like a flower. It was refreshing to see someone with no regard for convention, as opposed to the Duchess of Montague, a woman whom he would personally nominate as the person one most doesn\u2019t want to welcome into the family.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait for Lady Eleanor to return from escorting her mother,\u201d he said.</p><p>Lisette gave her charming little shrug. It seemed she\u2019d forgotten about Eleanor.</p><p>Whom he was apparently marrying. From all appearances, Eleanor had decided to kick over the traces, but he didn\u2019t have any real belief that she had actually decided to marry him. She had announced that merely to silence her mother.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t think of another woman in all of England who would dare to announce their engagement without waiting for him to propose.</p><p>Eleanor walked back into the room. If Lisette glowed with a kind of concentrated gold, Eleanor had the crimson lips and sultry look of an English harem dancer, if such a thing existed.</p> <p>Without a word to him she dropped on the floor next to Anne. Her side panniers were too large for the indignity of sitting on the floor. One of them bounced into the air and he caught a glimpse of a deliciously slim ankle before she slapped it back down.</p><p>\u201cI was about to ask if I might offer you a chair,\u201d he said, just for the pleasure of having her scowl at him.</p><p>Her eyes were as sooty as a fashionable strumpet\u2019s. But she was trained to be a duchess, and so she sat straight upright, even though seated on the floor. A ducal doxy, that\u2019s what she was. A dissipated duchess. Whatever she was, his body responded to her signals as if he really were in a brothel\u2014not that he ever entered those establishments.</p><p>He should probably join the group on the floor, but he loathed that sort of informality. And he didn\u2019t trust Popper\u2019s housekeeping skills, either.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you do besides throw the bones and try to catch the ball?\u201d Eleanor was asking. She had the ball in hand and seemed to be catching it easily enough.</p><p>\u201cJuby says he and other boys make up their own rules,\u201d Lisette put in. \u201cI don\u2019t see any reason why we should have to be precise. I want to try riding the elephant.\u201d</p> <p>Riding the elephant? Villiers realized he had clearly missed an important part of the conversation. It was a pity that his blood was at a slow boil, all due to Eleanor\u2019s pouty lips. It made him think of bedding her.</p><p>She was a fierce, sharp-tongued little thing who would probably turn into her mother. And if that wasn\u2019t enough to frighten a man into flaccidity, nothing would.</p><p>\u201cJuby?\u201d Eleanor said to Tobias. \u201cThat name makes you sound like a boiled sweet.\u201d</p><p>Villiers had to stop himself from grinning. She might be sharp-tongued, but she was echoing his opinion. He pulled over a chair and sat down behind his son.</p><p>Eleanor cast him one of her bird-quick looks. \u201cWhy do you get to sit in a chair while we\u2019re on the floor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou chose to sit there,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cI choose not to join you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a stick-in-the-mud you are, Leopold!\u201d Lisette laughed. She put her arm around Tobias. \u201cWe like being on the floor, don\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>Tobias edged away. He wasn\u2019t old enough, or young enough, to want to be hugged. But it was pleasant to see how charming she was with him. Obviously, Lisette was completely unaffected by the circumstances of Tobias\u2019s birth. She was treating him as she would any child: with that artless joy she brought to her daily life.</p> <p>She was laughing now, and clapping at the way Tobias was catching knucklebones on the back of his hand.</p><p>After five or six minutes Lisette was out of the game and so was Anne, who in fact had taken herself out. She had lit a cigarillo and was leaning against one of Villiers\u2019s chair legs and blowing smoke rings at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Lisette said, looking up at him with a pretty pout.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d Eleanor said, without even bothering to glance at him, \u201cLisette wishes to do something else.\u201d</p><p>She really would turn into her mother if she didn\u2019t watch out. Still, he helped Lisette to her feet, noticing that she was as lithe as she appeared. \u201cYou have a vast array of musical instruments on the far wall,\u201d he noted.</p><p>Her eyes brightened immediately. \u201cI\u2019ve learned to play all of them; I adore music!\u201d</p><p>His own mother had loved music as well, and used to spend hours playing a harpsichord in the drawing room. He smiled down at Lisette, imagining for a moment what their children might look like. All that gold delicacy would offset his dark, brutish looks.</p><p>Not that Tobias looked terrible, but he had to admit that his daughter Violet was no\u2014Well, she was no violet. She had an oddly lumpy look, and a huge chin. He didn\u2019t know how he\u2019d ever marry her off, but he figured that enough money would do it.</p><p>And maybe being around Lisette would teach Violet to be charming and happy. Lisette was doubly beautiful because she was so cheerful.</p><p>He glanced back at Eleanor, who was scowling at Tobias. She could use the same lesson. Still, common sense told him that Tobias didn\u2019t care about a scowl or two. Not after the abuse he had suffered at Grindel\u2019s hands.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s hands involuntarily curled into fists. He\u2019d knocked the man out, taken all the boys away, and then spoken to a Bow Street magistrate he knew. Grindel was now in prison for life, but still he lay awake at night thinking about ripping the man\u2019s head from his body.</p><p>\u201cLeopold!\u201d Lisette called prettily. \u201cWill you help me take down this lute?\u201d</p><p>Normally he would have frozen out any person with the temerity to call him by name. Yet somehow Lisette disarmed his every criticism. It was an interesting realization that warranted further thought.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye Eleanor saw Villiers trot after Lisette, but she didn\u2019t spare him a withering glance. Not that he\u2019d be looking; the pathetic awe in his eyes when he looked at Lisette told its own story.</p><p>Instead, she hunched over and watched like a hawk to make sure that Tobias didn\u2019t try to palm any of the bones. She\u2019d already caught him with one under his leg and another up his sleeve.</p><p>Across the room Lisette began tuning the lute. She had an angelic voice, and never seemed more the perfect lady than when she was singing. That was the sad thing about Lisette: it was no act. She was a lady...when she was a lady.</p><p>With an effort, Eleanor banished Villiers and Lisette from her mind. For the moment she just wanted to trounce this ill-tempered, ill-mannered, miniature Villiers. There was something about him that she liked. For one thing, he had been completely uncowed by her mother\u2019s glare.</p><p>They were tied going into the final game. He threw a perfect round. She countered. They switched to left-handed throws. Luckily, she was actually left-handed. He threw another perfect round, and again she countered. He returned to his right hand, but with a handicap of a bent little finger. Finally he missed. It was her turn. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She threw the ball, scooped\u2014and the sixth knucklebone slid, smooth as butter, under her spreading skirts. She closed her fingers around the bones.</p><p>\u201cYou won!\u201d Tobias cried, looking utterly shocked. \u201cBut I never lose.\u201d</p><p>She took a second to savor her victory. \u201cThat\u2019s likely because you\u2019ve never played a woman before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think girls are better at knucklebones than boys?\u201d She\u2019d seen that jutting jaw before. Villiers had it. Well, every boy had it when they were confronted with an unpleasant reality.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m better than you are,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t the two of us stand as emblems for our sexes?\u201d</p><p>He thought his way through that language. \u201cI\u2019ve played lots of girls before,\u201d he reported. \u201cAnd I always win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPride goeth before a fall,\u201d she said. And then she relented, grinning at him. \u201cI cheated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d His voice suddenly dropped a register, taking on, in its disbelief, his father\u2019s low voice.</p><p>She whisked aside her skirt and showed him the hidden jack. \u201cYou should always count the bones when someone claims victory.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do always count the bones!\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, normally. But you\u2019re a lady!\u201d His voice swooped from high to low. He would have his father\u2019s deep velvet tones someday.</p><p>\u201cYour mistake,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cI cheated\u2014but I still won. You tried to cheat and you lost. When I decided to cheat, I won because you didn\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>Tobias narrowed his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a strange lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery strange,\u201d Villiers said from above her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI have thought Eleanor strange since our nursery days,\u201d Anne laughed. She sounded a little drunk.</p><p>\u201cTobias,\u201d Eleanor said, ignoring them, \u201cdo you suppose that you\u2019re strong enough to haul me into a standing position?\u201d</p> <p>He jumped to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re not so large.\u201d He had decided to like her, she guessed. Now that she had cheated. Men were strange, no matter the age. \u201cI\u2019ll be taller than you in a month or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re as boastful as my dog,\u201d she told him. Sure enough, he managed to get her to her feet. She twitched her skirts so they flowed over her panniers.</p><p>He was longing to tell her that she was crazy and that dogs didn\u2019t boast, so she put him out of his misery. \u201cMy dog Oyster is a terrible braggart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he boast about?\u201d Tobias asked.</p><p>\u201cHis tail, for one thing. He loves his tail. The problem is that he can\u2019t see it because he\u2019s too fat. So he goes around and around, barking so that I realize how important and beautiful and special that tail is.\u201d</p><p>Tobias had clearly learned not to laugh, because he just watched her with those curious, intent eyes that reminded her of his father. It made her itch to comfort him, which was absurd.</p><p>\u201cSecond, Oyster is ridiculously proud of his ability to defend me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDefend you? The nursemaid told me that he was the size of a piglet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to admit that there may be a certain resemblance. But my point is that he thinks he\u2019s very fierce. Extremely so. He likes to pretend that the fire andirons are about to attack me. He creeps up, attacks them savagely, and manages to save my life.\u201d</p><p>Tobias hesitated.</p><p>\u201cI know...you wish to inform me that Oyster is not the brightest canine,\u201d Eleanor said, sighing.</p><p>Tobias almost smiled.</p><p>\u201cThe third thing he\u2019s very proud of is his pizzle,\u201d she said.</p><p>He grinned outright at that. \u201cI thought ladies never mentioned such things.\u201d</p><p>Actually they didn\u2019t, generally speaking. \u201cYou also thought you could beat any woman simply because you have a pizzle,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cNot to mention the fact that you thought a lady wouldn\u2019t cheat, so you didn\u2019t count the bones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m horrified,\u201d Villiers said with a drawl. \u201cHorrified.\u201d He turned to his son, his eyes so serious that Eleanor wondered if Tobias would get the joke. \u201cShe\u2019s no lady, son. I\u2019ll have to find another duchess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOyster has the smallest pizzle you can imagine,\u201d Eleanor said, glancing at Villiers just to make it clear that she might be able to imagine one smaller. \u201cMore like a radish than anything to be proud of.\u201d</p><p>Tobias giggled, sounding like any other child.</p><p>\u201cBut when he starts waving it around,\u201d she said, taking another sip of her rum punch, \u201cyou\u2019d think that it was a royal pizzle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does he do with it?\u201d Tobias asked. He sounded about five years younger than he had on entering the room.</p><p>\u201cWell, I hate to tell you this, because it\u2019s going to reduce your opinion of him,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cbut he is uncommonly fond of Peter, one of our footmen. Or perhaps it is more accurate to admit that his object of passion is Peter\u2019s leg.\u201d</p><p>Who would have thought it? Father and son laughed in exactly the same way.</p><p>Eleanor finished up her drink, thinking about how utterly predictable the male sense of humor was. Tobias reacted precisely as her own brother would have, at the same age. It seemed that men never really got past that age, in fact.</p><p>The Duke of Villiers. Age thirteen, going on...forty.</p><p>Typical.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>By the time Squire Thestle and his family finally appeared, Tobias had been dispatched to the nursery, and the entire company had consumed three glasses of rum punch each. Villiers showed no signs of intoxication, but Anne was weaving a little as she walked.</p><p>Eleanor prided herself on being able to manage several glasses of wine, but she was slowly coming to realize that rum punch was not like wine. Her head was swimming and she had to curb the impulse to beam.</p><p>Luckily, her mother had reappeared and taken over the role of hostess, since Lisette didn\u2019t even bother to rise to greet the squire. Lisette, seated on a couch beside Eleanor, had been talking, almost without breathing, for twenty minutes. Really, Eleanor thought sentimentally, Lisette was greatly misunderstood by the ton. She almost always made sense.</p><p>\u201cLisette,\u201d she said, interrupting, \u201cDon\u2019t you wish to marry someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I plan to do so. I\u2019m engaged; did you know that?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor sat up. \u201cYou\u2019re betrothed? To whom?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRoland\u2019s older brother,\u201d Lisette said, waving her hand at the squire and his son. \u201cMy father and his arranged it eons ago. His name is Lancelot.\u201d</p><p>It must have been arranged when the betrothed couple were in their respective cradles, given the edgy politeness with which the squire nodded in the direction of Lisette. \u201cRoland and Lancelot...No wonder Roland became a poet. Where is Lancelot?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe went on a tour some years ago,\u201d Lisette said with complete unconcern. \u201cWhen he comes back, I suppose we\u2019ll marry. I\u2019m quite comfortable as I am. Or if I meet someone I like better than Lancelot, I\u2019ll just marry him instead. The squire wouldn\u2019t mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat would you think of marrying Villiers, for example?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers?\u201d Lisette seemed to have forgotten who he was, so Eleanor waved her hand toward the duke. He was standing with his back to them, talking to Anne. She didn\u2019t know why Anne was so taken by his shoulders. She preferred his thighs. His muscles were positively immoral, the way they strained the silk of his pantaloons. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, Leopold,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cI thought you had decided to marry him, Eleanor. I\u2019m sure you told him so earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe did ask me,\u201d Eleanor said defensively.</p><p>\u201cReally? He looked so surprised.\u201d There wasn\u2019t an ounce of condemnation in Lisette\u2019s tone. Clearly, if she wanted to marry someone, she would simply go ahead and announce the impending nuptials. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t wish to marry Leopold.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt quite relieved. Well, of course she was relieved, because she had lost her head and announced her intention to marry Villiers, though she would have backed down if Lisette had strong feelings for the duke. Possibly.</p> <p>\u201cHe does have lovely hair,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cI never really thought of him as a husband.\u201d She bent her head to the side and peered at him.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you bending your neck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPeople are so interesting viewed sideways,\u201d she said. \u201cJust look at Leopold, for example. His nose is even bigger from the side.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor bent her neck but began to sag to the side so she straightened quickly. It must be the Champagne on top of rum punch.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind marrying Leopold,\u201d Lisette continued. \u201cLeopold and Lisette sound quite nice together. Almost as nice as Lancelot and Lisette. What\u2019s more, he saved me from a quite savage dog this afternoon.\u201d She looked at Eleanor. \u201cDid you hear about what happened to me?\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor managed a smile. \u201cIt was my puppy, remember, darling?\u201d</p><p>Lisette blinked. \u201cOh, of course it was!\u201d Her smile was a little forced. \u201cI\u2019ve been fearful of dogs since I was attacked by a mongrel in the village square. It was nearly the size of a wolf, starving to death, I expect. The villagers had to shoot it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must have been awful,\u201d Eleanor said flatly.</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s not what we were talking about. We were talking of marrying Villiers. You know, I am going to think about that very seriously. Thank you for suggesting it. My aunt Marguerite can be so annoying sometimes. Do you know that we almost never have visitors? I expect that people come to your house all the time, don\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel as if my spirit is trapped here.\u201d She flung open her arms and knocked Eleanor\u2019s glass to the floor. \u201cOh, well, it must be time for supper,\u201d she said, glancing at the spilled drink. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Popper that he should ring the bell this minute. Dinner!\u201d she called, waving to the room at large.</p> <p>They all looked up. Eleanor\u2019s mother was obviously enjoying a comfortable coze with the squire\u2019s wife.</p><p>\u201cTime to eat,\u201d Lisette said cheerfully. \u201cEleanor is getting tipsy and dropped her glass.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor quickly straightened her back again and tried to look sober.</p><p>\u201cSince Popper isn\u2019t here, I\u2019ll inform a footman,\u201d Lisette said. She darted out the door and a moment later they heard the dinner gong.</p><p>\u201cLady Lisette is remarkably spontaneous,\u201d Villiers said, appearing at Eleanor\u2019s side. His voice was far more admiring than she appreciated.</p><p>\u201cShe has always had that quality,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cWe spend a great deal of our time hemmed in by customs and manners,\u201d he said thoughtfully.</p><p>Manners were certainly not Lisette\u2019s strong suit, but Eleanor kept her mouth shut.</p> <p>Squire Thestle was a tall, thin man who had powdered his hair so heavily that little snowfalls kept drifting to his shoulders and then sliding, as if down a mountain slope, to the floor. He had melancholy eyes that reminded Eleanor of Oyster after a bout of incontinence and a scolding. His wife was even taller than he, and certainly broader in the shoulders.</p><p>Strangely enough, these homely parents had produced a remarkably beautiful son. With a brilliant smile, Lisette introduced Eleanor to Sir Roland. \u201cLady Eleanor, I know that you will be so pleased to meet Roland. Or Roly-Poly, as we used to call him. Roly, will you escort Lady Eleanor to her seat, please?\u201d</p><p>Sir Roland clearly didn\u2019t care to be reminded of this nickname; he looked at Lisette with the respectful dislike one reserves for a venomous viper. Eleanor certainly understood that feeling. She was starting to remember just how much she used to dread her annual summer visits to Knole House, before Lisette\u2019s mother died and their families drifted apart.</p><p>By five minutes later she was feeling much better. Roland didn\u2019t look at her with cool eyes that made her feel as if he was secretly laughing at her. Lisette had been right about his Roman nose, but she forgot to add how handsome a nose like that could be when it was paired with a deep lower lip and a strong chin. A Grecian chin, didn\u2019t she say?</p><p>Whatever kind of chin it was, she liked it. And Roland apparently liked her as well. They found so many agreeable subjects of conversation that she had to remind herself to turn now and then and ask the squire a few more questions about the birds nesting in the church steeple.</p><p>The admiration in Roland\u2019s eyes was very soothing. \u201cI\u2019m so surprised that I\u2019ve never met you before,\u201d he was saying now.</p><p>\u201cI find Almack\u2019s boring,\u201d Eleanor said, ignoring the fact that she was there every Wednesday last season. No one who\u2019d seen her in April would recognize her now. \u201cSo tedious...All the same people, and everyone on his best behavior.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know just what you mean,\u201d Roland said, looking at her a little shyly. He had nice eyelashes. Not as thick as Villiers\u2019s, she noticed, but long and curling. \u201cHow do you like to entertain yourself, Lady Eleanor?\u201d He caught himself and actually turned a little pink. \u201cI certainly didn\u2019t mean that in an improper manner.\u201d</p><p>Anne answered him from across the table, which was a breach of etiquette, but it was that sort of dinner party. \u201cEleanor does what every woman does for entertainment.\u201d</p><p>Villiers cut a glance at Eleanor and she could see laughter in his eyes. Anne was definitely the worse for all that rum punch, not to mention the Champagne. Popper seemed to have decided that the best way to survive the evening was to float all the unwanted guests in a sea of bubbles.</p><p>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d Roland asked, looking adorably interested.</p><p>Eleanor smiled at him. He was as fresh and sweet as an early peach. For all he must be older than she was, he seemed younger. He looked like someone who was ready to fall in love.</p><p>\u201cWe watch men, of course,\u201d Anne said with a tiny, ladylike hiccup. \u201cMen are endlessly amusing.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had discovered that if she leaned toward Roland, his eyes slid down to her breasts as if he couldn\u2019t stop himself. And when he looked back up at her face, there was something in the depths of his eyes that made her shift in her chair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine why you aren\u2019t married,\u201d he said, pitching his voice below the hum of conversation.</p><p>She was boggled for a moment. If she admitted to her own ruling about dukes, she sounded like a snobbish fool. On the other hand, if she admitted to being tenuously engaged to Villiers, she would have to stop flirting. Rather than decide, or dissemble, she turned the topic back to Roland. \u201cWhat do you do for recreation, sir?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI write. Day and night, I write poetry.\u201d He met her eyes again, steadily. \u201cI feel as if we shall definitely meet many times in our lives, Lady Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat at the pure intensity in his gaze. \u201cAh\u2014I hope so.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI write poetry,\u201d he said again. A lock of dark hair fell over his eyes and he threw it back. \u201cHave you ever read the verse of Richard Barnfield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t read much poetry,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI\u2019m halfway through Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets at the moment, but I\u2019m finding them slow going.\u201d</p><p>Roland picked up Eleanor\u2019s Champagne glass and leaned toward her. \u201cShakespeare is all very well, but of course his work is terribly out of fashion. I prefer a line that\u2019s more evocative. Her lips like red-rose leaves floated on this cup...and left its vintage sweeter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s lovely,\u201d she breathed. \u201cDid you just write it this moment?\u201d</p> <p>He grinned at her, and his smile was even more enticing than his intent gaze. \u201cI would lie to you about that, but I don\u2019t want to lie to you, ever.\u201d He handed her the glass. \u201cTaste. Honey from Hyblean bees, matched with this liquor, would be bitter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is Hyblea?\u201d It was Villiers, speaking across the table as rudely as had Anne.</p><p>Eleanor blinked at him. She was caught in the web of Roland\u2019s words. The last thing she wanted was a geographical discussion. She frowned and turned back to the poet. \u201cDo tell me the rest of the poem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the rest of the poem isn\u2019t fit for the supper table,\u201d he said with a glance from under his lashes. He put one finger on the inside of her wrist. \u201cThis blue vein touches your heart, Lady Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would love to know the remainder of the poem,\u201d she said, her voice dropping to a near whisper.</p> <p>\u201cSo would I,\u201d Villiers put in.</p><p>She glared at him. Couldn\u2019t he tell a private conversation when he overheard one? But now everyone was looking down the table, and Roland withdrew his finger as if she had burned him. She twitched with annoyance.</p><p>\u201cIt is part of my own version of Romeo and Juliet,\u201d Roland said. \u201cI won\u2019t share more; people find poetry tedious. Certainly my family tells me that mine is tiresome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo flowery, in my opinion,\u201d his father said. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s had quite a bit printed. He\u2019s not just some ne\u2019er-do-well with nothing better to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrinted?\u201d the duchess said, her tone dripping with disdain.</p><p>\u201cLikely you aren\u2019t knowledgeable about the literary world,\u201d the squire told her. \u201cThe very best have their poems printed, and no shame in that. The shame is in not printing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHumph,\u201d was Her Grace\u2019s response to that.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, my son was knighted last year for his poetry writing,\u201d the squire said, puffing up his thin chest.</p><p>\u201cA veritable troubadour,\u201d Villiers said. His comment was perfectly pitched to make it unclear whether he meant it as a compliment or an insult.</p><p>\u201cWhen we tragically lost Prince Octavius last year,\u201d the squire continued, \u201cRoland wrote an exquisite verse in his memory. Truly beautiful, and the king himself thought so. He felt it succored him in his time of suffering, and he summoned the lad to Buckingham Palace and knighted him on the spot.\u201d</p><p>Roland\u2019s lowered eyes were, perhaps, a bit more humble than Eleanor would have liked, but that was her ungracious, sarcastic nature coming out, and as Anne had told her, she needed to curb that trait. Luckily, Champagne had a mellowing effect.</p><p>\u201cWell, let\u2019s hear a bit of this poetry, then,\u201d Eleanor\u2019s mother allowed, in a considerably warmer voice. \u201cNot the piece for Princess Amelia. I can\u2019t abide feeling sad. Something more entertaining, if you please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a bit from when Romeo promises to climb to Juliet\u2019s window,\u201d Roland said. He put his right hand at his side and it just touched Eleanor\u2019s. \u201cJuliet tells him to come before the lark with its shrill song has waked a world of dreamers. And Romeo promises to climb to her balcony in a ladder wrought out of scarlet silk and sewn with pearls.\u201d</p><p>His finger barely stroked Eleanor\u2019s wrist.</p> <p>\u201cIs that it?\u201d Her Grace said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all I can remember,\u201d Roland said.</p><p>\u201cWell, I like the idea of a ladder sewn with pearls,\u201d the duchess allowed. \u201cI have a red bonnet sewn with pearls that may be something of the same idea.\u201d She turned to the squire. \u201cAren\u2019t you a little worried that all this talk of red silk and pearls makes your son sound like a milliner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a clever lad,\u201d the squire said, pride evident in his voice. \u201cHe\u2019s never caused me a moment\u2019s worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that\u2019s more than I can say for my daughters,\u201d she said, glancing down the table. \u201cEleanor, you are too pink in the face. How much Champagne have you drunk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I have,\u201d Anne said cheerfully. She looked at Lisette. \u201cDarling, don\u2019t you think you could rise now, so that we could leave the table before I slip under it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh! Are you waiting for me?\u201d Lisette said. \u201cGoodness, and I\u2019m such a slow eater. I eat like a bird.\u201d She took another bite.</p><p>Villiers smiled down at her. \u201cA very graceful bird, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor turned back to Roland. \u201cThat poem is beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually not that good,\u201d he told her with a twinkle. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t even try to publish that in its current state. Too flowery, as my father said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the ladder could be just silk with no pearls,\u201d Eleanor suggested. \u201cOne has to think that pearls are not only ruinously expensive, but uncomfortable underfoot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDepending on the weight of the climber, they might even be crushed,\u201d Villiers said, interjecting himself into their conversation again. \u201cIs Romeo the one who\u2019s fat and short of breath? Or is that Hamlet?\u201d</p><p>Roland threw him an unfriendly look. \u201cThat sort of verisimilitude has no place in the land of poesy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just trying to point out a logical problem,\u201d Villiers said innocently. \u201cCleopatra used to pulverize pearls and put them in her wine, after all. While I\u2019ve never stamped on one, I\u2019m certain that they would shatter easily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Lisette put in. \u201cI have any number of pearls and they aren\u2019t crushed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut have you stamped on any of them?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>Lisette stared at her for a moment, clearly searching her mind for the shards of crushed pearls. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet. \u201cLet\u2019s try it!\u201d</p><p>Villiers actually laughed, looking up at her. \u201cYou are a true original, Lady Lisette.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt her lips tightening. Glancing at Roland, she saw an expression in his eyes that she guessed mirrored her own.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he whispered to her, \u201cI\u2019ve lived next to Lady Lisette my whole life. Do you know that my brother is betrothed to her?\u201d And, when she nodded, \u201cIt all happened in the cradle, naturally, and it would bankrupt my father to repay her dowry. So Lancelot never comes home. We haven\u2019t seen him in six years. He does write now and then, hoping that she\u2019s run off with someone.\u201d</p><p>He held back her chair. \u201cWe\u2019re about to watch the demolishment of some pearls.\u201d</p><p>A short time later they were all in the sitting room, holding cups of tea, when Lisette\u2019s maid appeared with a string of pearls and a most disapproving look on her face. The poor woman even tried to remonstrate with her mistress. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Roland had come to sit next to Eleanor, as naturally as if they\u2019d always known each other. He put his mouth near her ear and she could feel his breath tickle her neck. \u201cIf someone takes the pearls away she\u2019ll turn into a whirling dervish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a whirling dervish?\u201d she said, giggling.</p><p>\u201cA monster who terrorizes the populations of India, as I understand. Or perhaps it was Turkey. Honestly, I hardly know, but I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe must stop her,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to crush a pearl on such a pretext.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJust look how she\u2019s making the Duke of Villiers laugh,\u201d Roland said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s quite taken with her. If you take the pearls away, you\u2019ll ruin her chance of making a match that would free my brother from his bondage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I expect he would. She\u2019s quite beautiful, you know. And the odd thing about her is that she\u2019s not a bad person. He won\u2019t know what she\u2019s really like until it\u2019s too late. She has enormous charm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Eleanor said, feeling guilty. \u201cAnd she can be so joyful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPity she\u2019d be such a horror to live with.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess had apparently just realized what was about to happen. She put down her tea cup with a little click, rose from her chair and snatched the pearls before Lisette could react. \u201cAm I to understand that you are planning to crush these pearls?\u201d she said in an awful voice.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lisette said, as blissfully unaware as ever. \u201cYou see, Your Grace, we are wondering how hard it is to crush a pearl. The Duke of Villiers thinks that Roland would smash a pearl under his feet. But I don\u2019t agree. He used to be roly-poly, but he\u2019s not at all plump any longer.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor turned to Roland with a grin, but his brows were drawn together and his face looked black with fury. Villiers, on the other hand, was laughing openly. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard him laughing, she thought sourly. I should have assumed it would be at someone else\u2019s expense.</p><p>Lisette held out her hand for the pearls, her pretty smile not even slipping. It was a quality that Eleanor envied. Because Lisette never envisioned opposition to one of her plans, she didn\u2019t flinch until the moment was upon her.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d the duchess announced in a dreadful voice. \u201cI have seen your mother in these pearls a hundred times.\u201d</p><p>Lisette blinked. \u201cMother is dead. She doesn\u2019t care what I do to them now.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHer memory is not dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re my pearls,\u201d Lisette said, her lower lip starting to tremble.</p><p>\u201cHere we go,\u201d Roland murmured.</p><p>Eleanor couldn\u2019t bear to see it happen. She jumped to her feet and hurried to Lisette\u2019s side. \u201cWe just want to make sure that your pearls remain intact,\u201d she said as persuasively as she could.</p><p>But Lisette\u2019s eyes were taking on that wild spark that Eleanor remembered. \u201cYou are crossing me!\u201d she cried, rounding on the duchess.</p><p>\u201cOf course I am!\u201d she snapped back. \u201cYour mother was one of my dearest friends.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor braced herself.</p><p>Villiers stepped forward and put a hand on Lisette\u2019s arm. She froze. \u201cHer Grace doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d His voice was dark and cool and mesmerizing. \u201cWhen my mother died I wanted to burn her clothing. Her jewelry. Her scarves.\u201d</p> <p>Lisette stood still. Even as Eleanor watched, Lisette shed her anger and her eyes turned grief-stricken.</p><p>\u201cI know how you feel,\u201d he finished.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s lip trembled. \u201cI miss my mother,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Eleanor retreated back to her seat.</p><p>\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d Roland said in her ear, \u201can innocent bystander might think that Lisette\u2019s mother died a year or two ago.\u201d</p><p>But Eleanor was watching Villiers. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you get over the death of your mother all that easily.\u201d Though she wasn\u2019t actually sure that Villiers meant to express grief when he talked of burning his mother\u2019s clothing. There was a shade of something darker in his voice.</p><p>\u201cWould you like to hear a song?\u201d Roland asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eleanor said, noticing that Lisette\u2019s white-blond curls just reached Villiers\u2019s shoulder; they looked quite striking together.</p><p>Roland looked down at her, his dark poet\u2019s eyes flaring. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing Lisette and I have in common. We both love music. If I borrow a lute\u201d\u2014he nodded at the far wall\u2014\u201cat least it will halt the tender scene. Though in my opinion Villiers\u2019s days as a bachelor are numbered. And his days of peace as well, but there\u2019s no need for us to play witnesses to that tragedy.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor thought about confessing her own semi-betrothed state and decided not to. Besides, Roland was already striding over to the wall and pulling down a lute.</p><p>He plucked a string and then called, \u201cLisette, you\u2019ve let this go out of tune again!\u201d</p><p>She leaped away from Villiers the moment the note sounded in the air, sadness falling from her like a discarded cloak. \u201cI played that one earlier this evening,\u201d she said, running to his side.</p><p>\u201cI suppose it\u2019s not too bad,\u201d Roland allowed, sitting down, the better to tune the instrument.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s face brimmed with happiness. \u201cLet\u2019s all sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am fatigued,\u201d the duchess announced.</p><p>She retired with little more than brief goodbyes to the squire and his wife. She didn\u2019t care for music any more than she appreciated poetry. It turned out that the squire\u2019s lady shared her lack of appreciation, and so the elder couple left, promising to send the coach back for their son.</p><p>It occurred to Eleanor as she curtsied goodbye that Squire Thestle\u2019s smile seemed to indicate hope that his son would make an advantageous match. With herself. She felt a bit more sober at the thought.</p><p>\u201cA lute, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Anne said, falling into the seat next to Eleanor that Roland had deserted. \u201cYour medieval lover is far too passionate for me. I feel as if I\u2019m caught in some sort of Shakespearean nightmare.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA glass of anisette?\u201d Popper said, offering a tray of small glasses.</p><p>\u201cIf I drink that I\u2019ll fall asleep in public,\u201d Anne said, pulling herself upright. \u201cNo, I\u2019m for bed.\u201d She looked down at Eleanor, a wry smile on her lips. \u201cHow complicated is the game of love, wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShakespeare?\u201d Eleanor inquired.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest,\u201d Anne said, taking herself off to bed.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>\u201cOh lovely, all the old people are gone,\u201d Lisette said gaily. \u201cLet\u2019s sing outside, on the terrace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t we keep people awake?\u201d Eleanor asked, sipping her anisette. It tasted like distilled licorice root, strong and sweet, with a sensual promise.</p><p>There was no gainsaying Lisette, of course. A moment later the four of them were outside. Light streamed from the library, but the terrace itself was in shadow. The air was warm and fragrant, like evening primroses.</p><p>Lisette had brought out another lute and she and Roland were seated together, so Eleanor made for the settee where she and Anne had sat that afternoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers had been leaning against the stone railing, but when Lisette and Roland began to sing, he joined her.</p><p>For a few moments they just listened. The lutes had a tremulous sound, as if notes were barely shaped before they slipped away. \u201cWho spoke to death?\u201d Lisette sang, high and clear and beautiful. \u201cLet no one speak of death,\u201d Roland answered her. His voice was a silky honey-smooth tenor that wove around hers. \u201cWhat should death do in such a merry house?\u201d they sang together.</p><p>Eleanor took another sip of her anisette and leaned her head back. Far above their heads the stars shone like silver buttons on a dandy\u2019s waistcoat.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she said to Villiers.</p> <p>\u201cPearls,\u201d he said laconically. \u201cCrushed to make stardust.\u201d</p><p>She turned to meet his eyes and choked back a laugh.</p><p>\u201cLet death go elsewhere\u2014\u201d Lisette sang, and broke off at Roland\u2019s impatient gesture.</p><p>\u201cYou have the fingering wrong again. Listen.\u201d He played the refrain again. And again.</p><p>\u201cYou look extremely beautiful tonight,\u201d Villiers said suddenly.</p> <p>\u201cMe?\u201d Then she remembered that Anne had painted her beautiful and smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are driving the poor poet mad with desire.\u201d</p><p>Villiers was looking at her so coolly that she didn\u2019t know what he thought of Roland\u2019s admiration. Perhaps he was suggesting that she might like to marry Roland instead of himself? She took another drink and the liqueur burned down her throat. It sang to her of confidence and passion, of men who would never leave her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to kiss Roland,\u201d she said, \u201cbefore I make a final decision.\u201d</p><p>It was only when he made a small incredulous noise in the back of his throat that she realized she had been less than clear. \u201cBefore I decide whether to marry him instead of you,\u201d she clarified.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll decide on the basis of a kiss? His kiss?\u201d A strand or two of Villiers\u2019s hair had fallen from its ribbon and swung near the curve of his jaw. It wasn\u2019t a poet\u2019s jaw. It was a harsh, male jaw, the kind belonging to a man likely to issue decrees. And feel that women should pay attention to his proclamations.</p> <p>Roland and Lisette had started singing again, something about love this time. \u201cI made the prince my slave,\u201d they sang together. \u201cHe was my lord for the space of a moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe space of a moon, my arse,\u201d Villiers said into her ear.</p><p>Eleanor started. She hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d moved close to her.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t they just sing what they mean: I tupped him for a month?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a frown.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll decide whether to marry me on the basis of his kiss?\u201d His words were a low growl, and hung on the air.</p><p>\u201cI put a ring on his finger and brought him to my house,\u201d Lisette sang, and Roland joined in: \u201cI clothed him in hyacinth and fed him honey-berries.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor let her head fall back and examined the hyacinth-colored sky. Villiers made a small movement next to her, and she felt a surge of power. She knew exactly what to do. She turned her head, just slightly. She didn\u2019t even smile at him; she just allowed the invitation to be in her eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAre you playing the siren with me?\u201d he asked, his voice low, almost incredulous.</p><p>\u201cOnly for the space of the moon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou surprise me,\u201d he said, bending toward her. His lips tasted of anisette, like spice and like a man. She opened her mouth, remembering instantly how delicious a kiss could be. How the touch of lips could change the whole feeling of her body. She leaned toward him and gave him everything he wanted.</p><p>And he took it.</p><p>She realized, in the first second after their kiss began, that Villiers would always take what he wanted. He crushed her mouth, cupping her face in his hands and pulling her toward him.</p><p>Dimly, she thought how different this first kiss was from the one she had shared with Gideon, years ago. They were young and unpracticed. Gideon fumbled; she giggled; he apologized. It soon became clear that she enjoyed kissing far more than he did.</p><p>Probably all young men were the same: eager, driven by lust. He longed to touch; she longed to kiss.</p><p>She remembered chasing him around the barn once, trying to catch and kiss him, until he suddenly turned around and snatched her up, his hands falling on her\u2014</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d a dark voice said in her ear.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, startled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m kissing you, damn it.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him, confused. In the light falling through the windows behind them, Villiers\u2019s eyes looked black. Eyelashes shaded his cheekbone, putting it into high relief. \u201cI was thinking of something else,\u201d she said honestly.</p><p>He stared at her for a second and then let out a howl of laughter that punctuated the singing she barely heard. \u201cBetween you and Tobias, I\u2019m achieving a modicum of humility, for the first time in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I doubt,\u201d she observed.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. \u201cI suppose you were thinking of Astley.\u201d</p><p>She felt a little dazed, as if the liqueur had gone to her head, and she couldn\u2019t follow what he was talking about so she just shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I punctured your vanity,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cIt was a nice kiss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNice?\u201d</p><p>He sounded incredulous. Apparently the Duke of Villiers was accustomed to women falling at his feet after one touch of his lips. \u201cYou taste like anise,\u201d she said, settling back into her position. \u201cI\u2019m very fond of licorice. Did you ever find the plants and chew them when you were little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head slightly, just enough so she could meet his eyes again. Of course he hadn\u2019t wandered about fields grazing on wild plants. He was likely swathed in velvet from his toes to his collarbone from age five. No, four.</p><p>\u201cOf whom were you thinking?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas it Astley?\u201d There was something dangerous in his tone.</p><p>She took another sip of anisette. It slid sweet and hot down her throat, adding to the heat in her insides that had jumped to life with his lips. And that was making her nervous. She had now kissed two men in her life, Gideon and Villiers. Both of them made her feel slightly delirious, wild with pleasure, wanting nothing more than to kiss again and again.</p><p>She had the uncomfortable feeling that she was a wagtail by nature. Her mother would not approve. \u201cIn truth, it was the Duke of Astley,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cHe is pretty. A maiden\u2019s dream, in fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was my dream,\u201d she confessed. In the background, Lisette and Roland were quarreling over a musical notation of some sort or other. \u201cAfter his father died, he started coming home with my brother during holidays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom Eton.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly. I never really paid much attention to him, but then one day...well, there he was.\u201d</p><p>It was embarrassing the way that Villiers\u2019s lips made her want to lean over and\u2014and nip him. Lick him.</p><p>\u201cWhat then?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cOh, it took us months to kiss,\u201d Eleanor said lightly. \u201cThough I spent a great deal of time dreaming about it. It\u2019s quite common to fall in love at that age.\u201d</p><p>He nodded, rather unexpectedly. Eleanor couldn\u2019t imagine the Duke of Villiers in love with anyone. \u201cYou?\u201d she asked. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy the surprise?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, the dukeness of you,\u201d she said with a wave of her hand, wondering if she might have drunk a bit too much.

My preference is for less revealing clothing.\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p> <p>\u201cDid Bess return your affection?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could she not?\u201d he asked. There was something hard in his voice. \u201cI was already a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat needn\u2019t have\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted. \u201cBelieve me, the barmaid who turns down a duke should be cast in bronze.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d Eleanor said tartly. \u201cYou have a distorted idea of your own consequence.\u201d A thought occurred to her. \u201cIs Bess the mother of one of your children?\u201d</p><p>The edge of his mouth quirked, sending a blaze of heat down Eleanor\u2019s legs.</p> <p>\u201cMy children really don\u2019t bother you, do they?\u201d</p><p>She considered that. \u201cShould they, on moral grounds? Religious? Ethical?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny of the above.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI myself would prefer to have tidier domestic relations,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see that it\u2019s any of my business if you don\u2019t agree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you are marrying me,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cOr so you said.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor reached out and took his glass of anisette. He had barely tasted it, after all. \u201cPerhaps. An announcement before my mother is hardly a commitment. Either of us may decide that we would rather marry another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would consider our betrothal a tentative one?\u201d</p><p>She glanced deliberately at Roland. He looked like the embodiment of a medieval troubadour, dark and dreamy, singing of love. She listened for a moment. He was actually singing about a widow marrying her sixth husband, but the principle was the same. He sang. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you sing?\u201d she suggested.</p> <p>\u201cNever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she sighed.</p><p>\u201cBess is not the mother of any of my children,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d Eleanor said agreeably.</p><p>\u201cShe fell in love with a much prettier fellow.\u201d</p><p>She considered his face. He was not pretty, not by any stretch of the imagination. Everything about him was just slightly rough-hewn, aggressive, male. Too male. He made embarrassing ideas float through her head. As if the Duke of Villiers would suddenly swoop on her, push her down on the settee, and throw himself on top of her. \u201cI thought a duke\u2019s precedence was all-important,\u201d she said hastily.</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Beaumont stole her from me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoodness,\u201d Eleanor said, smiling. \u201cLucky Bess! Chased by two dukes. Do tell me that you fought a romantic duel?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing romantic about duels,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cBut no. I had no claim over her, you see. I had completely lost my head. But a young man\u2019s adoration was no match for Beaumont\u2019s Adonis-like profile.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose Beaumont is handsome,\u201d she agreed. Not as handsome as Gideon, in her opinion, but good-looking enough. Still, he always looked so tired that it was hard to imagine him young.</p><p>\u201cYou are practically the first woman I\u2019ve spoken to who doesn\u2019t rhapsodize over Beaumont\u2019s face,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>She glanced at his nose and looked away again. She could hardly admit that Gideon had soured her interest in beautiful men. To the point to which she felt far more attracted to Villiers\u2019s sort of rough-hewn looks.</p><p>\u201cAnd yet I suppose that Astley is even more beautiful than Beaumont, to your eyes?\u201d Villiers asked, uncannily echoing her thoughts.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cMore golden, more sleek, more attractive in every way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eleanor agreed. She took another drink of Villiers\u2019s anisette.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and the sharp edge dropped from his voice. He actually sounded sympathetic.</p><p>\u201cIt was years ago,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cIf you still think of him while kissing another man, then it hasn\u2019t been long enough.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think how to refute that, but at that moment she looked up to see Lisette sling her lute at Roland\u2019s head. Roland threw himself sideways and at the same time managed to put up a hand and catch the lute.</p><p>\u201cYou wretched little\u2014\u201d he hollered.</p><p>Lisette opened her mouth to scream back, cast a look toward Eleanor and Villiers, and ran into the library.</p><p>It all happened so quickly that she was gone by the time Villiers looked around.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Roland said, walking toward them. \u201cWhen two musicians come together, we lose sense of time. Even worse, we sometimes lose our heads.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt her cheeks growing pink. She certainly had forgotten their presence during Villiers\u2019s kiss.</p><p>\u201cYour music played so sweetly on the night air that we all lost track of time,\u201d Villiers said at her shoulder.</p><p>Roland glanced at him. \u201cShakespeare on music. I gather that\u2019s part of If music be the food of love, play on, etcetera? Is that from A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually no,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThe beginning of Twelfth Night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate those old plays,\u201d Roland said to Eleanor with a comical grin. \u201cSo stuffy and antiquated. You have no idea how hard it can be to make older people realize that fresh material can be so much better.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t glance at Villiers, but she felt an irresistible urge to smile. Obviously he had seen them kiss.</p><p>\u201cWe old people generally go to bed with the chickens,\u201d Villiers said, without a trace of resentment in his voice.</p><p>\u201cAh well, I certainly didn\u2019t mean that comparison,\u201d Roland said, leaving in doubt exactly what comparison he had meant. \u201cLady Eleanor, may I call for you tomorrow? I would love to show you the countryside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d Villiers said genially, taking on the demeanor of a kindly uncle. \u201cYou young people ought to trot about on horses while the rest of us are taking our morning constitutional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would be happy to see you again, Sir Roland,\u201d Eleanor said, holding out her hand.</p><p>He fell back into a flourishing bow, raising her hand to his lips and holding it there for a long moment. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, meeting her eyes.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t leave those lutes,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Roland\u2019s bow to the duke was extremely brief, barely more than the kind of bob Eleanor had seen irate footmen give to a butler.</p><p>Villiers leaned back on the settee as if there was no question about the fact that they would stay there, unchaperoned. \u201cI didn\u2019t see what happened to Lisette, did you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eleanor thought of the jerky violence with which Lisette had swung the lute. \u201cI believe she was irritated by something Roland said.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can certainly understand that. I would suggest that Sir Roland\u2019s manner could be considered a far more reliable guide to matrimony than might his kisses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Suddenly the stars seemed much closer, now that there were only the two of them outside together. The night air was velvety and warm on her skin.</p><p>\u201cIf I were married to him, it would be about a week before I pushed one of his pompous, artistic poems down his throat,\u201d Villiers said with a perfect lack of expression, which made his comment hilarious.</p> <p>Eleanor burst into laughter. \u201cYou hurt his feelings with that twaddle about Shakespeare. It could be that he\u2019ll be a great writer someday, you know.\u201d</p><p>Villiers leaned a little closer. \u201cDropping the tiresome poet from the conversation, I don\u2019t think I want my marriage decided by a kiss that includes the Duke of Astley as an unknowing partner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought of Gideon for only a moment.\u201d Her treacherous heart sped up a bit.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you kiss me this time? Perhaps that will help to focus your attention on the man before you.\u201d</p><p>Of course she could kiss him. She was good at kissing, and those dalliances with Gideon weren\u2019t all that many years ago. So she leaned forward and kissed him with all the persuasive power that she\u2019d polished with Gideon. Her lips slipped along his, begged him for entrance.</p> <p>His lips didn\u2019t move.</p><p>She swallowed a little humiliation, leaned farther forward so he could see her bosom if he wished.</p><p>Gideon always closed his eyes when she kissed him, but Villiers kept his open. And to her dismay, he seemed to be looking at her with amusement rather than raw desire.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I like being kissed. That was as boring as my kiss, the one that drove you to start dreaming about Astley.\u201d</p><p>Gideon hadn\u2019t liked her kisses all that much either. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said, moving back and feeling around for her wrap. \u201cI really should go to\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say I didn\u2019t like kissing you,\u201d he interrupted.</p><p>\u201cYes, you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like being kissed.\u201d And with that rather cryptic statement he reached across and pulled her against his chest.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s arms went instinctively around his neck. But she didn\u2019t have time to think before his hands laced into her hair and his mouth took hers. He didn\u2019t beg or seduce. He invaded. He took her mouth hard, with a kind of concentrated lust and fever, and she knew exactly why all those women had never said no to him.</p><p>It didn\u2019t have anything to do with his ducal crest, as he seemed to think. It was the moment when the immaculately dressed, starched and beruffled duke suddenly turned wild, his mouth hot on hers, his hands gripping her hard.</p><p>This kiss was unlike any she\u2019d shared with Gideon. There was nothing sweet about Villiers\u2019s kiss. And Villiers didn\u2019t feel like the right way to think about him.</p><p>She broke free and his lips slid, hot, across her cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d she whispered, knowing it perfectly well. Leopold was too accustomed to women\u2019s avid attempts to claim intimacy with him. He was spoiled by too much adoration.</p><p>He said it against her lips. \u201cYou do remember my title?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t care about your title any more than\u2014\u201d But she didn\u2019t want to talk, so she turned toward his mouth again, starving as a new-born chick. He made a growling sound in his throat, and their tongues tangled. She was shaking, she thought dimly, pushing her fingers into his hair and pulling it free of its ribbon so that it slid like rough silk across her skin.</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d he said.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t listening because she was burning, breathless.</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She turned her mouth, wanting more of him, not words.</p><p>\u201cYou are a surprise,\u201d he said a moment later, pulling back again.</p><p>Men never wanted to kiss as long as she did, she thought, and then pulled herself together. \u201cA surprise?\u201d</p><p>Instinctively she knew instantly that she had to\u2014must\u2014cover up the extent to which she was unable to think because of this craving. For him. For this man who was looking at her with absolute self-possession, pulling his hair back and swiftly retying its ribbon. Apparently the duke didn\u2019t tolerate being unkempt for long.</p><p>She managed a shrug. \u201cBecause I enjoy your kisses? Since you imply that every woman falls prey to the ducal title, how do you know that I\u2019m not belatedly captivated simply by your crest?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you? After all...I am the second duke with whom you\u2019ve cavorted, if we count Astley. And I think we must count Astley, mustn\u2019t we?\u201d</p><p>There was just the subtlest insinuation to his voice. \u201cI was in love with Gideon,\u201d she said, not bothering to try to fix her own hair. It was probably a mess, but she refused to care. Instead she picked up the anisette, but it tasted sickly sweet now, and she put it down after it had barely touched her tongue. \u201cI suspect that I loved him more than you loved Bess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine how we would determine such a thing,\u201d Villiers\u2014no, Leopold\u2014said.</p><p>\u201cI wanted to marry him,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI thought we would marry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I surmised. Since I can\u2019t imagine that Astley chose his languid wife over you, I gather that fate intervened.\u201d</p><p>The pleasure of that compliment warmed her. \u201cFate in the form of his father\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI expect you did love him more than I loved Bess, then,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cFor I never thought to marry her. I was infatuated with her laugh. She had a wonderful chuckle. I wanted all her laughter for myself.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor raised an eyebrow. \u201cI would have thought that most young men felt possessive about other attributes of bonny Bess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I wanted those too,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cYou mean you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d She stopped.</p><p>\u201cElijah intervened before my adoration of Bess could lead me to convince myself that I should offer her money,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I merely stood about the inn adoring her, and never thought about money until it was too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cElijah, of course, didn\u2019t need to offer money because he was so very pretty.\u201d</p><p>He would hate sympathy, but she felt a flash of it anyway, followed by a wave of rage at stupid Bess for following the luscious Duke of Beaumont wherever he willed her. Presumably to Beaumont\u2019s bed.</p><p>\u201cI must take another look at Beaumont in the future. I\u2019m afraid that I always dismissed him\u2014he has that tiresome puritanical look\u2014but now that I know he stole your barmaid\u2019s attentions...\u201d</p><p>He laughed, and Eleanor liked the sound. \u201cYour problem is not choosing between myself and Beaumont, but choosing between myself and young Roland.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yours,\u201d she countered, \u201chas nothing to do with a barmaid. Instead you are faced by two nubile daughters of dukes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I should consider Lisette?\u201d</p><p>She knew perfectly well that he was considering Lisette. She\u2019d seen the way he watched her, with a kind of fascination, as if she were a fairy plaything. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s exquisite,\u201d she said. \u201cI would marry her, too.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at the detachment in her voice. With luck, that meant he hadn\u2019t guessed that she was lusting after him with embarrassing heat.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t marry a woman for her beauty,\u201d Villiers said. She caught just a trace, just the smallest trace, of the unlovely boy thrown over for his handsome friend. \u201cI need a mother for my children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette loves children,\u201d Eleanor said, meaning it. \u201cShe truly loves them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can tell. And she does so much work with those orphans. I believe that she wouldn\u2019t be put off by illegitimacy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not. Lisette would never think twice about a person\u2019s origins.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe could teach them to care as little about society as she does,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cI asked her why she was never presented, for example, and she just laughed. She didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette has never cared for convention. It\u2019s not in her nature to kow-tow to someone because he is of high rank.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen that in Quakers. But never in a woman of the aristocracy. It\u2019s unexpectedly alluring.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eleanor said, gathering her wrap. \u201cLisette is definitely alluring.\u201d She was not going to say anything about Lisette\u2019s inability to care for anything for very long. Or, for that matter, about her betrothal.</p><p>\u201cDo you really mean it?\u201d he said. Now he didn\u2019t look like a Leopold any longer: she was faced once more by the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>\u201cMean what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we might treat our betrothal as something of a...temporary state, perhaps to be dissolved by either of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI am certainly looking forward to Roland\u2019s visit tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo he is Roland. And I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d she said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t like that. His gray eyes turned cold, and she was glad that Roland had made an appearance, glad that she didn\u2019t care too much.</p><p>\u201cYou are the Duke of Villiers,\u201d she told him.</p><p>That glare of his probably withered other people. Those who cared more.</p><p>But she was determined not to care\u2014in fact, never to care that much about any man again, she reminded herself. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that I\u2019m not interested in marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call me Leopold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps, if we decide to marry,\u201d she said, standing up. \u201cBut I think that you are far more Villiers than you are Leopold. My mother always calls my father by his title.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd yet you refer to Roland by his first name.\u201d</p> <p>She took her time winding her wrap around her breasts, even though Villiers had never given her the satisfaction of knowing that he was looking at them. \u201cRoland is a Roland,\u201d she said finally.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m a Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette is a Lisette,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely, flirtatious name, perfect for someone with flyaway curls and a giggle.\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow at that description. \u201cRemind me not to cross you. Does your name suit you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Eleanor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certainly an Eleanor.\u201d Or at least she was from her mother\u2019s point of view.</p><p>\u201cEleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, and Queen of England,\u201d he said, sounding amused again.</p><p>That didn\u2019t make her amused, so she said her good-night and retired to her chamber.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 18, 1784</p><p>Villiers never woke early in the morning. Finchley, his valet, knew better than to even appear at his door before eleven. His ideal day consisted of playing chess most of the afternoon and then making love most of the night. He never paid calls, and he had discovered as a youth that a gift for chess translated into a gift for numbers; he gave his estate manager an hour a week, and within a few years his net worth had grown to one of the greatest in England.</p><p>He pulled himself out of sleep thinking that someone was beating down the door, only to suppose groggily that rain was crashing against his window. A moment later he realized that mere rain couldn\u2019t be causing that amount of noise. The window seemed about to shatter.</p><p>It must be hail. The worst hailstorm to hit southern England in years.</p><p>Villiers threw back the covers, fought his way through the bed hangings, and staggered out of bed.</p><p>Another blast of hail hit the window, shaking it so hard that the drapes actually shuddered. He walked over to the waiting basin of water and thrust his face into it. Then he straightened up and shook himself, chilly droplets flying in all directions. Finally he pulled back the drapes, expecting a sour gray light.</p><p>But instead there was sunshine. He closed his eyes and raked his hands through his hair. No hail. That implied...</p><p>He grabbed his towel and wound it around his waist, unlatched the door, pushed it open and stepped onto the stone balcony that looked over the gardens.</p><p>A thirteen-year-old boy was standing on the grass below, eyes bright.</p><p>\u201cFor Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Villiers snarled, squinting down at Tobias. \u201cWhat hour is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLate,\u201d Tobias said cheerfully. \u201cYou don\u2019t have any clothing on.\u201d</p><p>He leaned against the balustrade and stared down at his progeny. \u201cWhat in hell\u2019s name do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWaking you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know which window was mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLisette? Lady Lisette told you which window to throw rocks at? You could have broken the glass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, she threw quite a lot of them,\u201d Tobias allowed. \u201cShe just went around to the side of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening out here?\u201d came a smoky voice.</p><p>He actually started. Eleanor wandered from her window onto what he now understood was a shared balcony\u2014her chamber, it appeared, was next to his. Unlike him, she was swathed in some sort of thick wrapper that went from her collarbone to her toes.</p><p>Yet her clothing didn\u2019t matter. There was something about her that made him want to nibble her all over. It had to be the dissolute appeal of her. Her hair tumbled down her back, not in pretty ringlets, but in the kind of wild disarray that a man wants to find falling around his face as he thrusts up and\u2014</p><p>Villiers jerked his mind away, suddenly aware that his towel had tented in front.</p><p>Now Eleanor, too, had discovered that they shared a balcony. She didn\u2019t turn a hair at the idea that he was practically naked. No blushing. The corner of her mouth tipped up and she looked him over, so fast that he would have missed it if he hadn\u2019t been watching her at precisely that moment.</p><p>Villiers had no problem being surveyed. He had no illusions about the beauty of his face. His title and money brought women to his bed, but his body kept them there.</p><p>But Eleanor turned away as if he were no more interesting than a grasshopper and called down to Tobias. \u201cYou\u2019re cracked if you think someone like the duke is going to get up this early.\u201d</p><p>Tobias smiled, a bit shyly. \u201cWe thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe?\u201d Eleanor asked, straightening up.</p><p>\u201cLady Lisette thought that the duke might like to go riding,\u201d Tobias said. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCan you imagine the duke on a horse without being dressed head to foot in gold lace?\u201d Eleanor said mockingly. She glanced at him for a split second, but he felt it like a caress. \u201cYour father takes so long to get dressed that the sun would be going down by the time he emerged from his chamber.\u201d</p><p>She had said just the right thing. Villiers watched Tobias\u2019s grin get bigger. He was a fool to hope that it was the words your father that made the boy crack a smile. Tobias was too serious.</p><p>He leaned back against the balustrade again and deliberately crossed his arms, because it made his muscles look even larger and he had the feeling that Eleanor liked muscles. Thank God, there was no way that Tobias could see the tent in his towel from below.</p><p>He moved his legs apart a bit, just in case she wanted to take another look. Obviously nothing would shock the woman.</p> <p>\u201cAm I to understand that you think I couldn\u2019t be ready in less time than you?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She didn\u2019t look at him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Lisette?\u201d she called down to Tobias.</p><p>Villiers moved away from the edge of the balcony. He didn\u2019t mind showing some skin to Eleanor. But Lisette was a gently bred lady, with a kind of innocence that made her eyes shine with a deep-down purity.</p><p>Eleanor was leaning over the balustrade now, bantering with Tobias. Her bottom was very round under her thick robe. She was the antithesis of innocent. She made a man long to wake her up early enough so they could step out on the balcony with the first dawn light\u2014</p><p>He wrenched his mind away again and readjusted his towel. This was becoming painful. It was rather fascinating to imagine how Eleanor became the woman she was, given that her mother seemed altogether wedded to convention.</p> <p>Whereas Lisette, who seemed to be living more or less without a chaperone, was clearly untouched by the baser passions of the body.</p><p>\u201cWomen take much more time to dress than do men,\u201d he told Eleanor, deciding that he ought to give her one more chance to look him over before he returned to his chamber.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not most men,\u201d she said flatly. She did turn to face him, but her eyes stayed on his face rather than dropping lower. There was just a tinge of rosy color in her cheeks. Good.</p><p>He widened his stance again, daring her to look down. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019m not like other men,\u201d he said.</p><p>Eleanor choked with laughter. \u201cBecause your sense of consequence is bigger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd the rest of me too,\u201d he said, wondering if he\u2019d lost his mind. The Duke of Villiers never traded bawdy quips on a balcony. He never\u2014ever\u2014flirted.</p> <p>\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Eleanor said saucily.</p><p>He bit back a grin. The Duke of Villiers didn\u2019t smile in the morning. He squinted at the sky. \u201cWhat time is it, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look so afraid. I assure you that the sun isn\u2019t made out of green cheese,\u201d she said to him. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s around eight o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEight!\u201d He shuddered.</p><p>\u201cLeopold!\u201d came a clear voice from the lawn. \u201cWould you like to join us on an excursion?\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked cautiously over the balcony, trying to keep his body out of sight. Lisette was the very picture of an English lady. Curls crested on her head like a frothy wave; her eyes shone brightly; she was wearing an enchanting riding habit.</p><p>\u201cHello!\u201d she called, waving her hand at him. \u201cTime to rise and shine, Leopold!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, Leopold,\u201d Eleanor said in a low, mocking voice. \u201cDo start to shine, please. I think I saw the rising, but I definitely missed the shining.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs you said, there is a great deal of me that remains to be seen,\u201d he said silkily, loving their verbal jousting.</p><p>Even though he never engaged in anything as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as a flirtation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t join you,\u201d he said, raising his voice as he replied to Lisette.</p><p>She pouted. \u201cNo! Why on earth not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to pay a visit to the orphanage in Sevenoaks as soon as I am dressed.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth formed a perfect rosebud. A confused rosebud. \u201cWhy on earth do you need to do that? The orphans will return this afternoon, I assure you. A group of them come every afternoon to work on the play, though now we\u2019ve turned it to a treasure hunt.\u201d</p><p>One couldn\u2019t help but admire her devotion to those poor children. But the fact that two of them might be his own made him edgy. Still, he couldn\u2019t figure out exactly how to answer.</p><p>Eleanor broke in. \u201cThe duke is thinking of sponsoring the orphanage,\u201d she called down to Lisette. \u201cHe\u2019s quite charitable, you know. I\u2019ve heard tell that he\u2019s peopled his very own orphanage.\u201d</p><p>Tobias snorted, but Lisette\u2019s smile didn\u2019t waver. \u201cI am thinking of doing that as well,\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cOccasionally I have thought that the orphans are too thin, and wondered if they were well cared for. But I am assured that they eat sufficiently. If I had my own orphanage, I would make certain that they were offered only the foods they preferred.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I shall tour the orphanage this morning,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cWe shall come with you!\u201d Lisette said, clapping her hands. \u201cDo you know, I\u2019ve never toured the building? The children simply come to me, whenever I request it. I should like to see their dear little beds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cWe shall all go to the orphanage this morning. Lisette...Tobias.\u201d She walked back into her room without saying goodbye to Villiers, which didn\u2019t sit well with him.</p><p>He scowled and didn\u2019t even realize that Lisette was cheerily calling him to meet her in the breakfast room until Eleanor had already left. At least Lisette understood that one didn\u2019t simply turn away from a duke.</p><p>He turned to enter his chamber.</p><p>\u201cHey!\u201d</p><p>Hey? Could it be that someone was addressing him such? He turned, reluctantly. After all, he knew the voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to go to the orphanage and poke around?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPoke?\u201d he said, staring down at Tobias. \u201cWhat on earth would you look around for?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see what it\u2019s like. I\u2019ve heard stories about that sort of place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStories about orphanages?\u201d Villiers\u2019s jaw tightened but he pushed the thought away. Of course his children were fine. For one thing, Lisette saw to the orphans\u2019 welfare herself. But Tobias had an awkward eagerness to him, as if he were a setter on a leash. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said.</p><p>Tobias gave a sharp nod and set off.</p><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Villiers bellowed. And then, feeling very queer to be saying it, he asked: \u201cHave you broken your fast?\u201d</p><p>Tobias cast him a look of absolute scorn. \u201cI\u2019m in the nursery,\u201d he said. \u201cI was offered gruel at six this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGruel? They made you eat gruel?\u201d</p><p>He gave a sharp burst of laughter. \u201cI don\u2019t eat that! The footman brought me a meat pasty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope you tipped him.\u201d Villiers paused. \u201cDo you have any money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks to you,\u201d Tobias said, but without anger. \u201cAshmole gave me some. I\u2019ll be off now.\u201d And he was gone.</p><p>Villiers dressed meditatively, but with speed. In the last month he had gained some experience in dealing with the class of persons who cared for indigent children. With the intent of inspiring awe, if not fear, he chose a riding costume of a deep scarlet, with buttonholes picked out in gold thread. His breeches buttoned tightly to the side of his knee; his hussar buskin boots gleamed, and more importantly, each sported a tassel of French silk. He pulled back his hair and tied it with a scarlet ribbon. Finally he slid on his heavy signet ring and belted on his sword stick. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Some minutes later, Lisette sat beside him in the carriage, chattering like a magpie about the children, the treasure hunt, and about Mrs. Minchem, who ran the orphanage.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Minchem?\u201d Eleanor inquired. \u201cI don\u2019t like that name.\u201d</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t like it much either.</p><p>Lisette was off in a peal of laughter. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge people by their names, silly Eleanor!\u201d she said. \u201cWhy, think if we were to judge you by the name Eleanor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat of it?\u201d Eleanor said, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>But Lisette galloped ahead. \u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy name, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you think so, Leopold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a queen\u2019s name,\u201d he said. \u201cA chaste name.\u201d He didn\u2019t look at Eleanor. \u201cYes, I think it sounds like the kind of queen who is locked in a tower and never allowed to fall in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s sad,\u201d Lisette said, her mouth drooping.</p><p>\u201cWhereas your name is as pretty as you are,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eleanor\u2019s eyes narrowed and he realized too late that he had inadvertently implied that Lisette was prettier than Eleanor. Lisette was prettier than Eleanor, but since Eleanor had that sultry ladybird look, no red-blooded man in the vicinity of the two of them would want Lisette over Eleanor. Eleanor was bewitching.</p><p>He could hardly point that out, though, so he just leaned forward as the carriage jolted to a halt and examined the orphanage\u2019s fa\u00e7ade. It was big enough, but it looked like a mausoleum. He\u2019d been in a number of orphanages and children\u2019s workhouses in the last two months, and had yet to see one that he\u2019d want to live in.</p><p>Not that the question was really important. He was a duke. He\u2019d never even noticed the many places he wouldn\u2019t want to live in before, so why was he giving a second thought to the issue now?</p><p>He was still thinking about the many unpleasantries that dukes never contemplate when his footman announced them to the orphanage\u2019s headmistress.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem, unfortunately, lived up to her evocative name. She looked like a cheese-paring, bitter woman, the kind of woman whose small mouth was more vertical than horizontal. She looked like an irate rodent. But she smiled, showing every single tooth.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d she said, dropping into a curtsy that made all the keys on her chatelaine jangle. \u201cAnd Lady Lisette, what an honor it is to welcome you to Brocklehurst Hall. Lady Eleanor, it is indeed an honor.\u201d The ribbons on top of her cap trembled with her emphatic words.</p> <p>But Villiers wondered, looking at her pinched mouth. He decided to say nothing of his children for the moment.</p><p>\u201cWe would much appreciate a tour of your establishment,\u201d he said with his most charming smile.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem wasn\u2019t stupid; she actually recoiled. There must be something in his smile, he thought, that wasn\u2019t quite as benevolent as it could have been.</p><p>\u201cDo you take both boys and girls?\u201d Eleanor asked, intervening.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem snapped the answer out as if she were being interrogated by the Watch. \u201cNo, indeed, my lady! There are no male children. Ever. This orphanage is run by a ladies\u2019 committee, and we allow orphans of the female persuasion only.\u201d</p><p>Villiers instantly felt twice as male as he had a moment ago. Lisette was drifting around the room, humming a little tune, and examining some rather dreary watercolors depicting the dells. \u201cWhat do your orphans become when they leave your establishment?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cNot that!\u201d Mrs. Minchem said. \u201cGood women is what they become.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor walked forward a step. \u201cMy dearest Mrs. Minchem, the Duke of Villiers is considering the foundation of an orphanage of his very own. He has heard such excellent things about Brocklehurst Hall from Lady Lisette that he insisted on coming here first thing this morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is rather early in the morning,\u201d Mrs. Minchem allowed, thawing slightly.</p><p>\u201cAre the orphans not awake?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course they are! They\u2019re up at four-thirty in the morning, Your Grace, with a full hour of improving prayers before they begin their day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFour-thirty. My goodness,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd a full hour of prayers before breakfast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Children learn better on an empty stomach,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said authoritatively. \u201cAfter they\u2019re fed, they\u2019re good for nothing and fall asleep on their feet.\u201d</p><p>Likely because they were up at four-thirty in the morning, Villiers thought grimly. He was starting to have a very bad feeling. And Eleanor shared it, because their eyes met, and there was a frown in hers.</p><p>\u201cWe are interested in seeing everything,\u201d Eleanor said, turning to Mrs. Minchem and smiling like a madwoman. She seemed to think that lavish charm would win admittance.</p><p>Equally clearly, Mrs. Minchem wasn\u2019t charmed. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable without the agreement of the ladies\u2019 committee,\u201d she said, jangling her huge circle of keys. \u201cThey never authorized me to allow sightseeing trips.\u201d</p><p>Lisette drifted over from the other side of the room. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about that, Mrs. Minchem,\u201d she said. \u201cI am on the committee. Don\u2019t you remember that you didn\u2019t wish the orphans to visit me until I joined the committee?\u201d</p><p>She turned to Villiers. \u201cMrs. Minchem is an absolutely wonderful headmistress for the girls. She is fiercely protective of them, which is of course exactly what she should be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would prefer to have warning before I give tours of this nature,\u201d Mrs. Minchem stated.</p><p>But Eleanor could have told her that no one gainsaid Lisette when she had made up her mind. \u201cDear, dear Mrs. Minchem,\u201d Lisette cried. \u201cYou know that I am tasked by the committee to make four visits a year. And because I do delight in having the orphans to my house, I haven\u2019t paid you a visit in...oh...three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you said you had never visited Brocklehurst Hall at all,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cAnd all the more reason that we absolutely must pay a visit today. Now.\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Minchem still looked ready to complain, so Villiers stepped in. \u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t want anyone to think that there was something untoward happening with your orphans,\u201d he said softly. \u201cSo annoying...the investigation...\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Minchem\u2019s eyelashes flickered, and she protested with real-sounding distress, \u201cBut the beds won\u2019t be made yet! The house will be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe know exactly how it will be,\u201d Lisette said, putting her hand on the woman\u2019s arm. \u201cNow you just show us their cunning little beds, Mrs. Minchem. We don\u2019t mind if they\u2019re not made up. We know that the girls need to learn to care for themselves, and I\u2019m sure that some of them are rather lazy!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are that,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said grimly. She nodded to the servant standing by the far parlor door, opposite where they entered, and he opened it.</p><p>The door opened into a perfectly ordinary corridor, lined with doors. Mrs. Minchem seemed resigned now, and she opened the first on the right. \u201cThese girls are learning to sew,\u201d she said, standing to the side. \u201cThey begin with sheets and progress to sewing a man\u2019s shirt before they leave.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Villiers followed Eleanor and Lisette into the room. A group of girls in plain white frocks were seated on a half circle of stools before a window, industriously sewing. As the door opened they sprang to their feet and formed a line.</p><p>At a signal from the eldest, the entire line dropped into a curtsy at precisely the same time.</p><p>Lisette burst into a crow of laughter. \u201cHow perfectly adorable!\u201d she cried, clapping. \u201cPlease, do it again.\u201d</p><p>With a nod from Mrs. Minchem, the girls dropped another curtsy. And another.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t curtsy individually,\u201d Eleanor said after the third round. \u201cThey dip to exactly the same distance from the floor, no matter their height. How on earth do they manage it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey train with a ruler,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said briefly, turning to go.</p><p>\u201cNo, no,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cThey must do it one more time.\u201d She clapped. \u201cCome, girls, curtsy!\u201d</p><p>Villiers felt a bit ill. The girls ranged from age five to perhaps fourteen. Every single one of them kept her eyes fixed on Mrs. Minchem, as if there were no visitors in the room at all.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem nodded.</p> <p>They all dipped to precisely the same distance and rose again.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like a dog act I saw at Bartholomew Fair,\u201d Villiers heard Lisette say to Eleanor as they left the room. It wasn\u2019t the most politic thing to say.</p><p>He was the last to leave. There were no twins in the line; he was certain of it. Although of course the twins might have been separated.</p><p>He should just ask Mrs. Minchem. But Eleanor was marching ahead, her back stiff with a kind of outrage that showed she hadn\u2019t enjoyed the dog act.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem opened the next door. She appeared to think that everything was going very well, and she seemed more relaxed. \u201cThe next group is made up of my parlor boarders, so to speak.\u201d</p><p>She tittered, but when no one responded, she explained: \u201cThese girls aren\u2019t quite orphans. That is, they are orphans in that their family cannot care for them, but they arrived with some money for their support.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow can they be orphans if they have family?\u201d Lisette asked, knitting her brow prettily.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem glanced at her and then said, \u201cI\u2019d not soil your ears with the telling, my lady. I\u2019ll just say that in many cases their fathers have handed them over with a bit of money to tide them by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery nice!\u201d Lisette said.</p><p>\u201cThe other girls pay for their own keep by making buttons and wigs,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said. \u201cBut these girls are training to become the very best ladies\u2019 maids, so they learn to be French.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Eleanor asked. \u201cDid you say that they are learning to be French?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said.</p><p>\u201cThis was one of my ideas!\u201d Lisette cried, clapping her hands again. Villiers realized that he would be quite happy if Lisette never clapped again. \u201cAll the best ladies\u2019 maids are French, aren\u2019t they? So I told Mrs. Minchem that she simply must turn some of the girls into mademoiselles.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took some doing,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said grimly. \u201cBut they\u2019ve got the trick now, and I think they\u2019ll find good places. We had to give them fancy names, of course.\u201d She opened the door.</p> <p>There were six girls, also wearing white gowns and seated in a circle, but instead of sewing, they were apparently having a tea party. As the door opened they rose to their feet, lined up, and dropped into a synchronized curtsy.</p><p>\u201cNow girls,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said heavily, \u201cdemonstrate, if you please.\u201d</p><p>The tallest girl stepped forward and curtsied before Lisette. \u201cBonjour, mademoiselle. Comment allez-vous? Votre coiffe est tr\u00e8s \u00e9l\u00e9gante.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe concentrated on three things,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said. \u201cA proper command of French, development of an appropriate accent while speaking English, and a French manner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA French manner?\u201d Eleanor asked. \u201cHow does one quantify such a thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe national character of the French is frivolous,\u201d Mrs. Minchem announced. \u201cIt is their lack of practicality that explains why they do not thrive. Nevertheless, they are very good at hair and clothing. We teach the girls to be voluble, excitable, and easily swayed by passion. Demonstrate.\u201d</p><p>At a nod from the eldest pupil, two girls stood forward.</p><p>\u201cJe m\u2019appelle Lisette-Aim\u00e9e,\u201d one said.</p><p>\u201cJe m\u2019appelle Lisette-Fleury,\u201d said the other.</p><p>\u201cHow adorable!\u201d Lisette cried. \u201cThey both have my name!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey all respond to Lisette,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said in answer to Eleanor\u2019s questioning glance. \u201cThat makes it easier for the staff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMadame! Vos souliers sont salis. Permettez-moi de les nettoyer pour vous,\u201d said the first in rapid French.</p><p>\u201cMadame! S\u2019il vous pla\u00eet, attendez. Vous ne pouvez \u00eatre vue ainsi! Votre tenue est en complet d\u00e9sordre!\u201d said the other, her voice rising.</p><p>\u201cPardonnez-moi,\u201d cried the first, collapsing into the second\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said.</p><p>The girls sprang apart and dropped into identical curtsies.</p><p>\u201cThe girls will be a credit to this establishment,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said, opening the door. \u201cWe will place them with gentlewomen in the next few months.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is something extremely bizarre about Mrs. Minchem,\u201d Eleanor said quietly to Villiers as they followed the other two down the corridor again.</p><p>\u201cDid you think that the two Lisettes at the end of the line looked alike?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>\u201cThey were not identical, and they were older than your children, no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently, my daughters are identical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen they have not been turned into Frenchwomen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank God for small favors,\u201d Villiers said. He was starting to get an edgy, angry feeling.</p><p>Ahead of them Lisette apparently grew tired of listening to Mrs. Minchem prose on about the virtues of laundry. She abruptly turned to the side and put a hand on a doorknob.</p><p>\u201cI must insist that you allow me to direct your visit!\u201d Mrs. Minchem snapped.</p><p>Villiers eyed the two women. Mrs. Minchem had burning eyes and the voice of a circus barker. But he\u2019d put his money on Lisette. The more he saw of her, the more she seemed like a force of nature.</p><p>Sure enough, with a charming smile that completely ignored Mrs. Minchem\u2019s purple cheeks, Lisette turned the doorknob and pranced inside.</p><p>\u201cUgh,\u201d Eleanor said, and hurried forward.</p><p>Villiers took the opportunity to open another door, the one closest to him, and walk through. Inside, a half circle of girls sat before the window, heads bent over their work. He stopped, feeling foolish. The girls sprang to their feet, but without Mrs. Minchem there, they obviously didn\u2019t know where to look, or whether to curtsy.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d he said, closing the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d they chorused, after a nod from the tallest girl. Then they dropped one of those uncannily accurate curtsies.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d he asked uneasily. As far as he could tell there were no twins in the group.</p><p>There was a silence. \u201cButtons, sir,\u201d the tallest girl said finally.</p><p>One had to suppose that buttons were made somewhere, but Villiers had never imagined that they came from orphanages. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAre there any twins in the orphanage?\u201d he asked abruptly.</p><p>Again, they all blinked at him, until the tallest girl said, \u201cJane-Lucinda and Jane-Phyllinda were born on the same day, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid they have the same mother?\u201d</p><p>They all nodded at that.</p> <p>\u201cWhere are they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPhyllinda was rude again and they\u2019re\u2014\u201d the youngest girl piped up, and abruptly went silent after a ferocious look from the tallest girl.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t know, sir,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cWe\u2019re snails, and Jane-Lucinda and Jane-Phyllinda are gold twist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSnails!\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t smile. \u201cWe are making snail buttons, trimmed with French knots. Sometimes known as death\u2019s-head buttons,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Villiers looked down the row of perfectly solemn faces. \u201cYou refer to yourself as snails?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe make snail buttons.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cAnd your names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMary-Alice, Mary-Bertha, Mary...\u201d And so it went. There were six Marys.</p><p>Villiers bowed. \u201cWhere will I find the Janes?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence. \u201cTwo doors down on the left, sir,\u201d the girl said finally.</p> <p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t\u2014\u201d said the little girl, and stopped again.</p><p>In the hallway everything was quiet. Two doors down on the left he found a circle of girls. The only difference was that these girls were wearing brown pinafores over their white dresses. \u201cAre you the Janes?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They sprang to their feet, lined up and dropped a curtsy. He looked them up and down but there wasn\u2019t a face there that resembled his own.</p><p>\u201cWhere are Jane-Lucinda and Jane-Phyllinda?\u201d he asked.</p><p>The youngest girl in the row put her fingers in her mouth, but otherwise no one moved. \u201cWe really couldn\u2019t say, sir,\u201d the tallest girl finally said.</p><p>He looked down the row. Cowed, dull eyes stared back at him until he reached the youngest, the one sucking on her fingers. Her eyes were bright blue: cautious, but awake. He walked over to her.</p><p>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane-Melinda,\u201d she said around her fingers.</p> <p>\u201cHands out of your mouth,\u201d the eldest girl snapped.</p><p>Jane-Melinda took her fingers out of her mouth, and Villiers grabbed her wrist before he was even aware of what he was doing. Her fingers were bleeding, four of them, and the fifth was deeply scored.</p><p>\u201cWhat in the hell is this about?\u201d he asked, putting her hand down gently and turning to the head of the line.</p><p>\u201cGold twist can be hard to manage in the beginning,\u201d the girl said.</p><p>He picked up the hands of the girl next in line. Her fingers were swollen, grotesque, and bleeding sluggishly in a few spots. The brown pinafores suddenly made sense.</p><p>In the middle of the circle was a basket full of buttons, glittering in the sunlight. Before each chair was a half-covered bobbin, a nub of a button in the process of being wound with the treacherously fine, cutting gold twist.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s wire,\u201d the tall girl said, ducking her head as though ashamed. \u201cIt does hurt now and then but you have to make it tight or the button falls apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist,\u201d he said under his breath. And then: \u201cTell me where to find Lucinda and Phyllinda, now.\u201d</p><p>The eldest girl froze, trembling. \u201cI daren\u2019t,\u201d she gasped. \u201cMrs. Minchem...\u201d</p><p>Down to his left, the smallest spoke. She had her fingers back in her mouth so it was difficult to understand her.</p><p>\u201cJane-Lucinda was smart to Mrs. Minchem,\u201d she said, big blue eyes fixed on Villiers\u2019s face. \u201cSo she was sent to that place. And Jane-Phyllinda went with her, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is that place?\u201d he asked. And then realized that his voice must be quite awful, as a few girls flinched.</p><p>\u201cThe sty,\u201d the eldest girl finally whispered.</p><p>\u201cThe pigsty?\u201d He could see the confirmation in their eyes, so he stepped back and made an elegant bow. He didn\u2019t know what to do. He didn\u2019t have any boiled sweets. He had nothing to give children with bleeding fingers.</p><p>The basket of gold twist buttons twinkled up at him innocently from the floor. He couldn\u2019t leave them to twist more wire. \u201cCome along, all of you,\u201d he said, turning to the door.</p><p>\u201cWh-What?\u201d It was the tallest girl, Jane-something.</p><p>\u201cFollow me,\u201d he said impatiently. \u201cI can\u2019t leave you here.\u201d He looked back and held out his hand. \u201cMelinda.\u201d</p><p>She trotted over to him and put a warm, wet hand in his. He tried not to think about blood and saliva, but simply pulled open the door and exited.</p><p>The corridor wasn\u2019t the quiet refuge he had rushed through on the way from the snails to the gold twists. He came out like a mother duck, trailing a limp line of girls in brown pinafores to find a group of screaming females milling around.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem was in the middle, looking like Lot\u2019s wife after the salt hit: stiff and bitter. Eleanor was in front of her, yelling something. Her whole body was so vibrant with fury that he was surprised that Mrs. Minchem didn\u2019t just dissolve. Lisette was off to the side, surrounded by a circle of girls in white dresses.</p><p>\u201cWho are these girls?\u201d he said, looking down at Melinda. She had edged closer to him at the first sight of Mrs. Minchem, and was sucking her right hand again.</p><p>\u201cThe Sarahs,\u201d she said, rather obscurely.</p><p>\u201cWhat do they make?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWigs,\u201d one of the other Janes said. \u201cThey make perukes for gentlemen.\u201d</p><p>That didn\u2019t sound as difficult as gold buttons. Villiers strode forward as if he always had a small girl in one hand and a train of others following.</p><p>Eleanor swung around. Her eyes were smoldering, but not in a sensual manner. Rather, she looked like a firework about to explode. \u201cVilliers, you will not believe the manner in which these children are treated!\u201d</p><p>She had exploded, obviously.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mrs. Minchem was also an exploding rocket. She gobbled in a voice so high and screechy that he could hardly understand it.</p><p>He dropped Melinda\u2019s hand, since he needed that hand to draw his sword stick. It slid free from its sheath with a swoosh.</p><p>Instant silence.</p><p>It was quite gratifying.</p><p>\u201cNow that I have your attention,\u201d he said, \u201cI have one question. Where is the punishment room, Mrs. Minchem? Or should I say, the pigsty?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor drew in her breath, but what really interested him was the way Mrs. Minchem drew up her bosom. It was a formidable bosom. It jutted before her like the prow of a ship approaching a new land.</p><p>\u201cYou are interfering with my methods,\u201d she spat. \u201cWhy have the Janes left their work?\u201d She rounded on the eldest Jane. \u201cHow dare you, Jane-Jolinda? You will not finish your quota!\u201d</p><p>Melinda pressed against Villiers\u2019s leg.</p><p>\u201cThe Janes will never make a gold button again,\u201d he told her. He brought the tip of his sword gently down to the ground. Everyone\u2019s eyes followed its bright surface.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem didn\u2019t quail. Instead she took a step forward. \u201cDo you dare to threaten me? Me, who cares for the neglected orphans of England? Me, who spends every waking moment of my day shaping these negligent bits of humanity into something that society might find useful? Me?\u201d She wasn\u2019t shrieking anymore. Her voice had taken on the brawny tones of a dockworker. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYes, you,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>She laughed at him. \u201cI do the work that no one else wants to do. My girls won\u2019t be prey to the likes of you. They\u2019ll know a trade when they leave me. You think you can come in here and lord about, but what do you really have in the way of morals?\u201d She spat it.</p><p>He managed not to flinch.</p><p>\u201cI see that you think you\u2019re coming in here like a knight in shining armor, coming to save the poor orphans. You fool, you fool! Do you have any idea how much work it takes me to give each of them a trade and a sense of purpose? And you\u2014you\u2019re one of them!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThem?\u201d he asked. Melinda was clinging to his pantaloons now, so he switched his sword to his left hand and put his right on the child\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Mrs. Minchem\u2019s eyes were maddened now. \u201cYou\u2019re one of the men who incontinently fill the landscape with the offspring of your illicit, your disgusting, unions!\u201d</p><p>Villiers resisted the impulse to cover Melinda\u2019s ears. It was regrettable that Mrs. Minchem actually had a point.</p><p>Eleanor marched around to confront Mrs. Minchem. \u201cThe pedigree of these children does not excuse your treatment.\u201d Her voice was at once soft and terrible, and cut through the woman\u2019s strident tones like a knife. \u201cYou are wrong to treat them so, wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know of these girls?\u201d Mrs. Minchem said shrilly. \u201cIf I do not subdue them, keep them working, they will betray their origins. They will become nightwalkers, like their mothers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will not bandy words with you,\u201d Eleanor said, and there was a crushing finality to her tone. \u201cLeopold, summon your footmen. Mrs. Minchem will be leaving the premises and she may need an escort.\u201d</p><p>Taking just a split second to savor the fact that she\u2019d used his given name instead of his title, Villiers turned to the eldest Jane. \u201cMy coachman is waiting in the courtyard, fetch a footman.\u201d She scurried off after one look at Mrs. Minchem, who was shuddering, like the surface of a seething volcano.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Eleanor said, cutting through her words. \u201cYou can explain yourself to a judge. The children have heard enough, and so have I.\u201d</p><p>Villiers thought of agreeing, and decided that would be undignified.</p><p>\u201cLisette,\u201d Eleanor said, not raising her voice.</p> <p>Lisette skipped up, children clinging to both hands.</p><p>\u201cWe need a good woman to make sure these children are warm and clothed, and that their injuries are attended to. Do you know of someone in the village, or in your household?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never treated these girls with aught less than loving kindness,\u201d Mrs. Minchem squealed.</p><p>Villiers met her eyes and she sputtered to a halt. \u201cI gather that my children are in the pigsty, madam. Do you wish to point the way?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour children\u2014your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy children,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cTwins. Currently named Jane-Lucinda and Jane-Phyllinda. My daughters, who are apparently residing in the sty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou have children living here?\u201d Lisette exclaimed.</p><p>\u201cThe sty!\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAs in a home for hogs?\u201d</p> <p>For the first time Mrs. Minchem looked a little frightened. She gulped like a snake trying to swallow a large bird. \u201cThose girls had to be separated from the rest because they were a bad influence.\u201d Her jaw firmed and she put on a defiant air. \u201cWicked, they were, especially Jane-Lucinda, and anyone who knows them will agree with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy children the fiends,\u201d Villiers said pleasantly. \u201cYes, that seems appropriate. Now you will do me the pleasure, madam, of telling me where to find the sty.\u201d He paused. \u201cI hardly need add that I hope, for your sake, that the both girls are healthy.\u201d</p><p>She flashed a look that tried to act like a hammer blow but failed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s behind the milking shed,\u201d a tall Sarah said suddenly, standing forward. \u201cI\u2019ve been there only once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you see how healthy she is,\u201d Mrs. Minchem said defiantly.</p><p>\u201cShe always said\u2014\u201d Melinda piped up, then faltered to a stop after a glare from Mrs. Minchem.</p><p>\u201cYes, Melinda?\u201d Villiers asked, peering down at the little girl attached to his leg.</p><p>\u201cShe said as how the hogs would eat us if we fell asleep,\u201d Melinda said, and pressed herself even harder against Villiers\u2019s thigh. \u201cAnd she left Lucinda and Phyllinda in there all night long.\u201d She gulped. \u201cMaybe they\u2019ve been et up.\u201d</p><p>Villiers looked at Mrs. Minchem and she actually recoiled. \u201cYou might want to spend the next few minutes praying that your hogs haven\u2019t acquired a taste for little girls,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>He waited until he was out of earshot before assuring Melinda that pigs were vegetarians. But when he and Eleanor, trailed by various orphans, undid the huge rusty clasp shackling the door to the sty, and stuck their heads into the dark, odiferous place, he felt serious misgivings.</p><p>There was no one in the sty but three extraordinarily large pigs and a litter of piglets. The sow lumbered to her feet with a murderous look in her small eyes.</p><p>In the middle of the soiled straw was one small shoe.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Jane-Lucinda\u2019s!\u201d the eldest Jane said, bursting into noisy tears.</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>\u201cThey must have escaped,\u201d Eleanor said, giving the girl a hug. \u201cThey are, after all, your children, Villiers. That is surely what happened.\u201d</p><p>He had picked his way through the filthy straw and was examining the window, set up high and caked with indescribable dirt. \u201cThey didn\u2019t go out this way.\u201d Of course the pigs couldn\u2019t have eaten two children. One of the animals was so fat that he couldn\u2019t imagine it on its feet. Though one had to suppose that there was room in that vast stomach for a small child\u2014</p><p>No. Of course not. One could not imagine that.</p><p>\u201cSomeone let them out,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cSomeone in this house had the Christian decency to look out for two small girls locked in this nauseating place overnight.\u201d</p><p>His blood was beating in his ears and he heard only part of what she said. Suddenly she was next to him, hand on his arm. \u201cA servant rescued them,\u201d she repeated.</p><p>A servant...a servant. Of course a servant rescued them. The red haze in his head miraculously cleared. He didn\u2019t even thank her, just pushed his sword back into its scabbard; he must have withdrawn it without realizing. \u201cWhoever saved my children will be handsomely rewarded.\u201d</p><p>But after Mrs. Minchem had been led away by Villiers\u2019s grooms, cursing and protesting, and all the servants gathered around, it became clear that not one of them had dared to gainsay their mistress\u2019s commands.</p><p>\u201cYou frequently left children overnight,\u201d Villiers stated, looking from face to face.</p><p>\u201cShe weren\u2019t an easy woman,\u201d a servant said.</p><p>He was a craven fool who turned his face to the side rather than meet Villiers\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re all dismissed,\u201d he said. \u201cLady Lisette will make certain that you are not hired within the county.\u201d He turned to Eleanor. \u201cWhere is Lisette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe felt dizzy at the idea of the sty,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI sent her home. She\u2019ll send the carriage back for us. Your twins are on the grounds somewhere. We must find them.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But two hours later the children had still not been found. Every room had been searched; the barns had been rifled; the sty was turned inside out.</p><p>There was no sign of two small girls.</p><p>\u201cThey must have run away,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would have done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do at the moment,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cWe must go home. It\u2019s long past time for luncheon. You\u2019ll send your footmen out to search the surrounding countryside and they\u2019ll find the children in no time. They can\u2019t have gone far.\u201d</p> <p>That was true. He could feel the logic of it like a balm to his soul. \u201cYou called me Leopold in the orphanage,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cA moment of weakness,\u201d she said, accepting a footman\u2019s hand to climb into the carriage.</p><p>Once in the carriage, he put his head back so he didn\u2019t have to meet her eyes and said, \u201cYou must think it\u2019s very odd that I...\u201d He tried to figure out how to phrase exactly what happened to him.</p><p>\u201cYou were terrified,\u201d Eleanor said, pulling a little mirror from her net bag and rubbing a smudge on her cheek. \u201cThat sty! That grotesque woman! I was just as frightened, and the children aren\u2019t even mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hardly claim them as my children, in that sense of the word. I didn\u2019t even know where they were living until a few days ago. I never gave them a second\u2019s thought until this year. They could have been spending every night in a sty, for all I knew.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense. You paid for them to be well-housed, warm, fed, and educated. That\u2019s more than many fathers in the same situation do.\u201d She peered at herself in the small glass and then dropped it back into her bag. \u201cLord knows, you\u2019re rich enough to give them all settlements, and that will buy them a future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo man is rich enough to buy back his past,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>She met his eyes and the regret in hers made him feel better. \u201cTrue. But there\u2019s no point in wailing over it. I hope to goodness that Willa remembered to walk Oyster. If not, my chamber is going to be as malodorous as the sty itself.\u201d She started searching about in her bag again.</p><p>She is a good person, Villiers thought, watching her under half-closed eyes so that she didn\u2019t realize. He\u2019d never noticed what a firm chin she had until she faced off with Mrs. Minchem.</p><p>There was something about Eleanor that made him want to bite her. He\u2019d like to bite that firm little chin. And then do the same to her neck. Her neck was as strong as she was: a beautiful, fierce column.</p><p>Without thinking too much about it he rose and sat down beside her, crushing her skirts. She squeaked some sort of reproach, but he kissed her silent. She tasted like one of the first raspberries in spring, so sweet and tart that it bit the tongue. And she tasted angry somehow, which made him wonder about why he could taste what she was feeling.</p> <p>But then she stopped being angry and her arms wound around his neck and she said \u201cLeopold\u201d into his mouth. He stopped thinking altogether and just focused on kissing her. After a while it dawned on him that there was something different about the way she was kissing him. Something he didn\u2019t recognize.</p><p>She was kissing him back. Really kissing him back.</p><p>She had one hand woven so hard into his hair that it almost hurt. And her tongue was playing with his, swooping and hiding and generally driving him mad with desire.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t as if he hadn\u2019t been kissed before. But when he let his mouth trail away over her cheek, thinking to bite her ear, she bade him return in a husky little command. And when he didn\u2019t, she grabbed his head and pulled him back.</p><p>That was new. No woman had ever...</p><p>He lost the train of thought again because she said his name, his given name, in sort of a purr, and every inch of his body blazed.</p><p>She was flushed and pink and utterly desirable. She looked at him that way she had, as if she were smoldering, as if she wanted only one thing in the world...</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re no virgin,\u201d he said, surprising himself. Gentlemen didn\u2019t say that sort of thing to ladies, let alone the gently-bred daughters of dukes.</p> <p>She let a finger run over his eyebrows, down his nose. He almost shuddered at her touch. Not even the highest paid courtesan in the world could manage the sultry look that Eleanor seemed to wield at a moment\u2019s notice. There was something about that...he needed to think it out, but he didn\u2019t have time.</p><p>\u201cTell me you\u2019re not a virgin,\u201d he said after a moment, assuring himself that he wasn\u2019t begging.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see how that is relevant to our particular activity.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a virgin. He knew it. It would be extremely ungentlemanly to make her confirm it. The promise of illicit pleasure sang in his blood, so he had to kiss her again.</p><p>They stepped out of the carriage only to be greeted by frenzied barking. Oyster launched himself from the front steps, so ecstatic at the sight of his mistress that his squat little body actually twisted in the air. He literally catapulted into her arms. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d Eleanor said as he licked her face. \u201cWere you afraid I\u2019d gone away and left you forever?\u201d</p><p>Villiers could help thinking that he had reached a new low in his life. Jealous of a dog. Wonderful.</p><p>\u201cNow I\u2019m going to put you down, Oyster,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cYou must not start barking again, because Lisette is afraid of you.\u201d</p><p>Oyster gave her a last lick; she put him on the ground; he started barking again.</p><p>Villiers stepped forward. \u201cOyster.\u201d</p><p>Oyster sat back on his haunches and looked him over. Villiers had no pretensions about dogs. They were smart; they were self-centered; they were single-minded. Oyster opened his mouth.</p><p>\u201cOyster,\u201d Villiers said, dropping his voice an octave or so.</p><p>Oyster shut his mouth, showing that he was as smart as the other dogs Villiers had encountered in life.</p><p>\u201cWhat a good dog he is,\u201d Eleanor said, sounding utterly delighted with the plump little mongrel she had just been kissing all over his absurd-looking head.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a good dog,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cany more than there are bad men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere certainly are bad men! And bad women too. Witness Mrs. Minchem.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are men who lose fear. Mrs. Minchem had no fear, and therefore she acted with impunity. She wanted to put a troublesome child in the pigs\u2019 dormitory, so she did. That\u2019s not necessarily bad\u2014just opportunistic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s bad. And Oyster is a good dog, because he obeys. Stay, Oyster. And don\u2019t bark. There, you see\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oyster suddenly leapt into the air with his strange twisting jump and began barking like a maddened rabbit with a voice box.</p><p>\u201cOyster!\u201d Eleanor cried\u2014but Oyster had leapt past both of them and through the open door of the carriage.</p><p>\u201cNo untrained animals in my carriage!\u201d Villiers snapped.</p><p>He and Eleanor reached the door at the same moment.</p><p>Oyster was barking with the singular fixation that a beggar might give a steaming pudding.</p><p>One of the seat cushions was thrown to the side, the wooden lid was up, and two extraordinarily dirty and rather sleepy faces were staring back at Oyster. The faces were identical.</p><p>\u201cJane-Lucinda,\u201d Villiers said. One of the girls nodded.</p><p>\u201cAnd Jane-Phyllinda,\u201d Eleanor breathed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Having made his point, Oyster stopped barking.</p><p>\u201cHow do you know our names?\u201d Lucinda demanded, putting her arm protectively around her sister.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d Eleanor said after a second\u2019s silence during which Villiers tried to figure out how to say Because I\u2019m your father.</p><p>\u201cLooking for us? Why?\u201d The girl\u2019s chin jutted out. \u201cYou can tell Mrs. Minchem that we hope she falls over and the pigs eat her ankles, because we aren\u2019t going back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cEver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you like to get out of the blanket box now?\u201d Eleanor inquired. \u201cI can assure you that Oyster won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>The bolder girl climbed from the box. She was wearing hardly any clothing, just a rough gown with no stockings and one shoe. Oyster started forward and began smelling her legs with an air of deep interest.</p><p>She certainly had an interesting odor; Villiers identified it immediately as Scent of Sty. In fact, now that he thought of it, all four of them were likely pungent.</p> <p>\u201cOyster won\u2019t hurt you,\u201d Eleanor said encouragingly. \u201cHe\u2019s just a puppy.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda gave Oyster a pat. He had finished sniffing her legs, so he sat back down, looked up at her face and gave a brisk command.</p><p>\u201cWhat does he want?\u201d Lucinda asked.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you to give him a proper pat,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd scratch his ears. He likes that. Would you care to come out of the box?\u201d she asked Phyllinda.</p><p>Phyllinda shook her head.</p><p>Lucinda sat down on the floor of the carriage while Oyster jumped into her lap. She started giggling helplessly as the dog licked her face. Villiers watched with some interest as the shape of her face emerged from all the dirt.</p> <p>But he didn\u2019t see what she really looked like until he pulled Oyster outside, bringing Lucinda with him. And then he almost dropped to his knees in surprise.</p><p>Her eyes were a gorgeous dark lilac, the color of larkspur in late summer.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s eyes\u2014\u201d he started to say to Eleanor, then realized that she was still inside the carriage. He poked a head in to find that she had coaxed Phyllinda out of the box.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad dog,\u201d Eleanor was saying. \u201cIf you just peek out the door, you\u2019ll see your sister playing with him. Oyster is just a puppy.\u201d</p><p>But Villiers took one look at Phyllinda\u2019s terrified, obstinate face and knew that it was all too much for her. She was five years old, and she\u2019d spent the night in a pigsty, presumably terrified of being eaten; she\u2019d escaped the sty only to find her way\u2014God knows how\u2014into their carriage; and now she was risking being chewed by a wild dog. Her instincts for self-preservation had clearly been honed inside the orphanage.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d he said, plucking her off the seat.</p><p>Her body went rigid, but he scooped her against his shoulder and backed out of the carriage.</p><p>It was only when he turned around that he realized what an audience they had drawn. By now, most of the Duke of Gilner\u2019s household had emerged from the house and were watching transfixed.</p> <p>Eleanor bent over Lucinda, now sitting on the ground with Oyster in her lap. \u201cIf you stand up and come with us, Oyster will come as well,\u201d he heard her say.</p><p>The coachman was staring straight ahead, as was proper, but Villiers could see his ears practically wiggle as he listened.</p><p>\u201cThis is Lucinda, and this is Phyllinda,\u201d he said. \u201cLucinda, stand up.\u201d She scrambled to her feet. There was a little rustle among the servants, as if wind blew through a pile of straw.</p><p>\u201cDoes anyone know where my son is?\u201d Villiers inquired.</p><p>They all looked around, as if someone else was sure to know. \u201cHe left for the orphanage this morning,\u201d Villiers continued. \u201cDid anyone see him go or return?\u201d</p><p>No one said a word.</p><p>\u201cIs he in the nursery?\u201d</p><p>Popper gestured and a footman dashed up the stairs.</p><p>\u201cWhat would Tobias be doing at the orphanage?\u201d Eleanor asked, knitting her brow. \u201cHe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe said he was going home,\u201d Lucinda put in, looking up from the dog.</p><p>This was unexpected. All eyes turned to the little girl.</p><p>\u201cYou know Tobias?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>Lucinda grinned, and Villiers looked past the streaked dirt and dog spit and who knows what to discover that his daughter was an extraordinarily beautiful girl. \u201cHe got us outta the sty this morning,\u201d she said. \u201cWe heard a banging.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe thought it was Mrs. Minchem coming again,\u201d Phyllinda said, her voice high and thready.</p><p>He tightened his hold on her. \u201cMrs. Minchem is incarcerated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s that?\u201d Lucinda asked.</p><p>\u201cThe Clink,\u201d Eleanor explained. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not coming out either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTobias unlocked the sty and took you out,\u201d Villiers said, rather stunned. \u201cAnd then he stowed you in the blanket box.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe put the blanket down and said as we should just go to sleep and he\u2019d walk home and then sneak us out of the box later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve been asleep?\u201d Villiers asked, suddenly remembering talk of virginity in the carriage.</p><p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t sleep last night because of that old sow,\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cBut I would have just kicked her good if she tried to bite us!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was too scared,\u201d Phyllinda whimpered.</p><p>\u201cWe stayed awake all night instead,\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cAn\u2019 then we slept in that box until we heard this doggie barking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let Oyster lick your mouth,\u201d Eleanor told Lucinda. \u201cYour cheek is all right, but your mouth, no.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSend someone out on horseback to look for Tobias,\u201d Villiers said to Popper. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a few miles, and he has to have stowed the girls after Lisette sent the carriage back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t he just climb in the carriage and wait for us?\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cHe could have told any of the groomsmen and they would have fetched us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise,\u201d Phyllinda whispered against Villiers\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to move even after the carriage stopped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe was going to have a bath first,\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cWe still needs to have that bath. He said our pa won\u2019t like us if we aren\u2019t clean.\u201d She gave Oyster a final pat. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, mister, we\u2019d better have that bath because our pa might be along at any moment.\u201d</p><p>The entire household went utterly quiet, every eye fixed on Villiers.</p><p>He looked down at Lucinda. She stood almost as high as his waist. She had one hand on her hip, and she looked five going on forty. Phyllinda was staring at him expectantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is going on out here?\u201d Lisette cried, bouncing down the front steps and waving at her maid. \u201cBeatrice, I\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere! Please fetch my painting materials; I had a fancy to paint a portrait of young children.\u201d She smiled at Eleanor. \u201cHow could one not want to paint youth, after seeing those beaming faces this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cthey did beam after we dispatched with Mrs. Minchem, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTheir joy was wonderful,\u201d Lisette said, sighing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Eleanor turned away and Villiers noticed that she had a remarkably jaundiced look on her face, which wasn\u2019t quite fair. Lisette had no way of knowing the particular conversation she was interrupting.</p><p>He pulled himself together. \u201cI am your father,\u201d he stated, looking first at Lucinda and then at Phyllinda.</p><p>Lucinda\u2019s eyes narrowed, and Phyllinda\u2019s eyes grew round, and Villiers thought he learned quite a lot about each of his daughters in that moment.</p><p>He learned even more just seconds later when Tobias appeared around the edge of the carriage, limping slightly. Lucinda dashed over and threw her arms around him, and Phyllinda began struggling and gave Villiers a solid kick before he realized that she wanted to get down.</p> <p>From a safe position behind Tobias, Lucinda shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not our pa,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the same one as Tobias. He promised us, and so\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Phyllinda said to Villiers, peeking around from behind Lucinda.</p><p>\u201cHe is your father,\u201d Tobias said cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cIs he?\u201d Lisette said, turning her large eyes on Villiers. \u201cMy goodness, but you\u2019re very virile, Leopold.\u201d There was a little snigger from one of the footmen, which died instantly.</p><p>Villiers tried to arrange his face into what he imagined to be a nicely paternal expression. \u201cI am your father. I accidentally lost you when you were quite small, and only found you today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou lost both of us,\u201d Lucinda said pointedly.</p><p>Phyllinda was hiding behind Lucinda, who was behind Tobias. \u201cYes,\u201d Villiers said, trying to meet Phyllinda\u2019s eyes. \u201cI lost both of you at the same time, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRemarkably careless,\u201d Lisette put in, not helpfully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. What else could he say? He held himself as stiffly as he always had, except it was only lately that he felt stiff. Before, he just felt ducal.</p><p>Tobias hauled Lucinda out from behind him. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad,\u201d he said, so that every servant could hear him. Villiers was used to living out his life in front of the household, but this was ridiculous. The sting of humiliation was practically Dantesque.</p><p>He turned to Lisette. \u201cCan you summon your housekeeper to take care of these children? They need baths.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNonsense, I\u2019ll bring them to the nursery myself,\u201d she said. With one look at her smiling blue eyes, both girls trotted away with Lisette, who was promising baths, hot soup, and Lord knew what else.</p><p>Villiers walked silently into the house, drawing back to allow Eleanor to climb the stairs before him. He occupied himself by noticing how small her waist was, and mocking himself for responding in an altogether physical way to the effect achieved by her corset.</p><p>At the very top she paused. \u201cDo you know what I keep thinking?\u201d A wildly mischievous smile spread across her face.</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t feel that you have to share it with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Lucifer, angel of the morning, how art thou fallen,\u201d she said. And then whisked herself off, grinning.</p><p>Two could play at that game. He went straight to his room, out onto the balcony, and, after pausing at her window to make sure her maid wasn\u2019t in the room, walked into Eleanor\u2019s chamber.</p><p>She was washing her hands, and turned around with an undignified squeak.</p><p>Villiers wasted no time. Her maid might arrive at any moment. He pulled her into his arms and took that sweet hot mouth of hers, kissing her so hard that he expected a protest, or a shove, or even a curse.</p> <p>Not from Eleanor.</p><p>Her arms went around his neck and one hand curled into his hair; his ribbon fell to the floor and her body came against his with joy. She squirmed against him, she sighed into his mouth, she gave a little moan when his hand stroked her back.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that women hadn\u2019t done the same before. He knew how to turn a woman\u2019s body into molten liquid, to shape and mold her so she couldn\u2019t stop panting, so she couldn\u2019t remember her own name, let alone his.</p><p>But Eleanor\u2019s breathing was unsteady before he tried his practiced caresses. It didn\u2019t have to do with his title, because he\u2019d already learned that she didn\u2019t care about it. It didn\u2019t have to do with his beauty, because he didn\u2019t have much. And it didn\u2019t have to do with his money, because the way she was rubbing herself against him, without shame, without guilt...that had nothing to do with money.</p><p>A thought occurred to him and he broke free even as her lips clung. \u201cAre you thinking of him?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she breathed. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>His heart thudded and he pulled free of her hands.</p><p>She pulled him back. \u201cKiss me again.\u201d He looked at her half-open eyes and groaned. There was something about Eleanor\u2014something about the contrast between her composed, snappy personality and the wildness she unleashed in him that made him unable to control himself.</p><p>Even if it meant kissing her while she fantasized about someone else.</p><p>He kissed her as if to convince both of them that he owned her, that he controlled her. Eleanor was too free to be controlled. And yet when she pressed against him and craved him, obviously craved him...he believed.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t not believe. He was only a man, after all. He couldn\u2019t stop his hand from stroking down her back, circling that small waist.</p><p>\u201cAre you wearing a corset?\u201d he murmured in her ear.</p><p>She chuckled and he grew even harder, if that were possible. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>His hands, practiced and sure, roamed her back. \u201cI think you\u2019re wearing a gown of tobin silk, sometimes called Florentine,\u201d he said, nibbling her ear.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. My sister ordered it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis piece at your bodice is gauze, a very thin silk made at Paisley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut am I wearing a corset?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cThat is the real question.\u201d</p><p>There was a scrabble at the door and Villiers sprang to her open window. He looked back for one more drink of her, to see the color in her cheeks, her tumbled hair, her desirous eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll discover the answer to that question tonight,\u201d he said, and it came out sounding like a vow.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Eleanor bathed in silence, her mind whirling. She was playing a dangerous game with Villiers. But there was no reason not to play.</p><p>Flirting with him felt fresh...clean. It felt as if all the empty places inside her that had yearned for Gideon these many years were being filled, even if Villiers wasn\u2019t another Gideon, and even if she wasn\u2019t falling in love with him.</p><p>She was falling in lust with him, a thought that would make most of the maidens in the ton swoon from shock. Men were the only ones allowed to lust; women were allowed only an impassioned yet mysteriously platonic \u201clove.\u201d Not to be consummated, naturally, until all the necessary papers and ceremonies were tidied up.</p><p>Gideon had been slender, young, and beautiful. Villiers was hard, masculine, and\u2014not bitter, but sardonic. There was a dark core to him that she would never know. Not that she needed or wanted to know it, she reminded herself.</p><p>She wanted his body. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to feel shame over that, though the world would think she ought to. But she\u2019d never been able to feel particularly shameful when she loved Gideon either.</p><p>Villiers\u2019s very touch made her melt and shudder. It brought out the same side of her that had enticed Gideon into a haymow, the side of her that dared Villiers to wonder whether she was wearing a corset. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear Anne\u2019s chemise dress,\u201d she told Willa after her bath. The gown was made of pale lilac taffeta, so delicate that the fabric flowed to the ground without pleats or folds. It fit very close on the bodice and buttoned from the bosom to the hem with small canary-yellow buttons.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure, my lady? You said that you would never wear it, because we couldn\u2019t fit a corset under that bodice,\u201d Willa said.</p><p>\u201cI have changed my mind.\u201d She would wear the gown for Villiers\u2019s sake. Willa knew the reason, but they preserved the fiction, the way polite women do. Willa buttoned her up and then went off to borrow Anne\u2019s face paints.</p><p>\u201cLady Anne will not be at supper,\u201d she reported, coming back with a small box in hand.</p> <p>\u201cIs she ill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarie says that she was up and about for a short time this morning, but she felt so poorly that she went back to bed and has been able to take nothing but chicken broth.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor grinned. \u201cShe overindulged last night.\u201d She picked up Anne\u2019s face paints and began experimenting. First she tried brushing dark lines around her eyes, the way Anne had the night before, but somehow she looked more badger-like than mysterious.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve overdone it,\u201d Willa said dubiously.</p><p>\u201cI look like a badger, don\u2019t I?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore like someone with the Black Death. Not that I\u2019ve ever seen the illness, but you look mortal with all that around your eyes.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor shuddered and rubbed some off. Then removed a little more. Drew some more back on. Put color on her lips and on her cheeks. Rubbed some of that off. Put a little flip of black at the outside edges of her eyes.</p><p>Rubbed some off.</p><p>Stood up for one final glance...and smiled.</p><p>Her gown was the opposite of the stiff satin gowns that had been in style so long. The French chemise had been introduced only last year, and she hadn\u2019t even thought of buying one. But her sister had.</p><p>Thank goodness for Anne and her predilection for fashion. Willa had piled her hair in waves of curls, with small sprays of violets tucked here and there. And after all that work, her eyes were perfect. Smudged, but not so much that she looked like a dying person. Or a badger.</p> <p>Her lips were crimson. She made a kissing gesture to the mirror, and Willa burst into laughter.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I\u2019m too extravagant?\u201d Eleanor asked, just before turning to leave.</p><p>\u201cNo. Not at all. It\u2019s as if\u2014well, it\u2019s as if it\u2019s more you, if you see what I mean, my lady.\u201d</p><p>Apparently more of her meant dressing like a hussy, which was a disconcerting thought.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just too bad that we\u2019re not in London,\u201d Willa went on happily. \u201cBecause those gentlemen would go absolutely mad. They would fall at your feet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want men at my feet. Would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not for me,\u201d Willa said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause that\u2019s for ladies and gentlemen. You should have four or five beaux at least, my lady. I want just one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think,\u201d said Eleanor, \u201cthat I want just one as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt would be a great waste,\u201d Willa said, shaking her head. \u201cLook at your gown, and how beautiful you are, and all. And then there\u2019s your dowry. It\u2019s always better if a gentleman has to fight off other men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor his sake or for mine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for both,\u201d Willa said, getting into the spirit of the conversation. \u201cHe feels better because he\u2019s had to fight off rivals.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think that Villiers cares,\u201d Eleanor said, feeling a touch of wistfulness. \u201cHe just wants a mother to his children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what he wants from you,\u201d Willa said with a chuckle.</p><p>Villiers inspected himself one last time in the glass while Finchley waited, another cravat close at hand in case he decided to redo the knot. He was wearing one of his favorite coats, made of a pale green silk, the color of the very first leaves in spring. It was embroidered with mulberry-colored flowers, a fantasy of climbing trumpet vines. His hair was tied back with a ribbon of the same green.</p><p>He looked like what he indeed was: an idiosyncratic and powerful duke. He did not look like a man who was prey to unaccustomed and unwelcome emotions. Shame, for one. And fear. When Tobias couldn\u2019t be found...when the daughters he had never met couldn\u2019t be found...he had felt sick.</p><p>That was unacceptable.</p><p>And what he felt for Eleanor was, frankly, unacceptable as well.</p><p>He had to make a dreadfully important decision that would determine his children\u2019s future happiness. He didn\u2019t need a wife or a lover. The important thing was that they needed a mother. And Lord knows, they deserved whatever he could give them.</p><p>His jaw tightened as he pictured the fusty, filthy sty again. And Tobias, wading through the bitterly cold mud of the Thames.</p><p>\u201cYour Grace?\u201d Finchley prompted. \u201cWould you like your gloves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, turning to go. \u201cI think I\u2019ll stop by the nursery before going downstairs for dinner.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well, Your Grace. I will wait in the downstairs entry with your gloves.\u201d</p><p>Villiers pushed open the door to the nursery with some trepidation. He and Tobias seemed to be able to rub along together. But he had another son and a daughter at home with whom he had hardly exchanged a word. And now two more daughters. It was overwhelming.</p><p>The first thing he saw when he entered was Lisette. She was sitting in a rocker by the fire, singing. She had a beautiful voice, as clear as a bell and yet surprisingly low. \u201cHush-a-bye baby, on the treetop,\u201d she sang. Lucinda or Phyllinda was curled in her lap, wearing a white nightie. Villiers looked around for the other girl, and found her in one of the beds, sucking her thumb in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cWhen the wind blows, the cradle will rock.</p><p>When the bough breaks, the cradle will fall,</p><p>Down will come baby, cradle and all.\u201d</p><p>The moment Lisette stopped singing, the little head on her shoulder popped up. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, lady, don\u2019t stop...\u201d</p><p>That had to be Lucinda, given her exhausted but stubborn tone. Lisette stroked the little girl on the shoulder, then bent her bright head over the girl again and sang.</p><p>\u201cMama will catch you, give you a squeeze.</p><p>Send you back up to play in the trees...\u201d</p><p>Villiers smiled. He didn\u2019t remember ever being sung to. His nanny was greatly taken with the young duke\u2019s consequence and treated him as a small prince from the moment he could remember.</p><p>No one sang to princes.</p><p>\u201cWhen twilight falls, and birds seek their nest.</p><p>Come home to the one who loves you the best.\u201d</p><p>Lisette\u2019s voice was so beautifully soothing that it wasn\u2019t in the least surprising to find Lucinda had succumbed. A maid tiptoed over to take the little girl, but Villiers waved her away and picked up the child himself.</p><p>She was utterly beautiful, from her curls to the long eyelashes hiding those lavender eyes she inherited from his grandmother. In sleep, her mouth was a rosebud rather than the defensive, obstinate grimace that she had worn downstairs.</p><p>\u201cPut her down carefully,\u201d Lisette said softly, at his shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to wake her.\u201d</p><p>He started toward one of the other little beds lining the wall of the nursery, but her light touch on his arm stopped him. \u201cWith her sister.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Of course. He placed Lucinda on the bed next to Phyllinda. Their ringlets curled together on the pillow.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a fine time fending off suitors when they\u2019re old enough to be noticed,\u201d Lisette whispered.</p><p>\u201cThey may be rejected by the ton. I\u2019ll dower them, of course, but they\u2019re bastards.\u201d He had promised to himself that he wouldn\u2019t try to avoid what he had done to them, and that meant naming it.</p><p>\u201cIf they were mine, I would teach them not to care.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHard to do in the midst of London, and children to a duke,\u201d he said wryly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t agree.\u201d She gave a disdainful little wave. \u201cI would teach them to ignore such foolishness. The ton is made up of unimportant, stupid persons. I care nothing for them; why should they?\u201d</p><p>She meant it. He could see the truth in her eyes: she really believed the ton was unimportant.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think of my title?\u201d he asked her.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, what do I think of it?\u201d She smiled. \u201cIt has four letters. D-U-K-E.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you revere it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy father does not revere his title in the least,\u201d she said.</p><p>Villiers hadn\u2019t even thought about her father. Gilner was an excellent man in Parliament, by all accounts. \u201cYour mother died some time ago. Do you know if your father ever thought to marry again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Lisette said peacefully. \u201cHe says he would prefer that his direct bloodline die out. My second cousin will inherit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow extremely\u2014\u201d</p><p>But she slipped her delicate hand into his and put a finger to her mouth. As they watched, Phyllinda shifted to her side and threw an arm around her sister.</p><p>\u201cWe will be missed downstairs,\u201d Lisette whispered. \u201cI only meant to stop by the nursery and see how they were doing.\u201d</p><p>Villiers said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the first part of that lullaby, but never the second verse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I made it up,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cI never liked the idea of the basket falling. Why, the babe would be hurt!\u201d She tugged his hand gently. \u201cCome on, Leopold. My aunt has returned home and she\u2019ll be vexed with me if I\u2019m overly late.\u201d</p><p>She called him Leopold so easily, as if they had been intimates forever.</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Eleanor entered the drawing room and was greeted by a tall, thin woman wearing a towering, snowy white wig. \u201cDarling, it\u2019s been years! I haven\u2019t seen you since you were in pinafores, and look at you now. Utterly gorgeous.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLady Marguerite,\u201d Eleanor said, dropping into a curtsy. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure to see you again. I may have changed, but you have not.\u201d</p><p>Marguerite laughed at that, but it was true. She was not only beautiful, but stylish, with arching dark eyebrows that sharply contrasted with her white wig. She had to be in her forties or even her early fifties, but she dressed with the \u00e9clat of a young woman.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure having visitors, even though several of them are confined to their chambers. Apparently your mother has a toothache,\u201d she said, leading Eleanor into the room, \u201cand dear Anne refuses to leave her bed. So we\u2019re very thin company tonight, with Lisette, Villiers, and myself. But I must introduce you to my good friend, the Honorable Lawrence Frederick Bentley the Third.\u201d</p><p>Bentley was from Yorkshire, with stiff white whiskers and very bright eyes. He looked as if he enjoyed galloping the moors shouting Tally-Ho! \u201cHow do you do?\u201d he said with a flourishing bow.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been discussing the endlessly fascinating subject of matrimony,\u201d Marguerite said, seating herself. \u201cI myself have never been married, as you know, and I shall never choose to be at this point in life. I prefer to have devoted friends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut what of love?\u201d Lisette said, cocking her head to one side and regarding her aunt as if she\u2019d never seen her before.</p><p>\u201cLove is all very well in its way\u2014Eleanor, dearest, do have one of these small tarts; they are delicious\u2014as I was saying, love is fine, but friendship is much more important.\u201d Marguerite shot an amused smile at Bentley. \u201cWhich is not to say that there can\u2019t be love in friendship...at least devoted friendship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWithout marriage no one would have children,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cFamily, what? Important, that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBentley has two children, though of course they\u2019re grown now,\u201d Marguerite informed the rest of them, speaking for him in a comfortable way that made it clear that while she may have declined to marry Bentley, the contours of their relationship weren\u2019t unfamiliar.</p><p>\u201cOne can certainly have children without marriage,\u201d Lisette said, with her unerring gift for saying what most people think, but never utter. \u201cJust look at Villiers\u2019s children. Your girls have startlingly beautiful eyes,\u201d she said, turning to him.</p><p>\u201cChildren? Didn\u2019t know you were\u2014what, ho!\u201d Bentley said, stopping in some confusion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married,\u201d Villiers said calmly. \u201cBut I do have children. Three of whom are upstairs, and about whom Lady Lisette has kindly expressed some admiration.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you have any children born outside your marriage?\u201d Lisette asked, turning to Bentley. \u201cYou must have had a wife earlier in life, before you met Marguerite, I mean.\u201d</p><p>Bentley was clearly used to Lisette; he didn\u2019t even flinch. \u201cMy wife died many years ago. I don\u2019t have any children other than those Marguerite mentioned, but a brother has one. Nice lad; we set him up as a cartwright and he\u2019s as fine as fivepence. A sturdy fellow too, not at all like my nephew.\u201d</p><p>Marguerite laughed. \u201cPoor Erskine! Bentley\u2019s nephew is in love with the daughter of a colonel, and all he does is mope and carry on for the love of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are both your nephews,\u201d Lisette pointed out.</p><p>Eleanor felt very glad that her mother felt a toothache; this was not a conversation that she would enjoy. What\u2019s more, the Honorable Lawrence and Marguerite were holding hands now, and the duchess wouldn\u2019t approve of that either.</p><p>And Villiers was smiling at Lisette, likely because of her defense of the illegitimate cartwright. Eleanor felt a stab of jealousy. He was hers\u2014except he wasn\u2019t. \u201cDid Sir Roland happen to stop by while we were at the orphanage?\u201d she asked Marguerite.</p><p>\u201cOf course he did,\u201d Marguerite said with a wicked twinkle. \u201cI gather you have captivated the attention of our local bard. I invited him to join us after supper for a musical interlude. Which reminds me, we really should go to supper now. Popper seems to be quite unnerved. I think it\u2019d be best if we do exactly as he requests tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you bring back any interesting stories from London?\u201d Lisette implored, after they were seated around the table.</p><p>\u201cYour papa sends his best wishes and said to tell you that he\u2019ll be coming home in a week or so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot that sort of news,\u201d Lisette said impatiently. \u201cInteresting news. As when you told us about Mrs. Cavil eating a bushel of cherries.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was a sad story,\u201d Marguerite said, \u201cgiven what happened to Mrs. Cavil the next day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Lisette said, grinning. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, along the same lines, but Popper just told me that Gyfford\u2019s brew house burned down. It\u2019s a village over,\u201d Marguerite explained to Villiers and Eleanor. \u201cHalf the village is insisting that it was Gyfford\u2019s dead wife, come back for revenge. The other half of the village is much less poetic, and feels that Gyfford was smoking his pipe in bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does Gyfford say about it?\u201d Lisette inquired.</p><p>\u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019s cinders,\u201d Marguerite said.</p><p>Lisette blinked. \u201cHe was our neighbor.\u201d Her lower lip started to tremble.</p> <p>\u201cStow it,\u201d Marguerite said, rapping Lisette sharply on the hand with her spoon. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know him, and by all accounts he was a hoary old bastard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow, now, Marguerite,\u201d Bentley said. \u201cLady Eleanor is not used to your lively ways. You\u2019ll shock the poor lass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen that particular lass shocked,\u201d Villiers drawled. \u201cDo go ahead and see if you can do so, Lady Marguerite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am rarely shocked or frightened,\u201d Lisette announced. \u201cExcept by dogs, of course. Fierce dogs.\u201d She threw a meaningful look at Eleanor.</p><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t go on about that puppy again,\u201d Marguerite said, earning Eleanor\u2019s gratitude. \u201cLet\u2019s see, what else can I tell you. The dowager Lady Faber has had a horrible accident.\u201d She paused dramatically.</p> <p>\u201cDo tell,\u201d Lisette said, clapping her hands together.</p><p>\u201cShe saw an advertisement in the London Gazette for a depilatory.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny story beginning on that note will end badly,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s a depilatory?\u201d Lisette asked.</p><p>\u201cA medicine to remove hair,\u201d Marguerite told her. \u201cLady Faber rubbed it all around her mouth, and unfortunately everywhere it touched turned bright garter blue.\u201d</p><p>Lisette went off in a peal of laughter.</p> <p>\u201cAnd while it is not funny, did you hear about the Duchess of Astley?\u201d Marguerite added. \u201cYes, thank you, Popper, I will have just a trifle more. Please tell Cook that the baked carrots are extremely good.\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s head swung up and he met Eleanor\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat on earth has happened to the duchess?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>\u201cI do hope you weren\u2019t close to the poor dear,\u201d Marguerite said. \u201cYes, Popper, I think we could move on to the next course now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe duchess?\u201d Villiers repeated.</p><p>\u201cYou appear quite dismayed,\u201d Lisette observed. \u201cWas she a friend of yours, Leopold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are addressing the duke by his first name,\u201d Marguerite said, narrowing her eyes and looking from Villiers to Lisette. \u201cThat is inappropriate. You are a betrothed woman.\u201d</p><p>Villiers blinked, and Eleanor felt a perverse satisfaction. Not that a betrothal would stop Villiers, if he decided he wanted to marry Lisette.</p><p>Lisette gave her a lazy smile. \u201cLeopold is a devoted friend. And since my fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t set foot in England for six years, I hardly feel he deserves the title.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease, Lady Marguerite, how is Ada?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry if she was a friend of yours, darling. Why, I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s dead. She couldn\u2019t breathe...what day was that now? Oh, it must have been last Friday. I suppose they just put her in the ground, the poor dear. Not that I knew her, but by all accounts she was a kindly person. And so young. What a loss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was kindly,\u201d Eleanor said. She felt sick. She had never wished ill of Ada. Never.</p><p>\u201cThe duke was at the Beaumonts\u2019 benefit for the Roman baths when it happened,\u201d Marguerite said with a kind of grinding cheerfulness that made Eleanor\u2019s nausea increase. \u201cApparently his wife didn\u2019t suffer. She just coughed once or twice and then collapsed. The doctor said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if something in her brain had simply burst.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLady Eleanor is not feeling well,\u201d Villiers said, sounding to Eleanor as if his words came from far away and underwater. She gripped the edge of the table hard because the roaring in her ears made her dizzy. It was stupid to feel responsible, even the slightest bit responsible. She had never wished ill of Ada. She had...she was sure of it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a beast! I\u2019m a bear!\u201d Marguerite was lamenting. \u201cOf course I should have known that the young duchess would have friends. I never met her about London, so I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t think...Popper, Popper! Get a footman\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll escort her upstairs,\u201d Villiers said, cutting her off.</p><p>Eleanor let go of the table and rose from her chair. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly all right. It must have just been the shock. I do believe I shall retire, however.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease forgive me!\u201d Marguerite called imploringly after her.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s heart was beating a guilty rhythm.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be a fool,\u201d Villiers said harshly, behind her on the stairs.</p><p>She waited until they reached the landing. \u201cI never wished her ill. But I\u2014I wished to be her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, be grateful that you didn\u2019t get your wish,\u201d Villiers said, as unemotional as ever. \u201cYou\u2019d be measuring a plot of ground right now.\u201d But she was learning to read those gray eyes, and they said something. Not that she was sure what.</p><p>The image of Gideon standing over Ada\u2019s body was so heartbreaking that Eleanor actually swayed and caught hold of the railing.</p><p>Villiers swore and plucked her up as if she weighed no more than one of his daughters.</p><p>\u201cYou needn\u2019t,\u201d she said feebly.</p><p>\u201cBe quiet,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>So she was quiet and stopped thinking about how she felt about Ada when she was alive, and just remembered her quiet smile, the sweetness in it, and the happiness with which Ada would show her newest embroidery project. Tears began to roll down her face.</p><p>Willa pulled open the door to her bedchamber and left immediately when Villiers jerked his head. He sat down in the chair and tucked her head against his shoulder, and Eleanor sobbed as if she were no older than one of his little girls. He handed her a white handkerchief but he didn\u2019t say a word.</p><p>After a while she stopped crying, sat up, and blew her nose. \u201cI\u2019m sorry she\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must look awful,\u201d Eleanor said, remembering all her makeup.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cThe shoe black around your eyes has run in little streaks down your cheeks. You look like the sister to a zebra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not shoe black,\u201d she protested, wiping it off with his handkerchief.</p><p>\u201cI should return to the supper table,\u201d he said, not moving, staring at her with his curiously beautiful gray eyes.</p><p>\u201cTobias has exactly the same eyes you do, have you noticed?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cThe same temperament as well. And the same brute nose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a brute nose.\u201d</p><p>Villiers leaned closer, so slowly that it seemed an eternity before their noses touched. \u201cYours is quite patrician,\u201d he said. \u201cSlender, straight, narrow. Like the pathway to heaven, now that I think of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen yours is as short and wide as the path to another place,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cNothing about me is short.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNothing about you is humble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse humility is one of the seven deadly sins.\u201d</p><p>He snatched a kiss, the kind that made Eleanor realize just how much she loved kisses. How much she wanted more. How\u2014How desperate she felt. And if that wasn\u2019t humiliating, what was? She had to regain her composure.</p><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be kissing like this when Ada is just buried,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI expect at least four women around the world died during the time I kissed you. If not more.\u201d He was frighteningly good at speaking in an utterly unemotional voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? Are you telling me that you were genuinely fond of Ada?\u201d</p><p>That question was a mistake, because she thought again of how critical she had been, thinking that she herself would have been a more affectionate wife, and tears welled in her eyes again. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t fond of her, it was my own shortcoming and my own stupidity,\u201d she said, getting off his lap rather clumsily. She walked over to the black window and looked blindly out. \u201cShe was a very kind person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy do her virtues mean that I can\u2019t kiss you?\u201d Villiers said, rising from his chair.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem respectful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr do you think we shouldn\u2019t kiss because Ada\u2019s death leaves an opening for a new duchess?\u201d</p><p>It took a moment for that to sink in, and then she spun about, took one step and slapped him. They stared at each other for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Villiers said finally. \u201cI should not have implied that you wept for any reason other than the obvious. I met the duchess only once, but I cannot imagine her uttering an ill-natured comment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was her greatest accomplishment,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cShe must have known...\u201d</p><p>Villiers\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t even flicker. \u201cMust have known what?\u201d</p> <p>She was tired of all the lies she had told her mother, all the lies she had told everyone. \u201cThat Gideon and I were devoted friends,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDevoted. And yet\u2014he married Ada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had every accomplishment,\u201d Eleanor pointed out. \u201cAnd as I told you, his father\u2019s will dictated his choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had every accomplishment, except that of making people love her,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>\u201cOf course people loved her.\u201d But she knew what he was saying. Ada was so acquiescent and sweet that one easily turned a shoulder to her, walked away, forgot she was in the room. \u201cI\u2019m sure that Gideon loved his wife,\u201d she added, giving it emphasis.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Villiers said, without a smile. \u201cMore to the point, now that she has passed away, I believe that you have two dukes to consider as potential husbands.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe may be a fool, but not that much of a fool. I saw the way he looked at you.\u201d Villiers pulled her into his arms again, which was just what she wanted him to do. \u201cIt was damnably close to the way I look at you,\u201d he whispered. His mouth silenced her before she could utter her deepest fear: that Gideon had chosen sweet Ada because she was so sweet.</p> <p>She had loved Gideon, but she also wanted him, and her desire disturbed Gideon. It made him uneasy. That certainly wasn\u2019t the case for Villiers.</p><p>Villiers kissed her with the sort of passion that demanded that she respond, forced her to respond. Even now his breathing was ragged, and yet his hands were shaping her, teasing her, caressing her\u2014trying to make her mad with desire.</p><p>What had frightened Gideon about her pleased Villiers. Though she really ought to call him Leopold, given the fact that he was rapidly becoming her closest...friend. If not quite devoted, yet.</p><p>As if he read her mind, he broke away and said, \u201cSay my name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him so hard that she could feel every button in his coat, and below that, lower still...</p><p>He was hard, and he was big, and he made sure she knew it.</p><p>\u201cLeonard,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He nipped her lip.</p><p>\u201cLeander.\u201d</p><p>He really bit her this time, on the lobe of her ear. She shivered and felt a wash of heat over her body. Their eyes met and there was a slow smile in his. He bent his head and she didn\u2019t move, held her breath as he pushed aside the soft silk of her chemise dress. Of course...there was no corset. His lips closed over her nipple and he suckled her until she sagged against his arm.</p><p>\u201cSay my name,\u201d he growled.</p><p>She was the master of herself. \u201cI know!\u201d she said, voice shaky. \u201cLloyd!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a danger to yourself.\u201d Her chemise gown gave way easily on the other side, and she leaned against his shoulder again, trembling, eyes closed. He scraped his teeth across her breast and she gave a little scream.</p><p>\u201cSay it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she said, and her voice broke into a throaty cry. \u201cLeopold!\u201d</p><p>His hand replaced his mouth, gave her a rough caress that made the blood race from her head.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you call me Leopold except when I kiss you into submission?\u201d He was kissing the corners of her mouth, the line of her jaw, and all the time, his hand...She arched forward in case he wanted more of her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not proper,\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou heard Lady Marguerite.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps not in London, but in this house...with Marguerite and her devoted Lawrence? One of Lisette\u2019s most charming virtues is her utter disregard of etiquette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPropriety is important.\u201d She pushed away his hand, remembering. \u201cYou should go downstairs. They might be wondering where you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that,\u201d he said with a lopsided smile. \u201cThey know exactly where we both are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing. You must return; I shall retire for the evening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRisqu\u00e9 Roland will be heartbroken if you miss the scintillating musical interval that awaits us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe will have to suffer,\u201d Eleanor said, pulling her bodice back into its crisscross shape. Her whole body was pulsing a little, as if her very blood was dancing.</p><p>Villiers was adjusting his cravat in front of the glass. \u201cYou\u2019ve crushed my neckcloth. I\u2019ll have to stop by my chamber to fetch another.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy bother?\u201d</p><p>He raised an eyebrow. \u201cGo downstairs with a crushed cravat?\u201d</p><p>She mimicked him. \u201cCall you by your first name in public?\u201d</p><p>He took one step toward her and the light in his eyes made her knees weaken. \u201cI can make you do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can crush all your cravats,\u201d she said loftily.</p><p>\u201cFor the right cause,\u201d he said, turning toward the door, \u201ca man might discard any number of cravats. There are two armchairs in my chamber.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never visit your chamber,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cHow can you even ask?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask,\u201d Villiers pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI merely commented that there are two such chairs, and then I was about to add that I intend to instruct Finchley to place those chairs on the balcony. That way, should anyone desire to join me, it would be possible to have a glass of brandy while looking at the stars.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat sounds monstrously improper,\u201d Eleanor observed.</p><p>\u201cMy favorite kind of activity.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>She should probably stop by her mother\u2019s room and inquire about her toothache. And she ought to write a note of condolence to Gideon. Instead Eleanor called for a bath, added essence of jasmine, and climbed in holding Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnets.</p> <p>Willa took down her curls and brushed out all the wilting violets. Then she poured a bit more hot water from the jug into the bath.</p><p>\u201cWould you mind if I went down to the kitchens to finish ironing your linens, my lady?\u201d she inquired.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cThis bath is deliciously warm. Just leave me a towel and I\u2019ll get out when I wish.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s right there,\u201d Willa said, \u201cbut your wrapper is downstairs to be mended, I\u2019m afraid. Oyster dragged it from the bed and snagged the fabric.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOyster!\u201d Eleanor said. He raised his head groggily and gave her a little woof before subsiding again. \u201cHas he been outside lately?\u201d</p> <p>Willa frowned. \u201cPerhaps I should take him for a walk as well, my lady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can put myself to bed, Willa, if you would just bring him up later.\u201d</p><p>Willa let herself out and Eleanor returned to Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets, which probably everyone in the world had read except for her. That fact made it all the more disconcerting to discover that she couldn\u2019t make head or tail of most of them.</p><p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments, she read. And then read it again. An impediment was an obstacle. It made her feel a little sad, really. She and Gideon had been a marriage of true minds until an impediment came along.</p><p>She and Villiers spent their time jousting with each other, whereas she and Gideon had thought as one. They had talked for countless hours and agreed on everything, though all these years later, she couldn\u2019t remember what those discussions were about.</p><p>He belived dueling was a terrible sin, she remembered that. Of course she agreed. There was no point to dueling. It was dangerous.</p> <p>She dragged herself back to the sonnet. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.</p><p>This line was even harder. Alteration? Could Shakespeare be talking about getting older? So love is not love if a man stops loving his wife because her hair turns gray. Her love for Gideon would never have faltered if he lost his beauty. Or bends with the remover to remove.</p><p>Again, unreasonably difficult, she thought. Just who was the remover?</p><p>The thing that made her uneasy, though, was that first line. She kept reading it over and over. Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. True love doesn\u2019t admit impediments. Gideon\u2019s father\u2019s will had been an impediment. And Gideon obviously admitted the impediment.</p><p>Had he not loved her?</p><p>The water was growing cold. She climbed out and grabbed the towel Willa had left. Why was she going over all this old ground? But she knew why. She had to put Gideon out of her mind, fold away her memories of feverish love.</p><p>Ada was gone. But that didn\u2019t mean Gideon wanted to marry her, that he loved her the way she had loved him.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t delude herself any longer. Love was not love when it admitted impediments. When it bent with the remover to remove. Gideon had bent to his father\u2019s will.</p> <p>It would be far better to marry Villiers. Their relationship was not as heady, not as romantic\u2014but what emotion they had was real.</p><p>She and Villiers would never fool themselves into thinking they had a marriage of true minds. It would be a different kind of marriage. That of true bodies.</p><p>Willa brought Oyster back; after an energetic tail-wagging wiggle, the better to show how much he missed her, he collapsed back on the floor and Willa left for the night. A moment later Oyster shot up and launched himself at the curtains covering the door leading to the balcony.</p><p>Eleanor found herself smiling. Villiers must have returned from dinner. He was likely sitting in one of those armchairs, looking at the stars. She looked down at herself. Her towel didn\u2019t cover much more of her legs than Villiers\u2019s had his.</p><p>But then, she liked her legs. They were shapely. And she and Villiers were getting married, after all. She tucked the towel more securely around her breasts, loving the feeling that she was playing with fire, and walked to the door, hushing Oyster.</p><p>It was pitch-dark outside. Oyster started barking again, so she scooped him up, almost losing her towel, and stepped outside.</p><p>\u201cIs anyone out here?\u201d she called cautiously.</p><p>\u201cAh, my princess!\u201d came a response.</p><p>Eleanor fell back a step.</p><p>\u201cShe appears before me like the shadow of a white rose in a mirror of silver.\u201d Roland\u2019s head came into view at the top of the balcony railing.</p><p>Oyster gave an aggressive little woof. Apparently he didn\u2019t care for poetry.</p><p>She had to admit that Roland spoke verse beautifully. \u201cOh, hello,\u201d she said, taking another step backwards toward the door to her room and wishing desperately that she had her wrapper. \u201cAre you quite\u2014\u201d</p><p>He interrupted her. \u201cShe has the beauty of a virgin! She has never defiled herself. She has never abandoned herself to men, like the other goddesses.\u201d</p><p>Oyster barked again, and Eleanor felt like joining him. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2014ahem\u2014very kind of you,\u201d she managed. Never mind the fact it wasn\u2019t true. \u201cAre you on a ladder, Sir Roland?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCertainly,\u201d Roland said, making no effort to climb onto the balcony. \u201cI am acting out my play for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re standing on a silk ladder!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cPlease do come onto the balcony, Sir Roland. I\u2019m worried for your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made of wood,\u201d he said. \u201cNow if you\u2019ll allow me to gather my thoughts...\u201d There was silence for a moment and then he intoned in such a booming voice that she jumped, \u201cThe night is fair in the garden, and my princess has eyes like amber.\u201d He flung out a hand and gestured to the sky. \u201cHow strange the moon looks! Like the hand of a dead woman seeking to cover herself with a shroud.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked up, but the moon looked pretty much the same as usual to her, and it had never included dead women or shrouds. In fact, that comment was in fairly poor taste, given the news about Ada...but then Roland hadn\u2019t been there during dinner. But surely he was told when he arrived for the musicale why she had retired early.</p><p>He ascended another rung. Now she could see him from the waist up. His eyes were burning with excitement. Or desire.</p><p>That made her feel rather pleased, but unfortunately not at all as if she\u2019d like to pull him to her, the way she felt when Villiers issued one of his sardonic jibes.</p><p>And yet Roland really was beautiful. In the light that fell from the windows behind her, he looked like the prince from an old fairy tale, climbing the tower to rescue a princess.</p><p>\u201cThy body is white like the snows that lie on the mountains of Judea, and come down into the valleys,\u201d he said. Eleanor could feel her cheeks getting a little warm. She refused to glance down at her bare legs, but of course her body was white. Why wouldn\u2019t it be?</p><p>\u201cThe roses in the garden of the Queen of Arabia are not so white as thy body,\u201d Roland said feverishly. \u201cNor the feet of the dawn when they light on the leaves, nor the breast of the moon when she lies on the breast of the sea...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cToo many breasts,\u201d came a deadpan voice at her left shoulder.</p><p>Eleanor jumped and uttered a little scream. \u201cVilliers!\u201d Then she looked back at the poet. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, Sir Roland.\u201d</p><p>But Roland wasn\u2019t there any longer. \u201cOh, no!\u201d she cried, dropping Oyster and running forward. Sure enough, the ladder was slowly swinging away from the house, the poet clinging to the top of it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, he won\u2019t! He might\u2014he might\u2014\u201d</p><p>The ladder gained speed as it went down and finally crashed. There was a sound of splintering wood. Eleanor peered into the dark, trying to figure out where Roland had landed.</p><p>\u201cHelp, someone!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cGo see what happened! Go get help. Don\u2019t just stand there\u2014are you laughing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, princess. Just wait a moment. Your swain liveth.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see exactly what was happening, but someone was cursing and it sounded like Roland.</p> <p>\u201cI estimate that he landed in the raspberry bushes,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHe probably hit them dead on. Not good for his clothing. Or,\u201d he added thoughtfully, \u201cdelicate parts of his anatomy. But the good news is that he landed rump down rather than the other way around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSir Roland!\u201d Eleanor called, ignoring the jaundiced commentary at her shoulder. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>There were thrashing noises.</p><p>\u201cDo you want help? Shall I call someone?\u201d</p><p>A door had opened onto the gardens now, and a couple of servants were cautiously emerging.</p><p>\u201cGo help Sir Roland out of the raspberry bushes,\u201d she called over the balcony.</p> <p>They peered up at her and then set out across the lawn.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go help?\u201d she asked crossly, turning to Leopold.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding up your towel,\u201d he said. She could just barely see his smile in the light from the doorway. If Roland looked like a troubadour, Villiers looked like Lucifer himself, all dark shadows and pure lust.</p><p>He dropped the grip he had on the back of her towel and fell back a step. All of a sudden she could feel the place where his hand had touched her skin, burning as if he had branded her.</p><p>Below them, Roland was being hauled out of the raspberry bushes. Eleanor tore her eyes away from Villiers and tucked her towel more securely around her. \u201cSir Roland, are you quite all right?\u201d she called, turning to lean out over the balcony.</p><p>He was limping across the lawn, supported by one of the footmen. A lock of hair had fallen over his face, making him look like a beautiful, fallen warrior.</p><p>\u201cYour poetry is sublime,\u201d Eleanor called, hoping Villiers would keep himself out of sight. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you were startled and the ladder slipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was pushed,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Eleanor blinked. \u201cOh, no, I assure you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cPushed by words!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWords?\u201d she repeated.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t see Villiers. She couldn\u2019t hear him or feel him. But she knew that he was shaking with laughter.</p><p>\u201cThe force of sarcasm pushed me from the perch of love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh. Well...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey jest at scars that never felt a wound.\u201d He limped past and into the house without another word. She was still bent over the balcony, looking down, when a large male body encircled hers from behind.</p><p>He was warm, burning...hard...strong. She suddenly felt, as if through his body, the provocative tilt of her bottom as she leaned over the balustrade. Where his body touched hers, she felt the impress of his desire, as if she were experiencing her curves through his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou could drive a man insane,\u201d Leopold said. His lips were on her neck, but it wasn\u2019t his lips that she felt most acutely. She wriggled against him. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d His voice grated in her ear but she moved anyway, straightening.</p><p>He allowed her, of course. She turned around, hitching up her towel once again. \u201cNow I know why women wear such large panniers,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cTo repel their admirers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecisely. Now if you\u2019ll forgive me, I shall retire for the night.\u201d</p><p>He caught her hand. \u201cAre you marrying me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought,\u201d she said, picking her words carefully, \u201cthat you were rather admiring of Lisette, and might wish to make her your duchess. And I say that without prejudice, Leopold, as one intelligent person to another. I hope we can speak to each other without tempests of emotion.\u201d</p><p>His smile was all the more welcome for being so rare. \u201cYou are an unusual woman, Eleanor. Though I don\u2019t think I like that name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me it\u2019s heavy and I\u2019ll push you directly off the balcony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a leaf from the poor poet\u2019s book and call you princess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no princess,\u201d she said, laughing. \u201cThough my mother tells me that you live in a castle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince I never go to that particular estate, you\u2019d have to settle for my other houses.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as if he\u2019d made a joke, because there was something odd about his voice that didn\u2019t welcome any further questions.</p><p>\u201cI will admit, then, that I\u2019m torn between the two of you,\u201d he said abruptly.</p><p>Something in her heart, in her chest, in her stomach\u2014somewhere\u2014fell with a resounding thump. She managed to keep her voice light and even. \u201cBetween myself and Lisette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am persuaded that she would be a truly superb mother for my children. She seems to have no regard whatsoever for the circumstances of their birth, either in the way she treats them here, in her house, or in her daily work with orphans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have never known Lisette to display the least prejudice toward any sort of person,\u201d Eleanor said, adding, \u201cThough she is quite unreasonable toward dogs.\u201d</p><p>Villiers smiled. \u201cPoor Oyster has not made an admirer there, it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor thought that the way people acted toward dogs, especially innocent puppies, said a great deal about them, but she held her tongue.</p><p>\u201cBut then when I think about marrying you,\u201d Villiers said, his voice deepening, \u201cwell...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think about bedding me,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>He didn\u2019t move toward her, but the flame that was always between them suddenly leaped higher. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible not to do so,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about you first thing in the morning when I wake, and last thing at night. And,\u201d he added thoughtfully, \u201ca good deal in between as well.\u201d</p><p>All Eleanor could think of was dropping the towel and moving toward him. But she had succumbed to pleasure before, and it had ended in heartbreak. Not that she could ever love Villiers the way she had loved Gideon, but she must have learned something from her mistakes. Hadn\u2019t she?</p><p>She should return to her room. She didn\u2019t move.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about the way you move, the way you laugh, the way you snap at me that I find\u2014appealing,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>He was making her sound like a warmed-over apple tart.</p><p>\u201cYet I swore to myself that I would find the best mother possible for my children. This evening, Lisette was wonderful in the nursery. The girls adore her already. I asked her how she would handle the ton when the children grew up.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d Eleanor asked, feeling that she ought to make some contribution, or else she might give voice to a scream: Are you as cracked as Lisette?</p><p>\u201cShe snapped her fingers and said that she would teach them to care nothing for such foolishness. Of course, she herself doesn\u2019t care. She lives here so happily, without being caught in the absurd farce that makes up our social life.\u201d</p><p>Several things came to mind, but they all seemed too severe, so Eleanor said merely, \u201cLisette truly does not care for societal conventions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s as if she\u2019s designed to mother these particular children,\u201d Villiers said.</p> <p>\u201cYou are not bound to me in any fashion,\u201d Eleanor pointed out. \u201cI announced our betrothal merely to placate my mother, as I\u2019m sure you realized. Or perhaps I meant to irritate her. I\u2019m quite certain that one would do better not to initiate a marriage on such flimsy grounds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably not,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>His smile twisted something inside her, so she said, rather quickly, \u201cWell, now that we\u2019ve settled that, I really should retire. It\u2019s growing chilly and I\u2019m not properly dressed.\u201d</p><p>But he didn\u2019t move, and neither did she.</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he said finally, very quietly.</p> <p>And when he crossed those two steps between them, she wound her arms around his neck as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Neither of them moved for a moment. She could feel the heat and hardness of his body.</p><p>Finally she leaned in and simply touched her tongue to his lips. \u201cHello,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s my name?\u201d he whispered back.</p><p>\u201cLucifer!\u201d</p><p>The lines by his eyes crinkled and she knew he was smiling at her, but it didn\u2019t matter because he bent his head and kissed her. It was slow, it was possessive, it was voluptuous. He was a master of the kiss...and the master of her.</p><p>With one slow movement, he brought his palm down over her hair and hooked a finger under the edge of her towel.</p> <p>\u201cLeopold!\u201d she said, breaking away from his kiss.</p><p>\u201cAh, you remembered my name.\u201d He looked so much younger, grinning at her in the moonlight. His teeth were very white; his hair was out of its ribbon and he looked free.</p><p>She suddenly realized that the way he loved to play with her, to provoke her to call him by other names so he would kiss her harder, was dangerous\u2014not only to her reputation, but also to her heart.</p><p>Even now his finger was tracing a little flower on her back, inside the dip of her towel.</p><p>\u201cI must go inside,\u201d she said. \u201cI really must.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSay my name one more time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers.\u201d She met his eyes. \u201cLet go of my towel, if you please.\u201d</p><p>With a rueful smile in his eyes, he left one final touch on her back, a touch that burned like fire, and stepped back.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll inform my mother tomorrow morning,\u201d she said.</p><p>She could tell that he\u2019d forgotten the subject, and it gave her a queer spasm of female pride. \u201cI\u2019ll tell my mother that we shall not marry,\u201d she clarified. \u201cSo that you can speak to Lisette. Unless...you already have?\u201d</p><p>His eyes cooled. \u201cI have many faults, but bigamy has never been one of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not married,\u201d she protested.</p><p>He bowed and turned away, but she wasn\u2019t going to allow that.</p><p>\u201cLeopold!\u201d she snapped, reaching out for his arm. \u201cWe are not children, and I won\u2019t tolerate your silent reproach merely because I queried you.\u201d</p><p>He opened his mouth, shut it, said finally: \u201cI would never speak to another woman about marriage while betrothed to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know if you considered yourself betrothed. After all, I simply announced the fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I considered myself betrothed,\u201d he said, the chill in his eyes easing. \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m still betrothed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you leave the balcony, and I leave the balcony.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, but something in his face made the laughter fade.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a man, princess, nothing more, nothing less.\u201d With one movement, so swift that she didn\u2019t even see it, he plucked her towel away and dropped it to the ground. She was so startled that she didn\u2019t even squeak. Didn\u2019t try to cover herself or run for the door.</p><p>Their eyes caught and he didn\u2019t lower his. \u201cMay I?\u201d he asked.</p><p>They weren\u2019t marrying, after all. He was going to marry Lisette, who had children following her like the Pied Piper. This was merely...</p><p>This was merely a dalliance in the moonlight.</p><p>She felt a surge of womanly power, a force as seductive as the shape of his body. \u201cYou may look,\u201d she instructed. \u201cBut you may not touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t belong to me. I have no right to touch.\u201d</p><p>True enough. He\u2019d chosen Lisette. And some small, mean part of her mind thought that\u2014well, to be truthful, it wasn\u2019t a small part of her mind. With her whole mind she thought he was even more blind than Lisette was crazy, which was to say: completely.</p><p>He deserved what he got. And just like Gideon, he deserved to lose what he was about to lose. So she stepped back and smiled, releasing his eyes from their voluntary bondage.</p><p>Of course, being Leopold, he surprised her. His eyes moved so slowly.</p><p>If he were naked, she wouldn\u2019t even know where to look first...Perhaps his chest. She knew it was muscled, but...and his stomach. Lower. The way his thighs felt when pressed against hers, hard and potent.</p><p>Her imagination made her own body change, feel liquid and powerful. She opened her legs slightly, not even glancing at the discarded towel, and leaned back against the balustrade.</p><p>Leopold was inspecting her as slowly as if she were a sovereign he suspected of being copper rather than true gold. She arched her back a little. She liked the way her breasts curved, and her delicate pink nipples, and the way those nipples didn\u2019t point downwards, like some women\u2019s did.</p><p>His breath was ragged but he was taking too long in his inspection, so she bent over to pick up the towel, taking her time.</p><p>When she straightened, she met his eyes again. The look in them was smoky and seductive, and made her feel as if she might do something foolish. It was time to leave.</p><p>She blew him a kiss.</p><p>He groaned as if he was in pain.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She left.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 19, 1784</p><p>The next morning, Eleanor walked over to the other wing of the house, trailed by Oyster and a footman with a tea service. Anne was sitting up in bed, reading. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cTea!\u201d Anne cried rapturously. \u201cYou are my favorite of all sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the most easily bribed of mine,\u201d Eleanor said, sitting down with her cup of tea.</p><p>\u201cMarie, will you come back in two minutes?\u201d Anne asked her maid. And then: \u201cShe told me about Ada. I\u2019m so sorry, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no reason to give me particular condolences.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, there is,\u201d her younger sister said, smiling ruefully. \u201cI\u2019ve known you for years, after all. I would guess that you stayed up half the night weeping into your pillow.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAda deserved tears. She had a terribly short life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. I do agree. But it\u2019s not your fault, my dear. And I would guess yours were guilty tears.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor nodded. But what was there to be said about it, after all? She had liked Ada, but Ada was gone, and there was no changing that. \u201cVilliers has decided to marry Lisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a bad thing for you,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThough it certainly is for him. Lisette really is eccentric, the poor thing. She\u2019s not made for marriage. She is best here, in the place where everyone knows her and makes allowances for her behavior. Does Villiers still fancy himself as a rescuer of fair maidens?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe he fancies her as an excellent mother.\u201d</p><p>Anne snorted. \u201cThis is the most wonderful book,\u201d she said, waving it at Eleanor. \u201cIt\u2019s called The Castle of Otranto. I scared myself silly last night when the son of the lord was crushed to death by a monstrous helmet that falls out of the sky just before he was supposed to be married. Have you read it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still trying to read Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cSo boring,\u201d Anne said. \u201cSonnets all just talk about one thing, really. But this book has portraits that sigh mysteriously, and bits of armor falling out of the clouds. And now Lord Manfred is trying to divorce his wife to marry his son\u2019s fianc\u00e9e...I believe I shall just stay in bed and read the whole thing today. I can\u2019t possibly survive another night unless I\u2019ve found out how it ends. This house creaks terribly in the dark.\u201d</p><p>There was a knock on the door and Anne\u2019s maid reentered. \u201cDo you happen to know how the duchess is feeling?\u201d Eleanor asked her.</p> <p>\u201cHer Grace had a poor night,\u201d Marie reported. \u201cBut the surgeon comes today and he\u2019ll pull out the tooth. Meanwhile Lady Marguerite gave a great bottle of laudanum to Her Grace\u2019s maid, and so Her Grace is fast asleep. Lady Marguerite told the maid to keep her that way so that the tooth can just be pulled before she wakes up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh dear,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure Mother would much rather be asleep. She is not fond of pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is?\u201d Anne said. \u201cI gather you are clambering up on a horse this morning, Eleanor? I must say, that habit is just lovely, and I didn\u2019t even pick it out myself.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor glanced down at herself. For almost the first time since arriving, she was wearing a costume that she herself had ordered. The habit was made of blue ribbed silk with a deep turned-down collar behind.</p><p>\u201cI particularly like your coattails,\u201d Anne added.</p><p>\u201cWhy should men be able to wear coattails and not women?\u201d Eleanor agreed, tipping her tall hat a little farther forward over her eyes. It was blue as well, and had two jaunty tassels that hung to her shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cMay I offer my felicitations on your betrothal to the Duke of Villiers, my lady?\u201d Marie asked.</p><p>\u201cYou may not,\u201d Anne said promptly. \u201cMy sister has decided not to marry the duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose children!\u201d Marie cried immediately, clasping her hands. \u201cI absolutely understand, my lady. The household is convulsed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConvulsed?\u201d Eleanor repeated. \u201cThat seems an odd word choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPopper is a very pious man, you understand. He has all of the maids praying three times a day. Then the duke brings these children in the house and of course they\u2019re\u2014\u201d She broke off.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re bastards,\u201d Anne put in cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cPopper was distraught enough when the first one arrived, thinking the boy was a limb of Satan and so on. But Lady Lisette just told him not to be tiresome, and the Duke of Villiers pays no heed to Popper, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure he just waved his fingers disdainfully,\u201d Eleanor said.</p> <p>\u201cThe first day wasn\u2019t too bad, but then when the two little girls arrived...well, there\u2019s been a terrible commotion belowstairs. Popper isn\u2019t anything compared to Mrs. Busy, the cook. She told the upstairs maid that her immortal soul might be in danger if she cleared the grate in the nursery. And she keeps sending up gruel because she says that meat does something to flesh and causes carnal provocations...I think I have that right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s purely cruel,\u201d Eleanor said sharply. \u201cThose are innocent children and they ought to be treated well. Did you say the cook\u2019s name is Mrs. Busy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Zeal-of-the-Land Busy,\u201d Marie said.</p><p>\u201cZeal of the what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeal-of-the-Land Busy,\u201d Marie repeated. \u201cHer husband was a famous preacher in London\u2014a Puritan, of course\u2014until he died from a surfeit of boiled pig and she was forced to go into service.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolute rubbish,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAre you telling me that Popper agrees with this extraordinary behavior?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, he does and he doesn\u2019t. He did tell Lady Lisette about the gruel, and she said that some gruel wouldn\u2019t hurt them, and that Popper should just make peace in the household. From what they say, Lady Lisette does not like to involve herself in household matters. And I\u2019m afraid that Lady Marguerite travels a great deal of the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, she\u2019s here now, and she ought to be boxing Mrs. Zeal-of-the-Land\u2019s ears,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cActually Lady Marguerite is not here,\u201d Marie said. \u201cShe rose early this morning and she and Mr. Bentley went on a trip to Royal Tunbridge Wells. She left you a note.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat an interesting life Lady Marguerite leads!\u201d Anne said with delight. \u201cI expect I shall be just the same, if I find myself widowed. Not that I would wish to be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall go to the kitchens myself,\u201d Eleanor said. She was experiencing a nice burst of pure rage, which had swept away the melancholy. She hated melancholy. \u201cI shall bring Oyster,\u201d she added. If Lisette was going to allow children in her house to be fed nothing but gruel, she would simply have to tolerate the presence of a fat, cheerful puppy.</p><p>\u201cGo forth and conquer!\u201d Anne said, settling back into bed. \u201cPerhaps I shall see you at supper, and perhaps not. It all depends on whether a whole suite of armor smashes the castle.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor walked down the front stairs, planning to sweep up Popper and take him along with her. Clearly he was a weak link in the household, but at the least he could back her up when it came to children\u2019s need for more than gruel to eat.</p><p>Oyster started barking energetically the moment they rounded the curve of the stair, so she peered down and saw Villiers standing in the entrance hall.</p><p>For a moment her heart bounded\u2014it had been so much fun toying with him and thinking of marrying him but then she remembered that he had chosen Lisette over her. So she said, \u201cOyster, be quiet,\u201d not loudly, but there must have been something in her tone because he actually obeyed.</p><p>The duke was as polite as ever, which was to say not very. He had a way of bowing that implied he was above such observances.</p><p>That being the case, she didn\u2019t curtsy to him, just pulled on her gloves. She wasn\u2019t going to touch anything in Mrs. Zeal-of-the-Gut\u2019s kitchen with her bare hands.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cWhen you bow as if you give a damn, I\u2019ll bother to bend my knee to you again.\u201d She gave him a sweet smile. Then she turned to Popper. \u201cI\u2019ll thank you to show me the kitchens.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhat, my lady?\u201d he said, starting to stammer because he was that sort of man.</p><p>Eleanor was her mother\u2019s daughter, even though she didn\u2019t choose to act as such most of the time. She pinned the butler to the wall with one look and then said, softly, \u201cThe kitchens, Popper.\u201d</p><p>Oyster gave a little whine by her leg. At least someone knew when she meant business.</p><p>\u201cOf course, my lady,\u201d Popper cried, pulling open the green baize door at the back of the entrance hall so quickly that it banged against the wall.</p> <p>\u201cEleanor?\u201d she heard Villiers say behind her.</p><p>She looked at him over her shoulder. \u201cHousekeeping matters,\u201d she said coolly. \u201cYou continue on with whatever you were doing. Play some chess or something.\u201d</p><p>She heard him snort. He followed her through the door, but she paid him no mind.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Mrs. Zeal-of-the-Land, Popper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do hope that breakfast was to your satisfaction, my lady?\u201d Popper trotted backwards down the servants\u2019 corridor, at imminent risk of bouncing into a wall. His round face was creased with anxiety.</p> <p>\u201cPerfectly acceptable,\u201d Eleanor said dryly. \u201cNo prayers delivered with my eggs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrayers?\u201d Villiers echoed.</p><p>They reached the kitchen. Popper thrust open the door and then flattened himself against the wall to allow her to pass.</p><p>\u201cPrayers?\u201d Villiers asked again, from a few paces behind Eleanor. But she had turned into a woman intent on battle, a species he recognized, so he wasn\u2019t surprised when she ignored him.</p><p>The kitchen was enormous and appeared to have changed little since medieval times. One wall was taken up by a fireplace with five spits rotating before it, thanks to a half-asleep boy operating some sort of a treadmill with his feet. Every last inch of the other walls was covered with shelves holding china, held upright by small wooden dowels. There were rows of teapots fenced in and adorned with strings of onions and garlic. Up above hung strings of sausages and cuts of other meats that Villiers couldn\u2019t identify.</p><p>There had to be ten people at work, carrying food about, stirring things on a big iron stove, washing crockery, or in the case of an elderly gentleman, sleeping in the corner.</p> <p>\u201cLady Eleanor. His Grace the Duke of Villiers,\u201d bellowed Popper.</p><p>A large woman turned about from the stove and squinted at them. \u201cI don\u2019t hold with visits to my kitchen.\u201d She turned her head. \u201cWitless, if you don\u2019t keep them spits turning I\u2019ll put you on one of them!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSister Busy,\u201d Popper said, wringing his hands. \u201cMake the duke and lady welcome. Be charitable, Mrs. Busy, be charitable!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor advanced to the center of the kitchen. The cook had scarlet cheeks and small eyes, not to mention a huge, dripping ladle.</p><p>\u201cI would like some bacon for breakfast,\u201d she said, walking forward as if the ladle were no threat.</p><p>The cook\u2019s small eyes narrowed. \u201cI don\u2019t hold with pork,\u201d she said shrilly. \u201cThe spice of idolatry, I call it! And what are you doing, bringing a mongrel into my kitchen!\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon is meat, and it is nourishing meat,\u201d Eleanor said coldly. Villiers had never heard quite that tone in her voice before, and he was glad of it. \u201cI want bacon and eggs sent up to the nursery immediately.\u201d</p><p>The cook slammed her ladle back into the large pot so hard that boiling soup splashed out on the stove and the floor. \u201cSo this is what you\u2019re about!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Eleanor stated.</p><p>Why on earth was she fussing over the children\u2019s breakfast? Villiers could have told her that Tobias had it all in hand, what with his bribes to the footman, but there wasn\u2019t time to interrupt.</p><p>\u201cFood is not meant to be gorged with gluttony or greediness,\u201d the cook said shrilly. \u201cNor to be eaten by those who are an abomination under the Lord!\u201d</p><p>For the first time Villiers noticed that Eleanor held a riding crop, and he grew a little concerned. She was running her fingers over it as if it were a delicate ribbon. Mrs. Busy didn\u2019t look like the type of woman to be intimidated.</p><p>\u201cI would hesitate to categorize anyone as indulging in gluttony,\u201d Eleanor said, her eyes lingering unpleasantly on the cook\u2019s admittedly abundant curves. \u201cBut I do know that those children cannot thrive on a diet of gruel.\u201d</p><p>Villiers froze.</p><p>Mrs. Busy\u2019s small mean eyes darted to him and then back to Eleanor. \u201cMeat breeds foul temptations! Carnal provocations! Those children are the seed of the devil and their appetites will be strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are the foul face of the devil,\u201d Eleanor said, taking another step forward.</p><p>She didn\u2019t do anything with the whip, but the cook flinched.</p><p>\u201cIf you do not send up a nourishing meal, including at least two kinds of meat, within the hour, I will have you turned out on the road, Mrs. Zeal-of-the-Land Busy. You will no longer be so busy. Do you understand me?\u201d</p><p>Mrs. Busy didn\u2019t answer. A drop of sweat ran down her forehead.</p><p>\u201cShe understands,\u201d Popper said, popping up between them. \u201cShe does, don\u2019t you, Sister Busy? She knows that the children are innocent creatures who aren\u2019t to blame for the circumstances of their wicked conception. Children, Sister Busy,\u201d he implored. \u201cJust children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAye,\u201d the cook said slowly.</p><p>Villiers stood behind Eleanor, the truth of it slowly sinking in. Apparently the gruel Tobias complained of wasn\u2019t just Mrs. Busy\u2019s idea of a child\u2019s diet, but something of a purgative. Thank God, Tobias had taken care of himself.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s face looked as if it were carved of the finest marble, as if the goddess Athena had come to life.</p><p>Mrs. Busy was no match for her. \u201cI\u2019ll send them breakfast,\u201d she said, wilting.</p><p>\u201cAnd every meal, as long as those children are here. If I hear that there is the least inadequacy, if you misplace an herb or forget an ingredient, I shall return.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall not. I sought merely to curb the\u2014the\u2014\u201d</p><p>Something in Eleanor\u2019s gaze warned against an explanation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll send excellent meals,\u201d Mrs. Busy said hastily.</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cThen I\u2019ll bid you good day, Mrs. Zeal-of-the-Land Busy. Oyster, come.\u201d</p><p>Villiers waited until she left the kitchen, because he didn\u2019t want Eleanor to feel that he didn\u2019t trust her success. Mrs. Busy didn\u2019t stir, just waited, with her eyes fixed on him. \u201cMy children are not an abomination,\u201d he stated, hearing his own cold voice and knowing there were few brave enough to endure the sound without flinching.</p><p>\u201cThat they are not,\u201d Mrs. Busy readily agreed, showing that she wasn\u2019t one of the brave.</p><p>Villiers turned to go.</p><p>\u201cBut you are!\u201d she burst out. \u201cVerily, I must say the truth and that is that thou dwellest in the tents of the wicked and feedest the vanity of the eye.\u201d</p><p>Apparently she didn\u2019t care for his coat. Or perhaps it was the embroidery that was spurring her censure.</p><p>\u201cI am moved by the spirit to say so!\u201d Mrs. Busy insisted.</p><p>\u201cAs long as the tents of the wicked are replete with the smiles of beautiful women,\u201d Villiers said, \u201cI shall be happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shall daunt the profaneness of mine enemies,\u201d Mrs. Busy stated. \u201cWhen sin provokes me, I shall not be silent.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSister Busy,\u201d implored Popper. \u201cCry you mercy, Sister Busy, consider your place in life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd while you are contemplating that, Mrs. Busy, you might include the thought that I may well marry your mistress, Lady Lisette,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cIn which case this house will become one vast tent for my wicked self. And then you, Mrs. Busy, will need to thrust yourself onto the sanctified highway because I may well bring all six of my children to live under this roof. In case you are wondering, none of the six was conceived with the benefit of matrimony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSix!\u201d she gasped, falling back and regarding him as if he were the very devil himself. \u201cThou tellest untruths. No man is so rank in the face of the Lord.\u201d</p><p>Against all odds, Villiers was beginning to enjoy himself. \u201cAre you gnashing your teeth, Mrs. Busy? That\u2019s an odd sound you\u2019re making.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThou art a Nebuchadnezzar, a very Nebuchadnezzar, come to mock me!\u201d Mrs. Busy said.</p><p>One of the pot boys giggled.</p><p>\u201cSister Busy,\u201d Popper implored.</p><p>\u201cI must take my leave,\u201d Villiers said with a flourishing bow. \u201cThank you for this charming conversation.\u201d</p><p>Popper ran after him down the corridor. \u201cI beg your pardon, Your Grace,\u201d he said, panting.</p> <p>Villiers stopped. \u201cWhat relation is she to you?\u201d</p><p>Popper rang his hands. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister, Your Grace. We were raised Puritan, you see, but she took to it fiercely, and then she married Zeal-of-the-Land, and I\u2019m afraid that she became rather rigid. She needs this position. She has nowhere else to go, and Zeal-of-the-Land left all his possessions to the church.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe left everything to the church?\u201d</p><p>Popper nodded. \u201cWith a request that they say prayers for his soul four times a day for a year. Which they will, because it transpired that Brother Busy had acquired quite a large estate. But unfortunately his will left my sister destitute and in need of a position. Please, Your Grace, I know that she\u2019s a fierce woman. But Brother Busy\u2019s death left her soured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can imagine,\u201d Villiers said, pushing open the baize door that led back to the foyer.</p><p>They emerged into chaos. Oyster was barking hysterically and running in circles, Eleanor was shouting, one of the footmen was chasing the dog, and Lisette was standing on the second or third step of the staircase, screaming. Into all of this rushed Popper, uttering useless admonitions in a shrill voice.</p> <p>\u201cQuiet!\u201d Villiers bellowed.</p><p>Everyone obeyed him except, characteristically, Eleanor. She whipped around, hands on her hips, and said through clenched teeth, \u201cEscort Lisette elsewhere before I do something I may\u2014or may not\u2014regret.\u201d</p><p>Oyster had dropped onto his haunches and was gazing at him in a rather charmingly attentive position, so Villiers raised a finger to the footman, who scooped up the dog. \u201cTake him outside,\u201d he commanded before turning to Lisette.</p><p>She was clinging to the banister, her face absolutely drained of color. Although she had stopped screaming, she was obviously paralyzed with fright.</p><p>\u201cLisette,\u201d he said, coming to the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>She looked at him, her face pathetically wan, her blue eyes huge.</p><p>\u201cPoor scrap,\u201d he said, and held out his arms. She fell into them and he scooped her up. She put her head against his shoulder, as trustingly as if she were a child.</p><p>\u201cTake her into the drawing room,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI\u2019ll go outside and make sure that Oyster is out of sight and sound.\u201d She said it flatly, without an edge, but Villiers could read her voice easily enough.</p> <p>He looked down at Lisette\u2019s spun-gold hair. She wasn\u2019t the bravest of creatures, but there was no point in defending her at the moment. Besides, Eleanor had already stamped out the door after Oyster.</p><p>So he walked into the drawing room and sat down on a sofa. After a moment Lisette eased off his lap and onto the bench beside him. \u201cI\u2019m quite irrational when it comes to dogs.\u201d Big tears made her eyes glisten. \u201cI hate being such a coward.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany people are afraid of dogs,\u201d he said, trying to sound consoling, although sympathy wasn\u2019t exactly his forte. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to apologize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOyster is likely a quite nice dog.\u201d She was twisting her fingers around and around each other. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I had such a terrible experience last year in the village. A feral dog was threatening everyone, and there were children in the square. I had to protect them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTerrible,\u201d Villiers said, only half listening.</p><p>\u201cIf we marry,\u201d Lisette said, \u201cyou must promise me that we will have no hounds on the premises.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we marry?\u201d he echoed, snapping to attention.</p><p>It was the second time in as many days that a woman had announced their imminent marriage without bothering to wait for his proposal. In this case, he hadn\u2019t even broached the idea of marriage, which made her announcement seem truly presumptuous.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Lisette said, apparently unmoved by the surprise in his voice. \u201cI am truly considering it, Leopold. I like your children so much.\u201d</p><p>Of course, that was why he was considering it too: because she would be a bighearted, wonderful mother to his motley brood.</p><p>She smiled up at him. \u201cI think we should suit, especially because you don\u2019t own a dog.\u201d</p><p>No dog but six children. Most women would run screaming in the opposite direction, so it seemed he had found the perfect woman.</p><p>At least from that particular point of view.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you kiss me now?\u201d Lisette asked. Her eyes were the exact color of sky outside the window. Of course he wanted to kiss her.</p><p>He leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on her lips. They were pale pink, very soft.</p><p>\u201cI like kissing,\u201d she said, sighing a bit. She put a hand on his chest. \u201cDo you like kissing, Leopold?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he said, wondering what the hell he\u2019d gotten himself into. It was her fresh sweetness that made her such a perfect choice for a wife. He would have to be slow and kind, and hope that he didn\u2019t wilt from pure boredom during the act.</p><p>\u201cOf course, I like other things about bedding men,\u201d she said.</p><p>He blinked.</p><p>\u201cKiss me again,\u201d she cooed, pursing her lips. He obliged, settling his lips over her soft ones. She couldn\u2019t have meant that comment the way it sounded.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you like about bedding men?\u201d he inquired.</p><p>She looked up through her lashes modestly. \u201cI\u2019m certain that you can teach me a great deal.\u201d</p><p>Lisette was the very model of a respectable virgin. Not like infuriating Eleanor, who had clearly slept with Godless Gideon before he ran off to marry Ada. And not like her in other ways too, because Eleanor had that trick of setting a man\u2019s blood on fire just by looking at him.</p><p>Whereas Lisette\u2019s sweet blue eyes were restful.</p><p>\u201cKiss me again,\u201d she said, placing a slender arm around his neck.</p><p>He bent his head again and this time ran his tongue along the seam of her lips. He was a little afraid that she might be prudish in her approach\u2014weren\u2019t virgins always nonplussed by their first real kisses?</p><p>But she opened her mouth readily enough. They played with their tongues for a while, and she even stroked his shoulders.</p><p>They\u2019d be fine in bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The fact that he kept thinking about Eleanor, and the way she uttered those absurd little noises when she kissed him...that was unacceptable.</p><p>He had made his bed the moment he allowed Tobias to be conceived. He couldn\u2019t undo those wrongs after all these years, but he could make a level-headed choice for wife, rather than choosing someone based on lust.</p><p>Because damn it, he felt lust for Eleanor. Even thinking about her made him harden. Remembering the way he bent over her on the balcony, and her bottom tucked\u2014</p><p>He woke to himself to find that Lisette was protesting the strength of his mouth. \u201cReally, Leopold,\u201d she said a bit querulously. \u201cI know that you have a man\u2019s desires, but there\u2019s no need to be immoderate.\u201d</p> <p>Never, in the length of his misspent life, had he kissed one woman while arousing himself with thoughts of another. He had horrified himself\u2014not an easy task. \u201cI will never do that again,\u201d he stated. \u201cI apologize.\u201d</p><p>Lisette dimpled at him. \u201cActually, I\u2019m quite happy to see the strength of your\u2014\u201d She coughed delicately. \u201c\u2014desire. I have seen you looking at Eleanor and I thought perhaps you had feelings for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe decision not to marry was mutual,\u201d he said, his voice coming out more sharply than he intended.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that!\u201d Lisette said, her dimples appearing again. \u201cNot that I would normally worry about competition, but Eleanor is so witty. And she has a kind of je ne sais quoi that makes her very attractive to men.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd,\u201d Lisette continued, \u201cshe\u2019s truly intelligent. When we were all children here we used to have chess tournaments and she always won. She would beat her brother and my father as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChess?\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe plays chess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you know? I thought Marguerite told me once that you have quite a penchant for it yourself, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could say that,\u201d he said. Since he was one of the three top players in the kingdom.</p><p>\u201cYou see, one of my other aunts is a quite good chess player. So she taught everyone chess in the summer, and she would organize us into tournaments.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat is her name?\u201d Villiers said, squinting through the window. A carriage had just drawn up, but he couldn\u2019t see if it had a crest on the door.</p> <p>\u201cRosamund Patton,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cHave you ever met her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve played Mrs. Patton at the Chess Club,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cShe was the only woman who had won entrance to the club until very recently, when the Duchess of Beaumont won a place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m sure that Eleanor could do the same. She used to beat Rosamund all the time. I think Eleanor is probably the most intelligent woman I know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that you are one of the nicest women I know,\u201d Villiers said, dropping a kiss on her mouth. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many ladies who would praise another woman the way you do.\u201d</p><p>Lisette\u2019s whole face lit up when she smiled. \u201cWomen can be so silly to each other! Men are easy to come by, but female friends are not. Goodness, look at that! We have another visitor.\u201d She clapped her hands, jumping to her feet. \u201cWhat fun this is! I haven\u2019t had visitors for a month of Sundays, and now it\u2019s positively raining people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a crest on the carriage door,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cOh well, then I expect it\u2019s Astley,\u201d Lisette said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>She turned to look at him. \u201cThe Duke of Astley, of course. Didn\u2019t you hear at dinner last night? His wife has died. He will have come for Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>Villiers grabbed her arm. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>She frowned until he loosed his grip and then she bestowed a smile on him. \u201cI said, it\u2019s the Duke of Astley, come to fetch Eleanor, of course.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I forgot. You probably don\u2019t know. They were in love as children. And then he was forced to marry a woman named Ada. That was so sad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow on earth do you know all this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you! We used to play together as children, and we still correspond occasionally. At any rate, Astley\u2014I think his name is Gideon, though I haven\u2019t met him\u2014loves Eleanor. And she loves him. So I expect he\u2019s come for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s come for her?\u201d</p><p>Lisette looked up at him. \u201cEleanor is not the sort of woman whom any man would forget,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s not Astley,\u201d Villiers stated. \u201cHis wife is barely in the ground.\u201d He held out his arm.</p><p>\u201cI shall go outside to see,\u201d Lisette said, and she actually dashed off without waiting for his escort.</p><p>Villiers decided that the code of gentlemanly behavior did not insist one had to trot after a fleeing woman, so he walked into the entrance hallway at a measured pace.</p><p>Never mind the fact that he was fighting an impulse to walk faster and faster. Of course it wasn\u2019t Astley. Though it wouldn\u2019t matter to him if it were. He had no wish to marry Eleanor; he was to marry Lisette. The only thing that bothered him was the fact that there would be a tremendous scandal if Eleanor bolted with the Duke of Astley a few days after his duchess died.</p><p>Impossible. He knew Astley. The man defined the word conventional. Astley would think as prudently as he himself had when choosing Lisette as a wife. Astley was a rational man.</p><p>Dukes had to be rational men. They couldn\u2019t simply dash off and do whatever they pleased. He quickened his pace. The carriage likely held Lisette\u2019s father, which was all to the good, because he should extend a formal request for Lisette\u2019s hand in marriage. Not to mention the fact that someone had mentioned a purported betrothal between Lisette and the next-door squire Thestle\u2019s son. Not Roland, but another one. That would have to be dealt with, he supposed.</p><p>There was always the chance that Gilner would refuse him, based on his bastard children, or Lisette\u2019s existing engagement. But now that he\u2019d had a close look at the Gilner estate, he doubted it. Gilner was clearly not a stickler for propriety. His daughter was chaperoned by a woman who brazenly lived with her devoted friend.</p><p>Moreover, from what he could see, Lady Marguerite spent a good deal of her time traveling. No severe elderly relative was part of the household, assigned to serve as a damper so that a suitor couldn\u2019t court Lisette whenever and wherever he wished. In fact, if he wanted, he could probably waltz right into Lisette\u2019s bedroom and deflower her.</p><p>No one would even notice, most likely.</p><p>Not that he would do it, because\u2014</p><p>He walked down the front steps feeling like a fool. The carriage did not have the Gilner crest. A small group was standing in front of the steps, and Lisette turned around, waving.</p><p>\u201cLeopold! Do come!\u201d</p><p>He walked over, knowing the truth of it in his gut.</p><p>\u201cYou see?\u201d she said happily, slipping her fingers into his. \u201cI told you so!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was locked in the arms of a man.</p><p>Not just any man either. Gideon, Duke of Astley, was a particularly beautiful man. Not terribly tall, but who needed height when he had that profile?</p><p>Villiers took a deep breath.</p><p>Gideon was kissing Eleanor in front of her sister Anne, Lisette, the butler, three footmen, assorted groomsmen\u2014and Eleanor\u2019s own mother, the duchess. Who was smiling, Villiers realized with another jolt. Not with the kind of barbed acceptance with which she greeted the news that he, the Duke of Villiers, was marrying her daughter, but with a kind of wild, surprised joy. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And Eleanor? He could see only the back of her head, but Gideon\u2019s hand was rumpling her hair, holding her with such tenderness that even he, coldhearted bastard that he was, felt...something.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it romantic?\u201d Lisette said, squeezing his hand.</p><p>It took everything he had not to pull away from her.</p><p>\u201cThey love each other so much. She waited for him. And he came to her the very first moment he could. I suppose he\u2019s been thinking of her every day for years.\u201d</p> <p>He could just imagine that.</p><p>Unfortunately.</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p><p>The Duchess of Montague was smiling with a fierce happiness that Eleanor hadn\u2019t seen since her brother gained his majority. \u201cJust wait until your father learns of this,\u201d she said to Eleanor, more or less under her breath. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so pleased.\u201d</p><p>They were leading Gideon to the drawing room, since her mother had graciously allowed that her daughter might have a short unchaperoned conversation with the duke.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s utterly mad, of course,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to deny all rumors. The duke should be mourning Ada; of course, he is mourning Ada. We won\u2019t announce anything. We\u2019ll keep it entirely secret. You\u2019ll have to drop Villiers. But no one knows of your engagement to him; it will be a seven-day wonder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is going to marry Lisette,\u201d Eleanor said flatly. She glanced back to find that Gideon had been caught by Anne. She felt a qualm, given Anne\u2019s express dislike for Gideon, but her sister seemed to be behaving politely enough.</p><p>\u201cLisette\u2019s father won\u2019t be happy with that. Gilner will have to come home now. I can\u2019t imagine that he wants his daughter to marry Villiers, not with those children of his in the picture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is a good man,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s the question of Lisette herself,\u201d her mother continued, not even listening. \u201cThe other night the squire rattled on about his elder son being engaged to Lisette, but it was clear to me that the man was desperate to save his son. The poor boy has been living abroad for years, ducking the marriage.\u201d</p><p>The conversation felt both morbid and ill-bred, so Eleanor moved to a sofa and sat down, hands folded.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll allow you fifteen minutes together,\u201d her mother said. \u201cNo more than that, if you please. I can\u2019t have the servants gossiping more than they\u2019re already likely to do. I suppose Astley will spend the night, but I\u2019ll instruct him to leave tomorrow morning. This really is a most disgraceful visit.\u201d She looked entirely happy.</p><p>Gideon appeared, and the duchess slipped out, closing the door firmly behind her.</p><p>Eleanor felt as if she were having one of those odd experiences described in the papers by people who claimed to have encountered a ghost. Surely this Gideon could not be the living, real Gideon? But there he was, standing in the door frame, apparently solid and real.</p><p>Yet the Gideon she had known for the past few years, ever since his eighteenth birthday, was polite, unfailingly mannered, and distant. Entirely correct behavior for a married acquaintance.</p><p>This Gideon had feverish eyes, so fervent that her own dropped, which meant that she saw he was holding a sparkling object in his right hand.</p><p>A few weeks ago she would have flown to him. Now she sat primly on the sofa. She could feel the weight of her panniers on either side of her legs, holding her down.</p><p>Gideon didn\u2019t move either. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said finally. All she felt was a wave of embarrassment because his voice was thick with emotion.</p><p>She opened her mouth and said just the wrong thing. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry about Ada\u2019s death.\u201d His face went slack, as if the only thing holding him together had been the fire in his eyes. \u201cI apologize!\u201d she cried, jumping to her feet. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to bring up such a painful subject.\u201d</p> <p>Grief was much easier to sympathize with than love, or whatever emotion he had been displaying before she mentioned Ada. So she fetched him from the doorway and brought him over to the sofa and patted his hand, just as the sister of a good friend would do. Like any acquaintance with a warm affection for a newly widowed man.</p><p>\u201cYou should know that I concluded all ceremonies for Ada before travelling here,\u201d he said.</p><p>Eleanor managed a weak smile.</p><p>\u201cShe was Quaker. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>And, when Eleanor shook her head, \u201cHer father permitted it. She was quite devout. I wasn\u2019t...I\u2019m Church of England, of course. But I liked her rector, Mr. Cumberwell. He buried her immediately at St. John\u2019s in Westminster. Quakers have a very simple ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor curled her fingers around his. \u201cI\u2019m glad that she found solace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Cumberwell to take her portion and endow a chapel in her memory. He refused because he said she wouldn\u2019t have liked that. So we\u2019re giving the money to a Foundling Hospital instead. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAda loved children,\u201d Eleanor said soothingly.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here with you,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t stop myself.\u201d</p><p>She resisted the impulse to shrink back on the sofa, to stop the conversation before it could start. There was something indecent about all the emotion in his eyes, as if she were seeing something she had no right to.</p><p>\u201cI feel shame,\u201d he said, hardly pausing for breath. \u201cBut shame is something a man can learn to live with. I felt shame years ago because of our love, because of the way we\u2014we were together. The shame I feel now is nothing compared to that.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was starting to feel ill. In some remote part of her mind she wondered whether she could stage a faint, in order to force him into silence. He was still turning that sparkling thing, a ring of course, a diamond, in his fingers. They were long and too slim, she thought. Almost prehensile. Grasping.</p><p>And then she caught her own thought, as if someone else had said it, with an echo of shock. She was thinking about Gideon. Gideon. The man she loved. The most beautiful man in the world.</p><p>But when she looked at him now, she saw little to admire. The sharp planes of his cheekbones seemed too thin, almost hollowed. His chin didn\u2019t have even the shadow of a beard; he hadn\u2019t had facial hair at eighteen, and perhaps he simply never developed it.</p><p>Some part of her mind insistently compared that to the line of another jaw, another man\u2019s jaw...</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said miserably, \u201cbut I had to come. Because of Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor started. It was as if he had read her mind.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t marry Villiers; it\u2019s absurd. It\u2019s disgusting,\u201d Gideon said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t allow such a thing to happen, couldn\u2019t allow such an abomination, not when I knew you were really waiting for me. I felt as if I would be turning my back on God Himself if I did not save you from that marriage.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor fruitlessly tried to think of a comment. Was she supposed to agree that she\u2019d been waiting for him for years? She would sound like the worst sort of wet hen.</p><p>But Gideon didn\u2019t seem to require an interlocutor anyway. \u201cAda died without pain,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Eleanor managed. Though that didn\u2019t seem quite the right response either.</p><p>\u201cShe was walking across the floor of the library, they told me, and she started to cough. I know people thought she was malingering,\u201d Gideon said, \u201cbut she wasn\u2019t. A coughing attack was a terrible thing, once it started. She would bend over and hack so violently that I felt as if her lungs must be injured.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI saw it once,\u201d Eleanor said, putting her hand over his again. The one that wasn\u2019t holding the ring. \u201cI was terrified for her.\u201d</p><p>He shuddered. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t not be. Sometimes I wouldn\u2019t go home at night, simply because I couldn\u2019t bear it. It looked so painful, though she said it wasn\u2019t. She was appallingly brave.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor murmured something.</p><p>\u201cI used to wish that she would just scream at me, or at fate, or someone. But she never did.\u201d His hands clenched and then he opened his right hand and looked down at the ring as if surprised to find it there.</p> <p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eleanor said quickly. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the only solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI love you, and you love me. I always loved you, even before you noticed me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have been more than thirteen when I came home with your brother the first time. But you were already yourself.\u201d He ran a finger along her eyebrow. \u201cYou were already laughing in that way you have.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor couldn\u2019t stop herself. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOther women smile. Or when they laugh, it comes out a pinched sound. Your mouth is so wide.\u201d</p><p>He fell silent, to Eleanor\u2019s relief. She\u2019d never thought of her mouth as wide, and it wasn\u2019t an image she particularly cared to dwell on.</p><p>But then he started talking again. \u201cI brought this ring with me because it\u2019s the ring I should have given you years ago. It was my mother\u2019s. I never gave it to Ada.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should have this conversation now,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>His eyes were burning again. His skin seemed drawn too tightly over his bones, and yet he was still Gideon. The same dear Gideon whom she had watched so hungrily at fourteen, had smiled at shyly\u2014and then not so shyly\u2014at fifteen, the boy she had lured to kiss her at sixteen...</p><p>\u201cYou miss her,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d he said, almost violently. \u201cI hardly knew her. We lived in the house like a brother and sister.\u201d</p><p>She touched him on the shoulder and it was the way it used to be, finally. She met his eyes and she knew what he was feeling, just the way she used to, when she thought they were two hearts beating as one. She held out her arms. \u201cIt\u2019s all right to miss her,\u201d she said.</p><p>He fell forward, head on her shoulder, still protesting that he didn\u2019t miss his wife at all. That he hardly knew her.</p><p>Until he began weeping.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-one</p><p>Eleanor didn\u2019t manage to escape to her bedchamber until very late that night. By then her nerves felt like the strings of a violin, pulled too tight and vibrating helplessly. She had a bath, dismissed Willa, put on her nightgown, and wrapped herself in a dressing gown.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t settle down. She tried lying on the bed. She tried sitting before the fire. She tried writing a letter to a friend, and tore up three different drafts.</p><p>Finally she remembered that there were armchairs on the balcony. Villiers wouldn\u2019t be there, waiting to see if he had a companion in stargazing. He had hardly met her eyes all day, just smiled at her coolly and offered his felicitations. She had done the same, of course.</p> <p>Lisette had swanned around the house talking about her marriage to dearest Leopold. He was probably in his betrothed\u2019s bedchamber that very moment. God knows, Lisette wouldn\u2019t bar the door.</p><p>She pushed open the tall doors and walked into the velvety darkness. The chairs were positioned on Villiers\u2019s side of the balcony, so she walked forward until she bumped into one. Then she rounded the arm and dropped straight down.</p><p>Only to land on a pair of muscular legs.</p><p>\u201cOof,\u201d said a male voice. \u201cYou look like a featherweight, but you\u2019re not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should bounce on you for that,\u201d she snapped.</p><p>There was a moment of silence while they both contemplated the possibilities that comment brought to mind.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let me stop you,\u201d he said finally.</p><p>She rose as he spoke. \u201cI shall leave you to the stars, Your Grace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eleanor waited, though she knew she shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cYou turn me into a lecher,\u201d he stated.</p><p>She smiled, although she knew he couldn\u2019t see her expression. \u201cI feel quite certain that I\u2019m not the first woman to have succeeded in that respect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOddly enough, I think that you are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSays the father of six children.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, I have felt lust. And I\u2019ve indulged lust. But no other woman has turned me into another person. It\u2019s unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>She kept her voice light. \u201cI thought that men enjoyed lechery.\u201d</p><p>With one swift, savage moment he stood before her. \u201cEnjoyment has little to do with the way I feel about you.\u201d His voice was low and dark. \u201cI could\u2014I could eat you, drink you. I want to lick you, suck you, own you.\u201d</p><p>For a moment she sank into the mesmerizing sound of his voice, and then she shook free. \u201cYou can\u2019t own me, Leopold. You are marrying Lisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon came back for me, after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery romantic,\u201d Villiers said flatly.</p><p>She heard a faint sound from her bedchamber.</p><p>\u201cSomeone is knocking on your door,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI suspect it is not your maid.\u201d</p><p>She looked up at him in the dim light, a well of desperation in her heart. \u201cLeopold\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to go,\u201d he said, composed as ever. \u201cObviously I am not the only man turned lecher by your beauty, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not beautiful,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He said something but she couldn\u2019t hear it. The knocking sounded again.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d she asked.</p><p>His lips slid down her forehead, her nose, and he said it against her mouth. \u201cOnly the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-two</p><p>\u201cGideon,\u201d Eleanor said, opening the door.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t so young anymore. His eyes were tired and little lines flared from the corners. And yet he had the same bone-deep beauty he\u2019d had as a boy. \u201cI had to apologize for my behavior this afternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need not excuse yourself,\u201d she said, holding out her hand. The day had passed in such a fury of emotion that she hadn\u2019t taken a breath, hadn\u2019t thought. Everything that she\u2019d ever dreamed of\u2014no, not Ada\u2019s death, but the rest\u2014had come true in one moment.</p><p>Gideon walked in, and they sat by the fireplace as if they\u2019d been married for over a decade, as if young love had faded and turned to something stronger.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said after a moment.</p><p>\u201cIn my bedchamber, or in Kent?\u201d She smiled, trying to ease the tension in his face.</p><p>\u201cIn Kent,\u201d he said, not smiling. \u201cI must leave at dawn tomorrow; all my people think I merely stopped here on the way to visit Ada\u2019s great-aunt. She had no other relatives.\u201d</p><p>The ton would certainly discover where he was, given the kiss with which he\u2019d greeted her. But she didn\u2019t say anything. She kept searching his face, looking for that indescribable thing that had made him the man she loved above everyone and everything else. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere will be gossip,\u201d he added. His mouth tightened. He was acquiring little marks by the edges of his mouth, likely from making that silent rebuke. Making it over and over.</p><p>\u201cI expect that\u2019s the case,\u201d she said, realizing that the room had fallen silent again.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor blinked. \u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have cared too much what other people thought. You never really understood why I married Ada, did you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLikely not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you must have suspected that I could have ignored or overturned my father\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor took a deep breath. It was absurd to think that she wasn\u2019t interested in hearing his reasoning. Of course she was interested. She loved Gideon. He was her true passion. \u201cI thought perhaps...\u201d But she stopped. He wasn\u2019t the sort of man with whom one could talk about lechery.</p><p>He was waiting, so she tried again. \u201cWe abandoned propriety...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t that, though I acted like a rakeshame when I took your virginity,\u201d he said, leaning forward. His eyes were the blue of the Aegean Sea. \u201cAnd even worse, when I turned my back on you. I know you must have considered taking your own life, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor coughed. \u201cWell, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt took me a year, even longer, to realize that a love like ours comes once in a lifetime. Only once, and never again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to feel as passionately as I did,\u201d Eleanor said bluntly. \u201cIf I felt we shared the love of a lifetime, you did not agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I was a fool.\u201d He captured her hand and wove his fingers through hers. \u201cI had no idea what it meant\u2014how much it meant\u2014to have a woman\u2019s desire. To know that I mattered to you.\u201d</p><p>He stopped, so Eleanor said, almost reluctantly, \u201cYou were everything to me, Gideon.\u201d And he had been. That fact didn\u2019t explain why her heart didn\u2019t catch now with that familiar agony, the joy of seeing him. She thought love like hers would last forever.</p> <p>Of course it would. Shakespeare said that love didn\u2019t alter with days or weeks. And she truly loved Gideon. Then.</p><p>He didn\u2019t seem to catch the silent but that followed her You were everything to me. His grip tightened on her hand and he leaned forward again. \u201cThat\u2019s why I breached every rule of society in order to come to your side, if only for a night. I can\u2019t see you again for a year, of course. I must honor Ada and mourn her properly. But I can\u2019t let you marry Villiers. Not with the way you feel about me!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about the way you feel about me?\u201d Eleanor asked, pulling her fingers free. She was conscious of a strangely bleak feeling around her heart.</p><p>\u201cI feel just the same way,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cI survived my marriage, after the first year or so, by remembering how you\u2014how you trembled when I kissed you, Eleanor. How you used to ask me for another kiss, and another. How you...how you invited me to...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d She folded her hands in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t even voice such emotions,\u201d he said, looking at her earnestly. \u201cNot a word shall pass my lips until my mourning period is over. Servants may gossip, but there will be no consequences.\u201d</p><p>He rose to his feet and held out his hand for her.</p><p>Her fingers didn\u2019t burn at his touch. Her heart didn\u2019t flutter in her chest.</p> <p>She felt as if a shadow Eleanor were in the room with them, the Eleanor of old, who would have been laughing, and crying, and throwing herself onto Gideon\u2019s chest. Who would have been unable to stop kissing him, her hands flying about his shoulders, touching him as he so clearly longed for her to do.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand now why I left you for Ada?\u201d he said, scooping up her hands and putting the palms against his mouth.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The shadow Eleanor would have kissed his palm. She might even have done something mad, like pull off his neck scarf, laughing at his protests, her fingers trailing over the strong column of his throat.</p><p>The real Eleanor just closed her lips tightly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t understand that you were like food and drink. I never imagined that the attentions I\u2014I silently chided you for would become the only thing I longed for. That without your desire I would shrivel into a man I scarcely recognize, a man without blood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never revealed anything to me,\u201d she whispered. \u201cNothing. I saw you so many times after you married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAda knew.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought\u2014I feared\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe understood. I used to talk of you sometimes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe had no interest in marital relations,\u201d he said. \u201cNone. If I was trapped by my father\u2019s will, she was equally trapped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never made love?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few times, in the first year. It made her cough. It made her uncomfortable and unhappy. She didn\u2019t enjoy it in the least.\u201d His hands tightened convulsively on hers. \u201cAfter a while all I could think about was you, and the way you welcomed me, desired me. Of you, and what I threw away.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m honored by your feelings\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere aren\u2019t many women like you,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cDo you know that, Eleanor? Do you understand how life-giving, how important, you are to a man? I would kiss you now,\u201d he said, his eyes fierce, intent. \u201cI would sweep you into my arms and carry you to that bed, if it were honorable, Eleanor. You know that, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell\u2014\u201d she said, startled.</p><p>\u201cIn fact, the more I look at you, the more I feel my grip on honor slipping from my grasp,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cAda knew, after all. What\u2019s a scandal between you and me? We\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cGideon, you have to leave at dawn and continue your journey to Ada\u2019s great-aunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019ll return to you,\u201d he said, his voice full of longing. \u201cYou can\u2019t stay here, with Villiers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting Lisette, not the duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI saw the way he looked at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVilliers is marrying Lisette.\u201d</p><p>Gideon snorted.</p><p>Eleanor blinked. \u201cDid you say something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe Duke of Villiers has finally found the one woman he can\u2019t have.\u201d There was something bold and prideful in his voice that froze the words in her mouth. \u201cHe will have to live without you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, he plans to marry Lisette,\u201d she said, moving toward the door. \u201cNow I really must go to sleep, Gideon. It\u2019s been a long day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would kiss you,\u201d he said, moving after her. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be able to stop. And I know you couldn\u2019t. So I\u2019m being good for both of us.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said faintly, opening the door.</p><p>It was all she\u2019d dreamed of for years. He leaned toward her, his beautifully-shaped mouth hovering near hers. \u201cAsk me, Eleanor,\u201d he whispered. \u201cBeg me to stay. I can\u2019t say no to you. I never could say no to you.\u201d</p><p>The shadow Eleanor would have pleaded with him to stay. She would be a flame by now, intent on driving him to the same luxurious agony. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The real Eleanor felt strangely calm.

Why did she have to\u2014</p><p>She cleared her throat. \u201cNot tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re right. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate.\u201d</p><p>She had the door almost closed when it opened again under the pressure of his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable leaving you here with Villiers and those bastards of his.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m visiting Lisette,\u201d she said patiently.</p> <p>\u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will your visit be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a few more days,\u201d she said, not having given it much thought.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll escort you and your mother back to London.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut then everyone will know\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, his voice shaking a bit. \u201cI love you and the world can know. I am willing to accept censure in order to have you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWonderful,\u201d Eleanor said weakly. She closed the door, leaned against it, her forehead against the cool wood. \u201cWonderful.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-three</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 20, 1784</p> <p>\u201cSomeone must find places to which we can send the children for the treasure hunt,\u201d Lisette said briskly. \u201cEleanor, why don\u2019t you do that? It\u2019s outdoors and you can take that dog with you. I need you to find four appropriate places from which a child might bring something back. An egg from the henhouse: that sort of thing. I\u2019ll write the clues tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt looks like rain,\u201d Villiers said, peering outside.</p><p>\u201cThen you go with her and hold an umbrella,\u201d Lisette said. She turned to Eleanor\u2019s mother. \u201cMay I ask you...\u201d</p><p>Eleanor rose and walked out of the room without a word, so Villiers followed. She had all the signs of a woman about to explode, whether from anger or grief, or something else, he didn\u2019t know.</p><p>Grief would be a bit much, given that the Duke of Astley had swooped in and declared his love. True, he was already gone when the household rose, but that was just his moralistic way.</p><p>\u201cAre you feeling cross because your prince has left?\u201d he asked, catching up with Eleanor just as she sent a footman to fetch Oyster.</p><p>She gave him a cool look over one shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one could believe otherwise, given his ardor yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Eleanor had an odd look on her face, but just then the footman rushed up with Oyster, who was celebrating the happy prospect of a walk by barking.</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>Naturally he paid no heed to that, so Villiers unbelted his sword stick, gave it to a footman, and took the leash instead. The dog was so ugly that he was an abomination. Nothing could be done about his jaw, but his manners were another story.</p><p>\u201cQuiet,\u201d he said.</p><p>Oyster stopped in mid-yap.</p><p>They walked out of the house and around a path to the right, Eleanor leading the way as if she knew precisely where to go. Villiers took one look at her rigid back and decided that cheerful conversation was overrated. He occupied himself instead with refusing to walk every time Oyster pulled on the leash.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take long at all before the puppy was doing a reasonable imitation of a well-mannered creature. They headed out of the gardens as Eleanor took a small winding path that led into the woods stretching down the hill.</p><p>Villiers had lost sight of her by the time Oyster and he had come to an amicable agreement about the proper pace for a walk.</p><p>He should have brought Tobias along, he realized. And perhaps even the two little girls. Then he could have marched down the walk like a damned middle-aged family man, with children and dog. Following an irate wife down the path. The shocking thing was that the picture didn\u2019t even feel aberrant\u2014until he realized that of course he wouldn\u2019t be following Eleanor anywhere.</p><p>He would follow Lisette. Sweet golden Lisette.</p><p>He had to stop and apologize to Oyster because the poor beast didn\u2019t deserve to have his leash tugged so hard.</p><p>The path turned a hard right and then dumped into a rocky stream. It looked as if a giant had tossed white boulders and rocks the way children toss marbles. They lay in scrambled heaps, some as large as carriages, others the size of chamber pots. A weak stream trickled around them. On the far side of the stream was a great bramble hedge that climbed up a small hill.</p><p>\u201cEleanor!\u201d Villiers called out.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d Her head popped up from behind a huge rock.</p><p>He felt foolish. \u201cOyster and I are here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWandering about. We used to come here as children. Look how good Oyster is being. I would have thought he would be a water dog. Perhaps he\u2019s becoming sick.\u201d</p><p>Villiers raised an eyebrow at the dog quietly sitting on the ground, only his tail betraying excitement. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe I\u2019ll let him off the leash.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Eleanor said dubiously. \u201cI never\u2014\u201d</p><p>Oyster was off the leash and joyously dashing onto the rocks. He squealed like a piglet when his paw slid into the water, so Villiers judged him unlikely to drown.</p><p>\u201cCome on, then,\u201d Eleanor said impatiently. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see?\u201d Her head disappeared.</p><p>He sighed. It didn\u2019t suit him to clamber about on the rocks. It didn\u2019t suit his clothes, either. It was very tiresome, growing to be self-aware. He preferred life when he used to stride around London paying no mind to anyone except the occasional chess opponent.</p><p>He managed to get over the rocks without scuffing his boots. Notwithstanding the earlier look of the skies, the sun was out and pouring over the rocks, throwing shadows into high relief. The river wandered into tiny eddies and pools, but most of the rocks were dry and hot. They were bleached as white as the cliffs of Dover.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you\u2014Oh.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had found a small pool. Scandalously, deliciously, she had taken off her slippers and her stockings. Her ankles were delicate, not white, but the color of sweet cream. Her toes wiggled like small fish in the clear water.</p><p>She looked up at him and smiled. Her bad mood seemed to have evaporated. \u201cMy brother and I used to spend hours here when we were children visiting the estate.\u201d</p><p>He sat down and pulled off his boots. He didn\u2019t like cold water. He didn\u2019t like undressing in the outdoors. But he had ceased to pay much attention to his own likes and dislikes, not while his body was driven by this hunger. \u201cDid Lisette like putting her toes in the water?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s face stilled and he cursed himself silently for bringing up his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s name. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said after a second. \u201cLisette...no. But those are her favorite roses.\u201d She jerked her head over her shoulder.</p><p>He glanced up and saw that an apricot rosebush had scrambled partway up the bramble hedge on the far side of the stream. The blossoms hung in heavy clusters, their petals the color of orange liqueur in the sunlight.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to make her happy, you\u2019ll fetch her some,\u201d Eleanor said, pulling her skirts up a little higher so she could reach the bottom of the stream with her toes.</p><p>\u201cYou must be joking,\u201d he said, dragging his eyes away from her legs. They were elegant and slim. \u201cThey\u2019re over my head, not to mention the fact that I\u2019d fall into the water. It looks much deeper on that side.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t be thinking of sending children here on the treasure hunt,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could easily fall and break a limb.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to be one of those wildly protective papas, are you?

They gave him a strange aching sensation.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a brother,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, Villiers, I\u2019m drawing a horse.

Was he very young?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEleven.\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cHe was just eleven.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe caught diphtheria,\u201d Villiers said. He heard the lack of expression in his own voice but was powerless to stop it.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s awful,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cDid many people get it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My mother acted quickly. She isolated him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, she isolated him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe put him in a wing of our house and wouldn\u2019t allow anyone in or out.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had forgotten about the new horse she was painting. Her fingers curled on the rock. He watched them because he couldn\u2019t bear to meet her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNot\u2014by himself?\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat. \u201cNo, his manservant was with him, of course. Though the man got diphtheria as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen who took care of them?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne of the footmen, a man named Ashmole. He was a cantankerous bastard even back then, when he was only a second footman. He slammed his way into that part of the house and brought them food and cared for them, and my mother didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor reached over and put her hand on his cheek. He could feel the chill of her wet fingers to the back of his teeth. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>He jerked and her fingers fell away. \u201cI wasn\u2019t there. I was off at school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr you would have gone to your brother, and probably died of the illness as well,\u201d she said, nodding.</p><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Ashmole, the cantankerous footman, didn\u2019t get ill. He\u2019s now my butler.\u201d</p><p>She liked that. Her expression eased the clamp that always settled on his heart if he thought about his brother. Or his mother. Or the country estate where he grew up.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why you never go to the castle that my mother talked of.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cWe closed off that wing, but even my mother stopped going home after a time. We lived with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSurely you will go home someday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s falling apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe castle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let every stone in Castle Cary fall to the ground before I enter that place again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can understand that,\u201d she said after a time. She had gone back to dabbling in the stream, flicking water onto the rocks opposite.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to think about his brother anymore, or the castle. Everything he wanted sat opposite him, flicking water and humming under her breath. Her lashes curled in the sunlight and the bodice of her gown strained a little over her breasts. He guessed it had been originally made for her sister.</p><p>He\u2019d never wanted anyone like this in his life, not with this ravening hunger, the kind that made him tell her secrets he had told no one, that threatened to bring him to his knees...though now that he thought of it, his knees would be a very good place to be, given the part of her body that position would make available to him.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cwhat do you think I drew this time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d he corrected her. He peered at the patch of wet she\u2019d traced on the rock next to her. \u201cWhy did you paint a pizzle on that rock?\u201d he inquired, pulling off his stockings at last.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a pizzle!\u201d she said, giggling. Her laughter ran along his skin and raised the hair on the back of his neck.</p><p>He put his feet down into the little puddle she\u2019d chosen. They were huge next to hers, and they both stared for a moment. Then he moved in one smooth motion to her rock.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she gasped, just like the heroine in a bad play.</p><p>\u201cI could ask the same of you,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Why ask? You\u2019re seducing me, and I don\u2019t care why.\u201d He looked down at her wide eyes. She\u2019d forgotten to put on the black makeup this morning. He wouldn\u2019t want to tell her, but she looked even better without it. Eyes like hers didn\u2019t need cosmetics.</p><p>\u201cI am not!\u201d she said, but he could tell her heart wasn\u2019t in the protest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married,\u201d he said, pulling her to her feet and pushing her gently back onto the large, gratifyingly flat rock that stood at her back. \u201cNeither are you. You can hardly have made serious vows to Master Gideon, since he informed everyone in the drawing room last night that he fully intends to mourn his wife for the next year. Apparently he feels you will simply wait for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t!\u201d Eleanor said. But she didn\u2019t try to move away, just leaned against the rock, trapped by his arms braced on either side of her.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes he did,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cUnless you managed to change his mind later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, I did,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back to escort us to London.\u201d</p><p>Even given the urgent hunger coursing through his body, he felt that like a blow. He froze for a moment, looking down at her almond-shaped eyes, the way her bottom lip curved out, plump and full, and then shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t try and get out of it now, princess. It\u2019s too late.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d she began.</p><p>He bent his head and nipped her lip. He was going to say something else, but she sighed into his mouth and all of a sudden he could smell her, the faint perfume of jasmine and something indescribably better, more sensual. Something that took him from normal to rock hard every time he came close to her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEssence of Eleanor,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIf I could bottle it, I would become famous.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved into a smile and he kissed her again. He emerged from that kiss dazed, his body on fire, heart pounding.</p><p>\u201cI am not trying to seduce you,\u201d Eleanor stated.</p><p>All the higher parts of his brain were considering the logistics of making love in the midst of a river, and he barely understood her.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m seducing you. Would that be all right with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seducing me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said calmly. As calmly as he could, given that he felt like a ravening animal. \u201cDon\u2019t pick this moment to become chaste, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if I did?\u201d she said, and there was something in her eyes, some sort of confused hurt.</p><p>He kissed her hard, the kind of kiss that stole his breath and made his fingers curl with the wish to touch her. But he didn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019d seduce you anyway,\u201d he told her, honestly enough. \u201cGod, Eleanor, I\u2019ve never felt this way. Ever.\u201d</p><p>And then he stood up and wrenched off his neck cloth. Threw his heavy silk jacket over one rock and his fine linen shirt over another.</p><p>The woman he meant to seduce laughed at him while sunbeams danced in her hair, turning individual hairs into spun gold and glossy bronze and darker hues, like brewed tea. He didn\u2019t care how she laughed as long as she didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t, falling silent when he eased his breeches down over that aching, hot part of himself. He didn\u2019t see fear in her eyes, thank God. Or reluctance, either.</p><p>Naked, he walked back through the pool, not even feeling the chilly water on his ankles. She kept her hands at her sides.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t mean...\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Her eyes were very wide and very dark. But not reluctant.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Her body was curves and shadows, pink here, cream there. He wanted to tear her gown off, taste all of her. She had buttons all the way down her dress. It was the work of mere moments to unbutton some two hundred buttons, not counting those that flew off, sinking into the pool with tiny splashes.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He glanced over his shoulder. They were far from the house, and even if someone did come down the path, they were around the curve of the stream, well out of sight.</p><p>\u201cNo one will come.\u201d He had dispensed with her corset and was inching up her chemise. \u201cWe are alone, Eleanor. Do you realize that we are almost never alone? Finchley is always hanging around my bedchamber, and there\u2019s your maid\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t make love in the open air. I\u2019ve never heard of anything so scandalous. We are, both of us, promised to others.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am marrying for the sake of my children.\u201d He said it flatly. \u201cI have every expectation that Lisette and I will be quite comfortable together. And I will be faithful to her. But I am not yet married. In fact, I haven\u2019t even proposed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe announced your engagement,\u201d Eleanor pointed out, keeping a tight grip on her chemise so he couldn\u2019t pull it up her legs.</p><p>\u201cThat surprised me, but not as much as when you announced the same,\u201d he said, giving her a little kiss at the edge of her mouth. He had a hand under the edge of her chemise now, running circles on her smooth skin.</p><p>\u201cI should have made you go on one knee,\u201d she said. \u201cGideon didn\u2019t either; at this rate, I\u2019ll never have a proper proposal.\u201d</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t want to think about Gideon. He didn\u2019t even want to hear the man\u2019s name. He slid his hand higher and then ran his lips over her eyebrow. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful, Eleanor,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAt first I thought your eyes were black, but they\u2019re actually blue, the color of the sky just before the sun sets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t do this! Oyster is watching,\u201d she said, pulling the hem of her chemise back down.</p><p>Villiers had been alive a few years more than thirty. He knew perfectly well when a woman was truly protesting and when she was offering excuses for the mere sake of it.</p><p>The pug was sprawled out on a sunny rock, paws in the air, snoring. In his estimation, Oyster was a pathetic excuse for a dog, so he didn\u2019t even bother answering that protest, just wrestled the fabric out of her hand and swept the whole garment up and over her hair.</p><p>And then, there they were. Naked.</p><p>Her hair had started to fall from its pins, locks sliding over her breasts. Her stomach was gently rounded and curved into a beautiful shadow, dusted with hair the color of brandy.</p><p>He was never at a loss for words. Never. Until now. \u201cYou\u2019re so\u2014\u201d He stopped. He\u2019d been wanting to explore her with his mouth for hours, days. And she wanted a man to kneel before her.</p><p>So he did, pushing her legs apart slightly so he could run his tongue up a beautiful slender thigh.</p><p>\u201cOh\u2014\u201d she cried, her voice far away and thin.</p><p>Her skin was sweet and smooth, and he painted designs on her with his tongue, sliding higher and higher, as if she too were a smooth rock in the sunshine. Her fingers were playing with his hair, twisting, caressing.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to\u2014\u201d Her breathing was growing ragged.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d She sounded truly shocked, so he stood up and let his fingers drift over the rounded curve of her inner thigh that he had just kissed.</p><p>She had a flush high in her cheeks that made his whole body thrum with pleasure, so much so that he didn\u2019t even realize for a moment how odd it was that her pleasure would be causing his. He didn\u2019t think of that until they were kissing again and he was sipping the sweet darkness of her mouth, one arm around her back to protect her from the hard stone, the other still caressing her thigh, sliding closer, farther away, closer again.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to touch me there, are you?\u201d she whispered tremulously.</p><p>He pulled back and frowned at her. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even touch you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2014No. Is that always part of lovemaking?\u201d</p><p>The struggle with his conscience took a split second, and his conscience lost, as always. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cOne wouldn\u2019t want to criticize a former lover, but...\u201d He had her trembling, so he slid his fingers just to the edge of the soft curls between her legs. \u201cA man always touches a woman here. Because\u2014\u201d He pulled her closer so he could feel her soft breasts against his chest. \u201c\u2014because that is where a woman is most luscious and most delicate, which in itself sets a man on fire.\u201d He let a finger drop deep, stroke and glide.</p><p>Her head dropped back against his arm, so he bent to kiss her throat.</p><p>\u201cHe touches her like this,\u201d he said, licking her shoulder and letting his fingers wander.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014lovely,\u201d Eleanor said, the break in her voice sending another jolt down to Villiers\u2019s groin.</p><p>\u201cSurely he kissed you here?\u201d He kissed his way down the slope of her breast, ran his teeth gently over her nipple.</p><p>\u201cOf\u2014Of course,\u201d she said, her back arching toward him. \u201cThat feels so good!\u201d He didn\u2019t think she was talking only about the fact he was suckling her, so he increased the pressure of his fingers a little bit. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her little cries were an aphrodisiac like no other, so he knelt again before she had a chance to protest and pulled her legs apart even farther.</p><p>She was so exquisite that he was shaking like a lad experiencing his first woman.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d she cried. \u201cOh Leo, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not proper,\u201d Eleanor cried desperately. \u201cI can\u2019t think that it is. I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.\u201d She looked around wildly, apparently remembering again that they were outside. \u201cAnd we\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her voice broke off because he had dipped his fingers into the chilly water and stroked them over the hottest part of her body. Her mouth fell open and she made a choked noise. He smiled against her leg and let his fingers dance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to kiss you now,\u201d he said, when he had her trembling.</p><p>She managed to say \u201cLeo,\u201d but it was a weak protest and he knew it. He put his mouth on her, delicately, in the sweetest kiss of all. It took only a moment. Her hands twisted in his hair, her hips arched, and she broke in a cry, a quaking, muffled cry that was the most beautiful thing he\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>He straightened slowly, knowing he was just barely in control. \u201cYou look like a virgin sacrifice, waiting on the rock for a dragon to sweep by,\u201d he said, hearing the growling tone in his own voice.</p><p>She opened her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m no virgin,\u201d she whispered, pulling him closer.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m so grateful for that,\u201d he whispered back. \u201cI just need to find my breeches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow,\u201d she cried, pulling him to her. \u201cOh God, Leo, please, please...I want you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot as much as I want you,\u201d he growled. He couldn\u2019t even let his body touch hers. If he allowed himself even a touch, he would lose control, plunge into her sweetness, take her right there under God\u2019s sky and with no shame.</p><p>Eleanor couldn\u2019t think lucidly. She was leaning against a rock in the sunshine. She was naked. She was about to make love with a man to whom she had no formal attachment. She was...</p><p>All the considerations that should have made her run shrieking into the woods seemed inconsequential, when she could instead watch Leopold\u2019s beautiful haunch as he leaned over and pulled a French letter from the pocket of his breeches, throwing them toward the riverbank.</p><p>\u201cDo you carry those with you at all times?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He straightened and turned around. His body almost took her breath away: it was so powerful, muscled and beautiful...so very different from hers. She wasn\u2019t prone to feeling dainty and feminine, though she felt just that as she stood there in the sunshine, waiting. But she didn\u2019t move, afraid that she would break the spell if she moved. That one of them would regain some common sense and reach for clothing.</p><p>\u201cAre we going to make love standing up?\u201d she asked shyly a few moments later. \u201cOh!\u201d Because they clearly were going to do just that. His big hands cupped her bottom and he pulled her up a bit and then...</p><p>And then she opened her thighs and he was sliding in, and it was different\u2014so different\u2014than she remembered. His hands were curled around her bottom but her entire being was focused somewhere else. He was slow and she needed it. She could feel every inch.</p><p>It was enthralling\u2014a bit painful\u2014exquisite. Her nails dug into his shoulders.</p><p>\u201cToo much?\u201d he whispered, his voice a growl. \u201cYou\u2019re so tight, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust go slow,\u201d she said in a gasp. He took another inch and the pleasure of it streaked like fire down her legs. She bit his lip.</p><p>He growled at her and took another inch.</p> <p>She meant to tell him something else, but what she said was, \u201cDon\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not planning to,\u201d he said, and nipped her ear. Stole another inch. Waited, let her feel him, adjust to the invasion, his thickness, his possession.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, gasping again.</p><p>\u201cPrincess, you have nothing to apologize for.\u201d There was a kind of raw truth in his voice that made her feel so ecstatic that she arched, and he came home. All the way. His groan ripped from his lungs, and she would have done the same but she couldn\u2019t breathe; it felt that good.</p><p>And then he was sliding back, and it was like silk, easier the second time, better the third, dizzying the fourth...she lost track. He was braced against the rock on either side of her, kissing her deep and sweet, and all the time his hips were pumping back and forth.</p><p>Little thoughts floated through her mind and then were lost in a sea of pleasure. This was what it was like making love to a man, rather than a boy. It was all different: the heat, the strength, the\u2014</p><p>She couldn\u2019t even count the ways it was different.</p><p>They were both sweaty now, and flames were licking at her legs, her stomach. She was arching against him, feeling every time he pushed back, but it wasn\u2019t quite happening.</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>And yet she couldn\u2019t\u2014she didn\u2019t want to say anything. To direct him. To be\u2014to be what Gideon thought she was.</p><p>But then he said, \u201cEleanor,\u201d and his voice was harsh and pleading at once, and she suddenly realized how ridiculous she was being.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d she said in a gasp, and hooked one leg around his hip so she was just a bit higher, so that when he pumped it wasn\u2019t just pleasurable but pure, unadulterated paradise. \u201cThis way,\u201d she said, flinching because she was doing what she swore to herself she would never do again.</p><p>But it was Leopold, and he didn\u2019t look scandalized, or insulted; he just thrust. She actually cried out.</p><p>She heard him grunt with satisfaction but she couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t speak, because he was hard and fast now, and a tidal wave of pleasure curled her toes and swept up her legs and threw her back onto the rock.</p><p>Her cries floated into the high blue sky and disappeared. His growl probably frightened some sleeping forest animal.</p><p>And then...</p><p>And then she found herself standing in his arms, her knees weak, her breath harsh in the quiet air.</p><p>\u201cGod damn,\u201d he said quietly. He had his arms around her but his forehead against the rock.</p><p>After she and Gideon had made love, all ten times, they had both been riddled by guilt afterwards. He would swear that they would never do it again, not until he was of age and they were married. And she would know that she had lured him to it, and feel guilty and slightly sick.</p><p>With Leopold there was none of that.</p><p>He finally lifted his head off the rock, and the look on his face had to approximate the grin on hers. \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d he said. Then, \u201cYou\u2019re good.\u201d</p><p>She felt the smile fall from her face. \u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019m not good at this. It\u2019s not a skill that I\u2019ve developed. I just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHush,\u201d he said, putting his lips against hers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t implying you were the Whore of Babylon. I was just saying that it was the best sex I ever had in my life.\u201d</p><p>It was a flat statement.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d she asked, hearing the incredulity in her voice. \u201cIsn\u2019t this what\u2014\u201d She waved her hand.</p><p>\u201cWhat I have all the time?\u201d It was his turn to grin at her. Had she ever thought his eyes cold? They were full of laughter now, laughter and something else, the echo of desire. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>No, the presence of desire.

He tasted wonderful.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Leopold said.</p><p>Some tiny part of her heart registered disappointment. Of course he was right. Gideon had always been right, too.</p><p>But standing straight just meant that she was in full contact with his body. And at least part of him was interested in...</p> <p>\u201cMoving is my favorite activity,\u201d Leopold said, low and easy. \u201cAre you going to look at me any time soon, princess?\u201d</p><p>She had barely met his eyes since they made love. It was too embarrassing. And too frightening, if she admitted it to herself. She didn\u2019t want to see awe in his eyes, didn\u2019t want to see acknowledgment that she was some sort of amazing courtesanlike woman.</p><p>Even though somehow she was. Apparently.</p><p>She was starting to feel a little sick. Who knew it would be so depressing to make men happy?</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d There was a soft growl in her ear and a strong hand pulled her face around. Leopold was frowning down at her. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d she said quickly.</p><p>He kissed her, quick and fierce. \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She couldn\u2019t tell him. He would think she was mad. He might even laugh at her.</p> <p>\u201cStubborn wench.\u201d With one swift movement he swung her into his arms and started walking over the rocks.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d she gasped, holding onto his arm. \u201cI\u2019d prefer to walk. I\u2019d like to put my clothes back on now. My clothes!\u201d She looked back. \u201cWe left my chemise on the rock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need it,\u201d he said, climbing out of the river.</p><p>\u201cI need it!\u201d she said indignantly. \u201cWill you please put me down now? I must collect my clothing.\u201d</p><p>He laid her flat on her back in the soft grass, and followed her down so quickly that she could hardly twitch before his body was covering hers.</p><p>\u201cYou said we should move,\u201d he reminded her. It was now clear what kind of moving he had in mind.</p><p>\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d Eleanor said, smiling but determined. She\u2019d had enough of being everybody\u2019s favorite doxy for the moment.</p><p>He almost let her up, but then suddenly pushed her down again. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell me what went wrong in that head of yours, or I\u2019ll never let you go back to the house. I\u2019ll have to keep you here.\u201d</p><p>She giggled. \u201cKeep me here? On the riverbank?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the sort of man who changed his mind. And it didn\u2019t really matter, after all.</p><p>So she just blurted it out. \u201cI know that I\u2019m different from other ladies. And in some ways I\u2019m grateful, but in other ways it all seems rather tiresome.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDifferent in what way?\u201d He let her go and rolled to the side, grabbing his breeches off a rock. His gray eyes weren\u2019t even sympathetic. He wasn\u2019t a sympathetic sort of man.</p><p>\u201cYou said I wasn\u2019t the Whore of Babylon, but sometimes I feel as if I am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d That interested him. But she could see amusement too, in the gleam of his eyes under his eyelashes. It wasn\u2019t fair that a man should have such thick, dark lashes when she had to put black stuff on hers.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t describe it,\u201d she said dispiritedly, sitting up. \u201cI really must put my clothing back on, Villiers.\u201d</p><p>His scowl was so potent that she actually recoiled. He threw his breeches back down again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said after a second\u2019s pause. \u201cLeopold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold all the time, Eleanor. Never Villiers, to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d she said gently, \u201cyou\u2019re marrying another woman. And I\u2019m marrying Gideon.\u201d</p><p>He lay down and pulled her over, onto his body. He was so hot that she involuntarily shivered. \u201cThen tell me what the hell you\u2019re thinking about,\u201d he growled. \u201cTell me and then we\u2019ll go off and live our perfect lives with our perfect spouses. Have you realized that we\u2019re both marrying extraordinarily beautiful people?\u201d</p><p>She gave him a lopsided smile. \u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of it that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are. Golden girls and boys, as Shakespeare has it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that one of the sonnets? I\u2019m just reading them for the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s from a play. Golden girls and boys all must, like chimney sweepers, come to dust. I\u2019ve always thought it was a good motto for a duke to keep in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you count yourself among the golden boys?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it comes to beauty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut dukes are golden,\u201d she said. \u201cI see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStrip away the title and I\u2019m as brutish as a chimney sweep. People like Astley carry their nobility on their face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that why you dress so extravagantly?\u201d Eleanor asked. She was oddly balanced on his body, her breasts squished into his chest, her elbows on either side of him. But she was comfortable.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said slowly. And then: \u201cPerhaps. But you were going to confess your dark fear that you\u2019re really the ducal version of a palace whore. And I have to admit that I\u2019m really curious.\u201d</p><p>He was laughing again, if only with his eyes, so she leaned down to give him a reproving nip, but they started kissing and somehow she lost track of her chastisement. She only slowly came back to herself, from that heated, tender place his kisses took her.</p><p>\u201cI feel like a doxy,\u201d she said to him, not even whispering. \u201cI lured Gideon into making love all those years ago, you know. I made him do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have had to, given that he takes himself so seriously. Too much attention to manners turns a man into a judicious bore,\u201d Leopold said, pushing her so she was sitting on his stomach. \u201cI\u2019m listening breathlessly, but meanwhile, if you felt like edging back just a tad?\u201d</p><p>She grasped what he was getting at and could feel her cheeks flaming. \u201cHave you no shame?\u201d she asked, curious, not reprimanding.</p><p>\u201cShame has nothing to do with it,\u201d he said promptly. \u201cWarn me some more about your seductive self, and meanwhile I\u2019ll show you what I have in mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou make me sound so foolish,\u201d Eleanor said, covering her face with her hands.</p><p>He pulled them down. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t make fun. You slept with the inestimably tedious Gideon, who doubtless credited you with every spark of passion that ignited between you. Because that way he could stop himself from feeling any blame.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell...\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cAnd by blaming you for every rule the two of you broke, he could walk away from you and marry someone else. Because you made him uncomfortable, Eleanor. All that passion, and he\u2019s nothing more than a dry husk after all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t say that,\u201d she protested. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about my fianc\u00e9.\u201d</p><p>He made a rude gesture. \u201cAnd then I came along, and we\u2019re like tinder and spark, the two of us. But you measured me by his ashes and thought I was crediting you with being the courtesan of my dreams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou did say...\u201d Eleanor whispered, feeling herself turn even pinker.</p><p>\u201cI said that it was the best sex I ever had. I didn\u2019t say you were the best lover I ever had.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re getting the hang of it,\u201d he said, drawing his hands slowly over her breasts. She looked down at his hands. They were large, and darker than her skin. They shaped her breasts, played with them with exactly the right mix of tenderness and strength.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I have done?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cAre you genuinely curious, or are you going to fall into a pit of despair and decide that you are the worst courtesan in all of England?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not a courtesan,\u201d she pointed out.</p><p>\u201cNo. You\u2019re an utterly delectable woman, with the most gorgeous breasts in Christendom.\u201d</p><p>His voice was darker, lower. \u201cWhat should I have done?\u201d she persisted.</p><p>\u201cTouch me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou kept your hands on my shoulders, more or less.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She colored. \u201cI didn\u2019t think...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d like to be touched, because that fool Astley had a poker up his arse about it. But I don\u2019t. I want you to touch me everywhere.\u201d Suddenly his hands were around her waist, picking her up, easing her back down.</p><p>She squeaked, but it was so much easier this time. She felt soft and wet. He thrust into her with a groan that sent a bird flying from the bushes beside them.</p><p>Neither of them moved for a moment. Their breath was harsh.</p><p>\u201cWould you like me to touch you like this?\u201d she said, circling his nipple with one finger.</p><p>\u201cHmm. That\u2019s not terrible but it\u2019s not great either,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat else might you do with that finger?\u201d</p><p>He was teasing her again, so she pinched him as a rebuke, and his breath caught\u2014and she learned something.</p><p>He recovered fast, though, and pulled her tighter, whispering, \u201cAny more of that and this will be a very short encounter, princess.\u201d She didn\u2019t want that, and neither did he. So he gave her one of the kisses that made her feel as if she were both drowning and catching on fire, all at once.</p><p>\u201cI want you to lick me all over,\u201d he said, hoarse in her ear. And he started to move.</p> <p>It took a minute for what he was saying to sink into her mind, and then she suddenly imagined herself on her knees before him, as he had been before her, making him groan and cry out, as he had to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>His fingers were gripping her hips, but she could feel the fire clamping down so soon, too soon. \u201cOh, Leopold,\u201d she said helplessly, running her fingers through his hair. \u201cI can\u2019t touch you now, I can\u2019t because...\u201d But whatever she was going to say was lost in a wave of pure, violent pleasure.</p><p>She came back to herself slowly to find that he was still there, still...with her.</p><p>\u201cA courtesan would never come before her client,\u201d Leopold said in her ear. \u201cAnd if she did, she\u2019d have to come again, just to make up for it.\u201d</p><p>She would have laughed but she was too tired.</p><p>\u201cThere are other things I\u2019d like you to do,\u201d Leopold said, his voice like a velvet whip. And he started to tell her. In detail.</p><p>She came twice more before he finally conceded that perhaps she might, just might, achieve some modicum of skill such as a real courtesan had.</p><p>But she didn\u2019t care what he said, because he cried out when he came, cried her name in such a way that she threw away all those fears.</p><p>She was no Whore of Babylon.</p><p>\u201cEleanor,\u201d he said again, afterwards. And held her very tightly. Just that: \u201cEleanor.\u201d</p><p>It was enough.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-four</p><p>That night at supper Lisette talked of nothing but the treasure hunt to take place two days hence. Her plate looked like a small boat adrift in a sea of foolscap, on which were scrawled notes and lists. For the most part Villiers, Eleanor, Anne, and the duchess simply allowed the monologue to burble forth. There was unspoken agreement in the room that Lisette\u2019s enthusiasm was like a fever, and should be treated with extreme caution.</p><p>\u201cEveryone in the county will be here, of course. You will have a particularly enjoyable time, Eleanor,\u201d Lisette said, beaming. \u201cNot only will Sir Roland and his parents attend, but I invited the Duke of Astley to return and he said that he may well do it. His late wife\u2019s great-aunt is only an hour\u2019s ride from here, and he thought to return for the treasure hunt.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s mother frowned. \u201cThat is a remarkably inappropriate idea. It has been barely a week since his wife died.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for charity,\u201d Lisette said blithely. \u201cNo one expects him to stay in the house weeping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey may not expect tears, but they expect a modicum of observance,\u201d the duchess said acidly. But her comment didn\u2019t have the usual force to which she normally gave even the smallest impropriety. The surgeon had pulled her tooth, but the pain lingered, and she was treating it with laudanum. Which had the pleasant effect of making her lose about half of what made her a duchess, as Eleanor saw it.</p><p>Her Grace was a far more agreeable companion in her current state.</p><p>Lisette ignored her, simply plucking a paper from the mess in front of her. \u201cI wrote all the clues for the treasure hunt last night. Shall I read them aloud to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Anne said without particular inflection. \u201cAre the children meant to read the clues to themselves? I very much doubt that they are literate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course they can read,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cThey receive classes in reading, writing, and deportment every day except Sunday.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m on the Ladies\u2019 Committee of the orphanage,\u201d Lisette said, glancing at her with a trace of irritation. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading the schedule of their activities for years. The Committee insists that all the girls learn to read. I myself have urged the acquisition of a musical education, though to this point they do little more than sing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMrs. Minchem may have claimed the children were being taught reading, but did they learn, or did they spend all their time making buttons?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d Lisette said with a little shudder. \u201cI can\u2019t bear such disagreeable subjects. Mrs. Minchem is gone, and I hope we can simply forget these unpleasant events.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor found herself looking at Lisette with real dislike, and bit her tongue. Certainly Lisette should have made those tours of the orphanage. But likely, Mrs. Minchem would have kept the disturbing truth out of sight anyway.</p><p>\u201cHow are the orphans doing now?\u201d Villiers asked, breaking into the cool little silence that followed Lisette\u2019s speech. Not that Lisette had even noticed; she kept scribbling on the pieces of paper spread around her plate. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cOh, very well!\u201d Lisette replied. \u201cThe baker\u2019s wife from the village has moved in temporarily. The Ladies\u2019 Committee is going to hire a new headmistress. In the meantime, I\u2019m arranging everything myself. It will be just fine, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor hated to be such a doubting Thomas. But it seemed to her that someone energetic and truly directed was needed to head up the orphanage. Whereas Lisette was energetic in bursts, generally only when she became obsessed with a project, as she was now. The treasure hunt was all she could speak of.</p><p>\u201cDo you think that fifty pounds is enough?\u201d Lisette was asking.</p><p>\u201cFifty pounds?\u201d the duchess asked. \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe first child to bring back all four items will win fifty pounds,\u201d Lisette explained. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to set her up in an apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very generous thought,\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>Lisette beamed at him. \u201cI would love to fund all of the orphans, but I don\u2019t have enough pin money. Luckily, I rarely spend it, so I have enough for one orphan this time.\u201d</p><p>The worst of it was that she meant it. Lisette would readily give all her money to the orphans. Eleanor found herself picking at her food and letting the discussion whirl around her. Villiers threw in fifty pounds for another prize. She was rather surprised when her mother offered a third prize, but put it down to the effect of laudanum together with the general air of virtue around the table.</p><p>\u201cI spend all my pin money on gowns,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThough I hate to lower the altruistic tone by admitting it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI must ask Aunt Marguerite if she would sponsor an orphan as well,\u201d Lisette was saying.</p><p>\u201cLady Marguerite is an eccentric,\u201d the duchess murmured. She was starting to look rather more befuddled than at the start of the evening.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that wine and laudanum are a good mix.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I feel better. So\u2014So much better. Really, so much better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re three sheets to the wind,\u201d Lisette commented.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d the duchess asked, peering at her.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re totty,\u201d Lisette said, louder. \u201cTop-heavy. Sluiced over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Her Grace said, standing up with just a mild waver. \u201cYou always were a rude little girl, and you\u2019ve only become worse. I can\u2019t abide you.\u201d And with that, she left.</p><p>Anne was grinning behind her napkin, but Villiers\u2019s face was utterly expressionless. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lisette,\u201d Eleanor said into the silence that greeted the slam of the door. \u201cI think the laudanum and wine are influencing my mother\u2019s temperament.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother always said that your mother was small-minded,\u201d Lisette said cheerfully.</p><p>Eleanor wasn\u2019t sure how to speak to that assessment, so she returned to her sole \u00e0 la venitienne.</p><p>\u201cDid you know that your children plan to participate in the treasure hunt, Leopold?\u201d Lisette asked.</p><p>He looked up, rather startled. \u201cWill they indeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTobias at least.\u201d She returned to her list.</p> <p>\u201cHow exactly will the hunt work?\u201d Villiers asked.</p><p>\u201cEach clue leads you to a location, and tells you to bring back an object. We\u2019ll give out all four clues at once; that way the children won\u2019t end up just trooping around after each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWon\u2019t Tobias have an advantage over the other children, since he has been living here for several days?\u201d Eleanor asked.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure that he will be a fine candidate for an apprenticeship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTobias does not need an apprenticeship,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>\u201cOf course he does,\u201d Lisette said, not really listening. \u201cHe\u2019s a clever boy. You could apprentice him to a violin maker, for instance. He might create wonderful instruments. He has lovely fingers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI plan to give him an estate worth ten thousand pounds a year.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor took a sip of her wine. Apparently, Leopold had forgotten to share a few details of his anticipated home life with his fianc\u00e9e. But Lisette merely shrugged. She was always easygoing\u2014unless you crossed her.</p><p>\u201cTobias will not participate in the treasure hunt,\u201d Villiers stated.</p><p>Lisette\u2019s brows drew together. \u201cOf course he will. He\u2019s just the right age to win, and he\u2019s already excited about it. You can\u2019t disappoint the boy. I was in the nursery this morning and he talked of nothing but the hunt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTobias talked of nothing else?\u201d</p><p>Eleanor knew what Villiers meant. Tobias was eminently his father\u2019s son: he would never babble.</p><p>\u201cIn his own particular fashion,\u201d Lisette said airily.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not appropriate for him to compete against orphans to win fifty pounds,\u201d Villiers pointed out.</p><p>\u201cI know!\u201d Lisette exclaimed, clapping her hands. \u201cIf he wins, you can simply tell Tobias that he can\u2019t keep the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou might want to inform him of that salient fact ahead of time,\u201d Anne noted. It seemed to Eleanor that her sister was enjoying the dinner a good deal more than she herself was.</p><p>\u201cI will instruct him that it would be improper for him to participate,\u201d Villiers said, accepting a partridge served on a croustade from the footman.</p><p>Lisette huffed but went back to her list.</p><p>\u201cWhat sort of things are the children supposed to fetch?\u201d Anne inquired.</p><p>\u201cI told you. An egg from the henhouse, that sort of thing.\u201d Impish pleasure lit up Lisette\u2019s face. \u201cBut they have to bring the egg home without breaking it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when will the treasure hunt begin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs soon as Aunt Marguerite arrives,\u201d Lisette said. \u201cAnd my father, of course.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor resolutely turned up the corners of her mouth into something approximating a smile.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t say a word to Marguerite about the Duke of Astley\u2019s clandestine visit,\u201d Lisette said, turning to her. \u201cThough of course you\u2019ll want to tell everyone, I\u2019m sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cActually, no,\u201d Eleanor said. Villiers\u2019s head swung up and she avoided his eyes. \u201cHis Grace\u2019s whereabouts are his own business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll disappoint the gossip lovers,\u201d Lisette said, looking back and forth between two pieces of foolscap. \u201cDo you think that the winning orphan should be crowned in gold or with laurel leaves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGold?\u201d Eleanor asked, still avoiding Villiers\u2019s eyes. \u201cHow on earth would you manage that, Lisette?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, there is an old crown in the west wing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s locked up, but of course I could get it out. I think Queen Elizabeth left it here when she was on progress years ago. Something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour family never returned it?\u201d Anne asked. \u201cYou\u2019d think that Queen Elizabeth would have missed the crown.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently there is some sort of letter she wrote in the library, asking for the crown back, but my ancestor pretended he\u2019d never seen it. I\u2019m due in the nursery to say good-night to your little girls, Leopold. Do come with me.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at his half-eaten partridge. \u201cI\u2019m still eating.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou can finish later,\u201d Lisette said cheerfully, holding out her hand.</p><p>\u201cAnne and I don\u2019t mind if you both leave,\u201d Eleanor put in, without being asked. \u201cI\u2019ll just finish my plate and retire upstairs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I do mind,\u201d Villiers said coolly. \u201cIf you must leave the table, Lisette, you might ask Lady Eleanor or Mrs. Bouchon to act as hostess in your place.\u201d</p><p>Lisette laughed, but there was a dangerous edge there, an edge that Eleanor remembered from tantrums of years ago. \u201cWhy on earth would I adhere to such stuffy rules? I don\u2019t run my household that way! It\u2019s time to say good-night to the girls, so I shall go. And I know that you want to come with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d he said flatly, looking up at her.</p><p>Her hand dropped.</p><p>\u201cI wish to finish my fowl, and then I plan to have some of that excellent lamb that Popper has on the side table,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cAnd after that I shall likely have some sugared plums, since I see them waiting as well.\u201d</p><p>There was a dangerous, trembling moment when peace hung in the balance. But then Lisette\u2019s face cleared and she burst out laughing. \u201cYou men!\u201d she said, half shrieking with laughter. \u201cYou\u2019re completely worthless if you haven\u2019t finished your meal. I know that.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cMy papa is exactly the same. Cross as a bear until he\u2019s had his morning tea and toast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d Villiers said, taking a bite of fowl. \u201cDo give the children my best.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell them you\u2019ll be upstairs in ten minutes,\u201d she said blithely, trotting out the door.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t\u2014\u201d he said. But she was gone.</p><p>\u201cPopper,\u201d Villiers said to the butler, \u201cwait until Lady Lisette has left the nursery, and then inform the children that I will visit them in the morning, just as I told them a short while ago, would you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Your Grace,\u201d Popper said.</p><p>Eleanor allowed a footman to take away her sole, since it was rather salty to her taste, and accepted a slice of Milanese flan in its place.</p><p>\u201cThat was awkward,\u201d Villiers said after a time.</p> <p>\u201cLisette has never cared much for eating,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Villiers said thoughtfully. \u201cI, on the other hand, care a great deal for eating. You seem to share my preference.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor was instantly conscious that she was far more curvy than Lisette, and likely could stand to lose some weight.</p><p>\u201cDo you suppose that the Duke of Astley will really return for the treasure hunt?\u201d Anne asked.</p><p>Eleanor felt a deep certainty that he would. In her opinion, Gideon had gone slightly mad. He had always been so prudent and principled...but no longer.</p><p>\u201cOf course he will,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cHe\u2019s in love.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn love,\u201d Anne said, as if tasting the words. \u201cWhat an extraordinary concept for such a tiresome man. You know,\u201d she said, turning to Eleanor, \u201cI really do owe both you and him an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t think why,\u201d Eleanor said, endeavoring to end the conversation the way their mother surely would have.</p> <p>\u201cI told you that the man never loved you enough, that he was a weak-chinned milksop. I was obviously wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you indeed?\u201d Villiers said. \u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs I said, I was wrong,\u201d Anne said, ignoring him. \u201cThe fact that Astley snapped back to your side shows that he does love you\u2014is in love with you, in fact. How romantic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, very,\u201d Villiers chimed in.</p><p>Eleanor just concentrated on eating her flan. She had wished, years ago, that Gideon was brave enough to risk his reputation in order to marry her rather than Ada. She couldn\u2019t have asked for more than what he was doing now. If he appeared at that treasure hunt, and particularly if he showed a marked preference for her, the scandal would ricochet across the ton.</p><p>\u201cAt this rate, everyone will be discussing the treasure hunt for the next month,\u201d Anne said, confirming Eleanor\u2019s anxiety. \u201cI am very happy that I accompanied you. I shall be so popular.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps we should give Mother an extra laudanum dose that morning,\u201d Eleanor said. And she was half-serious.</p><p>\u201cIf Astley has decided that you are worth more than the world\u2019s opinion,\u201d Villiers said, his voice very even, \u201cyour mother will simply have to get used to that fact. I don\u2019t expect he will wait for a full year of mourning before marrying you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe must,\u201d Eleanor said firmly. \u201cHe\u2019s Ada\u2019s only close family member, since her father passed away last year.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Anne put in. \u201cMy sense is that he is making sure Eleanor doesn\u2019t end up married to you while his back is turned. But he seemed genuinely fond of his wife, in a lukewarm kind of way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstley is in the grip of passion,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cYes, I will take some of that lamb now, Popper. Thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPassion needn\u2019t last more than a week,\u201d Anne said with her usual cynicism.</p><p>Villiers glanced at Eleanor. \u201cIt will in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA tiresome subject of conversation,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cHow are your daughters settling in, Villiers?\u201d</p><p>But Anne wasn\u2019t diverted. \u201cWhy do you think Astley won\u2019t settle down and wait once he is certain that Eleanor won\u2019t marry you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause he\u2019s had a few years to realize what he threw away.\u201d</p><p>Back to the immeasurable charms of the Whore of Babylon, Eleanor thought dismally.</p><p>Anne was relentless. \u201cWhat exactly do you think he\u2019s realized?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe thinks that there\u2019s no reason to eat breakfast unless Eleanor is there to give him that silly wide grin of hers. He wants to have an argument with her just so he can kiss her into a good mood again. He wants to sleep with her every night, see her holding a baby with brandy-colored hair like hers.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cHe wants her forever,\u201d Villiers continued. Their eyes met and his were as cool as ever. \u201cHe can\u2019t bear the idea that she might ever love another man. I\u2019d bet my entire estate that he will arrive tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>Anne sighed. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t so prodigiously fond of my husband, I\u2019d probably fall in love with you just for that description, Villiers.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s mind was whirling. If his face hadn\u2019t been so impassive, so composed, she would have thought...</p><p>\u201cSince you inquired about my daughters,\u201d he said, turning to Eleanor, \u201cLisette spent several hours with them today. I expect they will be very sad when we return to London.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou ought to leave soon, before she tires of them,\u201d Anne said, proving her voice could be just as emotionless as Villiers\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThat seems an unnecessarily unkind assessment,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cI believe that Lisette genuinely enjoys the girls. And she is looking forward to being their mother.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor shot Anne her most ferocious look, the one copied from their mother. Anne twitched an eyebrow but said in a sweetly musical voice, \u201cOf course it will all be different this time, Villiers. I quite forgot that the two of you are to be married.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t try for a life on the stage,\u201d Villiers said flatly.</p><p>\u201cI think we should go back to discussing Astley,\u201d Anne said. \u201cThat\u2019s a far more fascinating subject than your marital mishaps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no marriage yet,\u201d he snapped.</p><p>\u201cThen we can save the discussion of your unhappiness for the next time we meet,\u201d she said brightly.</p> <p>Eleanor rose. \u201cIf you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo tell me that you\u2019re going to succor some orphans,\u201d Anne said, fluttering her eyelashes. \u201cOr perhaps you plan to distribute food among the starving villagers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am retiring to my chamber,\u201d Eleanor said, with what she considered a masterful control of her temper. \u201cI plan a tedious night with a bath and my book.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, Shakespeare\u2019s sonnets,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cLove that lasts ages, into which category we must now place the Duke of Astley. A good choice.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor managed to get herself out of the room without saying something she might later regret.</p> <p>The two people remaining at the dining table stared at each other.</p><p>Then Villiers looked at Popper and jerked his head, so the butler and his footmen quickly left.</p><p>\u201cA touch of the bourgeois,\u201d Eleanor\u2019s sister said mockingly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you cared about servants\u2019 talk, Duke.\u201d</p><p>He ignored that. \u201cI was under the impression that you were not in favor of my suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat suit?\u201d Anne said. \u201cYou\u2019re marrying Lisette. And, in case I haven\u2019t said it already, congratulations. Your life is certainly going to be interesting.\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cAll those children,\u201d she said innocently. \u201cWhat a responsibility. It\u2019d be one thing if you were planning to bundle them all off to the country with fifty pounds and a package of bread and cheese, but to bring them up as nobility? To pitch them onto the civilized world as if birth and illegitimacy didn\u2019t matter?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know they matter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, of course, they don\u2019t matter to Lisette.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t know why he was defending himself to Anne, whom he hardly even knew. He had a flash of nostalgia for the old Villiers, the one who tolerated no insolence of any kind. The duke who was coolly uninterested in anyone\u2019s opinion except his own.</p><p>What had happened to him? He had given Mrs. Bouchon a look that would have silenced anyone from the queen to a scullery maid, and she paid him no heed.</p><p>\u201cThat is precisely why Lisette will be a perfect mother for them,\u201d he said, wading into the sort of explanations he never would have made a mere year ago. \u201cShe cares nothing for the formalities of the ton, for its strictures and rules.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t afford to care for them,\u201d Anne said. \u201cShe is considered mad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not mad,\u201d Villiers said sharply. \u201cShe seems eminently sane to me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Anne said, rather surprisingly. \u201cI\u2019ve known Lisette for years, and I\u2019ve never considered her to be cracked. Not in the way that Barnabe Reeve went mad. Did you ever know him? You must be about the same age.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Villiers said, placing his fork and knife precisely on his plate. \u201cReeve told me when we were both at Eton that he thought he might be able to fly someday. At the time, I considered it a boyish ambition that I rather shared. His later conviction that he was growing wings was a surprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, there\u2019s madness like Reeve\u2019s, and then there\u2019s Lisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no comparison,\u201d Villiers said. \u201cNone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReeve doesn\u2019t listen to the people who tell him repeatedly that people rarely, if ever, grow wings. Lisette doesn\u2019t listen to people who tell her anything that she doesn\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe difference between will and wings is the difference between madness and its opposite,\u201d Villiers pointed out.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She beamed at him. \u201cReeve thinks he can grow wings and he can\u2019t. Lisette thinks she can spend her life doing exactly as she wishes, no matter the amount of human wreckage she leaves behind her\u2014and she can. That is the difference, my dear Villiers.\u201d</p><p>One had to say that Eleanor\u2019s sister understood a good exit line. She hopped to her feet and dropped into a deep curtsy. \u201cYour Grace.\u201d</p><p>Villiers stood, but only because the rules of society were drilled into him. They were second nature at this point.</p><p>He remained standing even after she left the room.</p><p>Until it occurred to him that Eleanor was in her bedchamber. And she was likely taking a bath. That ridiculous excuse for a man, Astley, was returning for the treasure hunt, and that was\u2014</p><p>That was very soon.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-five</p><p>Eleanor lay in the bath once again staring at her book of sonnets, but only because that\u2019s what she had told everyone she was going to do. She hated Shakespeare. What did he know about real human relationships? About how complicated they were?</p><p>Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks...Perhaps he was right about that, but it was all so much more complex than that simple sentence promised. Gideon still loved her. He did. Shakespeare said that love looked on tempests and was never shaken.</p><p>Yet hers was shaken. There was no other way to describe it. Her love had altered. All these years she\u2019d been loving Gideon, and not allowing herself to be angry at him for his cowardice, for not loving her as deeply as she loved him.</p><p>But it came down to it, she was the one lacking in true depth of feeling.</p><p>After a while, tired of trying to sort it all out, she dropped the book to the floor by the bath. Then she realized it might get wet, and shoved it so hard that it spun under the bed and disappeared.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t even surprised when the door to the balcony silently opened. It was a relief, really.</p><p>Villiers\u2014Leopold\u2014wasn\u2019t in love with her, so she didn\u2019t have to align her feelings for him with the claims made in a love sonnet. She could just enjoy being indecent. Shameful. Outrageous.</p><p>When she didn\u2019t hear anything more after the soft click of the door, she pulled one leg slowly out of the water and pointed her toe. She had nice legs, if she said so herself. She was particularly fond of the roundness of her kneecap.</p><p>After discovering one had a shallow soul, it was very reassuring to be able to retreat to the solid reality of a kneecap.</p><p>Though she\u2019d heard nothing, a pair of burning lips suddenly pressed the left side of her neck. She obligingly bent her head to the right to give him more access, and two hands slid around her from behind and cupped her breasts.</p><p>\u201cLook what I found.\u201d His voice was a low rumble at her ear. \u201cA brassy baggage, waiting in her bath for a man to wander by so she can entice him with her skills.\u201d The odd thing was that the sound of his voice sent heat to her legs even faster than the sight of his hands caressing her breasts, even faster than feeling him caress her.</p><p>\u201cVilliers,\u201d she said, dropping her head back against his shoulder and ignoring his foolish comment.</p><p>He bit her ear, and growled. \u201cWhat did you call me?\u201d</p><p>It was a command, a brand, a thrilling display of domination and authority. She felt her mouth curve. \u201cLeslie.\u201d</p><p>One hand slid over her stomach.</p><p>\u201cTry again.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLandry.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and his hand slid down another few inches, hovering. Eleanor just stopped her hips from arching toward him. Inside, she kept thinking, Please, please, please...</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d she whispered. \u201cLeo.\u201d</p><p>He turned his head and caught her in a kiss, an erotic, dizzying kiss that was so absorbingly like a conversation that she didn\u2019t even realize at first that his hand was between her legs. Then it all blended together into the taste of his tooth powder, flavored with something\u2014cinnamon, perhaps\u2014and the smell of him, and the dancing, sleek power of those wicked fingers.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until after he made her arch so high that water rolled off her body, until she cried his name aloud, until her body flared into brief, blazing perfection, that she remembered Gideon.</p><p>Gideon was back. He was in love with her. Why was she lying in a bath waiting for a different duke to prowl illicitly through the door?</p><p>What sort of woman did that make her?</p><p>Obviously Leopold was wasting no time thinking about Gideon, or his own fianc\u00e9e, for that matter. Before her knees had regained strength, he bundled her out of the bath, wrapping her in a towel. She swayed on her feet, her body still singing with pleasure, her mind confusedly trying to sort through her moral iniquities.</p><p>\u201cNo going to sleep,\u201d he muttered at her.</p> <p>\u201cThat felt so good. I could do it all night.\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cJust what a man most wants to hear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntrue,\u201d she said, opening her eyes. He had put her on the bed and was rubbing her hair dry with a towel.</p><p>\u201cI assure you that it is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMen don\u2019t want their wives to be too desirous,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cI believe it makes them nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever having been married, I couldn\u2019t say. But just in case you\u2019re right, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re not married,\u201d Villiers said, throwing aside the towel and standing back as if he were a pirate about to ravish a fainting maiden.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t be like Lisette, and pretend that rules don\u2019t matter,\u201d she said, raising her head and then letting it flop back down because he wasn\u2019t looking at her face. \u201cThey matter. We\u2019re not supposed to make love like this without marriage, because marriage matters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree. It does.\u201d</p><p>She studied him for a moment, but he had bent over so he could run his lips over her ribs, and tease the curve of her breast. He wasn\u2019t following the conversation very closely.</p><p>\u201cImmoral, illegal\u2014and yet so\u2014beautiful.\u201d She sighed.</p><p>\u201cCome on, princess.\u201d Villiers pulled her upright.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized that he was wearing a wrapper. It was deep black velvet, embroidered with pearl arabesques.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like this garment,\u201d she said, tracing an embroidered design with her finger.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t buy it for you.\u201d</p> <p>She eased the thick velvet apart in the front. Suddenly she wasn\u2019t in the least sleepy. Leopold\u2019s chest was broad and ribbed with muscle. He didn\u2019t say a word, so she put her face against him and just inhaled.</p><p>He smelled wonderful. Faintly of starched linen. But also of decadence, and privacy, and plain dealings.</p><p>Even better, of private sin.</p><p>She slid her hands inside the robe and the fabric fell over her arms, too thick, too luxurious. \u201cI don\u2019t like this wrapper,\u201d she murmured. She found his nipple and licked it. The tiniest shiver passed through his frame.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t ask for sartorial advice,\u201d he said. He managed to sound indifferent, but she wasn\u2019t fooled by him any longer. Leopold had perfected a blas\u00e9, ducal manner. But he wasn\u2019t indifferent.</p><p>\u201cYou care,\u201d she said, nipping him with her teeth because he had done the same to her. And, she discovered, he liked it as much as she had.</p><p>So she slid her hand down to his bottom. It was firm and muscled and about as different from her rear as it could possibly be. She kept kissing him, exploring all the curves and angles of his body, the places that made him suddenly draw in breath, or sway toward her.</p><p>A brutal-looking white scar marked his right side. \u201cYour duel?\u201d she asked, tracing it with her fingers.</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem large enough, does it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor death.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and pressed her lips to the mark. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt this moment,\u201d he said, and the fervency in his voice couldn\u2019t be mistaken, \u201cso am I.\u201d</p><p>She sipped and nipped and experimented until he was muttering something that sounded like a prayer or a curse, but with her name tangled in...and then with a quick twist, she rose and pushed him back on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI need to\u2014\u201d he gasped.</p><p>\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, grinning.</p><p>\u201cEnough practice for you,\u201d he said, grabbing her wrists.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He seemed intent on getting up, so she cut him off. \u201cThere may not be a tomorrow, Leo. You know that.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother, Anne, and I will leave for London in two or three days at the most.\u201d</p><p>His grip tightened. \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She waited a split second and realized he wasn\u2019t going to say more. \u201cI must,\u201d she said, pulling out of his grip. He let her go, of course.</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t drown in the sudden bleakness that threatened to engulf her. It wasn\u2019t as if they were in love, that unshakable, unalterable thing. She could alter, and she would alter. Once she had slaked herself with him.</p><p>His brow was drawn, and he looked as if he were trying to coerce his foolish male brain into figuring out what she was thinking. So she slid down to her knees, which put her right where she needed to be.</p><p>He tasted hot, and male, and faintly like soap. Even putting her lips on him made heat shoot to her groin. It wasn\u2019t because of his taste, or the fact that he felt like heated honey against her lips.</p><p>It was the power of it, if she were honest. Leopold obviously stopped thinking, was unable to think. Every time she tightened her lips, he let out a groan. In just a few minutes he seemed to be struggling for breath. Every time he groaned, a scalding wave of desire washed down her legs.</p><p>Suddenly his strong hands caught her and he pulled her up to face him. All the cool self-possession was gone from his face, from his eyes. He kissed her urgently, desperately, falling back on the bed and pulling her on top of him. The French letter took a moment and then she slid down, taking him as if they had always belonged together, as if the rhythm they forged was the rhythm of life.</p><p>She braced her arms on either side of his head and looked down through the screen of her hair. \u201cI know why you wear such elaborate clothing,\u201d she told him.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t listening. Instead he thrust up, his fingers biting into her shoulders. She fell for a moment into voluptuous, toe-curling pleasure, and then recovered. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re hiding your eyes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want anyone to see your eyes, so you dress like a peacock.\u201d</p><p>He grunted and thrust up again, sending a shock of white heat through her body. \u201cI suppose you think you\u2019re very clever?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am very clever,\u201d she said. \u201cFor example, it takes a clever woman to figure this out...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>What she did then made the Duke of Villiers actually cry out.</p><p>And those eyes, the eyes he hid from the world behind a screen of ice and a mask of gold thread...they were almost black with desire and yet he never closed them.</p><p>He kept looking at her, and she kept looking down at him.</p><p>\u201cI know what is dangerous about you,\u201d he said suddenly, a few shuddering moments later.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped.</p><p>\u201cYou see me too clearly.\u201d He flipped her over in one smooth motion, pinned her down, bit her lip. \u201cYou\u2019re damned dangerous, Eleanor, Lady Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>It made her feel shy...to be dangerous for other reasons than her own desire.</p><p>\u201cMy Eleanor,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she didn\u2019t correct him because her heart was singing the same tune, and there was no need to speak about it.</p> <p>Chapter Twenty-six</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 21, 1784</p><p>By the next morning Lisette had lost interest in the treasure hunt.

If only that boy Tobias wasn\u2019t part of it. I don\u2019t like him. He thinks he\u2019s clever but in fact he\u2019s only rude. I can quite see bringing the girls up as ladies, but that boy will never be a gentleman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe fact that Tobias doesn\u2019t care for others\u2019 opinions makes him only more akin to a gentleman,\u201d Eleanor suggested.</p><p>\u201cI shall marry Leopold, but I\u2019ll tell him that the boys have to be apprenticed. That\u2019s reasonable. There are three girls, or perhaps four. More than enough children for one household, given the number of maids they need and such.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that Villiers will be happy with that bargain,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>Lisette suddenly laughed, but the sound was jarring, like bells falling to the ground. \u201cMust you keep to such affectations?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSuch as?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCalling him Villiers! Remember, I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you!\u201d</p><p>She was in a dangerous state that Eleanor remembered from years ago. It would take only one unwary remark to send her off into a towering rage followed by a passionate fit of crying.</p><p>\u201cI shall do my best to please you,\u201d Eleanor said. And she whisked out of the room.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-seven</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 22, 1784</p><p>The morning of the treasure hunt dawned bright and clear. Eleanor had gone to sleep puzzling over love, and woken up, thinking about the shape of Leopold\u2019s hands, and from the two constructed an understanding that made her sit up straight in bed.</p><p>Gideon was an exquisite male animal, a finely drawn, beautifully painted specimen with whom any healthy young woman would be hard put not to fall in love. Villiers\u2014or Leopold, as she had taken to thinking of him in the inner recesses of her mind\u2014had beautifully shaped thighs and a large nose and even larger parts that she ought to know nothing of...And he was infuriating, fiercely intelligent, and, in his own way, as ethical as Gideon.</p><p>Gideon followed rules with precision\u2014at least until he discarded them in his pursuit of her. To him, life was properly lived if one followed the behest of an ethical watchman who combined the precepts of the Anglican church with the dictates of society.</p><p>But Leopold was doing something far more difficult: forging rules from the mistakes he had made. He was building an ethical life from the consequences of his not-always-ethical choices, and consciously pursuing a course designed to ameliorate the wrongs he had committed.</p><p>It was causing him no end of trouble, of course, given those six children. And it had to be said that his mistakes seemed to be more grossly evident in the world than those of other men: six children, after all. Though the sum total was, in fact, five, if one deducted Lady Caroline\u2019s contribution, Eleanor reminded herself.</p><p>Her own ethical standing was just as confused. She had flagrantly broken the most important precepts of church and society that pertained to women when she slept with Gideon the first time, though in her own defense, she scarcely remembered those rules in the tumult of first love.</p><p>She thought for a moment about the implications of the phrase first love. No matter: the point was that her youthful shame was compounded by her extraordinary folly in making love to the Duke of Villiers. One could not be more shameless than to do so in the out-of-doors.</p><p>The problem\u2014the real problem\u2014was that the rules governing women\u2019s behavior explicitly structured things so that women protected themselves from men. Because women were supposed to be designed along the lines of Ada: submitting to their husbands from a sense of duty, angelic in their desire to please.</p><p>She was out of bed and drawing back the drapes covering the door to the balcony, just so she could see the two chairs Leopold had placed there, before she realized that there should be no shame.</p><p>She had hurt no one. Gideon was none the worse for her seduction\u2014indeed, she had the distinct feeling that he would consider himself the better for it. She had not injured Leopold by seducing him\u2014or yielding to his seduction, however one wished to put it. And Leopold had not injured her, either.</p><p>She knew instinctively that Gideon was already in his coach on the way to the house, having said a hasty farewell to Ada\u2019s great-aunt. And Leopold was in the chamber next to hers, and she had a shrewd suspicion that he had felt as hungry and aching as she had the previous evening, when she\u2019d crawled into her bed and found it woefully empty.</p><p>And she was sure of another thing too: that a life in which there was no reevaluation of beliefs and behavior was a life not worth living.</p><p>Both men, both dukes, were doing just that. Gideon was laying his reputation and his fortune at her feet, to make up for the error of having turned his back on her years earlier. And Leopold was marrying Lisette because he believed that she would be the better mother for the children he had carelessly brought into the world, without love or even great affection. With women whose names he seemed hardly to remember. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>That was the problem, to Eleanor\u2019s mind. He would marry a woman without love, to nurture the children he had created without love.</p><p>It seemed wrong to her, deeply wrong, as surely as the way her own erotic impulses had never seemed wrong. It was almost a relief to feel something so strongly. At least she had some sort of moral compass, though it wasn\u2019t one of which the church or her mother might approve. Leopold did not love Lisette, so he should not marry her.</p><p>With a scratch on the door, Willa entered, full of household news. \u201cLady Lisette is tired of the very idea of the treasure hunt,\u201d she reported. \u201cAnd she\u2019s not interested in the orphans anymore either, though her maid, Jane, says she will regain interest when it\u2019s time for the Ladies\u2019 Committee to meet. But right now she doesn\u2019t want to hear a word of them or Mrs. Minchem.\u201d</p><p>There was nothing surprising in that. \u201cHas she a new passion, then?\u201d Eleanor inquired.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, it\u2019s those two little girls of the duke\u2019s,\u201d Willa said. \u201cShe was in the nursery with them for hours yesterday, playing as if she were a little one herself, so Jane says. She took breakfast with them today, and has started teaching the quieter one the lute. Phyllinda, I think her name is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow nice,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s dressed them up as beautiful as if they were little daughters of the manor,\u201d Willa continued. \u201cShe had three seamstresses working at their costumes all night long.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear that blue gown that Madame Gasquet had time to alter,\u201d Eleanor said, not wanting to think about Lisette\u2019s appropriation of the twins. \u201cThe one ordered by another customer.\u201d</p><p>Willa brought out the gown. \u201cLady Lisette insisted that each girl must have her own maid, which upset the housekeeper because she has only two downstairs maids now. Their hair is piled that high; the maids were given special wool pads to give height.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWool?\u201d Eleanor exclaimed. \u201cBut that\u2019s so hot and the sun is already shining!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange because Lady Lisette herself doesn\u2019t ever wear such things, but she ordered the maids to dress the girls\u2019 hair with them. I hear the children aren\u2019t that pleased.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait until the sun heats up that wool,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cMaster Tobias wants to know if he may take Oyster with him on the treasure hunt,\u201d Willa said.</p><p>\u201cI suppose he may,\u201d Eleanor replied. \u201cAs long as he keeps Oyster out of Lisette\u2019s sight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, he will. There\u2019s no love lost there, apparently. The little girls just dote on her, or so the nursery maid told me, but Master Tobias was quite snappish with her when she wanted the girls to sleep in her room for the night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy on earth would she wish to do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe planned to tell them stories of fairies and goblins,\u201d Willa said. \u201cWould you like this blue ribbon, my lady, or this dark green one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe blue, please,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cFairies and goblins?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJane says that Lady Lisette often stays up all night long singing and playing her lute and such, and then she sleeps during the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat must be difficult for the household.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEveryone receives a generous gift on Boxing Day from the duke. Apparently he makes a joke of the fact that his household is better-paid that any other in the county: he says it\u2019s the \u2018Lisette Toll,\u2019 as if she were a toll road, you see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHas her father arrived yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. Lady Marguerite is here, though. She arrived just before breakfast. The squire\u2019s family will be coming for the day, and all the ladies on the orphanage committee. It\u2019s a proper f\u00eate! The house will be bursting at the seams.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI believe my mother wishes us to leave after the treasure hunt,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cNot now that the Duke of Astley has returned,\u201d Willa said with a knowing look in her eye. \u201cHe arrived two hours ago, practically at the crack of dawn, and Her Grace told her maid that we\u2019d stay as long as he does. Mrs. Busy is cooking so you wouldn\u2019t believe, as it\u2019ll be a grand dinner tonight with Lisette\u2019s father here. He\u2019s almost never home, you know. They say he can\u2019t bear to see Lisette as she is. He never broke off that betrothal with the squire\u2019s son because he keeps hoping she\u2019ll change.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor digested that in silence. It was only when Willa had declared her to be quite ready that she asked, \u201cWhat did Tobias say to Lisette, do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told her to stubble it because she\u2019d give the girls nightmares,\u201d Willa said, laughing. \u201cAnd the whole household is saying how Lisette has met her match at last, because she didn\u2019t have a word to say back to him. She knew that a spasm would just make him laugh at her, so she didn\u2019t bother, just left the room, and that was the end of her plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would guess that he will have no problem controlling Oyster during the treasure hunt,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cIf he can manage Lisette, he can manage a naughty puppy.\u201d</p><p>She cast a look out the balcony door before going downstairs. The lawn was already dotted with the white gowns of the committee ladies, their lacy parasols making them look like daisies. The orphans in their blue pinafores were darting and running about, and Eleanor didn\u2019t think it was her imagination that they already looked heartier.</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to go downstairs. She wanted to avoid Gideon, and avoid her mother as well. She wanted to avoid Lisette, because she might be tempted into unkindness, if not violence. She wanted to avoid Roland, because she wasn\u2019t in a poetic mood, and she didn\u2019t particularly wish to meet his father\u2019s hopeful eyes, either.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t hide. So she wandered downstairs just in time to see Lisette formally begin the hunt by ringing a little silver bell. A stage had been built in the back garden, and she was prancing about like the Queen of May, handing out flowers to all the children. Apparently the winning child wasn\u2019t to wear a gold crown, unless Lisette was planning to take it off her own head. She was wearing a small but unmistakably genuine crown; Eleanor couldn\u2019t believe that there were two such crowns in all of Kent.</p><p>\u201cTitania, Queen of the Fairies,\u201d Roland said, appearing at her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI always pictured Titania clad in gauzy leaves with her hair loose,\u201d Eleanor said, giving him a smile.</p><p>\u201cTitania was a termagant,\u201d Roland said, \u201cand that\u2019s the crucial distinction. Remember how Shakespeare says that she fought with her husband so violently that all the corn rotted in the field?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are unkind,\u201d Eleanor said, frowning at him.</p><p>\u201cI will admit that I hadn\u2019t conceived of Titania\u2019s fairies as bastard children of a duke.\u201d</p><p>Phyllinda and Lucinda were standing on either side of Lisette, looking like small attendants, if not fairy ones. Their hair was piled so high that they appeared to be wearing airy beehives. They were both dressed in cloth of gold, which seemed utterly inappropriate for such a hot day, but their dresses did match Lisette\u2019s crown.</p><p>Still, what did she know about children? Perhaps they loved Lisette\u2019s reflected glory. Certainly the ladies from the orphanage committee were agog over the girls\u2019 beauty. And Lisette was rather carefully not identifying their lineage. Eleanor had a strong feeling that the good Christian members of the Ladies\u2019 Committee might not be quite so rapturous over Phyllinda\u2019s lovely eyes if they knew her parentage. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo child is going to win the prize,\u201d Roland said disgustedly, looking up from the page of clues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to solve them. Listen to this: In marble walls as white as milk, lined with a skin as soft as silk, within a fountain crystal clear, a golden apple doth appear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m not done. No doors there are to this stronghold, yet thieves break in and steal the gold. What am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t the faintest idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know that one, but only because my nanny used to tell it to me. The answer is, an egg. Lisette apparently expects the children to figure the riddle and then be able to find the henhouse and bring back an egg.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor shrugged. \u201cI suppose she\u2019ll just give the prizes to whichever children solve one or two riddles, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat will be Villiers\u2019s bastards,\u201d Roland said with a sneer.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you say so?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause Lisette isn\u2019t playing fair, of course.\u201d He nodded.</p> <p>Sure enough, Lisette was whispering in Lucinda\u2019s ear. The little girl dimpled up at her and patted her hand, and then ran off.</p><p>Eleanor discovered that she was smiling. The expression on Lucinda\u2019s face didn\u2019t display adoration, the way Willa had described. She would describe it as something altogether more knowing\u2014and more manipulative. Well, what would she have expected? They were Villiers\u2019s daughters, after all.</p><p>She looked around again, trying to ignore the way Roland was standing too close to her. Gideon was basking in her mother\u2019s smiles. Lucinda had run directly from Lisette over to Tobias, who was lounging by the raspberry bushes. There was no sign of Oyster, to her relief. A great flock of orphans in blue pinafores were clustered together, puzzling over the clues; they seemed to be having as much trouble reading them as solving them.</p><p>Villiers was nowhere to be seen. It was ridiculous to find that the day lost its flavor simply because an errant duke had chosen not to participate in the frolic.</p><p>Just then a soft voice said, \u201cLady Eleanor.\u201d She looked down to find Phyllinda smiling up at her.</p><p>With precisely the same smile her twin had just used on Lisette.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the answers,\u201d Eleanor said bluntly. \u201cI can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p><p>Phyllinda\u2019s smile just broadened and she held up her hand. \u201cWill you help me with something in the house, Lady Eleanor? Please?\u201d The last please was tacked on with pitiful emphasis.</p><p>Eleanor could hardly say no, even given the fact that the child was clearly up to something. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Phyllinda leaned close and whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s private. To do with my petticoats.\u201d</p><p>Since, in her better moments, she was a lady, Eleanor didn\u2019t roll her eyes. Instead she took the hand Phyllinda was offering and followed her into the house. They passed Gideon, who cast a look at their linked hands and grew a little stiff.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s up here,\u201d Phyllinda said, lisping a bit.</p><p>Having a naturally suspicious mind, Eleanor thought back to the way Phyllinda spoke when she and her sister were first uncovered in the carriage. No lisp. One had to suppose that the lisp had been proven effective in outwitting adults susceptible to mindless sentiment.</p><p>\u201cThis is your bedchamber, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Phyllinda lisped, stepping to the side. She was overacting terribly.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eleanor said, pushing open the door to her room and walking in. \u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d</p><p>It was with no great feeling of surprise that she heard the door shut behind her and a key turn in the lock. It seemed she had been given a reprieve from the spectacle, just as she wished. She pulled off her blue slippers and wiggled her toes, then strolled over and reached for the bell to ring for Willa, only to find that it had been cut off. Intrepid of them. One might even call it diabolical.</p><p>The only thing that made her remotely curious was why. She didn\u2019t present any particular threat to the children\u2019s desire to win the prizes donated by her mother, Lisette, and the Duke of Villiers. Of course she could go onto her balcony and call down to the crowd below. But it seemed ungracious, somehow.</p><p>So, taking advantage of the unscheduled opportunity, she lay down on her bed and listened to the hubbub of polite voices drifting from the garden. She didn\u2019t wake up until the door opened.</p><p>\u201cI wondered where you were,\u201d she asked in a drowsy voice. \u201cDid they just lock the door behind you, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Villiers sounded a bit testy.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps the adults are being removed to allow more time for answering riddles,\u201d Eleanor offered, turning on her side and tucking a hand under her cheek. \u201cIn that case, we should expect Lisette to join us any moment.\u201d</p><p>He snorted and threw himself into an armchair. She was trying to remember her dream, because he had been in it. Oyster had thrown himself at her in his usual frenzied display of love, and\u2014</p><p>\u201cYou were wearing a pinafore,\u201d she exclaimed. To a raised eyebrow, she explained, \u201cIn my dream. And,\u201d she added thoughtfully, \u201cnothing else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would like to have that dream about you, but I don\u2019t care for the thought of myself in a frock. You look tiresomely beautiful,\u201d Villiers observed. He stretched out his legs. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I mind being locked up with you, but what the devil are we doing in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told Tobias that I would not allow him to win the prize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that explains why you\u2019re here, then. I fail to see why I should suffer the same fate. Nor why we have to be together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that my son locked me in a room so that he could win fifty pounds, after I expressly forbade him to do so?\u201d Villiers\u2019s voice was cold, so cold, but she knew him now. She knew to look past the utterly dazzling costume he was wearing, and past his chilly look, straight into his eyes. He was angry...he was a little hurt.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s just like you,\u201d she pointed out. \u201cWhat he wants, he intends to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like that. Well, I might be like that, but I don\u2019t lock people in rooms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ve learned something useful about your son. And I must say, if you didn\u2019t already know that he believes in shortcuts to winning, you haven\u2019t played knucklebones with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who cheated,\u201d he pointed out.</p><p>\u201cOnly after prying the bones out from under his leg and then again from his sleeve. He\u2019s got those little girls of yours begging the answers from Lisette. Cheating, in other words.\u201d</p><p>He was silent a moment. And then, very un-ducally: \u201cDevil take it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s parenthood,\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cIf you don\u2019t lay down the rules the right way, the child simply slips the leash and does as she wishes. Just look at me. My poor mother has no idea what a hussy I am. She would be not only astonished, but affronted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s her fault that you succumbed to Gideon\u2019s blue eyes. Though may I add that I am astonished by the vapid shallowness with which he is basking in your mother\u2019s attentions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGideon does adore my mother. When his mother died, she became something of a substitute.\u201d</p><p>Villiers snorted. \u201cNow what are we supposed to do?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI think we should probably prevent them from winning,\u201d Eleanor said, standing up and stretching. \u201cThat was a very nice nap.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just how do you suggest\u2014Oh.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor went to the balcony door, pulled the key from the keyhole, and paused, looking over her shoulder. \u201cYou know, I think it might be best if you allow me to handle this.\u201d</p><p>Villiers got up, frowning. \u201cOf course I will not\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t hear the rest, because she had closed the balcony door behind her and turned the key. Then she walked through Villiers\u2019s bedchamber, pausing for a moment to look at his silver-backed brushes, and went down the stairs.</p><p>It didn\u2019t take her long to find the three children; she just had to call for Oyster and then listen for his bark. They were inside the half-ruined folly, another of Lisette\u2019s abandoned projects.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you three doing?\u201d she asked, going down on one knee to greet Oyster.</p><p>Phyllinda\u2019s eyes grew very round. \u201cHow did you get out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balcony.\u201d</p> <p>Tobias gave a quick look around.</p><p>\u201cYour father is still locked in my room,\u201d she told him, answering his unspoken question.</p><p>His mouth fell open too, so she was faced with three astounded little faces. Inheritance was a truly amazing thing: they could not be anyone else\u2019s children. Not even given the fact that Tobias had cool gray eyes and the girls had lavender ones...it was the turn of their chins, the shape of their eyes, and some sort of shrewd, fierce intelligence.</p><p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you tell me exactly what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re planning to win, of course,\u201d Lucinda said. Eleanor could see a dawning respect in her eyes. \u201cWhy did you lock the duke in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought he might create more trouble than your plan merits,\u201d she said, giving Oyster a last pat and standing up. \u201cSo you want to win all three prizes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFifty pounds each!\u201d Phyllinda said with a little gasp.</p><p>\u201cA lot of money,\u201d Eleanor agreed.</p><p>Tobias just waited, his eyes narrowed. He knew her reappearance meant trouble.</p><p>\u201cHow are you doing with the clues so far?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Lucinda stepped back so Eleanor could see their collection. Tobias\u2019s velvet coat was crumpled into a nest that included, among other things, three rather dirty eggs. \u201cWe have all but one,\u201d she said, giving her the syrupy sweet smile that Lisette so favored.</p><p>\u201cStop that,\u201d Eleanor said sharply.</p><p>The smile froze.</p><p>\u201cIf you want to smile, smile. But spare me the acting. You don\u2019t do it very well. Now which riddle haven\u2019t you solved?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Tobias said reluctantly. \u201cIt\u2019s only two lines. Little girl, little girl, where have you been?\u201d And then, Gathering apricots to give to the queen. We were about to go back to Lisette again because we don\u2019t know where to find an apricot. I don\u2019t think they even grow here. I\u2019ve only seen one once.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a nursery rhyme,\u201d Eleanor said. They all blinked at her. \u201cA rhyme for children,\u201d she explained. Of course they hadn\u2019t learned any frivolous rhymes, given their childhoods. \u201cNext line is, Gathering roses to give to the queen. The girl gives the roses to the queen, who gives her a big diamond as a reward. I suppose that Lady Lisette is the queen\u2014she is wearing a crown\u2014and you need to give her an apricot-colored rose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s easy!\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cThere\u2019s a load of roses around the side of the house.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not the right color. She wants the ones by the river. Come on,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>They walked out of the folly and around the back of the house, Tobias carrying his precious cargo wrapped in his coat.</p><p>\u201cOh, there you are!\u201d Gideon called, walking toward her. He didn\u2019t bother to acknowledge the children, just took her arm and brought her to a halt. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere. You missed the strawberries and cream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, pleasantly enough, \u201cI\u2019m engaged at the moment. But I should be back in five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t like it, but she gently pulled free and walked on. As they left the gardens and started down the path to the river, a small hand slipped into hers. Phyllinda was looking up at her, her eyes clear and her mouth unsmiling. \u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t like you,\u201d Lucinda put in.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a molly,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cThere\u2019s something ratty about him. Just stay away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy ratty?\u201d Eleanor inquired.</p><p>\u201cHe has big front teeth. You know how the duke looks a proper fright in those coats he wears?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI suppose you mean Villiers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, him. He\u2019s got awful taste, but all the same, when he looks at you, you know what he\u2019s thinking. Whereas that one looks a bit unhinged. Maybe he\u2019ll marry Lisette. She\u2019s the same.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor thought about it for a moment and then said, \u201cYour father is marrying Lisette, Tobias. So you mustn\u2019t say slighting things about her, particularly in front of Phyllinda and Lucinda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not stupid,\u201d he said.</p><p>They rounded the curve and arrived at the stream. \u201cThe roses grow over there,\u201d Eleanor said, pointing.</p><p>Lucinda started forward, of course, so she grabbed her arm. \u201cThat\u2019s straight up the rocks, and you can\u2019t do it in those clothes. Your hair alone would disbalance you. Tobias, you fetch three roses.\u201d</p><p>He was up the slope in a moment, and barring a bit of colorful language when he was introduced to the roses\u2019 vicious thorns, he was successful. \u201cWe\u2019ve got everything!\u201d he said triumphantly, pulling open his crumpled coat to add the roses. By some miracle the three eggs were intact.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to claim the three prizes,\u201d Eleanor said genially.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tobias sounded guarded.</p><p>\u201cAnd those other orphans, the ones Lucinda and Phyllinda lived with...they won\u2019t win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot everyone can win,\u201d Tobias pointed out.</p><p>\u201cThere are those who would say that you have won. After all, your father intends to give you each ten thousands pounds when you reach eighteen years. Whereas the Janes and Marys and the other girls will go off to be ladies\u2019 maids.\u201d</p><p>Phyllinda had her hand in Eleanor\u2019s again. \u201cAt least they don\u2019t have to make buttons any longer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true. But they will never live in a grand house with their brothers and sisters. You do know that you have three more siblings, don\u2019t you?\u201d And when Phyllinda and Lucinda nodded, \u201cThe Marys will go out to work because there is no one to take care of them. Whereas you have a father, and while he may have lost you for a while, he will always take care of you from now on, you know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Tobias said.</p><p>\u201cNot in front of your little sisters,\u201d she said, giving him a look.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>\u201cJane-Melinda didn\u2019t solve a single clue because she can\u2019t read,\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cShe\u2019s awfully nice. I\u2019ll give her my egg and rose and stuff.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cA girl named Sarah-Susan told me where to find you in the sty,\u201d Tobias said. His tone was begrudging but accepting.</p><p>\u201cWe could give mine to Mary-Bertha,\u201d Phyllinda said. \u201cBecause once when Mrs. Minchem said that Lucinda couldn\u2019t have any breakfast or lunch, she kept some bread and gave it to us. Do you remember that, Lucinda?\u201d</p><p>Her sister nodded, but Eleanor was having trouble speaking around the anger in her throat, so they just went up to the lawn in silence and found the girls in question.</p><p>Eleanor stood watching the excitement as the three little girls claimed their prizes, until she remembered that she had a duke locked in her room. Tobias seemed reconciled to losing; he was trying to train Oyster to walk on his hind legs, which was an anatomical impossibility, as anyone could have told him.</p> <p>\u201cI know why you locked your father up,\u201d she asked him, \u201cbut why did you lock me in as well? And why in my bedchamber?\u201d</p><p>He looked up with an odd twist to his mouth. \u201cI don\u2019t like Lisette.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe old nanny told me that if a lady and gentleman are locked in a room together, they have to get married. Which doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said frankly, \u201cbecause if they want to be shaking the sheets, they don\u2019t need sheets to be doing it, if you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>Clearly Tobias had seen more than he should have in his short life, but he didn\u2019t seem particularly scandalized.</p> <p>\u201cSo you thought...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather you than her,\u201d he said. It wasn\u2019t much of an endorsement, but it felt good. \u201cHow\u2019d you get out, anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe balcony door was unlocked and no one had the faintest idea we were together, so your plan came to naught. And I do think that people do better to choose their own spouses. Your father wants to marry Lisette.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you want to marry that ratty duke?\u201d His tone was indescribably scornful.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said rather faintly. \u201cHe\u2019s an old friend.\u201d She looked up and saw Gideon determinedly making his way across the lawn toward her, followed by her mother. \u201cI had better let your father out now. Take care of Oyster.\u201d</p><p>She dashed into the house, pretending she didn\u2019t hear her mother calling.</p> <p>Leopold was asleep. He had stripped off his coat and was lying sprawled out on her bed. She tiptoed across the carpet and stood next to him. He would never be beautiful, like Gideon. He was blunt and complicated, and still grieving for his brother.</p><p>She was in love with him.</p><p>Horribly, truly in love. The kind of love that wouldn\u2019t alter, ever, and wouldn\u2019t admit impediments.</p><p>Lisette was an impediment.</p><p>Gideon was another.</p><p>And frankly, Leopold was the third obstacle, given his professed intention to marry Lisette. Her love may not alter, but it wasn\u2019t going to succeed either.</p><p>She kicked off her slippers and then reached under her skirts to unhook her panniers and her petticoat. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t unlace her gown without help, so once she\u2019d taken off her stockings, and left a heap of petticoats on the floor, she pulled up her skirts and climbed onto the bed.</p><p>Well, to be exact, she climbed on top of Leopold.</p> <p>He grunted and pulled her down to him, and in that moment she realized that he hadn\u2019t been asleep, not all the time she stood watching him, and certainly not while she was undressing.</p><p>\u201cDid you dream about me wearing nothing but a pinafore?\u201d she asked. He was kissing her neck and seemed to be\u2014from all signs\u2014very happy to see her.</p><p>\u201cNo pinafore,\u201d he said. His voice had already taken on the wildness that was so opposite to his immaculately polished appearance as a duke. Her entire heart, her body, welcomed it. His fingers were...everywhere.</p><p>\u201cEleanor?\u201d he asked, pulling his shirt over his head.</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, just waited for him to throw off his breeches, grab a French letter, and then greedily took all of him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get to kiss you,\u201d he said, arching up with a look of fierce bliss that belied his complaint.</p><p>\u201cNext time,\u201d she said, gasping. \u201cI have decided not to marry Gideon.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were closed, but at that they opened. She put a hand over his mouth and rode him hard, but she couldn\u2019t divert him. His eyes stayed on her face, even as his body rose to meet hers.</p><p>\u201cI know you want to marry Lisette,\u201d she told him, keeping her hand over his lips even though he was nipping her fingers. \u201cAnd I honor your decision. I am not saying this because I want you to marry me.\u201d</p><p>Though she did, she did.</p><p>He managed to pull away her hand and she froze. \u201cSay a word and I\u2019ll leave,\u201d she said. He shoved upwards and she easily evaded him. \u201cRight now. I\u2019ll leave this room.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s your room!\u201d</p><p>She took him with a wave of heat and pleasure, and lost track of her thoughts for a bit, but then remembered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make you marry me,\u201d she said, gasping a little because he had picked up the pace.</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><p>That couldn\u2019t be hurt in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re doing something honorable,\u201d she said. \u201cYou feel that Lisette will make a better mother to your children. We\u2019re not children, Leopold. We can speak the truth aloud to each other.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d she said, leaning over to give him a kiss. It was almost too tender, though, and she had to sit up again fast, before she kissed him again. \u201cIt\u2019s easier for me, because I don\u2019t have children.\u201d She gave him a lopsided grin. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to marry for love.\u201d</p><p>This time he froze.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t love Gideon, so I won\u2019t marry him. I used to love him, but somehow it all changed.\u201d</p><p>A moment later she found herself flat on her back, and they weren\u2019t making love any more.</p><p>\u201cLeo,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He was braced over her, frowning down through a lock of hair that had fallen over his eyes. He was delicious...heartbreaking.</p><p>She nipped his lip. She\u2019d be damned if he\u2019d ever find out how she felt. She didn\u2019t ever want yet another man to know that she loved him more than he loved her. Never again.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so calm about my marriage to Lisette,\u201d he said, scowling. \u201cI want to kill Astley, every time I see him. Hell, every time he even looks at you I feel like wringing his scraggy neck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a man,\u201d she said, ignoring the little voice in her head that reminded her just how murderous she felt every time Lisette trilled out her excitement over becoming half of Leopold and Lisette, as she kept referring to them. \u201cDo you suppose that you could make love to me now, Leopold?\u201d She reached up and ran her fingers along his cheeks. And then she said it, because it had to be said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be leaving first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He looked down at her, and then he pulled away.</p><p>\u201cLeopold?\u201d She looked down at herself. Her blue gown was rucked around her waist, and her bare legs were trembling.</p><p>But he got up and walked away from the bed, raking his fingers through his hair.</p><p>The words going through her head were not words that a lady was supposed to know, let alone think. She pulled her gown down over her knees and sat on the edge of the bed. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t make love to you knowing it\u2019s the last time,\u201d he said finally, his voice tight.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say. She couldn\u2019t fight for him. If she were to voice what she thought about Lisette...she might convince him. But it would always be her opinion against his. He had to either see it himself, or\u2014or marry Lisette. That was all there was to it.</p><p>He turned around. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this way about another woman.

But I honestly think that Lisette is unique in her attitude toward the children\u2019s illegitimacy. She doesn\u2019t even see it as a problem. She can teach them to live without shame. She already adores the girls, and they adore her. I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>He turned away again.</p><p>There was a long moment of silence. Sunshine came in through the balcony door and slashed across his broad shoulders. She didn\u2019t let herself feel...anything.</p><p>Finally he said, \u201cI can\u2019t choose whom I would, because I made this bed, as the saying goes. And I must lie in it.\u201d He turned back to her.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d she said, quite peaceably. After all, as he said, she\u2019d been through this exact scene before. She had a precedent; she understood the undertow of anguish that would follow, the sense of regret and loss, the bewilderment of loving someone more than he loved her.</p> <p>The next time around, she thought, it\u2019s going to be different.</p><p>But it was different. She knew that. There wouldn\u2019t be any next time around for her when it came to love...but that was all right, too.</p><p>If she couldn\u2019t have the complicated duke in front of her, she didn\u2019t want to love anyone. He was still staring at the empty fireplace, so she just drank in the sight of him, his muscled legs and lean powerful rear, the way his shoulders flared, the exact color of his hair\u2014</p><p>And that was when the door burst open.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-eight</p><p>It happened so fast that afterward Leopold was never quite able to describe it. One moment he was trying to figure out why his heart felt as if it were splitting in two, and the next moment he was faced by an utterly enraged, out-of-control Duke of Astley who was screaming\u2014literally screaming\u2014about the fact that he had dishonored Eleanor.</p> <p>Which he had.</p><p>No one could argue otherwise, given the fact that he was stark naked in her bedchamber. He pulled on his breeches, but could think of only one thing to say. \u201cDo you want everyone in this house to know?\u201d His voice cut across Astley\u2019s hysteria like a knife.</p><p>The man choked.</p><p>\u201cYou will give me satisfaction,\u201d Astley said, his eyes bright as a lunatic\u2019s. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must be out of your mind,\u201d Leopold said, unwisely. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in duels.\u201d</p><p>Astley went for his throat, forcing Leopold to throw him across the room, which was ridiculous and made him feel even more foolish.</p><p>\u201cI know why you want to keep quiet!\u201d Astley hissed, lurching back on his feet. \u201cI will marry Eleanor no matter whether you\u2019ve debauched her or not. She is not in control of her own impulses. She needs a man, and I left her. This is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will not marry either of you,\u201d Eleanor cried, intervening. \u201cSo Gideon, if you wish to save my reputation, I would beg you to stop speaking so loudly.\u201d</p> <p>Astley stared at her. \u201cOf course you\u2019re marrying me. I have forgiven you, Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI will not marry either of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI forgive you,\u201d he persisted.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t need your forgiveness,\u201d Leopold found himself saying through clenched teeth. \u201cYou should be groveling at her feet, begging for her forgiveness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI already have,\u201d he said, with an odd sort of punctured dignity. \u201cAnd now I shall defend her honor, just as I should have defended her years ago.\u201d The sound of his slap was shockingly loud in the quiet room. \u201cName your seconds.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake,\u201d Leopold said. He turned away and walked toward the balcony window. He had won four duels and lost one, badly. And he had sworn never to fight with a sword again. He was too good\u2014and it was only after almost losing his own to a dueling wound that he realized how much he prized life.</p><p>His successful duels had ended with him wounding his opponents, none mortally. It was only by the grace of God that he hadn\u2019t killed someone. He had no desire to alter that record.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to kill you,\u201d he said, turning around.</p><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t. Virtue\u2014truth\u2014God are on my side.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAstley, you\u2019re one of the House of Lords\u2019s most vocal opponents of dueling, and you have been for the last few years at least. Tell me that you even know how to handle a rapier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I do. I was trained as is any gentleman\u2019s son. Do I need to slap you again, Your Grace?\u201d Astley was maddened by rage. His face was completely white.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Leopold said slowly. \u201cBut I won\u2019t fight you with seconds. If you want to fight, you\u2019ll have to do it privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause if you involve another, the world will know. And if Eleanor then refuses to marry you, as she has a perfect right to do, she will be ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t marry him instead of me!\u201d Astley swung around.</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked me,\u201d Eleanor said, head high.</p><p>Leopold actually sympathized with Astley this time. He could have ducked; he certainly knew what was coming. But he took a hard right to his chin.</p><p>Eleanor grabbed Astley\u2019s arm. \u201cHe\u2019s marrying Lisette! For pity\u2019s sake, Gideon. He can hardly marry me when he\u2019s promised to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why are you in her bedchamber?\u201d Astley said, panting.</p><p>Although it hurt like the devil, Leopold refused to give his opponent the satisfaction of seeing him feel his chin. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a bastard,\u201d he said heavily.</p><p>\u201cYou are that,\u201d Astley said. \u201cLook me in the eye and tell me that you\u2019d rather marry Lisette than Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>It hurt to open his mouth, and not only because of the blow. He didn\u2019t manage to open it before Eleanor intervened once more.</p><p>\u201cHe does!\u201d she said, her voice tight. \u201cWhat are you trying to prove, Gideon? Leopold has decided that Lisette will be a better mother to his children. He bedded me, but that gave him precisely as much desire to marry me as it gave you. In short: not much.\u201d</p><p>Astley started to speak, but she held up her hand. Her eyes were flaming. \u201cNeither of you seem to care, but I\u2019ll tell you this: I deserve better than either of you. I deserve a man who will love me, who will believe to the bottom of his heart that I\u2019m exactly the woman he wants to raise his children. Who won\u2019t think of me as just a woman to bed.\u201d</p><p>Leopold felt her words as if a blow had shuddered down his spine. He had never meant to hurt her. And yet there were tears standing in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cI deserve more,\u201d she repeated savagely.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019ll be a wonderful mother,\u201d Astley said, like an eager puppy dog. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to marry me because you realize you made a mistake.

Because believe it or not, I don\u2019t believe in duels anymore.\u201d</p><p>The slap made his head fall back and his teeth rattle.</p><p>\u201cWhat in God\u2019s name was that for? That\u2019s the third time you\u2019ve struck me in five minutes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I love her,\u201d Astley said. \u201cI behaved like a young ass when I left her. And maybe she\u2019s right when she says it\u2019s too late for us. But you\u2014you used her. You made her fall in love with you, and you rejected her. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>For the first time, Leopold felt a stir of alarm. Faint, but real. \u201cYou can\u2019t kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Astley stated clearly. \u201cI dishonored Eleanor. This will atone for what I did to her. I\u2019ll revenge her. I\u2019ll take you down because it\u2019s the right thing to do. You broke her heart. I\u2019ve never seen her look like that, not when I left her, and not thereafter. By God, I never understood the point of dueling before but I understand it now.\u201d</p><p>Leopold knew when a man had irrevocably made up his mind. He pulled on his boots. \u201cTomorrow at dawn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a stretch of green down by the river. It will do.\u201d He felt inexpressibly weary. A man wanted to kill him because he had broken the heart of\u2014</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>She was so logical, so cool, when she agreed with him that he should marry Lisette. Women had moaned and murmured and shouted their love for him before, not that he ever believed them. Hell, Lisette had patted his cheek and told him that she loved him earlier that morning.</p> <p>Eleanor never said a word.</p><p>\u201cShe doesn\u2019t love me,\u201d he said, just as Astley was leaving the room.</p><p>\u201cYou fool,\u201d Astley said savagely. \u201cYou utter ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hardly an uninterested bystander,\u201d Leopold said.</p><p>\u201cI do love her. But what I see in her eyes when she looks at you...I never saw that before. She used to desire me. She loves you. But that doesn\u2019t matter, does it?\u201d He turned around, his eyes bright with scorn. \u201cYou\u2019ve made your choice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t marry whom I wish\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what I told her all those years ago,\u201d Astley said, stepping into the corridor. \u201cPrecisely those words.\u201d</p><p>And he was gone.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-nine</p><p>Eleanor thought she had lived through nightmares before, but the torment of dinner that night surpassed any anguish she had felt when Gideon left her. Lisette\u2019s father, the Duke of Gilner, had returned, and contrary to Lisette\u2019s prediction was enchanted to give his daughter\u2019s hand to the Duke of Villiers.</p><p>He didn\u2019t turn a hair over the question of the duke\u2019s illegitimate children, just said cheerfully\u2014and in front of the entire table, \u201cI\u2019m sure my little girl has told you that she can\u2019t bear young of her own, so this is perfect.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor had been looking everywhere except at Villiers, who was sitting across from her, but at this she peeked from under her lashes, just enough to see that Lisette had not bothered to inform her future husband of this fact. But of course he nodded as if the news were of no account.</p><p>Perhaps it wasn\u2019t. After all, he wanted a mother for the children he already had. Surely an heir was less important. That thought led to bitterness, so she took a deep breath and pushed the question of Villiers\u2019s children aside.</p><p>\u201cIt seems we both have reason to celebrate,\u201d her mother said archly, from her position at Gilner\u2019s right hand. \u201cOur dear children are matched\u2014and so suitably too!\u201d</p><p>For all his liberal notions, the duke didn\u2019t seem quite as pleased with her mother\u2019s announcement, once he realized that Gideon\u2019s wife was barely in the grave. He was a nice man, Eleanor thought. Too nice, perhaps. If he\u2019d placed more of a curb on Lisette...She sighed. There was no use thinking about it.</p><p>Anne squeezed her hand under the table. \u201cAlmost through,\u201d her sister whispered. \u201cOne more course.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor gave her a lopsided smile. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re with me.\u201d</p><p>Anne leaned over and said in her ear. \u201cYou\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll get revenge\u2014on both of them. I have plans.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor didn\u2019t care.</p><p>At that moment she heard the scribble-scrabble of sharp claws on the parquet. Her heart stopped. It couldn\u2019t be. It\u2014</p><p>Oyster tore around the corner into the dining room, going so quickly that she heard his claws scrape the wood.</p><p>\u201cOh, no!\u201d she yelped, as loud as Oyster himself.</p><p>Lisette was sitting to the left of her father. She leaped up, jumped on her chair and screamed. Of course.</p><p>Eleanor was running around the table, trying to catch her puppy, and only learned afterwards what happened. Apparently Oyster bounded onto Lisette\u2019s chair as if he\u2019d grown wings.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s trying to bite me!\u201d Lisette screamed.</p><p>Anne said later that it looked as if he was planning to lick her slipper.</p><p>Whatever Oyster\u2019s intention, he had only a second before Lisette, without breaking her scream, scooped him up and threw him with all her might across the table and through the air. He didn\u2019t even have time to bark as he sailed over Gideon\u2019s head and slammed into the wall.</p><p>Time became slow, like honey pouring from a spoon. The puppy slid down the paneling and collapsed in a boneless heap of too-large paws.</p><p>\u201cDaughter!\u201d Gilner roared.</p><p>Still Lisette screamed.</p><p>Eleanor found herself on her knees by Oyster, tears streaming down her face. She was afraid to move him. Not that it mattered. He didn\u2019t appear to be breathing. Then Villiers was there, sliding one huge hand under the puppy\u2019s neck and the other under his body. \u201cWe\u2019ll take him into the library,\u201d he said, straightening.</p><p>He must have caught Lisette\u2019s eye.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that!\u201d she screamed. \u201cYou have no right to look at me like that!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d Villiers said.</p><p>\u201cYou are, you are! You look at me the same way that bastard son of yours looks at me!\u201d</p><p>There was a curious silence in the room, and a feeling that Eleanor suddenly remembered from Lisette\u2019s tantrums all those years ago. It felt as if the air in the room was in short supply.</p><p>Villiers didn\u2019t say a word, just shifted Oyster closer into his arms. His paw flapped lifelessly and Eleanor\u2019s tears came harder. Her sister\u2019s arms went around her, pressing a handkerchief to her cheek.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s your fault!\u201d Lisette shrieked, turning to her father.</p><p>He was on his feet as well, looking miserable and exhausted. \u201cBe quiet, Lisette,\u201d he said, his voice heavy.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault\u2014all of it. Everything!\u201d She looked around the table, her eyes as bright and hard as cannonballs. \u201cHe took away my baby. He took him away and since then nothing has been right.\u201d She turned to her father. \u201cYou are a horrible man! You are a despicable, child-stealing\u2014\u201d</p><p>Lady Marguerite\u2019s voice cut through the tirade with barely controlled rage. \u201cYou will not speak to your father that way, Lisette. You sent away your own child because you said he smelled and cried too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a falsehood!\u201d Lisette shouted. \u201cA lie because you\u2019re all liars!\u201d</p> <p>Marguerite\u2019s hand shot out and she pulled Lisette down from her perch on the chair and then grabbed her chin. \u201cLook at me! You told your mother to get rid of that child. You did that to my poor sister, who never recovered. She was never the same from the moment she gave that child to his father. She did it because she knew you would ruin that boy\u2019s life. But don\u2019t you ever, ever, blame another soul for that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will blame him,\u201d Lisette said, her voice a horrible sobbing half shriek. \u201cI will blame him because it is his fault. And his, as well.\u201d She pointed at Villiers. \u201cHe brought that boy here, that horrible boy, who made me think about my own child, the one you took from me. The one my own mother stole from me.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor couldn\u2019t bear another moment. She reached out and plucked Oyster from Villiers\u2019s arms before he could stop her. Then she began to walk away.</p><p>\u201cAnd you!\u201d she heard on a rising shriek. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what\u2014\u201d</p><p>There was a sound, of the slap of water, and Lisette\u2019s voice broke off.</p><p>Eleanor glanced over her shoulder. Anne had apparently snatched a pitcher of water from the sideboard and thrown it directly into Lisette\u2019s face.</p> <p>Eleanor just kept going, down the hall to the library. The footman threw open the door, such an appalled expression on his face that she realized everything must have been audible in the entry.</p><p>\u201cMy lady,\u201d Popper said, hurrying to her as she sat down on a sofa. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a cold cloth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need,\u201d Eleanor said, icily calm in her grief. \u201cIt won\u2019t help.\u201d Oyster\u2019s head had fallen over the crook of her arm and she couldn\u2019t see his eyes. She closed her own for a moment, and opened them to find Tobias standing before her. All color had drained from his face.</p><p>\u201cIt was me,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI did it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t do it. Lisette threw him against a wall.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d he repeated, his shoulders back as if he faced a magistrate. \u201cI rubbed a beef steak on the bottom of her slippers, and then I took Oyster out of your room and let him go.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor swallowed. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I wanted the duke to see what she was like. I never thought she\u2019d kill him. I never thought that!\u201d</p> <p>He looked like a boy who had never cried in his life. His skin was drawn tightly over the bones of his face.</p><p>Tears slipped down Eleanor\u2019s cheeks again. She slipped one arm out from under Oyster and held it out to him. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t. And Oyster knows you didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>He stood there, frozen, and she thought, My God, he\u2019s never been hugged. But then suddenly his wiry body was pressed against hers, and a not very clean hand fell on Oyster\u2019s fur, and they were both crying.</p><p>Someone handed her a large handkerchief of such fine quality that it could belong only to one person. He slipped a hand under Oyster\u2019s body.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><p>His eyes met hers over the head of his weeping child. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s breathing,\u201d Leopold said softly. \u201cTobias, he\u2019s breathing. Oyster isn\u2019t dead.\u201d</p><p>Popper trotted up with a wet cloth. They turned Oyster over. His legs seemed boneless, so limp that Eleanor secretly lost hope again. Tobias began gently rubbing the cloth around Oyster\u2019s closed eyes and around his muzzle, crooning, \u201cCome on, boy. Come on, old boy. Open your eyes, boy.\u201d</p><p>Oyster didn\u2019t stir. Eleanor pressed her lips together.</p><p>\u201cSmelling salts!\u201d Popper said, and left the room again.</p><p>\u201cI can feel his heart,\u201d Leopold said, his deep voice steady. \u201cJust keep doing it, son. Oyster will wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go running as soon as you wake up,\u201d Tobias said, his voice hoarse from crying. \u201cI\u2019ll take you out to the raspberry bushes and you can look for a rat. Remember when we looked for a rat? Remember that, Oyster? Come on, old boy, wake up!\u201d</p><p>Tears were running down his face again, so Eleanor pulled him a little closer.</p><p>\u201cShit,\u201d he muttered, reasserting his masculinity.</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not waking up.\u201d Despair cracked his voice. He said an even worse curse word, one that Eleanor had only heard once before.</p><p>\u201cGive him a moment,\u201d Leopold said.</p><p>Popper reappeared, waving a vial of smelling salts. The duke twisted the cork, putting the bitter smell directly under the puppy\u2019s nose.</p><p>\u201cEw!\u201d Tobias said, turning his head away.</p><p>In so doing, he missed the moment when Oyster opened his eyes and looked blearily around. But he didn\u2019t miss Oyster\u2019s weak lick.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2014He\u2014He\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d his father said in his measured way. But Eleanor knew to look past the magnificent ruby velvet coat, past the thick eyelashes. The Duke of Villiers was watching his boy bury his face in Oyster\u2019s fur, and she saw love in his eyes.</p><p>\u201cTobias,\u201d Eleanor said softly, \u201cOyster is yours now.\u201d</p><p>Tobias raised his head. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m giving you Oyster.\u201d She smiled at him. \u201cHe loves you, and you love him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut he loves you best!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take him looking for rats.\u201d She ran her fingers through Oyster\u2019s short hair. The puppy suddenly trembled all over, as if a stiff wind had ruffled through his fur. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty bored with me. And when I thought he was dead\u2014well, I think he\u2019s going to live to a good old age now. But just in case, I want him to do all the ratting he can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Tobias said. \u201cWe could share him. Maybe he could sleep with me sometimes. I know you like him in your bedchamber at night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that wouldn\u2019t really work.\u201d</p><p>Oyster tumbled off her lap. He seemed a bit wobbly, but gave himself a vigorous shake. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cHe\u2019ll love living in the nursery with you.

You said you were going to choose between them, and now you have to admit that the one out there is cracked. That Lisette, she\u2019s a bleeding nightmare!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI would be honored,\u201d Leopold said, looking up and meeting her eyes.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s throat ached. She\u2019d seen his eyes rest on her arm, encircling Tobias. And he finally understood what Lisette was like.</p><p>But she wanted more. She wanted someone who loved her for herself. Who didn\u2019t think she was good enough to bed but not good enough to mother\u2014and who changed his mind only when she proved herself maternal enough. She wanted to be married for herself.</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Tobias said, sounding as if he were pleading with Oyster again. \u201cYou\u2019ll marry him, won\u2019t you? He\u2019s not so bad. That way, Oyster can stay with both of us.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head, taking a deep breath. \u201cI can\u2019t, Tobias.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPlease!\u201d The word sounded wrung from his chest.</p><p>\u201cIt will be all right,\u201d she said, oddly touched. \u201cI promise you can keep Oyster.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2014I like you,\u201d he said, the words dropping into the silent room. \u201cAn\u2019 the girls do too. You\u2019ll see, we\u2019ll be good. You\u2019ll like Violet. She\u2019s not real pretty, like Lucinda and Phyllinda, but she\u2019s\u2014she\u2019s nice. And\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, standing up. \u201cI just can\u2019t, Tobias. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Leopold made a sharp movement, but said nothing.</p><p>Oyster jumped down and started frolicking around her ankles. Obviously his little brain had completely forgotten what had just happened to him. \u201cStay, Oyster,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Wonder of wonders, he actually sat down and wagged his tail.</p><p>\u201cGood dog.\u201d</p><p>It seemed a very long way to the door, but that was probably because of the silence behind her.</p><p>Chapter Thirty</p><p>Knole House, country residence of the Duke of Gilner</p><p>June 23, 1784</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t fight with you,\u201d Leopold said flatly. The sun was barely over the horizon and the air was surprisingly chilly.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t give you a choice,\u201d Astley said. He was pacing out the wet grass, his rapier unsheathed and ready.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should have thought of that before you debauched Eleanor. Before you made her fall in love with you and then chose a raving lunatic over her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might well kill you.

Death doesn\u2019t frighten me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you were in love with Eleanor.\u201d</p><p>Astley\u2019s face crumpled for a moment. \u201cI am. But I loved Ada too. Eleanor was right about that. It\u2019s all so complicated...\u201d He shook himself and kept pacing.</p><p>\u201cIf I kill you, I\u2019ll have to leave the country. But the children\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCart them away with you. You can\u2019t tell me that anyone will care if you leave, let alone them. You? The Duke of Villiers? You have no family, other than your clutch of bastards. Everyone will be glad to see you take them away from decent society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you ready to fight?\u201d Villiers said, a wave of ice filling his veins. Astley was right. Well, almost. Elijah and Jemma would care if he had to leave England permanently. But no one else would.</p><p>It would probably be better for Eleanor, actually. She wouldn\u2019t even have to see him. He hadn\u2019t been able to sleep, slowly taking himself though an understanding of his catastrophic idiocy. He had spurned Eleanor because he thought Lisette would be a better mother for his children. But Lisette, he now understood, looked upon children as if they were playmates\u2014or worse, playthings.</p><p>All the time, Eleanor was just the mother they needed: a woman who looked problems straight on, who didn\u2019t ever lie or pretend. Tobias had known that. Hell, even Oyster knew how perfect she was.</p><p>So why was he such an idiot? Why was he the only one who didn\u2019t know what motherhood looked like?</p><p>But even that was just a digression: the real question was why he was the only one who didn\u2019t know what love looked like. Who didn\u2019t realize that his heart, that stubborn organ that he\u2019d always ignored, would be seared with agony by the idea of never seeing Eleanor again?</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t he have known that was\u2014that was love. Real love. The kind of love that never goes away.</p><p>\u201cEn garde!\u201d Astley cried.</p><p>Leopold raised his rapier, still thinking.</p><p>\u201cI fully plan to kill you,\u201d Astley said pleasantly. \u201cPerhaps you should pay attention.\u201d</p><p>Leopold met Astley\u2019s eyes and saw his determination. \u201cIn which event, you\u2019ll be the one to leave the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one cares what I do,\u201d Astley said. \u201cMy mother\u2019s dead. My father\u2019s dead. Eleanor doesn\u2019t love me anymore. I don\u2019t want to sound like a sniveling schoolboy, but I no longer have the faintest interest in seeing tomorrow. And if I happen to be around for it, it won\u2019t matter whether I\u2019m in England or India.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell,\u201d Leopold muttered. The man was mad with grief. He\u2019d seen that look once before, on his aunt\u2019s face\u2014at the funeral for his five-year-old nephew.</p><p>He assumed his stance.</p><p>Obviously, Astley wasn\u2019t practiced. And he didn\u2019t even fight that well. In less fraught circumstances, Leopold could have chosen a spot to insert his blade and injured the duke within a minute. But passion, it seemed, changed everything.</p><p>He found himself fighting defensively, parrying Astley\u2019s inexperienced lunges. It was surprisingly difficult, perhaps because Astley didn\u2019t respond like a trained fencer. He simply slashed away as if Leopold were a hedge he had decided to prune.</p><p>Within ten minutes they were both sweating in the still-cool air. But Leopold couldn\u2019t keep his mind on the duel, no matter how he tried. He just kept thinking what a fool he was. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to trust his instincts.</p><p>His heart.</p><p>He took a step back. Astley bounded toward him, sword raised like some sort of avenging angel.</p><p>Leopold threw down his rapier.</p><p>Astley tried to stop, but slid on the wet grass and ended up on his back, sword in the air. Leopold offered him a hand. Astley ignored it and came to his feet, breathing hard. \u201cWhat in the holy hell are you doing?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cI refuse to fight,\u201d Leopold said, certain of the absolute rightness of that decision.</p><p>\u201cDo I have to slap you again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can try. But I will not fight you. A duel is for protecting one\u2019s honor,\u201d he said painstakingly.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think you need to protect your honor, after what you did?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I have any.\u201d He picked up his sword and untucked his shirt from his breeches in order to wipe the dew from the blade. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>There was an odd little silence in the meadow, broken only by the song of a lark over the river.</p><p>\u201cYou can kill me if you want,\u201d Leopold added.</p><p>\u201cOh, for Christ\u2019s sake.\u201d Astley sat down on a large rock at the side of the stream, then observed, \u201cMy arms ache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou should get a fencing master,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?

You can get her back,\u201d Astley offered.</p><p>Leopold shook his head. \u201cShe\u2019ll never believe that I love her now.

At first she didn\u2019t believe Eleanor\u2019s declaration that she had refused Gideon\u2019s proposal, even if he followed the strict protocol of a year of mourning. After finally grasping and accepting that, she leapt on the idea of her daughter marrying Villiers, bastard children or no. Resigning herself to the finality of Eleanor\u2019s edict regarding the second duke led to wailing and gnashing of teeth. Literally.</p><p>Melancholy hung over the house like a shroud. The duchess took to drifting from room to room, her face a combination of dejection and rage.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t imagine that you can live with your brother for life!\u201d she said shrilly one morning at breakfast. \u201cI won\u2019t have his life destroyed by having to live with a spinster sister. It would have ruined my marriage had your aunt lived with us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI mean to marry,\u201d Eleanor said steadily, repeating what she had said a few hundred times in the past weeks. \u201cJust not a duke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTwo dukes! Two dukes asking for your hand in marriage and you refused them both!\u201d The lament sounded like a lullaby to Eleanor now, so familiar that she didn\u2019t even distinguish the words in the general flow. \u201cThe only good thing to emerge from this disaster is that you\u2019ve got rid of that horrid dog, though I vow the Aubusson in the morning room still has an odor.\u201d</p><p>Then the letter arrived.</p><p>Dear Lady Eleanor Lindel,</p><p>I hope you will excuse the audacity of this missive. We danced together once in the past, although I am quite certain that you hardly noticed my presence. For my part, I was unable to express my admiration as I was engaged abroad on His Majesty\u2019s behalf. I am now returned to England, and thus I am bold enough to inquire, as I would have three years ago, if you would be so kind as to accompany me on a drive to Kensington Gardens.</p><p>Hon. Josiah Ormston</p><p>\u201cYou might as well go,\u201d Anne said, reading over her shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously been nursing a tendre for you all this time. It will cheer you up. Do you have any idea who he is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t. And it won\u2019t cheer me up,\u201d Eleanor said evenly.</p><p>Dear Mr. Ormston,</p><p>No lady can consider it an affront to learn that a gentleman has remembered her name over the span of three years. However, I must beg you to excuse me. Since I do not have the same memory of you, it would feel odd indeed to join you for a drive. Perhaps we shall renew our acquaintance when the season begins again.</p><p>Lady Eleanor</p><p>\u201cNever mind the fact that you\u2019ll be a burden on the family for life!\u201d the duchess wailed, upon learning of the letter. \u201cThe least you could do would be to marry someone above the merchant class. Though if your father ever returns from Russia, I shall direct him to inquire amongst that sort. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\u201d</p><p>Anne, who was kindly sharing most of her meals with them, doing her best to blunt the flow of recriminations, said, \u201cMother, you can\u2019t mean to say that you intend to sell Eleanor to the highest bidder.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d the duchess demanded. \u201cNo one can tell me that she isn\u2019t a serpent\u2019s tooth, gnawing on my bosom! Her dowry should be sufficient to buy us a merchant. Perhaps one of the Wedgwoods. I vow their crockery has grown so expensive that they must be worth a fortune.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMo-ther,\u201d Anne said, grinning.</p><p>Eleanor said nothing. Her father would never agree to such a scheme. And her mother didn\u2019t really mean it. By refusing two dukes, she had struck at the roots of her mother\u2019s strongest belief: that a title is God\u2019s own way of marking his blessed few. Marrying her daughter to a cit would likely kill her.</p><p>\u201cThe least you could do is devote an afternoon to this\u2014this Ermster fellow,\u201d the duchess continued. \u201cHe\u2019s a gentleman. He might marry you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who he is,\u201d Eleanor objected.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not in Debrett\u2019s,\u201d Anne added.</p><p>\u201cDebrett\u2019s, Debrett\u2019s,\u201d the duchess said fretfully. \u201cIt can be terribly inaccurate, you know. They completely neglected to note that your great-aunt was related, on her mother\u2019s side, to a Russian prince.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor sighed. \u201cIf you wish me to accompany Mr. Ormston to the park, I shall, if he asks me again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the least you could do,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThe very least. You\u2019ll have to make a true effort now, Eleanor. Everyone will think that Villiers rejected you. They\u2019ll be scrutinizing you to see what he found lacking.\u201d</p><p>Despite herself, the back of Eleanor\u2019s throat tightened.</p><p>\u201cMother,\u201d Anne interceded, leaning forward and waving a copy of the Morning Post, \u201cdid you read about this extraordinary robbery?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are so many,\u201d the duchess said. \u201cWho can keep account?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but this one happened in our own street!\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt says that an old gentleman, residing in Arlington Street, was sitting in his front parlor when he was extremely alarmed by the sudden appearance of a man with black crepe over his face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cape on his face? How extraordinary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, black crepe. He must have worn it...\u201d</p><p>Eleanor stopped listening. She had beaten back the tears, again. Perhaps she should go for a drive with Mr. Ormston. She had made up her mind to marry a mere gentleman, and any man who didn\u2019t even appear in Debrett\u2019s Peerage certainly qualified.</p><p>There was no real point in waiting for the new season. She suspected\u2014nay, she knew\u2014that her heart would never be whole. Yet she would marry, and she would have children, and she would feel joy again. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>But she would never love with that kind of ravening, blissful hunger that she felt for Leopold\u2014the kind of hunger that made her want to touch his arm when they were at supper, meet his eyes at breakfast, sleep next to him every night.</p><p>Mr. Ormston\u2019s next letter provided something of a relief from these gloomy thoughts.</p><p>Dear Lady Eleanor Lindel,</p><p>I entirely concur with your dismay at the idea of a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with an unknown man, though I should assure you that I am indeed a gentleman. As the younger son of Baron Plumptre, I took my uncle\u2019s surname in honor of his leaving me a snug fortune. I hope that I do not offend you by speaking so directly of these matters. Though I have little hope of refreshing your memory, as I recall, you wore a gown of some sort of blue stuff, and we talked of Miss Burney\u2019s play, The Witlings. You did not care for the actress who played Mrs. Voluble.</p> <p>With deep respect,</p><p>Hon. Josiah Ormston</p><p>\u201cWell, now you must remember him,\u201d Anne said with triumph, waving the letter. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like Mrs. Voluble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one did,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI barely recall the play, but every review said that Mrs. Voluble was shrill and unpleasant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I like about this man is that he remembers everything about dancing with you,\u201d Anne said, dropping the letter and turning to her mother\u2019s Debrett\u2019s, always handy on the parlor table. \u201cIt would be very nice for you to experience some adoration. Yes, he\u2019s here, listed not under Ormston, but as a second son to Plumptre. Josiah is not a wonderful name, but a sturdy one, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI suppose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou must go,\u201d Anne said. \u201cMother will never let you hear the end of it otherwise.\u201d</p><p>Dear Mr. Ormston,</p><p>I would be pleased to accompany you to the park tomorrow.</p><p>Lady Eleanor</p><p>\u201cYou should wear the blue gown you took to Kent,\u201d Anne said. \u201cIt might remind him of whatever it was you were wearing three years ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll wear one of my old gowns,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cIt did me no good to put on a wanton appearance, Anne. You have to admit that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo lip color?\u201d Anne asked, horrified.</p><p>\u201cNone. And a modest dress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps you weren\u2019t aware of this, but I instructed Willa to give away most of the gowns you used to own,\u201d her sister pointed out.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI certainly did,\u201d she retorted. \u201cJust because you\u2019ve been thwarted in love...\u201d She paused, and added, \u201cagain, doesn\u2019t mean that you should turn yourself into a pattern card of domestic dreariness. You\u2019ve had very bad luck, Eleanor. Now you need to be prudent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am being prudent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. You are going to dress like the desirable young lady that you are. You are going to act in a proper manner. Don\u2019t tell me that Villiers didn\u2019t get a good look at your silver combs, Eleanor, because I know perfectly well that he did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m a fool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying that perhaps you should just follow the path that the rest of us have taken successfully,\u201d her sister said gently. \u201cFlirt with the gentleman, be enticing and yet modest. It\u2019s a game, Eleanor, but it\u2019s a most rewarding one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d Eleanor said, inexpressibly depressed.</p><p>\u201cRemember, that was your first season, and your head was full of Gideon. Any number of respectable gentlemen might have fallen in love with you, and you wouldn\u2019t have noticed. I would suggest the sprigged muslin, because the gauze around the bodice makes it practically prudish.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor nodded, acquiescing.</p><p>\u201cAnd I suppose that you might eschew the black around your eyes,\u201d Anne said. \u201cBut you simply must have a bit of cheek color. You look as pale as a ghost. Poor Mr. Ormston will think you suffered from a bout of consumption while he was abroad.\u201d</p><p>At precisely two of the clock, Eleanor was ready. In truth, the muslin was so delectable that it was hard to feel miserable while wearing it. It had a cream background, sprigged with tiny cherries. The skirts were puckered around the bottom with cherry-colored gauze; the same gauze was tucked into the bosom, which would have been indecently low without it. The ensemble was completed by a supremely fashionable cabriolet bonnet with gauze ribbons that fluttered behind.</p><p>\u201cYou look quite good,\u201d her mother said grudgingly. And then, rather surprisingly, \u201cYou needn\u2019t feel that Mr. Ormston is your only resort, Eleanor. Your beauty means that you can certainly marry where you wish. Witness the two dukes begging for your hand. I know I have been snappish on the subject, but I have no doubt but that you\u2019ll take at some point.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor brushed her mother\u2019s cheek with a kiss. \u201cThank you, Mama.\u201d</p><p>Anne was standing at the window, most improperly peering through the drapes. \u201cHe\u2019s got a perfectly lovely landau,\u201d she reported. \u201cIt looks to be painted on the sides with cupids, or something like that. I can\u2019t quite see. And he has a footman. Really, Mr. Ormston was not jesting when he said his uncle left him a living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is vastly unseemly of you,\u201d the duchess scolded. \u201cYou look like a housemaid at the window. What do you see of the man himself?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe footman is coming to our door and blocking my view. Oh! Mr. Ormston is wearing a wig \u00e0 Grecque. Very fashionable of him! His coat is black. Quite plain. I don\u2019t see any large buttons.\u201d</p><p>\u201c\u00c0 Grecque?\u201d Eleanor asked, pulling on her gloves.</p><p>\u201cYou know...two curls on each side, and a long tail behind. It\u2019s quite smart.\u201d She turned around, smiling. \u201cHe looks to have broad shoulders as well. I expect you\u2019ll remember him the moment you enter the carriage.\u201d She danced over and gave Eleanor a kiss.</p><p>Eleanor followed Mr. Ormston\u2019s footman to the landau, lecturing herself the whole way about second, nay, third chances.</p><p>Mr. Ormston had descended from the carriage to meet her, of course. She raised her eyes just enough to see that he was wearing a coat of black cloth. Very respectable and sober. He bowed, taking her gloved hand and kissing it before handing her into the landau.</p><p>Eleanor sat down and looked up, prepared to smile.</p><p>Chapter Thirty-two</p><p>London residence of the Duke of Montague</p><p>August 8, 1784</p><p>\u201cI am honored that you accepted my invitation,\u201d Mr. Ormston said quietly. \u201cIt is a true pleasure to meet you again.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor could feel heat rising in her cheeks. \u201cIndeed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou are not the sort of woman whom any man could forget,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd what have you been doing in the intervening three years since we last met?\u201d Eleanor inquired. \u201cUnless it is a matter of great national import that you cannot share with me? A delicate matter, perhaps?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, this and that,\u201d Mr. Ormston said. \u201cI do a great deal of work with orphans.\u201d</p><p>His dark eyebrows were quite dramatic beneath his snowy wig. His shoulders were remarkably broad, but something about his unadorned black coat made them look even broader. \u201cIndeed,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cAnd how are your orphans, Mr. Ormston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite well. We have occasional problems, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t have children,\u201d she said pleasantly. \u201cI know nothing of raising children.\u201d</p><p>He cleared his throat and said, very low, \u201cYou know more than I do.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked down at her hands, clenched together in her lap. \u201cI think I should like to return to my house now.\u201d By some miracle her voice was quite steady.</p><p>\u201cBut we are here, at Kensington Gardens,\u201d Mr. Ormston said. The carriage glided to a halt and he leapt out and stood, holding up his gloved hand.</p> <p>Eleanor sat for a moment. She felt as empty as a vase without flowers or water. She had no emotion, not anger, grief, or even longing. So there could be no harm in taking a brief stroll, she thought.</p><p>She numbly put her hand in his, and dropped it the moment she descended. Then she opened her parasol at such an angle that it entirely shielded her face from that of her companion. \u201cHow lovely,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fuchsias are in bloom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cShall we rest for a moment, Lady Eleanor? There seems to be a suitable bench overlooking the Round Pond. I thought you might like to feed the swans.\u201d</p><p>She glanced to the side. He was holding a cotton bag, presumably filled with bread crusts. That was rather interesting. Mr. Ormston, alias Leopold Dautry, alias the Duke of Villiers, did not appear to be the sort of man whom she imagined carrying bread around.</p><p>They sat down next to each other and in total silence threw crusts at the swans. There were seven of them, counting a mated pair and five cygnets. The parents curled and bobbed their long necks, pushing their offspring out of the way in order to gobble bread.</p> <p>\u201cSo why have you disguised yourself as Mr. Ormston?\u201d she asked after a time.</p><p>\u201cIt is more than a mere disguise. I want to be everything that you wish me to be. If you don\u2019t want a duke, then I don\u2019t want to be a duke.\u201d</p><p>She closed her parasol and took a deep breath before replying. \u201cYou will forgive me if I impute your motives to an entirely commendable paternal instinct rather than a wish to please me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can find a mother for my children anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am quite certain that is true,\u201d she said. She pulled out a large crust and threw it unerringly at the male swan, hitting him in the beak. The cob took no affront and gobbled it up.</p><p>\u201cThat being the case, my motives are purely selfish.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs surprising as it may seem to those who know you\u2014or know of you,\u201d she corrected herself, \u201cI doubt that very much. Your attention to your children\u2019s well-being is commendable. I am sure that you will be successful with the daughter of a marquis. Though one should not discount the distressful possibility that you will have to lower yourself to the level of earl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here because of the children. I have hired an excellent tutor and two more nannies. They are fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarvelous,\u201d Eleanor said tonelessly. \u201cWho would have thought it was so easy to be a parent?\u201d This time she tried to hit the female swan, but missed.</p><p>\u201cWill you look at me before you brain those hapless birds?\u201d</p><p>She drew a deep breath. Of course she would look at him. She raised her eyes reluctantly. Mr. Ormston\u2019s coat did not clamor for attention; neither did his discreet, if fashionable, wig. Instead, those accoutrements framed his face.</p><p>What they really framed were his eyes.</p><p>Without the distraction of his famous hair, the gleaming embroidery of his coats...when she looked at Leopold, she saw his eyes.</p><p>\u201cOh...\u201d she said quietly.</p> <p>\u201cI love you. I will always love you, until the day I die.\u201d His voice was sure and deep, the voice of a man who knew himself. \u201cThe kind of love I feel has nothing to do with the children I have, or children we might have together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d She reached out to take his hand without even realizing what she was doing.</p><p>\u201cI went about things the wrong way. I didn\u2019t know how to recognize a mother, Eleanor. I never really had one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI recognized motherhood in Lisette, because she reminded me of my mother. She liked my brother and me to behave like little dukes, and she dressed us like royalty, almost as if we were dolls. When my brother became ill, she cut him out of her life. And though he didn\u2019t die for eight days, as far as I know, she never faltered in her resolution.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s hand tightened. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe Lisette\u2019s accusation that her mother was the one to bring her son to the Earl of Gryffyn. I would guess that she dispensed with the child herself. Did you realize Gryffyn was the father of her son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy mother told me everything on the journey home,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cLisette and my mother are quite similar. That is not an excuse, but an explanation for why I so foolishly chose the one woman likely to wound my children to the core. And worse, I didn\u2019t see you; I threw away what you offered.\u201d His voice was lashed with self-hatred. \u201cBut I never, ever, thought of you as only good enough to bed, Eleanor. Never. I wanted you\u2014more than I could even let myself know. More than I\u2019ve ever wanted to be with a woman in my life.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor felt the corner of her mouth curl up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014\u201d He broke off, rose and held out his hand. \u201cLady Eleanor, would you care to continue our stroll?\u201d</p><p>She took one more look at those beautiful gray eyes, drank deep of the emotion in them, stood up and opened her parasol again. She tucked her hand through her companion\u2019s arm.</p><p>\u201cDo tell me, Lady Eleanor, why you have stayed in London now that the season is almost over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dislike the artificial boundary created by the season,\u201d she said, tilting her parasol so its pale silk lining cast its shadow over her face. \u201cDuring the season people are all chasing after each other with matrimony on their minds. The grouse season starts in August, but I believe it is truly all the same.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlthough people do not always engage in a matrimonial pursuit,\u201d he added gravely, \u201cbut often in something less respectable. After all, many a wife seeks to avoid her husband. And gentlemen often pursue matrimony out of season.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you would say that when ladies are not hunting down gentlemen, they are engaged in hiding from them? Yes, that sounds reasonable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn occasion the gentleman must, like a hunter, employ subterfuge.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHiding in a blind built from willow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA black coat and wig, or even a distant cousin\u2019s identity. There is a chess exhibition tomorrow in Hyde Park. As I understand it, you are a fine player in your own right. May I escort you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat on earth is a chess exhibition?\u201d Eleanor inquired.</p><p>\u201cA demonstration,\u201d he said. \u201cI gather that a number of England\u2019s best chess players will be pitted against each other for the edification and pleasure of the public.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have heard that the Duke of Villiers is the best player in England,\u201d she said, twirling her parasol. They were almost back at the carriage.</p><p>\u201cNot so. The top two players are the Duke and Duchess of Beaumont.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill they participate in the exhibition?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that the doings of such elevated beings is quite outside the purview of Mr. Ormston.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIn that case,\u201d Eleanor said, \u201cI shall be very pleased to accompany you, Mr. Ormston.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow was it?\u201d Anne demanded the moment Eleanor entered the house. \u201cOh, I can see from your face that it went well! You look happy again!\u201d She pulled her into her arms. \u201cYou see? Men really are quite interchangeable. A woman merely needs to find the one who promises to adore her without being too irritating.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor smiled at her. \u201cHe asked me to accompany him to a chess exhibition tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, better you than me,\u201d Anne said. \u201cHow utterly tedious. You didn\u2019t talk about chess with Mr. Ormston, did you, Eleanor? He won\u2019t like it when he finds out how good you are. Men never like being beaten at games. If you play, you\u2019ll have to fudge it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can do that,\u201d Eleanor said, and disappeared, rather dreamily, up the stairs.</p><p>Mr. Ormston\u2019s landau appeared the next afternoon, promptly at two. \u201cI\u2019m really not sure about this person,\u201d her mother said fretfully. \u201cAnne, if you don\u2019t get away from the window, I shall bar you from this house. You\u2019ll have to ask him to tea, Eleanor. You can\u2019t continue to see this gentleman whom we haven\u2019t met.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you have met him, Mother,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m quite sure I have not!\u201d the duchess retorted.</p><p>\u201cIt was some years ago...but of course one must make allowances for one\u2019s memory as the years pass.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess threw her a glance of total revulsion. \u201cI suppose I met the man. Ormston...it sounds vaguely familiar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI assure you that you did,\u201d Eleanor said, smiling widely.</p><p>Mr. Ormston was waiting by the landau, of course, and handed her up with the utmost courtesy. For a moment Eleanor thought that perhaps he was even courteous to a fault, but then she decided to simply enjoy it.</p><p>Hyde Park was crowded with open carriages and gentlefolk; every person in the ton seemed to be promenading, or waving from a carriage.</p><p>Mr. Ormston didn\u2019t appear to have that many acquaintances\u2014though he did receive a few puzzled glances\u2014but she, of course, saw many friends.</p><p>\u201cThe chess exhibition is on Buck Hill Walk,\u201d he said as his landau came to a halt.</p> <p>Eleanor climbed down, dropping his hand the moment her toes touched the ground, as was proper.</p><p>A few moments later they found themselves watching a chess match between a Russian gentleman and an elegantly-clad young courtier. The courtier looked up and gave a little start. \u201cDashed if I didn\u2019t think for a moment that I recognized you, sir!\u201d he said, laughing.</p><p>Mr. Ormston bowed without speaking, which was a good idea because his voice was altogether too recognizable.</p><p>The Russian gentleman looked up for a moment and then back at the board with a faint smile.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m demned if I haven\u2019t lost to you again, Potemkin,\u201d the courtier said discontentedly.</p><p>\u201cSurely not,\u201d Eleanor said sweetly.</p><p>The young man took a good look at her extremely fetching walking dress, with particular attention to the low bodice, and quite visibly made up his mind to smile. He would have been surprised to learn that the exquisite lady before him considered his gesture condescending.</p><p>He rose and bowed, and even brought her gloved hand to his lips. \u201cAlas, I am already despairing,\u201d he said, giving a charming little shrug.</p> <p>Eleanor leaned forward and said, \u201cQueen to Rook Four, then he\u2019ll move pawn to King\u2019s Rook Three. You take his pawn with your bishop, he will recapture. Then you play Queen takes pawn. His King is laid open and your attack is invulnerable.\u201d</p><p>The man blinked.</p><p>\u201cDear me,\u201d Mr. Ormston said with a glance at the sun, \u201cit\u2019s looking alarmingly cloudy.\u201d</p><p>The courtier sat down.</p><p>\u201cYou are a formidable opponent,\u201d Leopold said as they walked on.</p><p>\u201cHe might still lose,\u201d Eleanor said.</p><p>\u201cIf he misplays the attack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy dear Mr. Ormston,\u201d Eleanor cried. \u201cSurely you jest. The moves are devious. White simply brings his pieces to bear on the denuded King, one by one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI must be distracted,\u201d he said.</p><p>Eleanor threw him a teasing glance. \u201cMy sister gave me firm instructions not to play chess with you, for I may frighten you. Are you afraid, Mr. Ormston?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>They walked a pace or two and then she took his hand. \u201cLeopold?\u201d</p><p>He spun her off the path and behind a thick lilac hedge so quickly that she didn\u2019t breathe. \u201cI\u2019m afraid, Eleanor. I\u2019m afraid that you don\u2019t love me as much as I love you. I\u2019m afraid that you won\u2019t believe me, that you\u2019ll think I want you merely for the benefit of my children. And oh God, Eleanor, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t live without you.\u201d</p><p>She reached out and slowly, very slowly, undid the pearl buttons on his very proper right glove. Then she peeled back the heavy gray silk\u2014far too fine, really, for a plain Mr. Ormston\u2014and gently pulled it off his hand.</p><p>She raised his hand, still without meeting his eyes, and kissed each finger. They trembled slightly in hers. She turned over his hand and pressed her lips to his palm. Only then did she meet his eyes. \u201cI am not afraid, because I love you. And I will always love you. Always. Your love stands between me and fear.\u201d</p><p>His face transformed itself\u2014without a smile, of course. Then before she realized what was happening, he went down on one knee.</p><p>\u201cLeopold\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you do me the inexpressible honor, Lady Eleanor, of becoming my wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh yes, I will, I will.\u201d</p><p>Then he was on his feet again and holding her tightly, and kissing her with that sort of passionate force that made Leopold...Leopold.</p><p>\u201cI have a ring in honor of our betrothal,\u201d he said some time later.</p><p>Eleanor was nestled against his chest, his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cYou may not feel it is fit for a duchess,\u201d he said, just a touch of doubt in his voice.</p><p>She opened her eyes to find that he had pulled the glove from her left hand and was sliding a ring over her finger. It was made of pale gold, shaped into the petals of a lily, with a beautiful diamond in the center. It was neither ostentatious nor lavishly ornamental. It was the kind of ring that delicately heralded true love. It was elegant; it was subtle. It was everything the Duke of Villiers wasn\u2019t, and Mr. Ormston was.</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. She put her arms around his neck. \u201cOh, Leo,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s absolutely perfect.\u201d</p><p>Had she ever thought his eyes were cold? \u201cI could get you a marquise-cut diamond as big as\u2014as a mouse,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you would prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo I could impress everyone with my glittering rodent?\u201d She managed to smile even though tears were slipping down her cheeks. \u201cThis is utterly perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMay I speak to your father?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help laughing a little. \u201cHe returns on the Saint Esprit, due to dock tomorrow, if it\u2019s on course.\u201d</p><p>He wiped away her tears and replaced her glove. Then they stepped out from behind the hedge and decorously made their way back to the carriage.</p><p>When Eleanor walked through her front door, she almost felt as if the past hour had not happened. Her hair was unmussed. Apparently Mr. Ormston did not believe in twisting his hands into a lady\u2019s coiffure when he kissed her. He had kissed her...but only on the lips. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Anne looked up. \u201cWhy\u2014Why\u2014\u201d</p><p>Eleanor smiled and took off her glove.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019ve seen him only twice!\u201d Anne shrieked. \u201cOh, what an utterly darling ring!\u201d She froze. \u201cEleanor, I\u2019ve seen this ring.\u201d Her voice was hushed. \u201cYour Mr. Ormston is\u2014is quite extravagant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Eleanor said, looking lovingly down at the ring. \u201cI have certainly seen bigger diamonds.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt has been on display at Stedman and Vardan, the jewelers on New Bond Street for over a month\u2014because it belonged to Queen Elizabeth, until she threw it to Sir Walter Raleigh after a jousting tournament. The diamond in the middle is one of the finest examples of a European cut that Mr. Stedman has ever seen...\u201d Her eyes grew round. \u201cEleanor, what sort of fortune could Mr. Ormston have inherited?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t stop laughing. It was so like her own, darling Leopold. He had found the one ring in England that would suit both of them. \u201cWould you say that this ring cost more than a marquise-cut diamond?\u201d she asked Anne.</p><p>\u201cWhy...why this ring probably cost more than ten such rings, Eleanor! He must love you so much.\u201d She peered at the ring, awed. \u201cHe must have thought of nothing but you for the last three years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Eleanor said, beaming. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Thirty-three</p> <p>London residence of the Duke of Montague</p><p>September 14, 1784</p><p>\u201cYour Grace,\u201d the Duchess of Montague said, bestowing a measured smile on the man who, in a matter of two days, would become her son-in-law. \u201cI suppose you would like to see Eleanor. She is in the morning room, and I shall allow you to go there on your own.\u201d</p><p>The duchess\u2019s visitors, Lady Festle and Mrs. Quinkhardt, smiled at the duke and then sighed at the look in his eye.</p><p>He was almost out the door when the duchess called after him. \u201cMy daughter tells me that you plan to bring her yet another betrothal gift.\u201d</p><p>The Duke of Villiers bowed, with a great deal of address. \u201cI did promise. And I have it with me this morning, Your Grace.\u201d</p> <p>The duchess must be forgiven if her smile was a trifle gloating. For, as she explained to her bosom companions, the Duke of Villiers was courting her daughter in a manner that was truly above reproach. \u201cHe never engages in the slightest indiscretion,\u201d she told them. \u201cThey say there\u2019s nothing as prudish as a reformed rake, and though I wouldn\u2019t have believed it myself, I believe it now! He doesn\u2019t even dance with her more than twice or at most three times.\u201d She lowered her voice. \u201cOne can sense if a young couple engages in inappropriate behavior, and I can assure you...they never do!\u201d</p><p>All of London was discussing the ring, naturally, and the duchess\u2019s chest swelled with pride as she confirmed to Lady Festle that her dearest daughter Eleanor was indeed wearing a diamond ring that had previously been worn by Queen Elizabeth. \u201cI am most curious about that betrothal gift,\u201d she told them. \u201cI\u2019ll give them ten minutes...more than enough. Perhaps there is a diadem to match the ring!\u201d</p><p>Eleanor looked up from a note she was writing to Lisette, commiserating over the fact the orphanage was being moved to Hampshire, when Villiers entered the room and closed the door behind him.</p><p>Since their betrothal, he had settled on a style somewhere between himself and Mr. Ormston. \u201cYou needn\u2019t,\u201d she had said, laughing, when he first appeared without a wig\u2014but still clad in subdued black velvet. Magnificent black velvet, but without even a touch of embroidery, and certainly no gold buttons.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t do it for you,\u201d he had said, imperturbable as ever. \u201cIt\u2019s the children. They are so wildly disrespectful when I appear in full court dress that I have adopted the path of least resistance.\u201d</p><p>Now he walked forward with that little secret smile of his.</p><p>\u201cLeopold,\u201d she said, dancing into his arms and then, because he was so very well-behaved, pulling his head down and demanding a kiss. One of his kisses. One of those that sent them both into a spin of heat and pleasure and desire.</p><p>\u201cI have brought you a betrothal present,\u201d he said, catching his breath and starting to unbutton his very proper coat.</p> <p>\u201cYou mustn\u2019t! My\u2014\u201d But her voice broke off.</p><p>For Leopold had pulled back his coat and there...there...</p><p>Eleanor reached out her hands. \u201cHow beautiful!\u201d</p><p>With the kind of smile that she never saw on his face\u2014let alone in his eyes\u2014before their betrothal, he pulled a very small, sleeping puppy from his inside pocket. It was a pug...probably. It didn\u2019t even open its eyes, just gave a little sleeping snore.</p><p>Eleanor took the puppy in her arms, whispering so she didn\u2019t wake it. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything so wonderful! Look at its little round tummy.\u201d She lifted the tiny dog up to her cheek. \u201cIts fur feels like black velvet. And it smells just like milky puppy...Oh Leopold, you couldn\u2019t have given me a present that I would love more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer name is Lettuce,\u201d her betrothed observed. \u201cA number of different names were bandied about, but Lucinda\u2019s choice won. Of course you may prefer a more elegant name.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLettuce,\u201d Eleanor breathed. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou see, Lucinda said that her little ears are as soft as pieces of lettuce,\u201d Leopold said, holding up the tiniest scrap of velvet Eleanor had ever seen.</p><p>\u201cOne can hardly call that an ear,\u201d she said, giggling. \u201cShe\u2019s such a darling.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid her nap will give you a false impression of that puppy,\u201d Leo said, curling his hand around Eleanor\u2019s cheek. Lettuce yawned, showing needle-sharp little teeth, and opened her eyes. \u201cMy personal name of choice was Cassandra.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCassandra?\u201d Eleanor held a suddenly wiggling bundle of fur up to her face so she could look into Lettuce\u2019s bright eyes. \u201cWhy such a long name for a tiny dog? You don\u2019t have bad news to tell us, do you, Lettuce?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYap!\u201d Lettuce said, struggling to lick Eleanor\u2019s chin. \u201cYap, yap, yap, yap, yap!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cYou do have a lot to say.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYap!\u201d Lettuce repeated.</p><p>Many times.</p><p>Eleanor put her down and discovered that Lettuce had mastered the art of running in circles and barking at the same time, something Oyster never managed. \u201cShe\u2019s so intelligent,\u201d she said, turning in Leo\u2019s arms so she could see his face.</p><p>\u201cShe certainly is expressive,\u201d Leo murmured, looking down at her. She knew the expression burning in his eyes. And if she hadn\u2019t known what it meant, she could feel it thrumming throughout her body. \u201cI can\u2019t last another two days,\u201d he said conversationally. \u201cThese have been the longest weeks of my life.\u201d</p><p>Eleanor put a kiss on his chin and another on the very edge of his mouth. \u201cYou want to make love to me in my mother\u2019s sitting room?\u201d</p><p>He groaned.</p><p>He really had been very, very good.</p><p>\u201cNow that I have a new puppy, I shall have to take her for walks in the back gardens, even during the night,\u201d she informed him. \u201cThank goodness, the nights are so unseasonably warm.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Leopold froze.</p><p>\u201cI shall walk her at two o\u2019clock in the morning. All the way out to the little summerhouse at the end of the gardens...and back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh,\u201d he said, and for just one moment pulled her hard against his body. Then he backed up and bowed. When her mother entered, he was kissing the very tips of her fingers.</p><p>\u201cWhy, Duke,\u201d the duchess called gaily. \u201cMay I see your betrothal gift? I confess I am all agog.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCertainly, Duchess,\u201d he said, bowing to her as well. \u201cHere it is.\u201d</p><p>Truly, his manners are beyond reproach, the duchess thought happily\u2014until she turned her eyes in the direction of the duke\u2019s pointing finger.</p><p>At the little dog, squatting on the Aubusson rug.</p><p>It was fortunate for the duchess\u2019s heart that she didn\u2019t happen to glance out of her bedchamber window in the middle of the night. If she had added to the horror of seeing her beloved rug serving, once again, as an impromptu chamber pot, the anguish of seeing her eldest daughter dash stark naked out of the summerhouse, chased by her oh-so-proper fianc\u00e9 (in a similar state of undress), well...it might have been too much for her.</p><p>But as it was, the household slumbered peacefully, while the two happiest people in it danced in the rain until Leo managed to catch his wife-to-be and hold her still long enough to kiss her...and kiss her...and kiss her again.</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>Seven years later</p><p>It was the Duchess of Villiers\u2019s birthday.</p><p>When Eleanor was growing up, her mother had, by all indications, no birthday. When one makes the decision not to age, birthdays are a necessary sacrifice. When Leopold was growing up, for all he knew his mother might well have celebrated all night long, but she had certainly never invited her children to participate.</p><p>Eleanor\u2019s thirtieth birthday was of a different sort. The South Parlor of the Duke of Villiers\u2019s country house in Essex\u2014as opposed to his houses in Norfolk, Wiltshire, and Devon, not to mention Castle Cary, which had presumably tumbled into an elegant heap\u2014was exploding with excitement. Tobias was in one corner, doing last minute work on the parts for their game of charades, an annual tradition since 1785.</p><p>A knot of dogs was frolicking in another corner. A naughty puppy named Muffin was being watched over by his mother. \u201cYap!\u201d she warned him as he tugged on the curtains. \u201cYap, Yap!\u201d Muffin shook his head back and forth, pretending he couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cWoof,\u201d his father added, waking up, and Muffin let go of the curtain altogether. His father went back to sleep while his mother launched into a loving, high-pitched diatribe that covered everything from curtains to grooming. Not that Muffin paid much attention.</p> <p>In a third corner, the duchess was sitting on a snug sofa, nursing a baby. In her delightfully full, chaotic, and joyful seven years of marriage, no babies had joined the household until Theodore came along.</p><p>Which explained why Phoebe (who used to be called Phyllinda) and Lucinda (who liked her name just fine) were sitting closely on either side of their mother. Not that the girls had generally been far from their mother\u2019s vicinity in the last year. At age twelve, they could sense the slight chill wind that signaled the end of childhood. This last month in particular they had hardly stirred from Eleanor\u2019s side, so fascinated by gummy smiles and plump toes that the twins, who never fought, found themselves squabbling over the privilege of holding their brother.</p><p>\u201cMay I hold Theodore now?\u201d Lucinda asked. \u201cPlease? It looks like he\u2019s finally done eating. I never thought anyone could drink milk for so long! I don\u2019t even like milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different for babies,\u201d Eleanor said, lifting roly-poly Theo over her shoulder. He let out a satisfied burp.</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s my turn,\u201d Phoebe said, intervening in her quiet way.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s my turn,\u201d her father said, scooping the baby off his wife\u2019s shoulder and swinging him into the air.</p><p>Theodore burst into a storm of giggles. He was adorable in the way that deeply loved babies are: bald, fat, and altogether scrumptious.</p><p>\u201cYou girls need to start planning for charades,\u201d the duke said, looking down at his daughters. \u201cTobias has finished writing all of the parts and he\u2019s handing them out.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLast year he made me be Lucifer, from Paradise Lost,\u201d Lucinda said resentfully.</p><p>\u201cYour fault,\u201d Phoebe said, laughing. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have played that trick on him when he came home from Oxford for the summer. You know he\u2019s particular about his clothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just wish he\u2019d let me pick out parts some time,\u201d Lucinda said. \u201cI\u2019d make him play an old beggar woman. Or Puss in Boots! He would have to put on paper ears and a tail, or he would never win. Can you imagine? Tobias would rather die than be so undignified!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on,\u201d Phoebe said, grabbing her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go, because if we get a wish from Mama for winning, we can say that we want Theo all tomorrow afternoon.\u201d</p><p>Lucinda\u2019s eyes brightened and they trotted off.</p><p>The duke slipped into the place next to his wife, holding Theo\u2019s hands so the bowlegged babe could practice sitting upright in his lap.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the best birthday present you ever gave me,\u201d Eleanor said, leaning her head against his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s true that he\u2019s three months old,\u201d Leopold said, grinning at Theodore. \u201cBut I think of him more as your present to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh no,\u201d Eleanor said. \u201cI have very, very clear memories of my birthday last year. And naturally, I expect that you plan to top your performance. Practice,\u201d she said demurely, \u201cmakes perfect.\u201d</p><p>Her husband shot her a wicked glance, full of laughter\u2014and desire. \u201cAfter the charades or before?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBefore,\u201d she whispered, leaning over and brushing a kiss on his jaw.</p><p>\u201cTobias!\u201d Leo shouted, leaping to his feet.</p><p>His eldest son, a sleek, brilliant version of himself, strolled over.</p><p>\u201cTake this scrap,\u201d Leo said, dumping Theo unceremoniously into Tobias\u2019s arms. \u201cWhatever you do, don\u2019t let Phoebe and Lucinda start fighting over him.\u201d</p><p>Theodore reached up and grabbed at his big brother\u2019s chin, giving him his best toothless smile.</p><p>\u201cDid he burp?\u201d Tobias asked sternly. He had quickly learned that sartorial standards can be severely threatened by leaky babies.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Eleanor said, taking her husband\u2019s hand. \u201cThank you, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe charades begin in one hour,\u201d Tobias said, not letting on with even the tiniest smile that he might have some idea what his beautiful stepmother and adoring father meant to do in the interim.</p><p>\u201cWe should be fine with that,\u201d Leo said, grinning down at Eleanor. Unlike his son, he\u2019d lost his ability to appear emotionless.</p><p>But he did wait until he was out of the parlor to pick up the duchess in his arms and carry her up the stairs. </p> </body></html>"]
