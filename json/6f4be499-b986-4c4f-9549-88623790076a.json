He started down the winding driveway to collect the mail, his face numb from the biting wind.</p><p>Winter had set in, and already he was restless. The lodge was quiet, housing just him and his two brothers until next hunting season when clients filled the bunkhouses. For ten years, he had lived for the fall when he could guide hunters into the mountains. But now he felt edgy. Unsatisfied.</p><p>He yanked open the mailbox and reached inside for the pile of envelopes. He turned back to the house, thumbing through the junk mail when a flash of color caught his eyes. He blinked, bringing the object into focus. There, huddled in the ditch, half covered with snow, was a person.</p> <p>Dropping the mail, he rushed over to the still form and knelt in the snow. Afraid of what he would find, he grasped a small shoulder and flipped the person over. To his shock, it was a woman. A beautiful woman.</p><p>He felt for a pulse, holding his breath until he felt the faint tremor in her neck. He brushed snow from her face and smoothed her blonde hair from her forehead. How had she gotten here?</p><p>Swinging her slight form into his arms, he stood up and strode rapidly back up the drive. He stared worriedly into her pale face and felt his groin tighten. A sharp tingle snaked up his spine, and he was besieged by unfamiliar emotions. Anger, possessiveness, concern, and pure unadulterated lust.</p><p>His cock swelled in his jeans, and his grip around her tightened. He was assailed by the nagging thought that she could be the one. He\u2019d never reacted this strongly to a woman, and certainly not to one he knew nothing about, but he also knew no matter his reaction, his brothers might not be in agreement.</p><p>At any rate, he couldn\u2019t leave her to freeze to death. He couldn\u2019t concern himself with what his brothers thought until he made sure she didn\u2019t die on him.</p> <p>As he shouldered his way inside, Ethan looked up from the couch where he was reading. He dropped the book when he saw the woman in Adam\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d he demanded, standing up.</p><p>\u201cI found her out in the ditch,\u201d Adam murmured, examining his brother closely for his reaction.</p><p>Ethan closed the distance between them and gazed down at the fragile looking woman. \u201cIs she alive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ryan asked as he entered the living room. His expression was guarded, a look that had become second nature since his discharge from the military. For the first time in a long while, Adam felt a surge of hope. He\u2019d give anything to be able to draw Ryan out from the private hell he endured. If she was the one...</p><p>Adam turned his attention back to the woman in his arms. \u201cI need to get her warmed up. Go draw a hot bath while I get her out of her wet clothes,\u201d he directed Ryan.</p> <p>Ethan raised a brow. \u201cYou going to strip her in here?\u201d</p><p>Adam shrugged. \u201cI doubt modesty is an issue when you\u2019re this close to freezing to death.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s eyes darkened, and he moved closer to the woman. He studied her then reached out his hand to touch her cheek. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful,\u201d he said huskily.</p><p>When he looked back up at Adam, his eyes shone with a multitude of emotions. Desire, tenderness and possessiveness. Adam felt a surge of triumph. Ethan felt it too.</p><p>\u201cAm I missing something here?\u201d Ryan asked as he returned to the living room.</p><p>\u201cIs the water drawn?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Ryan nodded and Adam strode past him. \u201cEthan will explain,\u201d he said briskly.</p><p>Adam walked into his bedroom and gently laid her on his bed. She didn\u2019t even have a coat on. He frowned as he began to peel her wet sweater off. She was soaked through.</p> <p>As he pulled the sweater over her head, he sucked in his breath. The skimpy bra she wore didn\u2019t do much to cover her breasts. The second thing he noticed was a large bruise that marred her porcelain skin. It covered an area the size of his hand. And he had large hands.</p><p>Had she been in some kind of accident? Is that why she was lying in the ditch?</p><p>He set to work pulling the damp jeans from her legs. As he rolled the material down her legs, his eyes were drawn to the dark curls clearly outlined against her underwear. So, she wasn\u2019t a natural blonde.</p><p>Suffering only a tiny moment of guilt, he peeled the scrap of silk down her legs, then unhooked her bra, leaving her completely naked beneath his gaze. He didn\u2019t think it possible that he could get any harder.</p><p>Every nerve ending in his body was on full alert. All it would take was one touch and he\u2019d explode.</p><p>He cursed vehemently and worked to keep his raging hormones in balance. She was unconscious and injured, and all he could think about was plunging his cock so deep within her that he\u2019d become a permanent part of her.</p><p>With shaking hands, he examined her limbs for any sign of a break. Her skin was cold, but she showed no sign of frostbite. The bath shouldn\u2019t do her any harm.</p><p>With great care, he picked her naked body up and walked out of the bedroom and into the huge bathroom he shared with his brothers. It was the size of a bedroom, with two showers and a huge Jacuzzi tub. The counter that lined one side of the wall had four sinks. A testament to their knowledge that one day one woman would share their lives.</p><p>The tub was full, and he leaned over to ease her into the warm water. She let out a small moan but didn\u2019t open her eyes. He held her so she wouldn\u2019t slip down further.</p><p>He turned when he heard the door open. Ryan stood there, his eyes hooded.</p><p>\u201cEthan says she\u2019s the one.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded, not knowing what else to say. He knew Ryan would have to make up his own mind.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s gaze swept over the woman but he didn\u2019t move forward. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re through. I wouldn\u2019t want her to awaken with both of us here. It might scare her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t be long,\u201d Adam said, trying to interpret the shadows in Ryan\u2019s eyes. \u201cDo me a favor and put her clothes in the dryer.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged and backed from the bathroom, closing the door quietly behind him.</p><p>Adam returned his attention to his charge just in time to see her eyes flutter open. Soft brown eyes stared at him in shock and confusion. Then fear.</p><p>The first thing Holly became aware of was delicious warmth. After being cold for so long, she was certain she\u2019d died and gone to heaven. Or maybe it was hell judging by the temperature.</p><p>Then she opened her eyes and quickly decided it had to be heaven because the devil couldn\u2019t possibly look as good as the man bending over her.</p><p>After staring at him for a moment, she realized she was naked. In a tub. With a gorgeous stranger looking at her, completely unabashed by her nudity. Maybe instead of drooling she ought to be afraid.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d the man said in a soothing tone as he backed a few inches away from the tub. \u201cI found you in the snow.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest and drew up her knees, trying to cover as much of her body as possible. \u201cWhere am I?\u201d she asked, hating how shaky her voice sounded.</p><p>\u201cThree Brothers Hunting Lodge,\u201d he replied. \u201cAre you hurting anywhere?\u201d</p><p>She clutched her chest tighter and shook her head. \u201cWhere are my clothes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the dryer. I\u2019ll give you a shirt to put on until they finish.\u201d</p><p>Despite the warmth of the water, chill bumps raced over her body, her nipples tightening against her arms. The man was positively sinful. His dark hair was cut short, and he had shoulders that would barely fit through a doorway. He was built bigger than a linebacker.</p><p>He stood, giving her a good look at his long legs encased in tight jeans. She nearly groaned aloud when she saw scuffed cowboy boots sticking out from under his pant legs. She\u2019d always been a sucker for a man in cowboy boots.</p><p>She gasped as he bent over and plucked her from the water. Before she could protest, he wrapped a huge towel around her and strode from the bathroom. She stifled her reprimand as he deposited her on a king-size bed. She gathered the ends of the towel and held them tightly around her.</p><p>He turned his back to her momentarily and disappeared into the closet. Seconds later, he returned with a flannel shirt and a pair of sweats.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re much too big for you, but they\u2019ll do until your clothes are dry.\u201d</p><p>He held them out to her, his gaze caressing her face. She should be afraid. She was in a strange man\u2019s house. Naked as the day she was born. And yet she didn\u2019t feel threatened by him.</p><p>She almost laughed at the absurdity. Most men terrified her. And with good reason. So why wasn\u2019t she screaming the house down? Why was she laying there staring at him like she\u2019d love nothing more than to strip him down to those cowboy boots? She should be making a mad dash out the door.</p><p>Instead, she curled her fingers around the shirt he offered, flushing madly when his hand touched hers briefly. Fire lit his eyes and burned a trail down her flesh as his gaze raked up and down her body.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to dress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re done, come on out to the living room and warm up by the fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cT-thank you,\u201d she stammered.</p><p>As soon as he left the room, she scrambled up, shedding the towel and yanking on the shirt. It hung to her knees, the sleeves dwarfing her arms. She rolled up each one so her hands were free.</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed and pulled on the sweats. When she stood, they fell to her ankles. Hiking them back up, she pulled at the drawstring, trying to make the monstrous pants stay up. They promptly fell back down, and she growled in irritation.</p><p>Well, he\u2019d seen her in a lot less. At least the shirt covered most of her. Hopefully her clothing would be dry soon.</p><p>She snuck a glance in the mirror over the dresser and winced at her appearance. Her hair was a mess, and the dye job was awful. It certainly hadn\u2019t achieved the desired effect of altering her appearance.</p><p>Straightening her shirt, she pulled it as far down her legs as she could and hesitantly walked out of the bedroom door. She moved down the hallway, looking left and right. At the end, she stopped and stared in embarrassment into the living room.</p><p>Three men, not just one, stared at back at her. Three gorgeous, hulking men. And here she stood in nothing more than a shirt. She started to retreat, but the man who had bathed her crossed the room and caught her elbow.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m Adam, by the way.\u201d He led her further into the living room despite her reluctance. \u201cThese two are my brothers, Ryan and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>She eyed them nervously and hung back, hoping Adam\u2019s body would shield her from view. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything about brothers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you the name of the ranch,\u201d he said in amusement.</p><p>He reached behind him and squeezed her hand in his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, baby. No one\u2019s going to hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She shivered. Not from fear, but from the sex appeal in his voice. How could a complete stranger make her feel so safe? She licked her lips. \u201cI\u2019m Holly,\u201d she said in just above a whisper.</p><p>One of the two brothers rose from the couch and walked over to her, reaching behind Adam and gently pulling her forward. \u201cCome over by the fire and get warm.\u201d His husky voice filtered over her like fine chocolate.</p><p>Oh Lord, she must be dreaming. \u201cWhich one are you?\u201d she asked, hesitating for a moment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Ethan.\u201d He smiled broadly at her. He tugged slightly on her hand, and she allowed him to lead her closer to the fire.</p><p>Ethan was as large as Adam. The only difference between them was their eyes. Both had dark hair. Almost black. But Adam had green eyes and Ethan\u2019s were a warm brown, while Ryan sported dark blue eyes. Ryan was slightly smaller in build than his brothers and his hair was a lighter brown, but where his brothers\u2019 hair was short, Ryan\u2019s hung below his ears, just brushing the tops of his shoulders. He had a wild, haunted look, the kind of man a woman instinctively wanted to try to tame. He looked to be the youngest, but Holly wasn\u2019t certain. They were all pretty close in age, though Adam had to be the oldest.</p><p>Ethan coaxed her into an armchair next to the fire, and she drew her legs underneath her. She stretched her hands to the fire, letting the warmth seep into her body.</p><p>She was nervous as a cat in a dog kennel. All of them were staring at her. She could feel them. Had they all seen her naked? Was that why they were looking at her with such intensity?</p><p>Adam walked over to stand by the fire. \u201cWhat happened to you, Holly? Why were you lying in the ditch? You weren\u2019t even dressed for the weather.\u201d</p><p>She tensed, unsure of how to answer. Her mind raced to come up with a plausible excuse. \u201cMy car broke down further down the mountain. I got out to find help. I must have fallen. I don\u2019t really remember.\u201d</p><p>Most of it was the truth. Actually, all of it was, but she wasn\u2019t going to go into any more detail than she had to.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d Ryan spoke up for the first time. He looked closely at her as if trying to peel her secrets right out of her head. He was quieter than the other two and more serious looking by far. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Really.\u201d She looked up at Adam. \u201cWill my clothes be dry soon? I should be going.\u201d</p><p>Ryan surged to his feet. Ethan tensed, and Adam\u2019s expression darkened.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think you should be going anywhere in this weather,\u201d Adam said firmly.</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t stay here until you\u2019re feeling better. Ryan and I will go look for your car and tow it here if we need to.\u201d</p> <p>Uncertainty made her hesitate. Logically, she should get the hell out while the getting was good, but she felt safe here, and she was tired of running.</p><p>She looked down at her hands and tried to control the shaking. She was so damn tired, and she couldn\u2019t remember the last time she\u2019d eaten.</p><p>Adam knelt beside the chair and cupped her chin in his large hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anywhere, baby. You can stay right here. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><p>If she\u2019d thought she couldn\u2019t become more aroused, she\u2019d been dead wrong. Though he voiced the offer in gentle tones, she didn\u2019t miss the command. He wanted her to stay.</p><p>\u201cI...I don\u2019t know.\u201d She closed her eyes, a wave of dizziness swamping her. She struggled to open them again, but the room swirled around her. Then it went dark.</p> <p>Chapter Two</p><p>With a muffled curse, Adam caught Holly\u2019s head as it fell forward. He quickly pulled her from the chair and cradled her in his arms. She was clearly exhausted and probably hungry to boot if her thinness was any indication.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put her in my room,\u201d he said as he walked toward the hall.</p><p>\u201cRyan and I\u2019ll go look for her car,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Adam placed her on the bed and pulled back the covers. She moaned softly, an expression of pain crossing her face, but she didn\u2019t open her eyes.</p><p>A pulse beat in his temple and he gritted his teeth. She was running from something. Or someone. She was skittish as a newborn colt, and she had so many secrets in her eyes it was hard to tell the color at times.</p> <p>The bruise on her ribs bothered him. It could be from a fall, but he doubted it. It didn\u2019t look recent. He fingered a strand of her hair, noticing the unevenness of the color. He\u2019d bet money she was a brunette. The same color as the curls between her legs.</p><p>With tenderness he hadn\u2019t displayed in a long time, he tucked the covers around her neck and walked quietly out. He needed a cold shower to calm his raging hard-on, but he opted to walk out into the cold and wait for Ethan and Ryan to return.</p><p>A half hour later, they drove up in the Land Rover. Adam walked to meet them. \u201cWhat did you find?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing,\u201d Ethan replied.</p><p>Adam raised a brow. So the angel had lied. Was she not thinking clearly or had she honestly not thought they would find out?</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cSleeping,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cShe needs to eat.\u201d</p><p>Ethan looked troubled. A feeling Adam could relate to. That they had found their woman was nothing short of amazing. But it appeared she came with trouble.</p> <p>Ryan shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI never thought we\u2019d find her. And now that we have, all I can think about is what if she doesn\u2019t want to stay? I felt it too. I know she\u2019s the one. Pop always said we\u2019d know, but I thought it was bullshit until now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ethan said quietly. \u201cI felt it too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s hiding something,\u201d Adam said. \u201cShe has a bruise the size of my fist on her ribcage, and I don\u2019t like to imagine how it got there. And she\u2019s not a natural blonde. She did a poor job dying it. A sign she was probably in a hurry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think someone\u2019s after her?\u201d Ethan demanded, his face darkening.</p><p>Ryan clenched his fists. \u201cWho could want to hurt such a little thing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but one thing\u2019s for damn certain. We can\u2019t let her leave no matter what we have to do,\u201d Adam said grimly.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s going to approach her first?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>Adam paused. \u201cI will,\u201d he finally said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way it\u2019s done. It\u2019s my responsibility. You two will help by making her feel as comfortable as possible. We\u2019re going to have to ease into this or I\u2019m afraid she might bolt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo easy with her, Adam,\u201d Ethan warned.</p><p>Adam glared at him. \u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Ethan didn\u2019t back down. \u201cYou know exactly what I mean. You dominate. It\u2019s your nature. You\u2019re going to have to curb that with her. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to offer her trust on a silver platter.\u201d</p><p>Though Ethan\u2019s words irritated him, Adam knew he was right. He was the authority figure in his personal and professional life, and he was used to getting his way. In his mind, Holly was theirs whether she accepted it right now or not.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cNow if we\u2019re done here, I\u2019m going to go check on her. Why don\u2019t you and Ryan see about supper?\u201d</p><p>Adam slipped back inside the bedroom to see Holly still sleeping soundly. After kicking off his boots, he pulled the covers back and gingerly settled down beside her. To his surprise, she let out a sigh of satisfaction and snuggled against him.</p><p>Her breasts rubbed erotically against his chest, and his cock swelled against her thighs. As she moved against him, her shirt rode up over her hips, exposing her luscious ass. Unable to help it, he smoothed his hand over her naked hip, pulling the shirt higher to her waist.</p><p>Her dark curls beckoned him, and he slipped his fingers to the soft folds of her pussy. She moaned as he dipped one finger to her clit and began a slow circular motion. She was hot and wet, and he was ready to burst from just touching her.</p><p>Using his fingers, he separated her pussy lips further and slipped his thumb down over her button. His middle finger drifted downward, teasing her entrance as his thumb continued stroking her.</p><p>Her breathing picked up, and she moved restlessly against him. He plunged his finger into her, closing his eyes and imagining it was his dick. She was tight. So damn tight.</p><p>He bent his head and nuzzled his lips inside the collar of her shirt until he found one taut nipple. When he latched onto it, she cried out. He worked his thumb faster as he sucked at her breast. Then she tightened beneath him and clamped her legs shut against his hand as she wailed her release.</p><p>He captured her cry in his mouth as he fastened his lips over hers. Slowly, he pulled his hand from her quivering pussy. He could smell her musky scent on his hand, and he ached to taste her. Ached to bury his head between her legs and love her like she\u2019d never been loved.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open, drowsy, drugged looking, her lips swollen from his kisses.</p><p>\u201cTell me I\u2019m not dreaming,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not dreaming.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened, and she let out a startled shriek. She scooted away from him yanking the covers over her body. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d she demanded, her voice still husky with passion.</p><p>He watched the confusion register in her eyes as she fought against her enjoyment of what happened and her natural instinct to fight it.</p><p>\u201cI made you come,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>\u201cI\u2014you...\u201d She trailed off, her mouth opening and closing in rapid succession.</p><p>He put his hand behind her neck and pulled her to him. \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering,\u201d he said as he kissed her long and hard, \u201cI plan to do it again. Soon.\u201d</p><p>She jerked away and gaped at him. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want me,\u201d he said matter-of-factly. \u201cAnd I want you more than I\u2019ve ever wanted another woman. I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Holly stared at him in shock. Her heart was beating double time. Not only had she experienced the most mind-blowing orgasm of her life\u2014okay, the only orgasm of her life, and if this was normal, she had no idea how a woman survived it\u2014but his declaration cut straight to her heart.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe him. It was her naivet\u00e9 that had gotten her in this situation to begin with. Her yearning to be loved and cherished. The mere thought of how stupid she\u2019d been made her want to puke.</p><p>His expression softened. \u201cWho hurt you, baby? Who put that fear in your eyes?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed nervously. This guy was too perceptive by far. How on earth could she be lying almost naked next to a guy she hadn\u2019t known for more than a day? She closed her eyes. This wasn\u2019t happening. It was all a dream. A wonderful dream, mind you, but a dream all the same. Any minute now, she\u2019d wake up and be back in the horror that was her life.</p><p>\u201cLet me go get your clothes for you,\u201d Adam said, throwing his legs over the side of the bed. \u201cYou need to eat something.\u201d</p><p>A few seconds later, he returned with her jeans and sweater. He dangled her underwear on the end of his finger and she hastily snatched them away from him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the kitchen. Come on out when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>When he\u2019d left, she scrambled out of bed and quickly pulled on her underwear. Her pussy still throbbed from the explosive orgasm. Her fingers lingered near her crotch, and she slipped her hand underneath the silk of her panties.</p><p>She flinched when her finger made contact with her swollen clit. God, the man was lethal. Reluctantly, she pulled her hand away and reached for her jeans.</p><p>When she was dressed, she walked to the door and stood hesitantly with her hand on the knob. How could she face him after what happened? Her cheeks burned with embarrassment. He was going to think she was a complete slut.</p><p>Drawing in a deep breath, she opened the door and slipped down the hall toward the kitchen. The smells emanating from the stove made her mouth water. It had been too long since her last good meal.</p><p>The three brothers looked up as she slid onto a barstool. She looked down self-consciously, hoping Adam hadn\u2019t seen fit to fill his brothers in on what happened.</p><p>Ryan moved closer and rubbed a hand over her shoulder. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>She shivered, horrified by her reaction to him. Surely she was still on edge from the orgasm she\u2019d experienced just minutes ago. She was losing her mind. Slut didn\u2019t even begin to describe her. She was lusting after three men.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she mumbled, flinching away from his touch.</p><p>Ethan put a plate in front of her. \u201cI\u2019ll dish it up in just a sec. You hungry?\u201d</p><p>Her stomach growled in response. \u201cStarving,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>\u201cHow long\u2019s it been since you ate?\u201d Adam asked, his expression pensive.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t remember,\u201d she said vaguely.</p><p>He exchanged glances with his two brothers, and she hoped she hadn\u2019t raised their suspicions even more. She needed to disappear as quickly as possible before anyone figured out where she was. Or who she was.</p><p>A few minutes later, Ethan heaped bacon, eggs and a slab of ham on her plate. Her hands shook slightly as she cut into the food with her fork.</p><p>Adam stood back, his arms crossed over his chest. He watched while she shoveled food into her mouth as quickly as she could. \u201cSlow down, baby. You\u2019re going to make yourself sick.\u201d</p><p>She flushed and set her fork down on the plate. Ethan plunked down a glass of orange juice next to her, and she smiled slightly at him before drinking down half the contents.</p><p>A loud knock sounded on the door, and Adam frowned. \u201cWho the hell could that be?\u201d He swiveled around as Ryan and Ethan both started forward.</p><p>\u201cHold up,\u201d he ordered. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who\u2019s out there.\u201d</p><p>They all turned around to where Holly was sitting, only she was gone. Adam swore. She\u2019d run scared the minute she heard the knock.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go find her,\u201d Ethan said, his tone suggesting he\u2019d take care of her and for Adam and Ryan to take care of the outside threat.</p><p>To their surprise, the door opened and Lacey McMillan stuck her head in. \u201cYou in there?\u201d she called out. She stopped when her gaze rested on Ryan and Adam.</p><p>Adam relaxed. Lacey was the county sheriff, and she paid a call from time to time to see how things were in the high country. Tall, lanky and redheaded. All the things Holly wasn\u2019t. At one time, Adam had thought Lacey might be the one, but his brothers hadn\u2019t shared his attraction.</p><p>She removed her Stetson as she walked further into the cabin. She threw Adam a saucy grin. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad to see me?\u201d</p><p>Ryan scowled and sat back down at the bar.</p><p>\u201cWhat brings you out?\u201d Adam asked, folding his arms and affecting what he knew to be an intimidating stance. Normally he wouldn\u2019t mind shooting the shit with Lacey, even doing a little light flirting, but that was in the past. Now he just wanted her to be gone as soon as possible.</p><p>Lacey slid onto a barstool beside Ryan, hitching her long legs up to balance on the lower rung of the stool.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s the third stooge?\u201d she asked, looking around for Ethan.</p><p>\u201cAround,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She arched a brow but didn\u2019t comment further on his being so close-mouthed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m up here to find out if y\u2019all have seen a young woman. Early twenties. Brunette. Short, maybe five two. We\u2019re dealing with a possible abduction, though she may have escaped. We found an abandoned car at the base of the mountain, and we\u2019re checking out the area. Maybe you saw something?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam shook his head then fixed his gaze on Ryan. \u201cYou and Ethan see anything when you were out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention back to Lacey. \u201cYou think she\u2019s still in the area?\u201d</p><p>Lacey shrugged. \u201cDunno. Could be, though if she\u2019s on her own, I don\u2019t imagine she\u2019ll last long in the backcountry. City girl from what I gathered. Got a bulletin from the Denver PD and the Feds wanting our department to be on the lookout. Seemed to think she might be headed this way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you need trackers?\u201d Adam asked, knowing if he didn\u2019t offer, it would seem odd. He and his brothers had tracked missing persons before for the sheriff\u2019s department. Last summer, they had found a little girl who had wandered off from her parents\u2019 campsite.</p><p>Lacey shook her head. \u201cNah. Like I said, I\u2019m just checking out the possibility anyone saw something. We don\u2019t even know who the car belongs to. Teddy\u2019s running the plates as we speak. Could be she never came this way.\u201d</p><p>Adam itched to ask more questions. Who did Holly belong to and who supposedly kidnapped her? But he knew it would arouse Lacey\u2019s suspicions, because if nothing else, the Colter brothers kept to themselves and didn\u2019t borrow trouble from anyone.</p><p>\u201cWell, let us know if we can help,\u201d he said shortly, dismissively.</p><p>Lacey chuckled then rose from the barstool. \u201cThere was a time when you were more welcoming,\u201d she said softly as she brushed by him, letting her full breasts rasp across his folded arms.</p> <p>He stepped back, only anxious for her to be gone so he could question Holly.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019ll see you around,\u201d Lacey said, a resigned expression on her face. She replaced her hat then walked to the door. \u201cLet me know if you see anything, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>When she shut the door, Adam let out his breath.</p><p>Ryan glanced up, his expression brooding.</p><p>\u201cShe was looking for Holly,\u201d Adam said, a frown twisting his brows.</p> <p>He turned and strode for the bedroom, Ryan following close behind. An invisible hand squeezed his chest when he saw Holly huddled on the bed, her knees hugged to her chest. Ethan sat beside her, rubbing a soothing hand up and down her back, but she barely registered his presence.</p><p>Adam cursed under his breath and knelt down on the floor in front of the bed. He reached a hand for hers and pried it away from her legs.</p><p>\u201cBaby, listen to me. You\u2019re safe here. That was just our sheriff.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes widened in alarm, and she shivered in fear.</p><p>\u201cNo police,\u201d she croaked.</p><p>\u201cNo police,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cPromise me,\u201d she said, her voice coming out in a pathetic squeak.</p><p>\u201cYou can trust us,\u201d Ethan said quietly. \u201cWe won\u2019t allow anyone to hurt you.\u201d</p> <p>She relaxed a tiny bit, leaning more into Ethan\u2019s caress.</p><p>Adam still held her hand in his, and he brushed his fingers over her upturned palm, trying to infuse his calm into her. \u201cListen to me, baby. We need to ask you some questions.\u201d</p><p>She let out a panicked moan. \u201cNo, no questions. Please, let me go. I need to leave.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s hand stilled on her back, and beside Adam, Ryan stiffened. Adam knew he had to handle this just right. He couldn\u2019t chance her running. They couldn\u2019t keep her safe if she ran.</p><p>He exchanged looks with his brothers. They were all united in this cause. They were not going to let her go. And they sure as hell weren\u2019t going to let anyone hurt her.</p><p>He stood then sat down on the bed beside her. \u201cHoney, you can trust us. We aren\u2019t going to hurt you. We aren\u2019t going to let anyone else hurt you. But we need to know what\u2019s going on. What happened to you.\u201d</p><p>Panic flared in her eyes. Fear spread out like a forest fire over her face. \u201cY-y-you don\u2019t understand,\u201d she stammered out. \u201cNo one can help. No one can stop h-h-him.\u201d She said him like she spoke of the devil himself.</p><p>\u201cWho, baby? Who are you talking about?\u201d Adam whispered.</p><p>She shook her head, her agitation increasing with each second. On the other side of her, Ethan shook his head, a warning to Adam that he was pushing too far. She looked about ready to shatter.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some rest?\u201d Adam said, though he wanted very badly to have all the answers to his questions.</p><p>Ethan gently pulled her to him then lifted her up off the comforter. He stood beside the bed while Adam and Ryan turned back the covers. Then Ethan laid her down and pulled the sheets over her. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right outside if you need us,\u201d Ethan said, bending down to kiss her forehead.</p><p>Her eyes were closed before they even left the room.</p><p>The brothers assembled in the kitchen, all of them wearing grim expressions.</p><p>\u201cWhat did Lacey want?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>Adam quickly filled Ethan in on all Lacey had to say.</p><p>\u201cSo someone kidnapped her?\u201d Ethan asked incredulously. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. Wouldn\u2019t she be more than willing to spill the story and go to the police?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree it makes no sense,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cWhich is why we aren\u2019t going to tell anyone about Holly. At least not until we have the full story from her. She\u2019s scared to death of someone. A man. The son of a bitch has hurt her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s attracted to us,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cAll three of us. It confuses her, but her reaction to us is there.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded, satisfaction filling every inch of his body. After so long of waiting, they finally had the woman they would spend the rest of their lives with.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>She dreamed of them. They came to her on the heels of a nightmare. A sweet balm to her battered senses. They replaced images of the devil and hell. Their hands soothed away the hurt. Adam, Ethan and Ryan, their touch gentle, yet demanding, their lips worshipping her body.</p><p>Holly awoke dripping with sweat, need and a healthy dose of embarrassment. Maybe she wasn\u2019t any better than a whore. Maybe Mason was right.</p><p>She shivered as a chill settled over her damp skin. She looked at the window to see darkness beyond. How long had she slept? Her gaze settled on the bedside clock. Four-thirty. In the morning? It must be.</p><p>Chances were the brothers weren\u2019t even awake. It would be a perfect opportunity for her to steal away. She endangered them by staying here. Mason would find her, and he would kill anyone in his way. And the idea of her three saviors being harmed because of her hurt in a way she couldn\u2019t explain.</p><p>She slid her legs from the covers, careful not to make a sound when her feet hit the floor. Her shoes, a simple pair of sneakers, lay by the door, her socks stuffed inside.</p><p>She quickly pulled on her socks then laced up her shoes. She had no coat to wear over her thin sweater so she retrieved the flannel shirt she had worn yesterday. It would have to do.</p><p>With extreme care, she opened the bedroom door and peered out into the hallway. The other bedroom doors were slightly ajar, much to her chagrin. She\u2019d have to sneak past them the best she could.</p><p>She tiptoed down the hall and breathed a sigh of relief when she reached the living room. That is until she saw Adam lying on the couch. He must have slept there last night since she\u2019d taken over his room.</p><p>A low fire burned in the fireplace, and she longed to go stand in front of it, anything to infuse as much warmth as she could before she stepped into the cold.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, she took small measured steps toward the door. If she could just reach the door. She glanced over at Adam who didn\u2019t stir. She reached out a hand for the door and held her breath as she turned the handle.</p><p>She opened it a crack and slipped out before a rush of cold air could blow in. She eased the door shut behind her and breathed a sigh of relief. She\u2019d made it.</p><p>The icy cold air made quick work of her inadequate clothing and infused an uncomfortable chill into her body. The Land Rover stood parked in the drive, and for a moment she contemplated taking it, but she wouldn\u2019t steal from the men who had been nothing but kind to her.</p><p>She\u2019d walk until she found another means of transportation.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere, doll?\u201d</p><p>She whirled in the direction of the voice to see Ethan and Ryan standing a few feet away, their arms loaded with firewood.</p><p>Her jaw worked up and down, and she struggled to say something, to respond. But nothing would come out. So she did the only thing she could think of. She ran.</p><p>Behind her, a set of curses rang out as she sped as quickly as she could across the snow. She had no idea where she was going. She only knew she had to get away.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t gotten far when arms plucked her off her feet. She met with a hard chest and found herself staring up into Ethan\u2019s face.</p><p>\u201cDamn it, don\u2019t look at me like that,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you. I\u2019d kill anyone who hurt you.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him in complete bewilderment at the possessiveness in his tone. \u201cLet me go,\u201d she begged. \u201cI can\u2019t stay here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd where would you go?\u201d Ryan demanded beside them. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t survive an hour out here.\u201d</p><p>She knew he had a point, but she couldn\u2019t stay here. She didn\u2019t understand the attraction she felt for the brothers, why she shivered if one of them so much as looked at her. One she could understand, but all three of them? What kind of freak did that make her?</p><p>\u201cGive me your coat,\u201d Ethan said to Ryan. \u201cShe\u2019s freezing already.\u201d</p><p>A moment later, she was bathed in warmth as Ryan\u2019s body heat bled into her. His coat smelled like him, felt like him, as if he held her instead of Ethan.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay here,\u201d she whispered, dangerously close to tears.</p><p>Ethan stared down at her for a long moment. Then to her complete surprise, he bent his lips to hers and caught her in a long, intense kiss.</p><p>He caught her gasp of shock and swallowed it up as his tongue danced over hers. She forgot all resistance as she melted like hot butter into his chest.</p><p>Jesus, Mary and Joseph. He was every bit as lethal as Adam. And she shouldn\u2019t be reacting this way to him. Not after what she had done with Adam.</p><p>Hot tears flooded her eyes, and she let out a moan of distress.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re scaring her, Ethan,\u201d Ryan growled beside them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a whore,\u201d she whispered. \u201cJust like he said.\u201d</p><p>Ethan went rigid, his arms like bands of steel around her body. \u201cWho called you a whore?\u201d he asked, his voice deadly quiet.</p><p>She struggled in his arms until he was forced to put her down, but he still kept a firm grip around her wrist.</p><p>\u201cDoes it matter? He was obviously right,\u201d she said in a tortured voice. \u201cAll any of you have to do is look at me and I go up in flames. What kind of woman am I?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cOur woman,\u201d Ryan answered. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind it makes you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth rounded in shock at his announcement. She looked back and forth between the two men, looking for an avenue of escape.</p><p>\u201cCome on, doll,\u201d Ethan said gently. \u201cLet\u2019s get you back to the house. You\u2019re freezing. Adam\u2019s not going to be happy about you running.\u201d</p><p>She tensed and Ryan spit out another curse. \u201cQuit scaring her, Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019d never hurt you, Holly. You\u2019re going to find out very quickly, that we\u2019d do anything to save you hurt,\u201d Ethan said, as he bent to swing her back into his arms.</p><p>She lay still in his arms as he strode back to the house. Her mind fought to comprehend the bizarre conversation she\u2019d just had with the brothers.</p><p>Ryan opened the door, and Ethan walked into the house with Holly still in his arms. Adam stood a few feet away, his arms crossed over his chest, his expression formidable.</p><p>Despite Ethan\u2019s assurances, she began to tremble in his arms. She turned her face into his chest, trying to hide from Adam\u2019s scrutiny. His power terrified her. Mason was nothing next to this man, and yet he\u2019d done so much to hurt her. Adam could do much more.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s arms tightened around her. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, doll,\u201d he whispered in her ear. He walked her over to the fire and set her down. She quickly arranged herself behind him so he stood as a barrier between her and Adam.</p><p>To her surprise, Adam laughed. \u201cSo is this going to be the way it is? You hide behind Ethan every time you do something to piss me off?\u201d</p><p>She frowned and stuck her head out from behind Ethan. Adam was smiling, and Ryan looked at her with quiet intensity. For a moment, she saw something in Ryan\u2019s eyes she recognized, could relate to. Torment.</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she began lamely. \u201cI don\u2019t understand any of this.\u201d</p><p>Adam looked at her standing behind Ethan, clutching fiercely at his shirt. She looked lost and forlorn and very afraid. He was glad she at least trusted Ethan, even if she had no idea she did. She was clearly assigning Ethan the role of protector. From him.</p><p>Ethan warned him with his eyes not to push. Hell, he could figure that much out without Ethan\u2019s warnings. Holly looked like a frightened fawn. Ready to bolt with the least provocation. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He sighed and sat down on the couch. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d</p><p>She clutched at Ethan\u2019s hand and chewed nervously at her lip.</p><p>What had made her so afraid? Who had hurt her so badly that she couldn\u2019t trust him or his brothers?</p><p>Ethan\u2019s arm went around her, squeezing her reassuringly even as he guided her forward. Ethan cupped her chin and forced her to look up at him. \u201cNo one will hurt you, doll. I swear it. No one will ever hurt you again.\u201d</p> <p>She relaxed a bit at his vow then turned her nervous gaze at Adam. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>He held out a hand to her and felt an insane sense of victory when she trustingly curled her hand into his. He pulled her into his arms and smoothed her hair from her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not angry, baby. Not at you. Never at you. I\u2019m angry at the son of a bitch who hurt you, who put that fear I see into your eyes.\u201d</p><p>He tugged her down further into his arms then kissed her, gently, lightly, feather soft across her mouth. For a moment, she melted into his arms, and she fit so damn perfect, like she\u2019d always belonged there. Then she tensed and yanked away from him, torment and self-loathing burning brightly in her eyes.</p><p>With an inarticulate cry, she ran past him and down the hall to the bedroom.</p><p>Adam started after her, surprised by her reaction. Ethan\u2019s hand on his arm stopped him.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to explain,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>Ethan sighed and dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cShe thinks she\u2019s a whore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome on, Adam, you know she has to be confused. She\u2019s attracted to the three of us. Some bastard has told her she\u2019s a whore and now she believes him. She doesn\u2019t understand herself or us. You have to explain it to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Adam said with a deep sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to her.\u201d</p> <p>Adam walked down the hall to the bedroom, his brothers following a short distance behind. He knocked softly, not wanting to alarm her by barging in. \u201cHolly, honey, it\u2019s me, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d Her voice, muffled by sobs, filtered through the door.</p><p>He opened the door, flinching when he saw her huddled on the bed, her eyes red-rimmed. She\u2019d discarded Ryan\u2019s coat on the floor. He stepped around it and walked over to sit on the bed next to her. He pulled her into his arms. She didn\u2019t fight him much to his delight.</p><p>\u201cTell me why you\u2019re crying,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cWhat would you say if I told you not two minutes before I kissed you in the living room, I was outside kissing Ethan?\u201d she said, her lip trembling.</p><p>He smiled and smoothed his hand over her hair. \u201cThat makes me very happy, actually.\u201d</p><p>Startled eyes flew to his face. \u201cHappy? I\u2019m acting like a slut and that makes you happy?\u201d</p><p>He looked sternly at her. \u201cI won\u2019t tolerate you talking about yourself that way. If you say anything like that again, I\u2019ll turn you over my knee and spank your pretty ass.\u201d</p> <p>Her mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cThere are some things you should know,\u201d he said. \u201cStarting with the fact that you belong to us. All of us.\u201d</p><p>He expected to see fear at his statement. Instead, he saw surprise. Ethan and Ryan, who had been standing in the doorway, moved closer to the bed. Ethan sat down behind Holly and slipped his hands over her shoulders, rubbing soothingly.</p><p>Holly looked uneasily between the brothers as Adam allowed time for his declaration to sink in. She wet her lips nervously and turned troubled eyes back to him.</p><p>\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re not going to let me leave?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cIf you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re a prisoner, the answer is no. If you\u2019re asking if we\u2019re going to open the door and let you waltz out of our lives, the answer is no.\u201d</p><p>He moved in closer, cupping her chin in his hand. Her breathing sped up. Beside her, Ryan curled his hand around hers. All three brothers were touching her, soothing her.</p><p>\u201cYou belong to us, Holly,\u201d Adam whispered. \u201cI can feel your want, your need. It\u2019s as strong as our need for you. You\u2019re frightened, but you want us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you want a sex slave?\u201d she asked in a strangled voice.</p><p>His eyes narrowed. She was afraid. Not just of him and his brothers but of herself and the unknown man who had done so much damage to her both physically and mentally.</p><p>\u201cIf you think this is only about sex, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Adam said in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about forever. You would be our wife, our mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d she squeaked. \u201cB-but...you can\u2019t all marry the same woman!\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t we?\u201d Ethan asked behind her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not legal!\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking with your mind,\u201d Adam chided. \u201cThere\u2019s no law that says you can\u2019t live with three men. In our hearts, you would be bound to all three of us. Wife to each one of us. Cherished by all of us.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in denial, in confusion.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s that way in our family,\u201d Ryan said quietly. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering if it\u2019s genetic then no, it isn\u2019t. We have a choice, and we\u2019re choosing you. Our fathers chose our mother, our grandfathers chose our grandmother. But we aren\u2019t bound by an invisible compulsion to lead that kind of life. It\u2019s something we decided when we were old enough to do so. We always knew there would be but one woman for the three of us. And so we\u2019ve waited.\u201d</p><p>Adam watched Holly\u2019s reaction to Ryan\u2019s sincere explanation. A sheen of tears rimmed her eyes, and her hands shook in her lap.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cBut you want us,\u201d Ethan persisted.</p><p>She nodded a little shamefully.</p><p>\u201cThen why can\u2019t you?\u201d Adam prompted, wanting to hear the demons she fought.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m already married,\u201d she choked out.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Cold fingers of dread gripped Adam\u2019s chest. Already married? He looked up to see the same dread mirrored on his brothers\u2019 faces. He glanced down at her finger, unbelieving that he would have missed a ring. But none shone there.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s hands had stilled on her shoulders. Ryan\u2019s grip on her hand had loosened. His own hand had dropped from her chin. Could it be the one woman meant for them was forbidden?</p><p>No, he wouldn\u2019t accept that. Couldn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cWho is he?\u201d Adam growled possessively.</p><p>Her hand fluttered to her throat, a defensive gesture. Panic flared across her face, quickly running out of control.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man you\u2019re running from,\u201d Ryan said, his face stony.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the man who put the fear in your eyes,\u201d Adam added, tilting her chin up once more.</p><p>She closed her eyes and nodded.</p><p>Relief poured over Adam. Ethan\u2019s hands once again smoothed over Holly\u2019s shoulders. This was something they could deal with. She would simply divorce the bastard.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going back to him,\u201d Adam said simply. \u201cYou\u2019ll never go back to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d she whispered. \u201cHe\u2019ll never let me go.\u201d Tears sparkled in her cinnamon eyes.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d Ethan muttered.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll hurt you, just like...\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off but Adam understood what she had left unsaid. He\u2019ll hurt you, just like he hurt me. He had never dealt with such rage as what built within him. It swirled like an out of control storm.</p><p>She cleared her throat and continued on. \u201cHe\u2019s a very powerful man. He\u2019ll kill you. All three of you. Murder means nothing to him. I can\u2019t let him do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you think you going back to him is the answer?\u201d Ryan asked incredulously.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll never go back to him. Not willingly. But I also can\u2019t stay here. If he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m here, if I\u2019m somewhere else, he can\u2019t very well hurt any of you.\u201d</p><p>A smile tugged at the corners of Adam\u2019s mouth. The little spitfire was trying to protect them. He felt a surge of pride. Their mate was proving very worthy indeed.</p><p>\u201cI realize you\u2019ve only known us a short time, baby, but you\u2019re going to have to learn to trust your husbands,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Her eyes flew open even wider. \u201cBut you\u2019re not my husbands! Weren\u2019t you listening? I\u2019m already married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA mere technicality,\u201d he said calmly. \u201cOne we intend to rectify as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>She made a sound of frustration. \u201cDid you hear anything I said?\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWe heard everything, but your concern is unfounded. We can take care of ourselves, but more than that, we can take care of you.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fell, a helpless gesture that stated she was at a complete loss as to what to do or say. They were pressing too hard, something they couldn\u2019t afford to do if they didn\u2019t want to lose her.</p><p>\u201cCome into the kitchen. Let us fix you some breakfast,\u201d Adam said, changing the topic to something neutral. Safe.</p><p>He saw the relief in her eyes. She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there in a minute,\u201d she said, her voice husky.</p><p>Adam got up and motioned for his brothers to follow him. A few seconds later, Holly was alone in the big bedroom, her senses reeling from what she had just experienced.</p><p>They wanted her. All of them. And damn it, she wanted them too. She desperately wanted to see where this whole bizarre episode would take them. But there were several problems with doing that.</p><p>One, Mason would find her if she stayed here. She knew that just as well as she knew he would step on anyone who got in his way.</p><p>Two, her longing to be cherished, protected, was what got her into her present mess, and here she was falling under the spell of three gorgeous cowboys. She had to quit looking to others for her happiness.</p><p>Their wife. She shook her head, still unable to comprehend what they had proposed. As progressive as today\u2019s society was, she didn\u2019t think it was so forward-thinking as to excuse one woman living with three men.</p><p>But then, why should she care what anyone else thought? She sure hadn\u2019t when she had run from Mason Bardwell\u2019s home in the dead of the night. On their wedding night at that.</p><p>She closed her eyes and rubbed her forehead. She needed aspirin and maybe a good stiff drink. Nothing made sense to her, and it hurt to try and sort through the myriad of emotions swimming around in her head.</p><p>\u201cHolly,\u201d Ryan said from the door.</p><p>She looked up to see the youngest brother leaning against the doorframe, studying her quietly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for breakfast.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak. Not trusting that she wouldn\u2019t throw herself across the room into his arms.</p><p>As if reading her mind, he ambled over to the bed and extended his hand down to her.</p><p>Slowly, she reached out and took his hand, liking the warmth that spread up her arm at an alarming rate.</p><p>He pulled her to stand beside him. His gaze slid over her, heating a path where it fell.</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t kissed me,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>Her eyes widened in surprise. She hadn\u2019t expected him to say anything of the sort.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve kissed Ethan and Adam, but not me. If I was a jealous man, I might take exception to that.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth fell open. What to say to that?</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we remedy that?\u201d he asked huskily.</p><p>He bent down, his mouth hovering a mere inch above hers. Sweet Jesus, how could she possibly resist? His hand slid over her jaw, to the back of her neck. His fingers plunged into her hair and pulled her to meet his mouth.</p><p>She sighed against his lips and let herself melt into his chest. The kiss was slow, hot, and thorough. Not as demanding as Adam\u2019s, not as gentle as Ethan\u2019s. Hot. It was the only word she could come up with to describe it.</p><p>Her nipples hardened against his chest, her breasts swelling and plumping in desire. An ache built in earnest between her legs, and she felt a sudden wetness. She clenched her legs together, trying to ease the burn, but it only grew stronger.</p><p>His big hands traveled down her back and settled on her ass, cupping and squeezing, pushing her against his groin. His cock, hard, big, bulging in his jeans, thrust into the cradle of her pelvis.</p><p>\u201cCan you feel how much I want you?\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He didn\u2019t wait for an answer. Instead, he resumed devouring her lips, raining a trail of heated kisses over her jawline and down to her neck.</p><p>She threw back her head and moaned when his teeth nipped the delicate curve of her shoulder. One hand still cupping her ass, his other hand slid around to her belly, then underneath her sweater, upwards until he cupped her breast.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat when he thumbed her nipple. Exquisite currents of pleasure radiated in all directions from her breasts. Her pussy pulsed in response. Her clit tightened, ached, strained.</p><p>She moved restlessly in his arms, so close to something wonderful. Then he shoved her shirt up and lowered his head. She clenched her teeth together in anticipation. Hot breath blew over her nipple, puckering it, tightening it unbearably. But still he didn\u2019t suck it into his mouth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she gasped out.</p><p>\u201cPlease what? Tell me what you want, Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mouth. Please. I want your mouth there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere?\u201d he asked, kissing the soft underswell of her breast. \u201cOr here?\u201d He kissed the area above her nipple.</p> <p>Losing patience with his teasing, she shoved her hand into his hair and pulled his head to her nipple.</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cOh, you mean here.\u201d He sucked her nipple into his mouth and her body exploded in pleasure.</p><p>\u201cOh my God!\u201d</p><p>She held him tightly against her, demanding his mouth not leave her breast. Currents of fire streaked down her belly and into her pelvis. Wetness gushed from her pussy. How could she be so close to coming when he\u2019d only sucked her nipples?</p><p>\u201cI hate to interrupt, but breakfast is getting cold,\u201d Adam said lazily from the door.</p> <p>Heat rushed to Holly\u2019s cheeks, and she yanked away from Ryan. She pulled at her sweater, trying to restore a semblance of modesty to her appearance.</p><p>But Ryan wouldn\u2019t let her get away that easily. He pulled her to his large frame and kissed her, hard. \u201cPay him no attention. He\u2019s pissed because he wants very much to be on the other side of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue,\u201d Adam said with a shrug. \u201cSoon enough. She\u2019ll be ours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant breakfast?\u201d Ryan asked as he motioned to the door.</p><p>\u201cYou go first,\u201d she said nervously. The idea of passing by Adam was enough to make her knees turn to jelly. She much preferred the protection Ryan\u2019s body offered as a buffer between her and Adam.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes glittered with unspent need as he tucked her hand into his. He pulled her along with him as he walked by Adam. She was almost out of the bedroom when Adam snaked an arm out and caught her.</p> <p>To her dismay, Ryan let her hand fall from his and ambled on toward the kitchen. She found herself hauled up against Adam\u2019s rock hard chest and staring into his green eyes.</p><p>\u201cYou have no reason to be afraid of me,\u201d he said seriously. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to hide behind Ethan and Ryan every time I say something to you. I\u2019m very glad you feel safe with my brothers, but they have no need to protect you from me.\u201d</p><p>She bit her lip nervously. \u201cIt\u2019s just that you\u2019re so...\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo...what?\u201d he prompted.</p><p>\u201cSo big,\u201d she blurted out.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cAnd Ethan and Ryan aren\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>She flushed. \u201cNo, yes, I mean yes, they\u2019re big but I don\u2019t think they\u2019d hurt me.\u201d</p><p>His lips tightened. \u201cAnd you think I would?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot intentionally,\u201d she said lamely. \u201cM-Mason is nothing compared to you and yet...\u201d She broke off, not wanting to blurt out what all Mason had done. \u201cIf he could do so much, what then could you do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that the bastard\u2019s name?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>She pressed her lips together, refusing to say any more.</p><p>Adam sighed and dragged a hand through his hair. \u201cCome here, baby.\u201d He pulled her over to the bed and sat down, settling her on his lap. \u201cI don\u2019t know what all this Mason bastard has done to you, though I fully intend to find out, but it\u2019s obvious he\u2019s destroyed any trust you might\u2019ve had within you. I can accept that. What I can\u2019t accept is the fear in your eyes every time I look at you.\u201d</p><p>Her heart thudded painfully. Adam looked earnest. Hard, but earnest. She felt silly over the fear that nagged her when he was focused on her, but she knew without a doubt, she would never be the same after meeting this man. And maybe that was what she was most afraid of.</p><p>\u201cI have been very honest with you,\u201d he continued on. \u201cI want you. More than any other woman. Ever. I won\u2019t be satisfied until you\u2019re in my bed. In our bed. Bound to us. Pregnant with our children. Belonging to us heart and soul forever. I can\u2019t put it any straighter than that. I won\u2019t let you go without a fight, that\u2019s for damn sure, but I sure as hell won\u2019t ever hurt you, and I\u2019ll move heaven and earth to make sure no one else does either.\u201d</p><p>She felt his speech to the very depths of her soul. How could she not? No one had ever spoken so honestly with her or with such conviction.</p><p>\u201cGive us a chance, Holly. It\u2019s all I ask.\u201d</p><p>Not examining the voice inside her that warned her to run far, far away, she slowly nodded.</p><p>A slow, triumphant smile spread across his face. \u201cNow, let\u2019s go eat that breakfast.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>Holly sat at the bar between Adam and Ryan as Ethan served up plates of ham and eggs. She glanced between them often, gauging their mood, their reaction to her, but they seemed unruffled.</p><p>It was as if they made such proclamations every day. She shook her head and speared another piece of egg with her fork. How could such a relationship work? Jealousy would be inevitable. And things would be much more difficult for her than for any of them. They only had one \u201cspouse\u201d to contend with, she had three.</p><p>Three men to please, put up with, all different. The mere idea of the complexities involved in the situation made her head ache even harder.</p><p>Ethan was obviously the easiest going of the three brothers. She relaxed around him. It was a natural reaction. Even if she didn\u2019t know Adam was the oldest, it was as clear as if it was written across his forehead. And even though he had gone to great lengths to make her feel at ease, she knew he could be dangerous when crossed. He exuded power and authority, wore it like a mantle draped around him.</p><p>Her gaze flitted sideways to Ryan. He was an enigma. The only one she didn\u2019t have an idea formed about already. He was quiet and serious, but more than that, she saw pain in his eyes. Like her, he\u2019d seen the darker side of life. She\u2019d bet her last dollar on it.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>She looked up to see him frowning at her.</p><p>\u201cJust a headache,\u201d she replied.</p><p>He walked to one of the cabinets and retrieved a bottle of ibuprofen, shook out several pills and handed them to her. Just one more example of them taking care of her. It warmed her to her toes and scared the hell out of her all at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, baby?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Was she that easy to read? Could they already see inside her mind and soul? Her fingers tensed on her fork for a moment as she contemplated denying that anything was on her mind, but Adam\u2019s honesty compelled her to be equally honest.</p><p>\u201cThe dynamics of the whole relationship you all propose... It\u2019s rather mind-boggling,\u201d she admitted.</p><p>She didn\u2019t miss the triumphant smiles passed between the brothers. Surely to them, this was a sign they were making headway. And maybe they were, as insane as she was to even contemplate it.</p><p>\u201cAnything in particular you want to talk about?\u201d Adam prompted.</p><p>She sighed and set down her fork. \u201cThis has all pretty much blown me away. I don\u2019t even know where to begin. I keep expecting to be told this is one huge joke at my expense.\u201d</p><p>Ryan put a hand on her knee. \u201cThis is no joke. Now tell us what\u2019s on your mind.\u201d</p><p>She took in a deep breath, told herself she was completely nuts and then proceeded to tell them precisely what concerns she had.</p><p>\u201cThe thing is, you guys only have one person to concern yourselves with, relationship wise. I have three. Three overbearing, overprotective, rather large men. I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s remotely possible that I could please all of you all of the time.\u201d</p><p>Cocky, self-assured grins adorned the three men\u2019s faces.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us expect perfection,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cThough,\u201d he added with an up and down sweep of her, \u201cI\u2019m not arguing with what we\u2019ve been given.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed this many times,\u201d Adam said in a serious tone. \u201cWe know it won\u2019t always be easy. It wasn\u2019t always easy for our mother and fathers, but if we all work at it, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t live in harmony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess I just don\u2019t understand the concept,\u201d Holly said. \u201cI can\u2019t wrap my brain around it.\u201d</p><p>Ryan reclaimed her attention by turning her back around to face him. \u201cThen think of it this way. Three men completely devoted to your happiness. Three men worshipping your body with theirs. Three men who would love you with complete abandon. Three men who would protect you and cherish you always.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him open-mouthed. \u201cWell, when you put it that way,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cDamn, Ryan, why didn\u2019t you speak up earlier?\u201d Ethan said in amusement.</p><p>\u201cThe first order of business is to go into town and buy you some clothes and whatever else you need,\u201d Adam said, changing the subject.</p><p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t need anything,\u201d she protested. Well, that wasn\u2019t entirely true, but she didn\u2019t want them buying her a bunch of stuff.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you care to repeat that part about three men devoted to her happiness, worshipping her, etc.?\u201d Ethan spoke up. \u201cBecause I\u2019m pretty sure making sure our woman is clothed and provided for falls under that heading.\u201d</p><p>Holly blushed.</p><p>\u201cEthan, you and Ryan want to drive her into town? I need to check out the horses and get the hay out. It\u2019s supposed to snow again tonight.\u201d He turned to Holly. \u201cThere\u2019s a western store in town. It isn\u2019t much but you\u2019ll be able to get boots, jeans and some shirts. And a coat. You need a decent coat. Next week, we\u2019ll drive into the city to do the heavy shopping for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said softly. She couldn\u2019t manage much more around the huge knot in her throat. She felt dangerously close to tears and fought to contain them.</p><p>Adam leaned forward and brushed his mouth across hers. He was surprisingly gentle. For the first time, she reached a hand out to touch him, running her fingertips across his cheek, feeling the slight stubble along his jaw.</p><p>When he drew away, his eyes were burning with passion, and she felt heady with the knowledge she had affected him so.</p><p>\u201cWell if we\u2019re going into town, we need to go now. We don\u2019t want to be late getting back if it\u2019s going to snow,\u201d Ryan announced, standing up from his seat at the bar.</p><p>\u201cIs it...is it safe for me to go into town?\u201d she asked. The idea that someone might see her and report back to Mason struck fear into her heart, no matter the brothers\u2019 vow to protect her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re not seen,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cRiley\u2019s Western Store is on the edge of town. We\u2019ll park you in a corner of the store and do your shopping for you, let you try on stuff if you need to, and we\u2019ll keep a sharp eye for anything unusual going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, expelling a long breath. \u201cLet\u2019s do it then.\u201d</p><p>The drive into town was long and quiet as they traveled down the mountain. Holly sat up front while Ethan drove and Ryan sat in the back of the Land Rover. During the course of the trip, Ethan reached over and twined his fingers with hers.</p><p>She drew comfort from the small gesture and readily laced her fingers in his.</p><p>Mid-morning, they drove into the small town of Clyde. Adam had been right. There wasn\u2019t much beyond a small grocery store, a feed mill, a few cafes and the western store, but there was a quaint main street and the businesses were clean and well-kept.</p><p>Ethan pulled up at the western store, and he and Ryan surveyed the area before opening their doors. Ryan opened her door and gestured for her to get out. Once she was out, Ethan and Ryan flanked her and they headed into the store.</p><p>They led her to the area beside the one small dressing room and had her sit.</p><p>\u201cNow tell us what sizes you need, and we\u2019ll bring you some stuff to look at,\u201d Ryan directed.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cThere\u2019s no one else in here. I think I can look myself if that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>Ethan glanced around once more. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go stand by the door. Ryan, you keep an eye on Holly while she shops.\u201d</p><p>Holly walked over to the racks in the center of the store and began thumbing through the shirts. She found a few long sleeve flannel shirts in her size and removed them from the rack. She wasn\u2019t sure how much she should spend so she only took a few and moved onto the jeans.</p><p>As she was searching for her size in the pants, Ryan walked up behind her with several more shirts over his arm. At her self-conscious glance, he shoved the shirts toward her, his expression brooking no argument.</p><p>\u201cTake them up to the counter for me, will you?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m fairly certain they\u2019ll fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant me to pick you out a pair of boots while I\u2019m up there?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI\u2019d like that. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She walked closer to the window overlooking the street and picked out a few pairs of jeans in dark blue and one each in black and khaki. As she turned to follow Ryan to the checkout, her eyes stopped on a familiar black vehicle pulling down the street.</p><p>Frozen to the spot, she watched in horror as Mason Bardwell climbed out of the flashy BMW, his gaze flitting up and down the street. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Her stomach knotted, rolled, tightening until she knew she would vomit. She glanced around in panic, looking for a place to hide. Somewhere he couldn\u2019t see her.</p><p>Ethan frowned as the BMW pulled into a parking spot across the street. Unusual vehicle for this part of the world. If it wasn\u2019t four-wheel drive, the locals had no use for it.</p><p>He glanced back to where Ryan was looking at boots and then at the racks where Holly was. Only she wasn\u2019t there. He scanned the store, looking to see where she moved, but she wasn\u2019t anywhere to be seen.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d he barked.</p> <p>Ryan turned around, his eyes searching for Holly as well. His features hardened when he saw no sign of her either.</p><p>They fanned out, darting between the clothes racks. Ryan walked to the back toward the fitting room, and Ethan scoured the front by the window.</p><p>He found her huddled behind a clearance rack, only her feet sticking out from under the clothes. When he parted the hangers, she flinched, as if afraid of who had come.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, doll? Who\u2019s scared you so bad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here. Outside. He\u2019s come for me. He knows I\u2019m here,\u201d she said with a low moan.</p> <p>She rocked back and forth, abject terror in her eyes. She hugged her knees tightly to her chest, a protective measure. Ethan wanted to march into the street and kill the bastard on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll kill him.\u201d</p><p>For a moment, Ethan thought he had spoken his thoughts aloud, but then he realized Ryan had walked up behind them.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d she protested. \u201cPlease, take me home. He can\u2019t see me. Please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let him hurt you, doll,\u201d Ethan soothed. He turned to Ryan. \u201cPull the Rover around back. I\u2019ll take her out that way.\u201d</p><p>He turned his attention back to Holly and gently picked her up. Cradling her to his chest, he strode toward the rear of the store, careful to keep her hidden from view.</p> <p>He stopped at the counter for the briefest of moments when he caught the storeowner\u2019s curious stare.</p><p>\u201cRiley, I need a favor,\u201d Ethan murmured. \u201cThere\u2019s a mean son of a bitch outside, and he\u2019s looking for this woman. If he asks you, you haven\u2019t seen her.\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s gaze hardened, and he fingered the shotgun he kept behind the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ethan.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded then hurried out the back. Ryan was there, holding the door open. \u201cYou drive,\u201d he ordered as he climbed into the back, still holding Holly.</p><p>A few seconds later, they pulled onto the main street. Holly lay in the seat, her head on Ethan\u2019s lap. He stared at the BMW on their way past, committing the license plate to memory. Not that it was hard. California plates. Personalized. MASON. Arrogant bastard to boot.</p><p>He stroked Holly\u2019s hair, his rage building as he felt her tremble beneath his touch. When they were out of town, he pulled her up beside him.</p><p>She clung to him, her face buried in his chest. She felt better than he had ever imagined a woman could feel. That the woman who would complete them all was finally with them was incomprehensible. And he sure as hell wasn\u2019t going to let some abusive bastard take her away from them.</p><p>\u201cHow is she?\u201d Ryan asked from the front seat as he sped up the mountain, taking the switchbacks as fast as he dared.</p> <p>\u201cGood question. How are you, doll?\u201d he asked, smoothing her hair from her face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said in a shaky voice. \u201cHe didn\u2019t see me, did he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, doll, he didn\u2019t. I promise. You\u2019re safe.\u201d</p><p>He continued to caress her, running his hand up and down her back. \u201cWe\u2019re almost home.\u201d</p><p>He nuzzled the top of her head, pressing kisses to her hair. Gradually she ceased shaking, but she held him tightly, a fact he wasn\u2019t complaining about. Whether she wanted to admit it or not, she trusted him. She trusted all three of them. It was a start.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>Adam was furious when Ethan and Ryan arrived with a visibly shaken Holly. He scooped her up in his arms and hugged her tightly against his chest. His eyes flashed over her head, demanding to know what happened from his brothers.</p><p>\u201cHer h\u2014the bastard was in town,\u201d Ethan spat.</p><p>\u201cDid he hurt you, baby?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>She shook her head against his chest.</p><p>He looked up to his brothers for confirmation.</p><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t see her,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAt least we don\u2019t think. He was parked on the street. Holly saw him from the store window.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>This certainly complicated things. He exchanged glances with his brothers. All silently agreed. Something would have to be done about the bastard. They couldn\u2019t allow Holly to be terrorized any longer.</p><p>Adam pulled Holly away from him slightly and framed her face in his hands. \u201cListen to me, baby. We won\u2019t let him hurt you, I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long moment then slowly nodded.</p><p>He let out a growl of satisfaction. \u201cGo run some bathwater, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Ryan left for the bathroom, leaving Adam and Ethan in the room with Holly. Adam ran a hand down her cheek, down the curve of her slender neck and down to the neckline of her shirt.</p><p>\u201cLet us take care of you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cFirst a bath...\u201d He let his voice trail off suggesting there was more to come.</p><p>She shivered in his arms. But she didn\u2019t look at all worried about the idea of more to come.</p><p>\u201cAdam, there\u2019s something...there\u2019s something you should know.\u201d</p><p>He lifted his brow at her nervous statement. He looked over at Ethan who shrugged.</p><p>She pushed away from him, and he allowed her space. She stood up and moved several feet from both him and Ethan.</p><p>\u201cI feel so stupid saying this,\u201d she began. She wrung her hands in front of her, her agitation increasing.</p><p>\u201cHolly,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cWhatever it is, just tell us. It can\u2019t be so bad, no matter what you may think.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and looked between them. \u201cI thought you should know, I mean I don\u2019t even know how this whole thing works. Between us, I mean. About sex.\u201d</p><p>She broke off, her cheeks pink with a blush.</p><p>Adam waited patiently for her to come around to her point. The fact she was entertaining thoughts of sex was promising, but she wasn\u2019t sure how it would work between them. He smiled. She was delightfully innocent.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019ve never done this before,\u201d she said awkwardly. \u201cI mean sex in general.\u201d</p><p>Not that innocent surely! His head jerked in surprise, and he looked at Ethan to see the same surprise blazoned on his face.</p><p>\u201cSay that again?\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Her blush deepened.</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re married,\u201d Adam began.</p><p>\u201cI left him on our wedding night,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>A slow smile spread across Ethan\u2019s face, and the same sense of satisfaction took hold of Adam. She was going to be more than just theirs. She would only belong to them. They would be her first. And her last.</p><p>\u201cMaybe you should explain, baby,\u201d he said gently. They needed to know all they could about her. The more they knew, the better chance they had of keeping her. And letting her go wasn\u2019t an option.</p><p>\u201cWater\u2019s ready,\u201d Ryan called from the door.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll let you talk in the tub,\u201d Adam said. He stood and closed the distance between him and Holly. She stepped back slightly when his hand slid under her shirt.</p><p>\u201cTrust me, baby. I won\u2019t hurt you. We need to get you out of your clothes.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips then captured her bottom lip between her teeth and nibbled furiously. She was, in a word, adorable.</p><p>Holly glanced between the three men in front of her and nearly hyperventilated. She wanted them, but she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be naked in front of them. The mere idea had her wanting to hurl.</p><p>Adam\u2019s hand slid underneath her shirt, his fingers brushing the underside of her breast. The thin material of her bra did nothing to muffle his touch. She felt the scorching blaze of his heat to her very depths.</p><p>Feather light, his fingers brushed across her skin, around to her back and to the clasp of her bra. With a flick of his hand, the clasp broke free.</p><p>Another hand slipped underneath her shirt, shoving it upward. She gave a startled gasp as she realized Ethan had joined Adam.</p><p>Ethan pushed her shirt to her neck then Adam gently tugged it over her head. She self-consciously covered her chest with her arms.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Ryan said huskily. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see him staring at her from across the room, his eyes burning into hers.</p><p>Slowly she let her hands fall away until she stood in front of them in only her jeans.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ethan breathed.</p><p>Adam undid the fly on her jeans then slid the zipper down.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry, the water is going to get cold,\u201d Ryan drawled.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t have that,\u201d Adam said in a voice that sent spasms from her belly to her pussy. Her muscles clenched in red hot need.</p><p>He began to peel her jeans down her body until she stood in only her panties. Ready for the agony to end, she hooked her thumbs in the waistband and quickly shimmied out of her underwear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She found herself lifted into his arms, and he carried her into the bathroom. He lowered her into the huge tub of foamy suds, and she moaned in pleasure as the warm water lapped over her body.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll give you some time to relax,\u201d Adam said as he stood back up. He dropped a kiss on top of her head. \u201cI\u2019ll be back to wash your hair and dry you off in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She watched as they filed out of the bathroom, and she sunk lower into the suds, closing her eyes. Would they want to have sex with her now that she had told them she was a virgin? She was nervous about the whole idea. Not only had she never done it, but she had three men wanting to make love to her. And she had no idea how they planned to go about it. But damned if the idea of it didn\u2019t have her toes curled.</p><p>\u201cThis changes things a bit,\u201d Adam said as he faced his two brothers in the bedroom.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Ryan demanded.</p><p>\u201cHolly\u2019s a virgin,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Ryan lifted a brow but said nothing more. He merely pinned Adam with a questioning stare.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Adam asked, sensing there was a lot on his youngest brother\u2019s mind.</p><p>Ryan sighed and shoved his hands into the pockets of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cHow do we know she won\u2019t change her mind? How do we know she didn\u2019t have cold feet and take off from her husband?\u201d</p><p>Ethan started to protest but Adam silenced him with a look. He could see the uncertainty in Ryan\u2019s eyes, knew of anyone, Ryan would be the most distrustful.</p><p>A twinge of pain squeezed his chest. Would he ever know what Ryan had endured in Iraq? Sadness weighed heavy on his mind. God knows he and Ethan had tried to get Ryan to open up, but ever since his return a year ago, he hadn\u2019t uttered a word about the time he spent in captivity.</p><p>\u201cRyan, she needs us. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll be easy. Hell, she\u2019s married. She\u2019s scared to death, and she\u2019s confused over what she\u2019s feeling for us. All we can do is protect her and show her how very good it can be with us.\u201d</p><p>He turned to Ethan. \u201cShe trusts you. She\u2019s already established a bond with you. I think you should be her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not a piece of meat to decide over,\u201d Ryan said in disgust.</p><p>He turned and walked out of the bedroom before Adam could respond.</p><p>Ethan chuckled softly. \u201cHe\u2019s right, you know. You don\u2019t have to control everything, Adam. No need to orchestrate the entire act of sex. I think we can handle it on our own.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t respond. That wasn\u2019t what he meant, but maybe they were right. He was trying too damn hard. He rubbed a hand through his hair and massaged the back of his neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be out in the barn,\u201d Adam said. \u201cYou can see to Holly.\u201d</p><p>Truth was he needed some fresh air. Needed to think.</p><p>The water had grown tepid, and Holly wasn\u2019t going to wait on the men any longer. Hell, it wasn\u2019t as if she couldn\u2019t handle herself anyway. Yet, she sat docilely in the tub like an obedient stooge.</p><p>She stood up, water running down her body. She reached for a towel that hung on the rack beside the tub and began drying off.</p><p>\u201cLet me.\u201d</p><p>The towel slipped from her fingers as Ethan took it and began rubbing her back.</p><p>\u201cI can do it,\u201d she said, more sharply than she intended.</p><p>She reached for the towel, not liking the fact she stood naked before him.</p><p>He probed her with his stare for a second then let her have the towel back.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the living room if you want to join me,\u201d he said as he walked out of the bathroom.</p><p>She took her time, her mind a mass of confusion. She was seriously deluding herself if she thought it would be as easy as setting up a new life here with the three brothers. She knew nothing about them, had no idea what she would do here, and there was the little matter of her marriage to a vile, sadistic monster. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Oh, he hadn\u2019t shown himself for the asshole he was until their wedding night. She\u2019d been starry-eyed and all agog that he had chosen her to be his wife. She\u2019d quickly learned that behind his charming exterior lurked a controlling, abusive man.</p><p>Would things have been different if she hadn\u2019t witnessed him killing a man in cold blood on the day of their wedding? Probably not, after all, he\u2019d had no difficulty raising a hand to her. No regret, no emotion had crossed his face as she\u2019d laid there crying.</p><p>She shuddered and shook her head to rid herself of the memory. Never again would she put herself in such a position. If she remained here, it would be because she wanted to, not because Adam dictated it.</p><p>If she remained here. Was she contemplating? Really?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind,\u201d she muttered to her reflection in the mirror.</p><p>You want them as much as they want you. Maybe more.</p><p>Her nipples puckered as she imagined them making love to her. She felt an unbearable tightening in her groin. It spread throughout her pelvis, and her clit pulsed in reaction.</p><p>She may be a virgin, but she wasn\u2019t an idiot. She was as horny as a priest in the Playboy Mansion.</p><p>Rolling her eyes heavenward, she dressed and slipped out of the bathroom. She meandered down the hall and, for the first time since her arrival, took stock of her surroundings.</p><p>The cabin exuded masculinity. All the rooms were sparsely decorated in earth tones. The living room was dominated by the stone fireplace, and the glow spread warmth over the rustic wood floors. It was, she imagined, just as a cabin may have looked a hundred years ago.</p><p>Ethan sat at a desk several feet from the fireplace. He was concentrating on a computer screen and occasionally tapping on the keyboard. Did they have internet access here in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>She looked around for the others, but the house was silent. Taking a deep breath, she crossed the room until she stood behind Ethan.</p><p>\u201cEthan?\u201d she asked, damning how quivery her voice came out.</p><p>He swiveled around in his chair and looked inquisitively at her.</p><p>\u201cCan I ask you some questions?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied.</p><p>He stood up and tucked her hand in his then pulled her over to the couch.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get comfortable.\u201d</p><p>She sank down beside him, careful to keep a safe distance from him. One touch from him and she was likely to throw herself into his arms and beg him to make love to her.</p><p>She stared at him for a long time then gathered her courage around her. \u201cIs this for real?\u201d</p><p>His gaze softened, and he sat back as if realizing she needed the space.</p><p>\u201cThis must be difficult for you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She swallowed back what she wanted to say then hesitated. Holding back her emotions wasn\u2019t natural for her, as problematic as it may be. Something told her she could be honest with Ethan.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, but not in the way you\u2019d think.\u201d</p><p>She promptly blushed and looked away as she spoke.</p><p>He didn\u2019t prompt her to say more, he merely waited.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d she began again, trying to formulate her thoughts. \u201cHow can you all want me? I mean I can understand wanting me, wanting to have sex that is, but Adam said... He made it sound like you wanted me to stay.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded.</p><p>\u201cBut how? You don\u2019t know me. How can it be any more than lust at this point?\u201d</p><p>He smiled and reached over, curling his strong fingers over her palm. He picked up her hand then turned it over until her palm faced up. Bending his head, he pressed his lips to her skin.</p><p>She shivered in reaction, a chill racing straight up her arm.</p><p>\u201cLust? Oh yeah,\u201d he said, lowering her hand. \u201cBut it\u2019s more than that.\u201d</p><p>Her hand fell to the couch, but she wanted to press it back to his mouth. The curl of urgency between her thighs had her shifting to alleviate the discomfort.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me if we\u2019re in love with you,\u201d he began, \u201cwell, I can\u2019t speak for my brothers, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple. As you said, we don\u2019t really know you. But we recognize you. Does that make sense?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head wordlessly.</p><p>\u201cPut it this way. I recognize you as the woman I will fall in love with. Maybe I\u2019ve already started down the path. I won\u2019t know until we\u2019ve had more time to explore each other.\u201d He flashed a wicked grin at her. \u201cAnd explore, I plan to do.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, his simple honesty comforted her more than a declaration of undying love and devotion. She\u2019d gotten those from Mason, and they certainly hadn\u2019t done her any good.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>\u201cI want never to have gotten married,\u201d she blurted out, allowing her regret to pour out of her soul.</p><p>Tears stung her eyelids and she looked away.</p><p>\u201cAhh, doll.\u201d</p><p>He scooted forward and pulled her against his chest. He tilted her chin up until she looked him in the eye.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay married to the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Sadness swelled in her chest. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019ll let me go. I know...I know too much,\u201d she said.</p><p>He arched his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you know, doll?\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes. She needed to release the heavy burden she\u2019d been carrying for the last two weeks.</p><p>\u201cI saw him kill someone,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOn our wedding day.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s grip tightened around her.</p><p>\u201cHell.\u201d</p><p>She pushed away from him, gritting her teeth to keep the tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cYou see, that\u2019s why I can\u2019t stay here. He\u2019ll find me. He\u2019ll kill you. It\u2019s nothing to him.\u201d</p><p>Ethan released his breath then looked over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou hear everything?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She swiveled around until she saw Ryan leaning against the wall behind her.</p><p>Ryan nodded, his eyes glittering dangerously.</p><p>\u201cDid you email Cal?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>She looked back at Ethan in confusion.</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s Cal?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a lawyer,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Her eyes widened. She looked between the brothers, checking their expressions for something, some clue as to their intentions.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good friend of ours. He practices law in Denver. I emailed him about your situation. Asked him how best to proceed with terminating your marriage.\u201d</p><p>She stood up in agitation, shrugging off Ethan\u2019s hand.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t tell him where I am!\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo one\u2019s going to tell him where you are, doll.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to be rid of him?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>She looked up to see him studying her, probing her as if measuring her reaction. Her eyes narrowed. Did he think she wanted to stay married to Mason?</p><p>\u201cAfter what you heard, how can you doubt that?\u201d she asked, staring back at him just as intently.</p><p>They squared off, neither backing down as they burned holes through each other with their eyes.</p><p>He relaxed his stance then crooked his finger at her.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>It pissed her off that she found herself crossing the room to stand in front of him.</p><p>He pulled her roughly into his arms and melded his lips to hers.</p><p>She moaned low in her throat. God, he felt so damn good. She threaded her arms around his neck, and in that moment, she didn\u2019t give a damn what he thought about her. She wanted to rip his clothes off.</p><p>He sucked her bottom lip between his teeth and nipped erotically. He wasn\u2019t gentle, his touch was demanding. He slid his hands underneath her shirt, upward until he cupped her breasts in his palms.</p><p>She flinched when his thumbs flicked her nipples. She arched closer to him, wanting more.</p><p>Her breath came in ragged spurts as his mouth left hers. He burned a trail down her neck then sank his teeth in the curve of her shoulder.</p><p>She cried out, her legs collapsing beneath her.</p><p>Something caught her. Not something. Someone. She found herself rocked against two hard chests. One in front. One in back.</p><p>Gentle kisses rained where before Ryan\u2019s teeth had seared her skin. She leaned back, wanting more of Ethan\u2019s touch.</p><p>Ryan shoved her shirt upward, baring her breasts. He bent and sucked one nipple into his mouth. God, he was hot. No preamble with him. No teasing. He went for it. Hard and fast.</p><p>\u201cDo you want it?\u201d Ryan murmured.</p><p>Did she want it? If she didn\u2019t get it, she was going to kill someone.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t want this, now is the time to say so,\u201d Ethan said as he rocked her ass against his rock hard erection.</p><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t stop. Please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever let it be said I could refuse a lady,\u201d Ethan said, his voice thick with desire.</p><p>Ryan pulled the shirt the rest of the way from her body and tossed it on the floor. He hooked his finger in the waistband of her jeans and pulled her hard against him.</p><p>He devoured her mouth with his as he fumbled with the zipper. In a few seconds, he was shoving her pants impatiently down her hips.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got too many clothes on,\u201d she protested.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes flashed. \u201cIn the bedroom. Now.\u201d</p><p>She slipped past him and walked on shaky legs down the hallway toward Adam\u2019s bedroom. She was clad in only her panties, but for some reason, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to be the one to divest herself of that last barrier.</p><p>She turned around as Ryan and Ethan walked through the door. Ryan yanked his shirt from his jeans while Ethan slowly unbuttoned his.</p><p>Her eyes were drawn to Ryan\u2019s groin as he unbuttoned his jeans. He let his pants drop then pulled his cock from his underwear.</p><p>He was magnificent.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said, as he fisted his cock in his hand.</p><p>She knew what he wanted, didn\u2019t need further instructions. She went to him and knelt on the floor in front of him.</p><p>He grasped the back of her head and guided his cock into her mouth. He let out a harsh groan as he slid into her throat.</p><p>He smelled musky and wild, tasted exotic.</p><p>\u201cGoddamn,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She didn\u2019t wait for him to set the pace. She was eager to explore him on her own. She made light sucking noises as she took him deeper into her mouth.</p><p>He was big and hard. She couldn\u2019t take him all, but damned if she wasn\u2019t going to try.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hips rocked forward and he thrust with more urgency.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so damn good,\u201d he said.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s hand tangled in her hair, and she felt her head pulled away from Ryan only for Ethan\u2019s cock to replace Ryan\u2019s.</p><p>She opened her mouth obediently to accept his larger circumference, and he slid rapidly back and forth.</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck yeah,\u201d Ethan said in a tortured whisper.</p><p>She felt the light seep of fluid in the back of her throat. Tangy, slightly salty. She swallowed, expecting more, but he pulled away from her.</p><p>Ryan lifted her to her feet and walked her backwards to the bed. The backs of her knees pressed against the mattress, and he laid her back until her legs dangled from the bed.</p><p>He leaned over and pressed his lips to her belly just above the band of her underwear. Then he began pulling them down her legs, his lips burning a trail in the same direction.</p><p>When she was free from the panties, he tossed them over his shoulder and nudged her knees apart. He knelt between her legs and ran a finger over the soft folds of her pussy.</p><p>She jerked in reaction. God, she was wet. Her clit hummed, waiting for him to touch her there.</p><p>He spread her wider then teased her entrance with one finger, two fingers. Then he bent his head and flicked his tongue over her clit.</p><p>She nearly shot off the bed. Ethan gently pushed her back down. The mattress sank under his weight as he sat down beside her and began rolling the tips of her breasts between his fingers.</p><p>Ryan swirled his tongue around her tight button then lapped downward to her opening.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s mouth closed over her nipple. Then her other. She closed her eyes and opened her mouth in a silent scream.</p><p>Ryan slipped a finger inside her, then two. He slid them back and forth as he sucked her clit into his mouth.</p><p>Her entire body tightened, jerked, then the world exploded around her. She lost the battle to remain silent, and she cried out as her orgasm racked her body.</p><p>She felt a gush of wetness between her legs, but still Ryan continued tormenting her with his mouth. Ethan sucked one nipple and pinched the other with his hand. Unbelievably, she felt the slow crawl of her release build again. Not again. She couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Suddenly Ryan pulled away, and she felt her legs spread unbelievably wide. Ethan moved his lips to capture hers in a breathless kiss.</p><p>\u201cRelax, doll,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>And she knew what was coming. Craved it, wanted it more than anything.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s cock nudged her entrance then in one firm push, he slid all the way in.</p><p>Her eyes flew open at the myriad of sensations accosting her. Pain, incredible pleasure, longing, want, need. She needed badly.</p><p>He remained still for a moment as her body adjusted to his invasion. He was big. He wasn\u2019t all the way in. Could he fit?</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hold on anymore,\u201d Ryan said through tightly compressed teeth. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He pulled back then surged forward, more powerfully than before. She gripped Ethan\u2019s head, yanking him down to her mouth. He held her tightly as Ryan began thrusting between her legs.</p><p>She\u2019d never felt anything like this before. Ryan leaned forward and jerked his hips powerfully.</p><p>\u201cOh!\u201d she exclaimed as he seated himself fully within her. She could feel his balls nestled against her ass.</p><p>\u201cAm I hurting you?\u201d Ryan gritted out.</p><p>\u201cGod no, don\u2019t stop,\u201d she pleaded.</p><p>Her words seemed to shove him right over the edge. He began tunneling into her, his hands gripping her hips.</p><p>In her haze, she registered another presence. Adam. The bed dipped again.</p><p>\u201cIt would appear I\u2019m missing all the fun.\u201d His deep voice washed over her, nearly sending her over the edge.</p><p>Adam put a hand behind her neck and pulled her head up far enough that he could slide his cock into her mouth.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sucked him deep within, in matching rhythm to Ryan\u2019s thrusts.</p><p>Adam gripped her head tightly and thrust hard, not allowing her to control the tempo. He paused to let her catch her breath then began stroking to the back of her throat.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s mouth closed over her nipple once more, his teeth grazing the sensitive tip. Then he sucked it into his mouth, and she nearly lost all sense of time and place.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t think, she could only react. She could feel Ryan\u2019s urgency mount, and he shook the entire bed with the force of his thrusts. Then he tightened between her legs, and she felt the hot jets of his release.</p><p>She whimpered in protest. She wasn\u2019t ready yet. She was close, so close. She didn\u2019t want Ryan to stop.</p><p>Adam slid all the way out of her mouth and paused a moment. Then he curled his hands into her hair and thrust all the way into her mouth, his cock sliding down her throat. His balls rested on her chin, and he kept her still, allowing himself to fill her mouth completely.</p><p>Ryan pulled out, and she felt the loss keenly. Adam withdrew and began pumping in and out of her mouth. He was close to his release, she could tell. He\u2019d tightened, swelled, become even harder in her mouth.</p><p>Precum filled the back of her mouth, and she swallowed quickly as he thrust faster.</p><p>The bed dipped and her legs wobbled and fell as Ryan left her. Before she could utter any sound of regret, her legs were spread wide once more.</p><p>Ethan slid into her. She moaned around Adam\u2019s cock. Ethan felt so different yet every bit as good as Ryan had felt.</p><p>Ethan began a slow in and out motion, gentle, deep.</p><p>She gagged slightly as Adam\u2019s hand gripped her neck tighter and he surged forward again.</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby, I\u2019m coming, get ready.\u201d</p><p>The wet sounds of her sucking filled the room as he fisted his cock in his other hand and forced himself deeper.</p> <p>Hot liquid filled her mouth, jetted against the back of her throat and spilled down her chin. She swallowed as fast as she could but it kept coming. He thrust one more time and held it deep, holding her against him as he finished in the back of her throat.</p><p>Slowly he let her head down until she was flat against the mattress again. She opened her eyes to see him staring down at her, desire and approval in his eyes.</p><p>He lowered his hand to caress her breasts, feathering his fingers across her taut nipples.</p><p>Ryan took the position vacated by Ethan, and he turned her head toward him. He was already hard again. He slid his cock into her mouth and groaned. He was surprisingly gentle, much more so than when he\u2019d fucked her.</p><p>Ethan stroked between her legs, the soft smacking noise of flesh meeting flesh filling the air. He pressed a thumb to her clit as he thrust deeper, and she began to squirm restlessly as her orgasm built, fanned out of control.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s cock in her mouth, Adam\u2019s hands on her breasts, Ethan deep within her pussy, it was all too much. She\u2019d held on as long as she could.</p><p>As Ryan filled her mouth with his cum, Ethan sank deeply inside her and poured himself into her. She bucked wildly beneath them, spasms rocking her body.</p><p>Ethan slipped from her and leaned heavily on her belly, his breath coming in ragged bursts. Ryan eased his cock from her mouth then gathered her in his arms.</p><p>She closed her eyes and sucked in deep mouthfuls of air, trying desperately to calm her raging senses. She shook from head to toe from the force of her orgasm. In short, she felt like jelly.</p><p>She felt her legs lifted then separated. A hard cock slid into her, and she moaned. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. She couldn\u2019t take another orgasm like she\u2019d just experienced. It would kill her.</p><p>Adam chuckled, the sound husky and erotic to her ears. It was the laugh of a predator. One who knew he had his prey right where he wanted.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, baby. You can. Just lay back and feel.\u201d</p><p>She was impossibly sore, and yet as he pushed into her, lapped her legs over his shoulders, she felt her body react.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it, baby.\u201d</p><p>Ryan and Ethan ran their hands soothingly over her body, feathering over her soft belly, her ribcage, then to her breasts. Both dark heads dipped and sucked at her nipples, lavishing them with attention.</p><p>Her body shuddered as Adam drove powerfully into her. He was so hard, so big.</p><p>He withdrew and she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cTurn over,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>Ethan and Ryan helped her turn over, their hands warm and comforting.</p><p>\u201cUp on your knees,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She shook in reaction. Was he going to take her from behind? This was by far the more erotic of her fantasies. The thing she\u2019d wanted to try most. It was the one position guaranteed to turn her on.</p><p>He gripped her hips in his strong hands and with his thumbs spread her buttocks until she felt cool air wash over her ass and pussy.</p><p>He ran a finger over the seam of her ass, pausing at her back entrance.</p><p>She flinched and tightened reflexively. Surely he wasn\u2019t going to...</p><p>He chuckled again as if reading her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, baby. But soon. Very soon.\u201d</p><p>Chills dotted her entire body at the idea of him fucking her ass. Would it feel as good as she imagined? Or would it be one of those things better left in fantasy and not in reality?</p><p>She didn\u2019t know, but she wanted to find out.</p><p>He positioned himself behind her then surged forward, nearly rocking her off her knees.</p><p>She screamed as a wave of pleasure, so sharp, raced over her. He was so deep. Deeper than she imagined he could go. He rocked forward, setting an insane pace, driving her forward. The slap of his thighs against her ass ricocheted through the room, the sound incredibly erotic to her ears.</p><p>Ethan knelt on the bed and positioned himself in front of her. His cock stood erect mere centimeters from her mouth. She opened her mouth obediently and he thrust inside.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s lips slid across her back making her shiver. His hands curled around to tweak and pinch at her nipples.</p><p>\u201cYou like this?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She nodded, unable to speak around Ethan\u2019s cock shoving impatiently into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cImagine how it will be when you are taking all three of us,\u201d he continued, his voice raspy with lust. \u201cWould you like that? Adam in your ass, me in your pussy, Ethan in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and bucked in reaction to his provocative words.</p><p>Adam thrust harder in response, making her cry out.</p><p>\u201cI think I want to fuck you again,\u201d Ryan whispered. \u201cWould you like that?\u201d</p><p>She let Ethan\u2019s cock slide out of her mouth long enough to shout yes before Ethan reclaimed her lips.</p><p>Adam withdrew, but he hadn\u2019t come yet. Ryan took his place and slid his hard cock into her quivering pussy.</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, you feel so damn good,\u201d Ryan said with a groan.</p><p>He fucked in and out, his fingers digging into her hips as Ethan continued his assault on her mouth. Never had she felt so powerful, so desirable and so in control of her own destiny. She reveled in it, giving as good as she was getting.</p><p>Ryan stopped all too soon, but Adam was there to take his place. They began taking turns, driving her up the peak to her release only to stop before she catapulted over the top.</p><p>Three, four, five thrusts, then another would take his place.</p><p>She sucked Ethan\u2019s cock with all the intensity of her raging desire. She wanted to come damn it. She needed to come.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming, doll,\u201d Ethan said hoarsely.</p><p>He shot into her throat, thrusting forcefully. She swallowed as she bucked back into the cock impaled in her pussy.</p><p>Finally she felt Adam tighten against her ass. She raised up on her hands as high as she could and pushed back against him. He gripped her shoulders with his hands, pulling her back as hard as he could.</p><p>He shot cum into her pussy until she felt it run down the inside of her thigh, but still she hadn\u2019t found her release.</p><p>He pulled out and Ryan quickly grabbed her hips and plunged into her. The fire in her pussy burned out of control. It ballooned into her pelvis, into her stomach, tightened her legs until she feared she would collapse.</p><p>He fucked her harder, knowing what she needed.</p><p>She closed her eyes and screamed as his hard thighs slammed against her ass. He reached underneath and pressed his fingers to her clit.</p><p>Black spots filled her vision. The world blurred around her. Her pussy felt as though it exploded as her orgasm finally burned over her.</p><p>Behind her, Ryan cried out. He thrust forward and convulsed against her.</p><p>She collapsed forward, no longer able to bear her weight with her hands. Ryan came with her, his big body covering hers, his cock still buried deeply within her.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t catch her breath fast enough. She panted as the aftershocks rocked her limp body. Then she simply blacked out.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Holly opened her eyes and blinked to adjust to the darkness. Her body was cocooned in warmth, and she let out a drowsy yawn.</p><p>She was curled against Adam\u2019s chest, his arms wrapped around her. A bare back pressed into hers, and she glanced over her shoulder, trying to see if it was Ethan or Ryan.</p><p>Best she could make out, it was Ethan. She frowned. Where was Ryan?</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>She ducked her head shyly, glad he couldn\u2019t see her well in the darkness.</p><p>His arms tightened around her and he tucked her head under his chin.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>She nodded against his chest. She was better than all right. She\u2019d never felt righter in her life.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into his chest, loving how safe she felt in his arms. She turned up her face so that her lips were in the direction of his ear.</p><p>\u201cWhere is Ryan?\u201d</p><p>Adam stiffened slightly but continued to rub his hand up and down her back.</p><p>\u201cHe went to his room,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned back on his pillow, taking her with him so her head was cushioned on his arm. He stared up at the ceiling.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t sleep well. He has nightmares, and he doesn\u2019t want us to hear.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned. She knew she\u2019d seen torment in Ryan\u2019s eyes, but what could be so bad that even his sleep would be haunted?</p><p>\u201cRyan got back from Iraq a little less than a year ago. He was Special Forces, got captured behind enemy lines. He was a POW for several weeks before our men got in to rescue him. He hasn\u2019t been the same since.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked in horror, afraid to know what he might have endured.</p><p>Adam sighed. \u201cI wish I knew. He won\u2019t talk about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you two shut up so I can sleep?\u201d Ethan complained, his voice muffled by his pillow.</p><p>She grinned and elbowed him in the side.</p><p>How natural it felt to be in bed with these two men, comfortable, easy, no awkwardness.</p><p>Ethan rolled over and slid his hand up over her breast.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to see we didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cBut what a way to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome snuggle me. Adam\u2019s gotten you the entire night,\u201d Ethan groused.</p><p>She giggled but curled into his arms and laid her head on his chest.</p><p>\u201cNow shut up and go back to sleep,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She closed her eyes, marveling at how truly happy she felt.</p><p>When Holly woke again, sunlight streamed through the window, nearly blinding her as she cracked her eyes open. She was alone in the bed, a fact she found disappointing.</p><p>A quick glance at the bedside clock told her why she was alone. It was nearly nine.</p><p>She stretched, testing the limits of her body. She felt sore, but unbelievably content. She swung her legs over the side of the bed, groaning a little when her muscles protested.</p><p>She started to grab the sheet to cover herself then laughed at the absurdity of that notion. Instead, she padded nude across the floor to the bathroom. The idea of a long, hot bath sounded like heaven.</p><p>She started the water running, and soon steam filled the large bathroom. When there were several inches of water in the bottom, she stepped in, sighing as the hot water lapped over her.</p><p>She leaned back in the tub and closed her eyes, allowing the water to rise around her. Images from the previous night filled her mind. Her body tingled, her thighs clenched, her nipples tightened in response.</p><p>It was the single most fantastic experience of her life. If she didn\u2019t remain with the brothers, what could she possibly look forward to in the sex department? It wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d find someone else to satisfy her as they had. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>And there was the fact that she had no desire to leave. She was tired of running, tired of living in fear, but could she trust that she would be safe here? What if she brought Mason to their doorstep?</p><p>Her conversation with Ethan the day before wavered in her mind. The truth was, she could see herself falling in love with them too. Maybe she wasn\u2019t yet. Maybe she was on her way much like Ethan had said.</p><p>She sighed. She should be happy. Instead, she was filled with dread.</p><p>She shook her head, not wanting to get mired down in the muck of her reality. Reaching for the soap, she lathered her body and quickly rinsed. When she was done, she stepped from the water and wrapped a towel around her.</p> <p>She went in search of her clothes, unsure of where Ryan and Ethan had put them after their shopping trip yesterday. Her stomach clenched. Had it only been yesterday that she had seen Mason in town?</p><p>Sweat broke out on her brow as sudden realization hit her. He was but a few miles away.</p><p>She sank onto the bed, her breath coming in painful wheezes. It was a full-scale panic attack.</p><p>\u201cHolly? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>She looked up to see Ethan standing in the doorway, a look of concern marring his face.</p> <p>He hurried over and knelt in front of her. He gently pried her hands apart and curled his fingers around hers.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it, doll?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason\u2019s here,\u201d she croaked. \u201cHe\u2019ll find me.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her chin in his hand and forced her to look at him. \u201cGet dressed and come into the living room. We\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ve come up with.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, daring to hope that maybe they could keep her safe and that she wouldn\u2019t be the cause of their death.</p><p>He stood and kissed the top of her head. \u201cYour clothes are in the top drawer.\u201d</p> <p>He walked out, leaving her alone to dress.</p><p>She rummaged through the drawer and pulled out a shirt and a pair of jeans. To her surprise, she found a package of white cotton underwear and two bras in her size. Ryan must have picked them up at the western store when he was choosing her boots.</p><p>She hurriedly dressed and headed for the living room. She paused at the doorway enjoying the sight of the three men. Ryan was sprawled on the couch, beer in hand. Ethan sat at the computer, aimlessly clicking the mouse. Adam stood by the fire, his stance one of impatience.</p><p>Adam looked up and saw her, his eyes smoldering much like the flames in the hearth.</p><p>Her confidence deserted her. She had the insane urge to turn tail and run back into the bedroom where it was safe. She took one step back, crossing her arms protectively over her chest.</p><p>Adam frowned but didn\u2019t move. Ryan looked up from the couch and waggled one finger at her from around his beer bottle.</p><p>Ethan rose and crossed the room, holding out his hand to her.</p><p>\u201cCome on over. We\u2019ve got a lot to discuss,\u201d he said as he pulled her further into the living room.</p> <p>She eased down onto the couch, inches from Ryan\u2019s outstretched feet. She sensed this was the point of no return. They wanted her to stay, and she would have to decide whether to listen to her heart or do everything in her power to keep them from harm.</p><p>The weight of the decision pressed down on her like a sandbag.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to talk,\u201d Adam said. He shoved his hands into his pockets and propped the heel of one boot on the hearth behind him.</p><p>She glanced at Ethan and Ryan, gauging their reaction. Ethan looked attentive. Ryan\u2019s eyes were guarded. No emotion shone on his face.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve talked to Cal Davis, a lawyer friend of ours in Denver. He can file the necessary papers for your divorce,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Her heart sped up, thumping painfully in her chest. She opened her mouth to speak, but her mouth went dry.</p><p>To her surprise, Ryan swung around, planting his feet on the floor. He reached over and tucked her hand in his. The gesture comforted her.</p><p>She glanced at him, trying to get a read on his thoughts. Did he still think she didn\u2019t want to be free of her husband? After everything that had happened last night?</p><p>He stared back at her, not budging in the least. He was stubborn. Well, so was she. She glared defiantly at him, daring him to voice his doubts.</p><p>A reluctant smile tugged at his lips.</p><p>\u201cWell, Holly,\u201d he said lazily. \u201cWhat\u2019s it going to be? Asshole husband or take a chance on three men who\u2019ll do everything they can to take care of you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d she said angrily.</p><p>Ryan tipped a finger under her chin and stared directly into her eyes. \u201cYes. It is.\u201d</p><p>She stood up, wrapping her arms around her waist. \u201cI\u2014I care a lot about you. All of you,\u201d she said, sweeping an arm out to encompass all three men. \u201cDon\u2019t you see? I couldn\u2019t bear it if something happened to any of you because of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, listen to me,\u201d Adam said, turning her to face him. \u201cIf you believe nothing else of us, believe this. We will not let that bastard get to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not me I\u2019m worried about!\u201d</p><p>She wanted to scream in frustration. Why couldn\u2019t they understand?</p><p>\u201cWe told you we\u2019d take care of you,\u201d Ryan said calmly. \u201cIf something happened to us, we couldn\u2019t take care of you. Therefore, by making you the promise that we\u2019ll protect you, you can be damned sure no pencil-necked bastard is going to touch us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do have a way with words,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>The absolute conviction in Ryan\u2019s voice made her pause.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, do you have that kind of faith in us?\u201d Ryan said, raising his brow questioningly at her.</p><p>He\u2019d turned it back on her. If she persisted with her protests, she would be demonstrating a lack of faith in them. Damn it. What was she supposed to do?</p><p>Adam caught her waist and pulled her against his chest. \u201cAnswer one question. If there was no Mason. If you weren\u2019t married. Would you stay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded before she thought better of her response.</p><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s settled,\u201d Adam said, satisfaction glimmering in his eyes. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell Cal to proceed with the divorce action, and we\u2019ll come up with a plan to make sure the bastard doesn\u2019t come within a square mile of you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to protest but he shushed her with his finger.</p><p>\u201cTrust us, baby.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. The thing was, she did trust them. It was insane. She\u2019d only known them a few days, and yet she trusted them more than she\u2019d ever trusted another living soul.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>Adam bent his head and kissed her hungrily. His hand shoved into her hair and kneaded the back of her neck as his tongue delved into her mouth.</p><p>When he pulled away, she was breathless.</p><p>\u201cWell, I must say, this is a surprise,\u201d a feminine voice drawled.</p><p>Holly whirled around to see a tall redhead in a cowboy hat and wearing a badge.</p><p>Adam swore. \u201cDamn it, Lacey, don\u2019t you know how to knock?</p><p>Chapter Eight</p><p>Ryan grasped Holly\u2019s wrist and shoved her behind him. His face darkened into a thundercloud, and Adam stepped forward in an effort to defuse a potentially explosive situation. He knew Ryan didn\u2019t like Lacey at all, and if she posed a threat to Holly, Adam wasn\u2019t sure what Ryan would do.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here, and what do you want?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>Lacey raised a brow in surprise at his vehemence.</p><p>\u201cThe question is what is she doing here?\u201d Lacey said with a nod in Holly\u2019s direction. \u201cUnless I\u2019m mistaken, she bears an uncanny resemblance to the woman on a missing person\u2019s report lying on my desk.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, fuck, fuck. Why did Lacey have to show up now of all times?</p><p>\u201cHer husband claims she was abducted,\u201d Lacey continued. \u201cWhat does the lady have to say about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t kidnapped,\u201d Holly said hotly.</p><p>Ryan shoved her back behind him and glared harder at Lacey.</p><p>\u201cAs you can see, she\u2019s perfectly fine,\u201d Ryan said icily. \u201cI\u2019m sure your services are required elsewhere. They aren\u2019t here.\u201d</p><p>Lacey flinched. \u201cYou never did like me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the point. The point is I have a worried husband searching for his missing wife. Now if she\u2019s here of her own free will, that\u2019s her business, but I need her to come to the station with me and give me a statement. Away from any undue influence,\u201d she said looking pointedly at the three brothers.</p><p>\u201cOver my dead body,\u201d Adam growled.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going anywhere near her bastard husband,\u201d Ethan spoke up.</p><p>Lacey sighed and moved her hand to rest on her hip, mere inches from her gun. \u201cYou guys aren\u2019t going to make this easy I see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Holly said softly, moving in front of Ryan.</p><p>Adam\u2019s chest clenched at the blatant fear in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo, baby. You\u2019re not going.\u201d</p><p>She turned troubled eyes on him. \u201cI won\u2019t cause you any trouble. I\u2019ll go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck that,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cLacey can take your damn statement here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on here, but I need to hear Mrs. Bardwell\u2019s version. One that isn\u2019t colored by three huge-ass men glowering over her shoulder. She\u2019ll need to come with me. Don\u2019t make me force the issue, Adam. You know I don\u2019t want to have to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is your problem, Lacey?\u201d Ethan interjected, surprising Adam with the anger in his voice.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing my job,\u201d she said in an even voice. \u201cYou lied to me when I asked if you\u2019d seen her. I have a very important man raising all sorts of hell in my town looking for his missing wife. His new wife I might add. Now I find her here. She looks frightened out of her mind, so you\u2019ll have to excuse me if I want to hear from her own mouth what the hell is going on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not us she\u2019s frightened of,\u201d Ryan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cFine, then she can come with me and explain,\u201d Lacey said.</p><p>Holly sucked in her breath, trying valiantly not to panic. She couldn\u2019t allow the brothers to get into trouble because they were protecting her. And it was time she stood up for herself. Adam had said his friend could handle her divorce. She would have to go with this Lacey person and explain as much as she dared. Otherwise all hell might break loose.</p><p>She moved toward the tall woman, determined not to be intimidated. Ryan caught at her arm and tried to drag her back.</p><p>She turned to him, trying to keep the fear from her eyes. \u201cI have to do this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t. This is something I have to do.\u201d</p><p>Uncertainty flashed in Ryan\u2019s eyes, and for a brief moment, she could swear she saw fear. Then his expression hardened into an impenetrable mask.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Ethan broke in.</p><p>\u201cHer husband goes nowhere near her,\u201d Adam bit out. \u201cYou hear me, Lacey? You get your damn statement, but you keep that bastard away from her. I\u2019m charging you with her safety.\u201d</p><p>Holly shivered at the hardness in his voice. Lacey blanched but nodded.</p><p>Hand on her holster, Lacey dipped her head toward the door. \u201cAfter you, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Holly turned to look at the three brothers, a sudden surge of uncertainty gripping her. She didn\u2019t want to leave the safe haven she\u2019d found here.</p><p>Before she could follow Lacey, Adam stepped forward and hauled her against him. His lips found hers, pressing hungrily against her as if infusing his strength into her.</p><p>Lacey cleared her throat by the door, and Holly turned to leave. She stepped into the cold and shivered. She hadn\u2019t thought to get her coat.</p><p>She trekked to the Jeep Cherokee, her boots crunching in the snow. Lacey gestured toward the passenger seat before stalking around to the driver\u2019s side.</p><p>Holly slid into the warm interior, grateful Lacey had left the engine running. She glanced out the window as Lacey backed out of the drive, a knot swelling in her throat as they drifted further away from the cabin.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t just let her go!\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Ryan stood where Holly had left him, staring broodingly at the door.</p><p>Adam scrubbed a hand through his hair and wondered what the hell they had done. \u201cI don\u2019t trust that bastard as far as I could throw him. I vote we ride into town and keep an eye on things. If she needs us, we\u2019ll be a lot more use than if we sit here on our fucking hands.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded his agreement.</p><p>Adam looked at Ryan who still hadn\u2019t moved. \u201cYou coming, bro?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe left,\u201d he said in a strained voice. \u201cHow do we know she\u2019ll want to come back?\u201d</p><p>Even as the statement angered Adam, he knew Ryan was voicing his fears.</p><p>\u201cShe left to protect us,\u201d Ethan snarled. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to protect her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re wasting time,\u201d Adam said. He had no desire to mediate a fight between his younger siblings. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Holly and Lacey rode into town in silence. As Lacey pulled up to the small wooden building that housed the sheriff\u2019s department, Holly stiffened. Her heart began to thunder. Mason\u2019s BMW was parked a few feet away.</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t say he would be here,\u201d she said, turning her furious gaze on Lacey.</p><p>Lacey shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s your husband. Where else would he be? He\u2019s been worried sick about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know nothing about my husband,\u201d Holly spat.</p> <p>Lacey sized her up in a quick glance. \u201cLook, he says you were kidnapped. If you weren\u2019t, fine. Just come inside, sign a statement and you can be on your way.\u201d</p><p>Holly fumbled with the door, her hands shaking. She stepped onto the icy pavement and waited for Lacey to precede her into the station.</p><p>At the doorway, she wiped her sweaty palms down the legs of her jeans. She would find courage. She would. She could do this. Mason couldn\u2019t hurt her in front of a witness, and she wouldn\u2019t go with him, no matter what. This was her chance to be rid of him.</p><p>\u201cDarling! There you are!\u201d</p><p>She cringed as Mason\u2019s voice echoed across the room. Just as quickly she found herself yanked into his arms. She pulled away, putting as much distance as she could between them.</p> <p>Mason turned to Lacey. \u201cThank you so much for returning my wife to me. If you don\u2019t mind, we\u2019ll be on our way. I want to make sure she hasn\u2019t been harmed in any way.\u201d</p><p>Holly gasped. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with you.\u201d</p><p>Mason rounded on her, his back to Lacey. His eyes glittered dangerously. \u201cI realize what an ordeal you\u2019ve been through, my love. I\u2019ll take you far away from this shit hole.\u201d</p><p>Holly backed away, looking to Lacey for help.</p><p>Lacey cleared her throat. \u201cMr. Bardwell, your wife claims she wasn\u2019t abducted. She\u2019s here of her own free will and apparently has no wish to leave.\u201d</p><p>Mason whirled back around but Holly could see he donned his most charming smile. \u201cI appreciate your concern for my wife, but this is a private matter best resolved between us. Perhaps we could have a moment of privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d Holly cried.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s impossible, Mr. Bardwell. Unless that is what Mrs. Bardwell wishes?\u201d</p><p>She looked to Holly for confirmation.</p><p>Holly shook her head vehemently. \u201cYou said all I had to do was sign a statement. I won\u2019t go with him.\u201d</p><p>Mason reached out and grasped her arm in a bruising grip. His fingers dug painfully into her upper arm, and she gasped in pain. \u201cI\u2019ve arranged a flight out of Denver. We must be on our way soon if we\u2019re to catch it.\u201d</p><p>She stared over at Lacey who looked a little flustered. \u201cCan we have a moment? Two minutes. If I\u2019m not outside that door in two minutes, come in for me.\u201d</p><p>Lacey arched a brow in surprise but nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll be outside.\u201d She pinned Mason with a hard stare. \u201cDon\u2019t try anything stupid, Mr. Bardwell.\u201d</p><p>As soon as Lacey disappeared through the door, Holly wrenched her arm free and backed hastily away from Mason.</p> <p>\u201cStay the hell away from me,\u201d she hissed. \u201cI\u2019m never going back with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t remember what happens when you defy me,\u201d he said, his voice carrying a heavy warning.</p><p>She jerked her chin up, determined not to show him the horrible fear that ate at her. Instead, she took a huge gamble.</p><p>\u201cI know what you did on our wedding day,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI saw you kill that man.\u201d</p><p>Mason\u2019s lips compressed in a fine white line. \u201cDon\u2019t threaten me, Holly. I\u2019ll make you sorry you were ever born.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you threaten me!\u201d she countered. \u201cI am going to file for divorce, Mason, and you are going to give me that divorce or I swear to God, I\u2019ll go to the media, the police, the FBI, whoever I have to go to in order to tell the world what a sorry bastard you are.\u201d</p><p>Mason\u2019s eyes flared in surprise. \u201cYou little blackmailing bitch.\u201d</p><p>She clenched her teeth. \u201cI am going to walk out of here, and I\u2019m never going back with you. If you ever come near me again, if you ever so much as breathe my name, I\u2019ll make sure you rot in prison.\u201d</p><p>Surprise flickered in Mason\u2019s eyes. He\u2019d underestimated her. She could read it in his expression. Well, that was fine. But she\u2019d make damn sure he didn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>The door opened and Lacey walked back in. \u201cEverything okay in here?\u201d She eyed Holly as she spoke.</p><p>\u201cI was just leaving,\u201d Mason said, anger coloring his voice. \u201cApparently a mistake has been made.\u201d</p><p>He stalked by Lacey and slammed the door behind him.</p><p>A buzzing started in Holly\u2019s ears, and she felt dangerously close to fainting.</p><p>\u201cHere,\u201d Lacey said, shoving a chair at her. \u201cMaybe you ought to sit down.\u201d</p><p>Holly sank into the chair, her hands curled into fists in her lap. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d faced Mason and stood up to him. Now she just wanted to get back to Adam, Ethan and Ryan.</p><p>\u201cCan I use your phone?\u201d Holly asked hoarsely.</p><p>Lacey gestured toward the desk. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>Holly rose and walked over to the desk then realized she didn\u2019t even know the phone number to the cabin. Her cheeks flaming, she looked up at Lacey. \u201cDo you know Adam\u2019s phone number?\u201d</p><p>Lacey rattled off the number with a familiarity that bothered Holly.</p><p>She punched the numbers and waited anxiously as it rang. After ten rings, she gently replaced the receiver, her chest tightening in worry.</p><p>\u201cYou could try the cell phone,\u201d Lacey said dryly.</p><p>Heat raced across Holly\u2019s face again, but she picked up the phone and looked expectantly at Lacey. After punching in the series of numbers Lacey once again supplied, she raised the phone to her ear and waited.</p><p>The brothers were nearly to town when Adam\u2019s cell phone rang. Adam snatched it up and barked a hello.</p><p>\u201cAdam?\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s soft voice filtered over the line.</p><p>\u201cBaby, are you all right?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>\u201cCan you...can you come get me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m at the sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d she replied.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in five minutes,\u201d he promised. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said, her voice stronger than before.</p><p>\u201cHang tight, baby. We\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>He hung up and tossed the phone aside. He had a dozen questions he\u2019d wanted to ask, but his priority was getting to Holly as fast as he could.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Ethan demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe wants us to come get her at the sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Adam replied.</p><p>He glanced at Ryan in his rearview mirror and saw relief flash across his brother\u2019s face.</p><p>They roared into town and down the street toward the sheriff\u2019s office. Adam frowned when a BMW nearly took off the front end of the Land Rover.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Ethan swore. \u201cThat\u2019s her husband.\u201d</p><p>Adam slammed on the brakes, opening the door before the Land Rover came to a complete stop. Had the bastard taken her? Had Lacey let him walk out with her?</p><p>The brothers hit the pavement running.</p><p>Adam was first to the door and flung it open, scanning the interior for Holly. Tension left him when he saw her huddled behind a desk. She looked up and, with a small cry, launched herself across the room and into his arms.</p><p>She hit him square in the chest, and he caught her up in his arms.</p><p>\u201cThank God you\u2019re all right,\u201d he said in a low voice.</p><p>She clung to him tightly, her face buried in his neck.</p><p>\u201cI did it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI told him I wanted a divorce.\u201d</p><p>Adam stroked her hair and kissed her temple, all the while satisfaction humming through his veins. Reluctantly, he set her down. Just as quickly, Ethan folded her up in his arms, holding on as tight to her as Adam had. Ethan kissed her lingeringly, his relief over her safety evident.</p><p>Across the room, Lacey\u2019s mouth fell open. Then her eyes widened in understanding. Adam knew the realization had hit her.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she said faintly. \u201cIt was never me. It was them.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. He ran a hand through his hair and walked a few steps closer to Lacey.</p><p>\u201cI made a mistake,\u201d he said honestly. \u201cYou\u2019re a good woman, Lacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot good enough apparently,\u201d she said bitterly.</p><p>Adam sighed. He hadn\u2019t wanted this scene between them and especially not in front of Holly. Once he\u2019d been attracted to Lacey, even thought his brothers might feel the same, but they hadn\u2019t. Ethan had reacted indifferently to her, and Ryan had instantly disliked her. He knew then it would never work between them, but it hadn\u2019t stopped him from spending time with her on occasion. She\u2019d been good company and someone to have a beer with. But she wasn\u2019t the one destined to occupy a place in his heart. That was reserved for Holly.</p><p>He gazed at the hurt he saw in Lacey\u2019s eyes and wished he wasn\u2019t the cause of it.</p><p>\u201cWe should be going,\u201d Ryan said, speaking up for the first time. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to snow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need her to sign that statement,\u201d Lacey said flatly. \u201cThen y\u2019all can be on your way.\u201d</p><p>She rummaged around on her desk for a moment then flipped a piece of paper and a pen to the end. Holly approached and looked down at the blank paper.</p><p>\u201cWhat should I say?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cWhatever\u2019s on your mind,\u201d Lacey drawled. \u201cI\u2019m married but don\u2019t want to be. Or maybe, I\u2019m fucking with the minds of four men.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cJust make it quick. I\u2019ve got work to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Lacey,\u201d Adam said, his voice harsher than he intended.</p><p>Holly scribbled three lines then signed her name with a flourish. She flicked the pen back across the desk at Lacey then turned away. She walked toward the door where Ryan and Ethan still stood, her intention clear. She was ready to go.</p><p>\u201cLet me get your coat,\u201d Ryan said gruffly. \u201cYou forgot to bring it.\u201d</p><p>He ducked out of the office and was back within thirty seconds carrying Holly\u2019s coat. He helped her into it then wrapped his arm protectively around her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m taking her out to the Rover.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded and watched as Ethan followed them outside. He turned back to Lacey, his lips pulled thin.</p><p>\u201cI understand you\u2019re upset, but that\u2019s no reason to be a bitch to Holly.\u201d</p><p>Lacey\u2019s cheeks flamed at his reprimand.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you ever tell me they had to accept me too?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cBecause they didn\u2019t,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>\u201cSo I never had a chance.\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Her fingers curled into fists at her sides. \u201cWell then, there isn\u2019t much more to say is there? Have a nice life with your helpless little doll.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s eyelids narrowed at her insult, but he refused to be baited into further argument. Holly waited for him to take her home. And that was all that mattered.</p><p>He turned and walked away.</p><p>Chapter Nine</p><p>Holly slid into the backseat with Ryan while Ethan got into the front. Despite the warmth of her coat, she shivered. Mostly in reaction to the last hour.</p><p>Beside her, Ryan shrugged out of his coat leaving him in a t-shirt that stretched tightly across his muscled chest and shoulders.</p><p>She wanted nothing more than to burrow into that chest, but she hesitated. She still wasn\u2019t sure where she stood with Ryan. He seemed to have a lot of mistrust regarding her. So she focused her attention out the window and waited for Adam to come out.</p><p>She would have to be a fool not to notice the sparks between Adam and Lacey, and that bothered her. Bothered her a lot. Had they been lovers? There was more than idle interest burning in the redhead\u2019s eyes. And then there was her comment about Ethan and Ryan which led Holly to believe Adam had wanted Lacey but his brothers hadn\u2019t.</p><p>She frowned and closed her eyes. She was tired and mentally exhausted, and she didn\u2019t like to dwell on the burning jealousy in her gut.</p><p>She barely registered the door opening and closing as Adam got in. He turned to look at her, but she didn\u2019t meet his gaze, wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to see what was there. She was feeling way too insecure to try and figure out what the hell was going on between him and Lacey.</p><p>They backed out of the small parking lot and headed out of town. And further from Mason.</p><p>She began to shake in earnest as the reality of what she had done hit her. She\u2019d stood up to the bastard and won. Now maybe the awful fear that gnawed at her gut would go away.</p><p>A warm hand kneaded and massaged her neck. She glanced over to see Ryan staring at her. She searched his face for some sign of what he was thinking, but could find no clue.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he said.</p><p>She flew into his arms and buried her face in his hard chest. Strong arms wrapped around her and a hand rubbed up and down her back. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m proud of you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>Tears streaked down her face as relief poured out of her system. So many weeks of constant fear had eaten away at her. Now she was free.</p><p>She snuggled deeper into Ryan\u2019s arms, curling herself as close into him as she could.</p><p>The next thing she knew the engine had stopped and cold air brushed over her as a door opened. Had she fallen asleep? All she really knew was that she had no desire to move from Ryan\u2019s arms. Reluctantly she picked her head up. They were back at the cabin.</p> <p>She slid over as Adam opened the door for her then she climbed out of the Land Rover. She pulled her coat tighter around her and hurried for the front door, anxious to be inside where it was warm.</p><p>They all entered the house, stamping the snow off their feet inside the door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d she announced, realizing she hadn\u2019t eaten a thing since the day before.</p><p>\u201cGo warm up in front of the fire, and I\u2019ll start on lunch,\u201d Ethan said, pushing her toward the living room.</p><p>Adam and Ryan followed her and Adam went to add more logs to the dying embers.</p> <p>\u201cSo what happened in there?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>Adam paused in his task and turned to look at Holly, obviously wanting to hear as well.</p><p>\u201cMason was there when we got to the sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Holly began.</p><p>Adam swore. \u201cLacey must have known he was there all along.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe tried to leave immediately, but I refused to go with him. I thought he was going to force the issue, but Lacey wouldn\u2019t let him. I asked Lacey to leave us alone for a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did what?\u201d Ryan demanded, his expression darkening.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the only way,\u201d she said. \u201cI told him that I knew what he\u2019d done on our wedding day, that I\u2019d seen him kill that man. Then I told him I wanted a divorce, and he was going to agree to that divorce or I\u2019d make sure the whole world knew what he\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cYeah, fuck is right,\u201d Adam said, rubbing the back of his neck.</p><p>She looked at them in surprise. \u201cBut I thought you wanted me to get a divorce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, we do,\u201d Adam said, pulling her into his arms. \u201cBut we want you safe, and you\u2019ve just told us that the bastard now knows you can put him away for life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was the only way to get him to agree to the divorce,\u201d she said defensively.</p><p>Adam rubbed her shoulders soothingly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, baby. You\u2019ll get your divorce, but more importantly, you won\u2019t ever have to face that bastard again.\u201d</p><p>Ethan called to them from the doorway. \u201cI threw together some sandwiches. Come eat.\u201d</p> <p>Holly turned and walked toward the kitchen. Had she made a mistake by threatening Mason? She frowned, worry inserting itself back into her mind.</p><p>She sat down at the bar and Ethan shoved a plate in front of her. The brothers took their places, and they began to eat.</p><p>\u201cWhat now?\u201d she asked, unable to keep the question back any longer.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She hesitated a moment, feeling unsure about the entire situation. \u201cI mean us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe go to Denver to see Cal so he can fast-track your divorce. And then we get on with our lives. Together.\u201d</p><p>She looked down at her plate and fiddled with the sandwich. A thousand questions crowded her mind, and she didn\u2019t know where to start.</p><p>\u201cWant to go riding after lunch?\u201d Ryan interrupted.</p><p>She looked at him in relief. Fresh air and a break sounded very inviting. She nodded then caught herself.</p><p>\u201cI assume you mean horseback riding? I haven\u2019t ridden in a long while.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll make sure you have a good mount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go too far,\u201d Adam warned. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a storm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need a babysitter,\u201d Ryan said darkly.</p><p>Holly shoved her plate aside, no longer hungry. Maybe getting out of the house for a while would help. She wanted to relax and not worry about looking over her shoulder for once.</p><p>Ryan pushed away from the table. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stood up. \u201cLet me go get something warmer on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in the barn. Head on out when you\u2019re done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re a lot alike you know.\u201d</p><p>Adam turned his head to Ethan after watching Holly leave the room. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan and Holly,\u201d Ethan replied. \u201cThey both know pain. You can see it in their eyes.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips tightened. He didn\u2019t like to think of either of them in pain, but he knew Ethan was right. Holly and his younger brother fought their demons. He just hoped they won.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you suppose happened over there?\u201d Adam muttered.</p><p>Ethan shook his head, sorrow washing into his eyes. \u201cI wish to hell I knew. I wish he\u2019d talk about it. Maybe then the poison would leave his system. I never wanted him to join the damn military anyway.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded in agreement. But Ryan was stubborn, and once he\u2019d made the decision, no one had been able to sway him. He\u2019d left a cocky, arrogant young man and come back a brooding, tortured soul.</p><p>\u201cMaybe she\u2019s what he needs,\u201d Ethan murmured. \u201cMaybe she\u2019s what we all need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd maybe she needs us just as badly,\u201d Adam added.</p><p>Holly stepped into the snow, shivering as a wash of cold air blew over her. She crunched her way down the slight incline to the barn. Ahead of her the terrain sloped upward, a testament to the mountain they were nestled on. Snow-capped peaks jutted skyward on the horizon. Around her the world was ablaze with white.</p><p>Her breath came out in a cloud in front of her as she mounted the last few steps to the barn door. Then she slipped inside, enjoying the warmth that greeted her.</p><p>Eight stalls lined either side of the barn. In the back, there was a large open area where stacks of hay bails stood. Ryan stepped out of one of the stalls leading a horse by the reins.</p><p>He glanced in her direction. \u201cI\u2019ve got her saddled for you. Come hold the reins while I ready my mount then we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p><p>Holly hurried forward and took the leather reins from Ryan.</p><p>Ryan motioned toward the back. \u201cTake her over there and wait.\u201d</p><p>Holly moved to the back, her horse clopping obediently behind her. While she waited for Ryan, she smoothed her hands over the mare\u2019s neck. She was a beauty. Gentle looking. Her head bobbed appreciatively as Holly stroked her mane.</p><p>A few seconds later, Ryan walked up, leading his mount behind him. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Holly nodded. As Ryan moved ahead of her, she cast an appreciative glance over his body. Damn, the man filled out a pair of jeans like no one else. He looked exceedingly masculine in his lambskin-lined coat, cowboy hat and scuffed boots. And his ass. What could she say about a man who had an ass that begged to be touched, fondled and squeezed?</p><p>She squeezed her legs together and picked up her pace. She was a walking hormone. But who could blame her after the night she\u2019d experienced? Her cheeks warmed to the point of discomfort when she thought of all they had done. She couldn\u2019t wait to do it again.</p><p>\u201cDo you need help up?\u201d Ryan asked, his voice close to her ear.</p><p>She jumped and looked around. Hell, she hadn\u2019t even realized they\u2019d walked outside. Hard to notice the cold when her entire body was erupting in flames.</p><p>She flushed and turned her attention to the horse. She was short, and it was a long way up into the saddle.</p><p>She looked back at Ryan. He grinned and in one swift motion, he wrapped his large hands around her waist and hoisted her up as easily as a sack of potatoes.</p><p>\u201cMisty\u2019s a good mount. She\u2019ll follow my lead, so don\u2019t worry about it. Just enjoy yourself,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>She smiled down at him. His hand lingered on her leg then he squeezed it before he walked over to mount his horse.</p><p>They picked their way through the snow around to the front of the cabin and down the drive to the road. Holly glanced back at the cabin. It was fully ensconced on the mountain as if the brothers had carved their home right into the surface. Snow covered the roof, and smoke drifted lazily from the stone chimney. It looked like a scene straight from a Christmas card. And it was now her home.</p><p>Her chest tightened, and she had the absurd urge to grin like a kid in a candy store. Home.</p><p>Life was a strange chain of ironies. She\u2019d learned that quickly enough. Only in the demise of her dreams had she actually found them.</p><p>But would it work out?</p><p>A shadow of doubt marred her jubilation. She\u2019d thought Mason was the answer to her dreams. Wealthy, seemingly doting on her, protective. The stuff a girl\u2019s dreams were made of. Or nightmares.</p><p>Was she making the same mistake again? She sure hadn\u2019t given any more thought or care to this decision than she had the one to marry Mason, and it had landed her in a kettle of hot water.</p><p>She frowned. If there had never been a Mason, if she had never made such a monumental mistake, if she hadn\u2019t desperately needed a place to run and hide, would she have been drawn to the brothers and what they offered?</p><p>She fought to try and place herself in the frame of mind she\u2019d been in before she\u2019d ever met Mason, but found it impossible to match the woman she\u2019d become to who she\u2019d been.</p><p>Her head hurt. She was trying too hard to analyze her feelings. She knew what she thought she felt for the brothers, but what if she was wrong? What if her attraction to them was merely a measure of self-preservation? Gratitude for the safe haven they provided?</p><p>Fuck a duck.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair to them. They wanted a woman who could love all three of them, not a woman who couldn\u2019t think for herself, who was a weak mess, one who\u2019d made one bad decision after another.</p><p>\u201cIf you frown any harder, you\u2019re going to screw up that pretty face of yours forever,\u201d Ryan said mildly.</p><p>She glanced up, guilty heat suffusing her cheeks. She hadn\u2019t even been paying attention to him, her horse or where they were going. And Ryan knew it.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said in a low voice. \u201cI was just thinking.\u201d</p><p>Ryan shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s why I asked if you wanted to go out for a while. You looked like you could use a break.\u201d</p><p>He turned back around in his saddle and stared ahead, silence looming between them once more.</p><p>She sighed. He wasn\u2019t pushy. She liked that. But then none of the brothers had pushed her hard. Adam could be demanding. Any fool could see that, but he hadn\u2019t pressed her boundaries.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here,\u201d she said, focusing her attention on Ryan.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cNo place on earth is more beautiful than the Rockies.\u201d</p><p>He loved it here. She could tell by the way his eyes scraped across the landscape. Some of the bleakness and torment he wore like a permanent tattoo disappeared, replaced by satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cHow did you all end up here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He shrugged again. \u201cWe grew up on a ranch. It was only natural that we\u2019d want one of our own. And we like to hunt. So we decided to combine those factors and make our living at it.\u201d</p><p>She thought on that a moment. The cabin they lived in was large. Though they didn\u2019t take meals in the dining room, the room sported a table that could easily sit two dozen people. And there were several rooms she hadn\u2019t explored yet. An uneasy thought crept into her mind.</p><p>\u201cSo when it\u2019s hunting season, there\u2019ll be lots of hunters in the cabin?\u201d she asked.</p><p>He studied her for a moment as if delving into her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cAre you worried about what they\u2019ll think?\u201d he asked, his tone slightly challenging.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said honestly. \u201cI mean I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll be presented. How do you introduce me to other people?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs our woman,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her stomach turned over. On the one hand, it did funny things to her, the idea of three sexy as hell men claiming her as their woman, but on the other hand, it could be awkward as hell.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d he said.</p><p>She felt her cheek warming again as another thought struck her. One she hadn\u2019t considered, but in light of their very different relationship, she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>She cleared her throat, wondering how to present such an awkward question.</p><p>Ryan sighed. \u201cJust say it, Holly. Whatever\u2019s on your mind. I don\u2019t bite.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, sure she was growing redder by the minute. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I wondered, that is I wasn\u2019t sure...\u201d She took another steadying breath. \u201cYou won\u2019t want there to be others, right?\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened and a scowl twisted his features. \u201cI\u2019ll kill any other man who touches you.\u201d</p><p>Her breath eased from her in relief.</p><p>Ryan scrubbed a hand over his chin. \u201cHolly, just because we have a different situation, in that all three of us are fucking the same woman, it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to be sharing you with every man who crosses our path. You\u2019re ours. You belong to us, heart and soul, and if another man so much as looks at you, we\u2019ll rip off his dick and cram it down his throat.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She couldn\u2019t help it. She laughed. Then she sobered. \u201cI hope you all aren\u2019t making a mistake,\u201d she said quietly.</p><p>He tipped up his Stetson to get a better look at her. \u201cAre we making a mistake, Holly?\u201d</p><p>She flinched under his frank appraisal. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be making a mistake,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI don\u2019t want any of this to be a mistake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you\u2019re rushing things,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. We\u2019ve got all the time in the world.\u201d</p><p>She drew comfort from his words. And maybe she had felt rushed. As if she should immediately feel right with the situation she found herself\u2014no, that she chose to be\u2014in. Relationships took time, even if she had a habit of hurling herself into them. It sounded as though they were more than willing to grant her time, and for that she was grateful.</p><p>She was surprised to see they were nearing the cabin again. She hadn\u2019t even paid attention to their ride, so deep in her thoughts she\u2019d been.</p><p>They rode around to the back and stopped outside the barn. Ryan slid from his horse then held up a hand to help her down. She landed inches from him, his body heat reaching out and enveloping her. He smelled so damn sexy. Just like a man should. Of wood, leather and a hint of wildness.</p><p>She placed her hand on his hard chest, unable to resist the temptation. His heat seared her palm. He growled low in his throat.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get the horses in before I fuck you right here in the snow,\u201d he said.</p><p>Goose bumps assaulted every inch of her body. Her nipples tightened and streaks of pleasure burned between her legs at his explicit words.</p><p>Her hands shaking, she followed him into the barn. She watched as he groomed the horses. She imagined it was her his hands roamed over instead of the horse. Sweat beaded on her brow. She wanted him. Right here. Right now. And if she could gain the courage, what was to stop her from taking what she wanted?</p><p>Chapter Ten</p><p>Holly\u2019s courage deserted her halfway to Ryan. As if sensing her approach, he turned around after locking the stall. He studied her for a moment.</p><p>\u201cDid you want something?\u201d</p><p>What a question. She swallowed. Then swallowed again.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d she said simply, it all coming out in a quick rush.</p><p>He flashed her a sexy, arrogant grin.</p><p>\u201cThen come get me,\u201d he said, spreading his arms out in a gesture or surrender.</p><p>She trembled with nervousness, but she walked slowly toward him. Her gaze focused on the bulge in his jeans, the bulge that had grown larger with her announcement. She knew precisely what she wanted to do with it. She wanted to taste it again. Like she had done before.</p><p>With shaking hands, she reached out for the button of his jeans. She heard his quick intake of breath when she worked it free. She pulled the zipper down until she could see the band of his underwear.</p><p>\u201cTake it out,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI want to see you pull it out.\u201d</p><p>Somehow the image of him pulling his cock out of his pants excited her wildly. She wanted that image to come to life.</p><p>\u201cGet on your knees,\u201d he rasped.</p> <p>She hastily complied, and he reached into his pants and pulled out his erection. She reached up, wanting to touch it. She curled her hands around it. It was inches from her lips, straining, hard as a rock.</p><p>She flicked her tongue out and delicately swirled it around the broad head. He flinched and groaned then moved forward, seeking more of her mouth.</p><p>She wrapped her hand around the base of his cock and guided him toward her lips. She let him rest on her lips for the merest of seconds before sucking him gently into her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAh damn, sweetheart. That\u2019s it. Take it all.\u201d</p><p>His hand tangled in her hair as he gripped the back of her neck. His hips surged forward as he thrust into her mouth.</p><p>She delighted in the contrast of soft, smooth skin and iron hardness. He tasted exotic, all male, like he smelled. Silky fluid spilled on her tongue as he surged to the back of her throat. She wanted more. She wanted to make him come. Make him as wild for her as she felt in his arms.</p><p>Soft sucking noises filled the barn. They sounded erotic to her ears and spurred her excitement. She drew him in then slid her mouth back down the length of him until the tip rested against her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a temptress,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She smiled. She felt like a temptress. Gloried in it. She let his cock fall from her mouth and ran her tongue down the underside, following the thick vein down to his balls. She sucked one in her mouth, loving the way his entire body tightened. She lavished attention on the other, sucking and laving with her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYou have to stop,\u201d he choked out. \u201cOr I\u2019m gonna come.\u201d</p><p>She sat back on her heels and flashed him a wicked smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the point.\u201d</p><p>He hauled her up against him and slammed his mouth down over hers. Their tongues dueled. Their lips met in breathless gasps.</p><p>\u201cGet your damn pants off,\u201d he demanded.</p><p>She wasted no time shucking first her boots and then her jeans. He reached down and ripped her underwear, the slight material tearing easily from her body. Before she could register what he was doing, he hoisted her up in his arms, spreading her legs around his waist.</p><p>In one hard plunge, he thrust deeply into her wetness. She cried out, the noise echoing over the barn. Her pussy convulsed around his cock, milking him, inviting him further.</p><p>He held her tightly with one arm and began yanking her coat off with the other. As soon as she was free, he wrapped both arms around her waist and began thrusting into her. She felt the denim of his jeans scratch at her ass as he worked his way further into her.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and threw her head back in abandon.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucking beautiful,\u201d he said tightly.</p><p>Buried deeply within her, he moved her back until she was firmly against the wall of the barn. Then he began to fuck her in earnest.</p><p>He kissed and sucked his way over her shoulder to her neck, and when he reached the delicate skin just below her ear, he sank his teeth in.</p><p>Her hands fisted in his hair. She wasn\u2019t gentle. But neither was he. She yanked his head from her neck and fused their lips together. She was hungry. Hungry for him and she couldn\u2019t get enough.</p><p>He fucked harder and harder, her back slamming against the wall. She didn\u2019t care. She wanted him deeper.</p><p>His hands crept downward, over the globes of her ass until he cupped both in his palms. He spread her wider to meet his thrusts. She felt his fingers feather across the tight entrance to her ass, and she tightened.</p><p>\u201cRelax,\u201d he whispered against her ear.</p><p>Before she could react, he thrust one finger inside. She bucked against him, the tight pinch of pain nearly sending her over the edge into a mind-blowing orgasm.</p><p>Then another finger joined the first. His cock was wedged tight in her pussy, his fingers pressing into her ass. It was more than she could stand. He pulled back, and then slammed into her at the same time he pushed his fingers further into her tight opening.</p><p>She exploded at the seams.</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t stop now!\u201d she wailed.</p><p>He held her up, supporting her in his strong arms as he fucked long, hard strokes. Thank God, because she would have completely wilted. Her body went flying into a million directions as her orgasm consumed her. She saw bright flashes of color then she squeezed her eyes shut, no longer able to bear the sensations.</p><p>\u201cOh God, baby, I\u2019m coming,\u201d he shouted hoarsely in her ear.</p><p>She slumped forward onto his chest, her arms wrapping weakly around him as he flooded into her pussy. His hips bucked underneath her ass, his zipper pressing into the soft flesh of her backside.</p><p>She rested her face in his neck, her breath coming in gasps. His arms wrapped around her, holding her close, his cock still buried deep inside her. They stood that way for several long moments until finally he pulled her face from his neck and kissed her gently.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d he asked huskily as he lifted her slightly so that his cock fell free.</p><p>She nodded, though she was altogether unsure she could. He let her slide carefully down his body, holding onto her until he was sure she could support her weight.</p><p>He tucked his cock back into his pants and buttoned the fly back up. Then he reached for her, holding her against his chest. He rested his chin on top of her head, and they stood in silence.</p><p>As her body calmed, the chilly air blew across her exposed bottom half. She shivered in his arms and he pulled away. He hurried over to where her jeans lay in a heap on the ground and retrieved them.</p><p>She pulled them on then found herself just as quickly back in Ryan\u2019s arms. He bent his head and kissed her. Thoroughly, leisurely. Slower than his usual hot as hell pace.</p><p>She sighed against his lips and sagged against his chest. She was as weak as a kitten, but completely sated.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you back to the house,\u201d Ryan said, his deep voice rumbling his chest against her cheek.</p><p>She rummaged for her boots and coat, pulled them on then followed Ryan out of the barn. They stepped into the kitchen, stamping the snow from their feet. She shrugged out of her coat, pulled her boots off again and padded into the living room.</p><p>It amazed her that already she sought out the presence of the others. Wanted to know where they were. Felt secure around them.</p><p>Adam was on the computer and Ethan was sprawled on the couch watching television. She walked over and crawled onto the couch with Ethan, her confidence bolstered by her act in the barn. Besides, she wanted a good cuddle after her romp with Ryan.</p><p>Ethan snaked his arm around her and nestled her against his chest. His brow arched as he took in her rumpled appearance.</p><p>\u201cYou and Ryan have a good time?\u201d</p><p>She flushed and ducked her head, resting it on his shoulder.</p><p>He chuckled as he smoothed her hair from her cheek. She yawned and snuggled closer against his body.</p><p>Chapter Eleven</p><p>When Holly awoke, she found herself alone on the couch. She blinked sleepily and looked around the room to find it empty. Yawning broadly, she sat up and squinted at the clock. At least she hadn\u2019t slept the entire day away.</p><p>She got up and padded to the kitchen. A glance out the pane glass of the back door told her Adam was chopping wood. She guessed Ethan and Ryan were either tending the horses or doing other chores.</p><p>She sat down on one of the barstools and cupped her chin in her palms. What was she going to do here? What kind of contribution could she make? She knew from her talks with the men that they guided during hunting season, but she wasn\u2019t entirely sure what they did for the rest of the year.</p><p>A disgusted sigh escaped her. She mentally ticked off her qualities and stopped before she reached five. She wasn\u2019t a brainless twit, but even she had to admit, she hadn\u2019t done much in life on her own.</p><p>Poor little rich girl. She winced at the apt description then shook her head in denial. No, she wasn\u2019t that helpless creature any longer.</p><p>Her parents had both been killed in the same accident when she was still a teenager. A distant cousin had overseen her inheritance until she reached twenty-one at which point she\u2019d been solidly on her own. Only it hadn\u2019t taken her long to seek the shelter of Mason\u2019s authority.</p><p>A wry smile twisted her lips. She\u2019d been such an idiot. Thank God she\u2019d waken up and taken steps to protect herself before it was too late. She had no doubt had she stayed with Mason, she\u2019d probably be dead. Or worse. Completely under his thumb.</p><p>Here, she felt free. Free to be herself. Free of her stupid past. It was a chance to start over and finally do things right. Make the right choices.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t screw this up, Holly,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>She glanced again at the clock then stood up. She had time for a shower before supper. When the men came in, she\u2019d ask what she could do to help out around the cabin.</p><p>Holly walked into the bathroom and turned on the shower. She stepped away and slipped out of her pants then walked to the sink in just her shirt while she waited for the water to heat.</p><p>She glanced at her reflection in the mirror and winced at the god-awful color of her hair. When they went to Denver, she was going to make a stop at a salon so she could get them to repair the dye job.</p><p>Behind her, she saw steam start to rise from the shower. She began to unbutton her flannel shirt when the door opened. She looked up to see Ethan walk in.</p><p>He paused for a moment before moving behind her. He cupped her shoulders in his hands and bent to press a kiss to her neck.</p><p>She shivered, goose bumps rippling up her spine.</p><p>\u201cWant company?\u201d he murmured.</p><p>She smiled and turned around until she was cradled in his arms. \u201cAre you offering to scrub my back?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m offering to do a lot more,\u201d he said wickedly.</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d</p><p>She grinned and shrugged out of her shirt. Then she moved around him and slipped into the shower.</p><p>She barely had time to move under the hot spray before the shower door opened and a very naked, very aroused Ethan stepped in.</p><p>Her eyes devoured him. Water beaded in his hair and ran down his neck then trickled down the muscled wall of his chest to his tight abdomen. From there it disappeared into the thatch of hair surrounding his bulging erection. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached for her hands then pulled them high above her head, pressing her against the shower wall. The water coursed over them both as he bent his head to kiss her.</p><p>His hard body covered hers, rocked against her with the promise of what was to come.</p><p>She tried to pull one of her hands away. She wanted to touch him. But he kept them locked above her.</p><p>His cock nudged her soft belly as his mouth burned an erotic trail down the curve of her neck.</p><p>Then he let her go.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She turned her body until her back was nestled against his chest. He reached around her for the bar of soap and lathered it on his hands.</p><p>He started at her stomach, kneading and softly soaping. Then he worked his way up to her breasts, cupping them in his hands, rolling the nipples between his fingers.</p><p>She moaned and leaned further back into him.</p><p>His right hand smoothed back down her skin, down to her pelvis. He rubbed lightly then slid his hand between her legs. With his left hand, he continued his attentions on her breasts, but his right hand burrowed further between her legs, sliding, teasing, spreading her folds.</p><p>She writhed against him, tension building in her body, stretching her impossibly.</p><p>Then his finger slid over her clit and her legs spasmed and threatened to fold on her.</p><p>Without warning, his hands left her, and she felt herself being pushed belly first against the wall of the shower as water continued to rain down on them.</p><p>The wall felt cool, the water felt hot, and her body trembled in anticipation as she felt him spread her legs.</p><p>Again, he raised her hands above her head and continued to nudge her legs apart with his thigh. She felt his cock brush against her ass then settle between her legs. With his knee, he propped her ass up enough to position himself at her pussy opening.</p><p>Then he plunged deeply inside her, rocking her against the tile wall.</p><p>Oh God, he was so deep. He felt so good. She closed her eyes and pressed her cheek against the shower.</p><p>\u201cKeep your hands up,\u201d he choked out as he let his own hands fall from hers.</p><p>She obeyed, keeping them above her head, pressed firmly against the walls. He positioned his hands at her hips, lifting her higher, holding her in place as he plunged again and again.</p><p>It was hot. It was hard to breathe. She\u2019d never felt such exquisite pleasure.</p><p>Her ass rested against his hard abdomen, his cock seated as deeply within her as he could go. Still she wanted more. He slowly withdrew, pushing forward, retreating before easing forward once more.</p><p>She bit her lip to keep from screaming out at the delicious agony. She felt poised to burst, and yet he wouldn\u2019t allow it with his deliberate movements. He could send her spiraling over the edge at any second and yet he delayed, opting to instead enjoy a slow, leisurely pace.</p><p>One hand gripped her hip, and the other stole around, slipping between her legs. He found her clit and began working it in a circular motion as he fucked back and forth behind her.</p> <p>\u201cEthan!\u201d she cried out.</p><p>\u201cEasy, sweetheart, I\u2019ve got you,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNot yet. Not yet.\u201d</p><p>She wailed as he paused. She was so close. So damn close.</p><p>His hand left her pussy and moved up to her breasts. He lazily circled one nipple with his fingers, brushing them ever so softly across the puckered tip. She felt the twinge all the way to her core.</p><p>He moved to the other one, plumping her breast in his hand, thumbing the nipple, teasing her unmercifully.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Ethan,\u201d she gasped out. \u201cLet me come!\u201d</p><p>He laughed softly. \u201cYou want it hard, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh God, yes, fuck me please!\u201d</p><p>He plucked her nipples until they stood erect, stiff peaks, straining for more. Then he wrapped both hands around her hips and rocked against her, plunging deep, hard.</p><p>\u201cYes, yes!\u201d she cried. She was getting close.</p><p>She closed her eyes and threw back her head. Her hands slid down the walls as he fucked her harder. The water turned cool and she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>The slap of his hips against her ass filled the bathroom, the soft sucking noise made louder by the wetness of their bodies.</p><p>The buildup was nearly painful in its intensity. Fire raged in her groin and spread rapidly to her stomach and breasts. Every muscle in her body tightened and clenched.</p><p>\u201cLet go, sweetheart, come with me,\u201d Ethan growled in her ear.</p><p>He thrust harder, in the throes of his own release. She felt the hot jet of semen burst from his cock, and she fell right over the cliff into oblivion.</p><p>His arm curled around her, under her breasts, holding her up and against him so she wouldn\u2019t fall. He was seated deeply within her, and her body shook with the force of her orgasm.</p><p>Her head lolled forward, sliding down the wet surface of the shower wall. She put out her hands to brace herself, her breath coming in heavy gasps.</p><p>They were going to kill her.</p><p>She felt him slide out of her, felt the warm rush of cum run down her legs. Then he lifted her, turned her around and held her close to his chest.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>The words murmured against her hair made her stiffen in surprise. Had she heard him correctly?</p><p>She pulled her head away and looked up into his eyes. They burned with desire, but they gleamed with something else. Love.</p><p>Thick emotion knotted in her throat. Tears burned her eyelids and threatened to spill over the rims. She didn\u2019t know what to say, how to respond. But she knew he meant it.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up, doll,\u201d he said gently.</p><p>He washed her, tenderly covering every spot on her body. Then he shampooed her hair and rinsed it for her.</p><p>When he was finished, he turned the water off and stepped out of the shower, reaching his hand back for her. He wrapped a big fluffy towel around her then hugged her to him, holding her tightly for several long seconds.</p><p>She felt ridiculously giddy, and yet hesitant. She felt compelled to return the sentiment, tell him she loved him too, but the words stuck in her throat. She wasn\u2019t ready yet, wasn\u2019t sure exactly of the depth of her feelings, and more than anything, she wanted to get this right.</p><p>Chapter Twelve</p><p>Holly felt deliciously sore and drowsy as she left the bathroom with Ethan. Love. He loved her. It didn\u2019t seem possible even though he\u2019d all but told her it would happen.</p><p>They joined the others in the kitchen where Adam was standing by the stove. Ryan sat on a barstool drinking a beer.</p><p>She walked over to Adam and wrapped her arms around him, resting her cheek on his back. He stiffened\u2014in surprise?\u2014for the briefest moment before turning around in her arms.</p><p>He smiled down at her and kissed the top of her head.</p><p>\u201cYou seem happy,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her cheeks grew warm and a ridiculous smile attacked her face.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d</p><p>He tipped her chin up with his fingers then bent to kiss her. His lips moved possessively over hers. His tongue pressed inward, tasting her, laying claim to her mouth.</p><p>He slowly released her. \u201cHave a seat. Supper will be ready in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>She floated over to where Ryan and Ethan sat and took the stool between them.</p><p>As Adam puttered around the kitchen, laying out the plates and glasses, Holly decided to broach the subject of her usefulness.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d she began.</p><p>The men turned their attention to her.</p><p>\u201cThat is I was wondering what it is I could do to help out. I mean, if I\u2019m not going to be a guest, that is, I\u2019m going to stay.\u201d</p><p>She took a deep breath and cursed her insecurity.</p><p>\u201cHolly,\u201d Ethan said, his tone slightly reprimanding. \u201cWe want you here. We want you to stay. This is your home. I realize it might take you a while to get used to things, but there is no need to dance around any subject, nor is there any need for you not to embrace your status here.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and ducked her head. \u201cAt any rate, I wondered what I could do to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s always something that needs to be done,\u201d Adam said with a shrug. \u201cAt present, we divide chores and responsibilities. We\u2019d be glad to have the help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cook,\u201d she blurted, embarrassed by the admission. She felt hopelessly inadequate. Her upbringing hadn\u2019t trained her to do much.</p><p>\u201cNo one said you had to cook,\u201d Ryan said calmly.</p><p>\u201cI could learn,\u201d she added quickly.</p><p>Adam plunked down the platter of chicken fried steak on the bar and stared at her. \u201cHolly, we don\u2019t want a domestic slave. You\u2019re here as our wife. Our mate. The mother of our children. We managed fine on our own. We can cook just fine. If you want to help out in other ways, I\u2019m sure we can come up with something.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks warmed with embarrassment. \u201cI\u2019m making a mess of things, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>Adam sat down and passed the platter over to Ethan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re uptight,\u201d Adam said gently. \u201cWe just want you to be happy. Relax. You don\u2019t have to do anything right now. Let\u2019s concentrate on freeing you from your current marriage so the bastard has no claim on you. Everything else will fall into place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen do we go to Denver?\u201d she asked, grateful to change the subject.</p><p>\u201cDay after tomorrow. I\u2019ve arranged for Riley to come in and feed the horses while we\u2019re gone. We\u2019ll drive down, check into a hotel, then see Cal the next morning.\u201d</p><p>She nodded then cleared her throat. \u201cI wonder if there would be time for me to hit a salon while we\u2019re there?\u201d She twirled the ends of her hair nervously with her fingers. \u201cI\u2019d like to get the color fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can do whatever you want,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cI also need to stop by a bank. I need to start an account so I can have funds wired in. I don\u2019t trust Mason not to empty them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about money,\u201d Ryan said darkly. \u201cWe\u2019re more than able to provide for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not his money,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not taking money from him. I\u2019m protecting mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe seemed to be fairly wealthy,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cHe is. But if he can find a way into my trust fund, he\u2019ll empty it to spite me.\u201d</p><p>Adam raised his brow. \u201cTrust fund?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFrom my parents,\u201d she explained. She shifted uncomfortably on her stool. \u201cThey were wealthy. They died when I was a teenager, and I came into my inheritance when I turned twenty-one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see, and how old are you now?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cTwenty-four.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd when did you meet Mason?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShortly after my parents died. He...well, he stepped in and took care of me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan muttered something unintelligible under his breath. Ethan and Adam exchanged knowing glances.</p><p>\u201cWhat? What are you looking like that for?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cJust how much money are we talking about in your trust fund?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t really know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake a guess,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cFifty? Sixty million?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d Ethan muttered.</p><p>\u201cHow sure are you of Mason\u2019s financial stability?\u201d Adam asked quietly.</p><p>She opened her mouth but her reply stuttered and halted in her throat. Buzzing began in her head, and she felt incredibly, incredibly stupid. Her cheeks burned, and her throat constricted painfully.</p><p>Without another word, she got up and walked out of the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHolly!\u201d</p><p>She heard Ethan call out to her, but she didn\u2019t stop. She wanted to bear her current humiliation alone, thank you very much.</p><p>She stopped at the front door long enough to yank her coat off the coat rack then she opened the door and stepped onto the front porch. Cold air assaulted her, and she hurriedly pulled on her coat.</p><p>She walked to the railing and leaned out, staring at the rising moon over the snow. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply in. She needed the cold to cool her hot face.</p><p>Stupid, stupid, stupid. She\u2019d never even considered Mason had an ulterior motive for singling her out. He\u2019d stepped in when her parents died and acted as her protector and confidante. He\u2019d pressured her to marry him when she turned twenty-one. Now she knew why. But she hadn\u2019t wanted to marry right away. The only semblance of common sense she\u2019d shown in the whole fiasco.</p><p>She propped her elbows on the porch railing and buried her face in her palms. He had only wanted her money.</p><p>It didn\u2019t hurt that he didn\u2019t love her, or that he had married her for other reasons. She knew he hadn\u2019t been capable of loving her when he\u2019d struck her, when he\u2019d killed another person in cold blood. But what stung was her utter naivet\u00e9.</p><p>Of course he wanted her money. It all made perfect sense now. His preoccupation with \u201cprotecting\u201d her, his endless questions about how she was managing her money. All in the guise of wanting to make sure she was taken care of. Thank God she hadn\u2019t stayed around long enough to turn everything over to him as they had planned once they were married.</p><p>\u201cJesus, how stupid can I get?\u201d she whispered. She\u2019d been prepared to give him everything. He probably would\u2019ve found a way to get rid of her inside of six months. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She heard the door open behind her, and she squeezed her eyes harder shut.</p><p>\u201cHolly.\u201d</p><p>Adam walked to stand beside her. She opened one eye to see him rest his hands on the railing beside her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a complete idiot,\u201d she choked out.</p> <p>He sighed and gently pulled her into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re not an idiot, baby. I\u2019d say you\u2019re an amazing woman.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in denial. \u201cI\u2019m pathetic. Pathetic!\u201d</p><p>She clenched his coat lapels in her hands and buried her face in his chest. Then she laughed. It sounded harsh even to her.</p><p>Adam\u2019s strong arms wrapped around her and held her tightly against him.</p><p>A tear leaked down her cheek, quickly absorbed by Adam\u2019s shirt.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to belong to someone,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI wanted someone to care about me and not my money or who my parents were. I was so very lonely.\u201d</p><p>Adam rubbed a hand up and down her back. \u201cYou do belong to someone, baby. And we don\u2019t give a damn about your money.\u201d</p><p>For some reason, his declaration opened the floodgate of tears she\u2019d been holding at bay.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t realized how truly lonely she\u2019d been or how desperate she was for someone to love her. Desperate. That about summed her up in a nutshell. And now she\u2019d latched onto the brothers. Maybe they weren\u2019t the same caliber as Mason but she hadn\u2019t given her commitment to them any more thought than she had given her marriage to Mason. And that scared the hell out of her.</p><p>They wanted forever. She wanted forever. But. There was always a but. If only she hadn\u2019t made so many bad decisions. Then she might be able to trust the decision to stay with Adam, Ethan and Ryan.</p><p>Adam continued to hold her, stroking her hair. The sound of a ringing cell phone jarred her senses. Adam cursed softly, and she felt him fumble for his pocket. She drew away to give him easier access, and he pulled his phone out to answer it.</p> <p>\u201cAdam here,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>There was a long pause then he turned away. Holly stood shivering lightly. She wanted back into the warmth of his arms.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll be right there,\u201d he said as he turned back around.</p><p>He clicked the phone shut and shoved it back into his jacket. \u201cI\u2019ve got to run into town. Lacey needs my help.\u201d</p><p>A sharp pang twisted in Holly\u2019s chest. She was surprised at its ferocity.</p><p>\u201cCome back inside where it\u2019s warm,\u201d he said. He took her arm and led her back in the door.</p><p>In the living room, Ryan and Ethan both looked up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to run into town. Lacey\u2019s got a problem, and her deputies are out on calls.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you need us to go with you?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>Ryan snorted in disgust.</p><p>\u201cNo. At least I don\u2019t think so. Looks to be a runaway. If I need trackers, I\u2019ll call you. I\u2019d rather you stay here and look after Holly.\u201d</p><p>Holly gritted her teeth. She didn\u2019t need looking after, damn it, and she sure as hell didn\u2019t want Adam off with a woman who very clearly wanted him.</p><p>Jealous? Oh, hell yeah, she was jealous. And it pissed her off. She hadn\u2019t thought she could feel more miserable than before, but she was wrong.</p><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t anyone else she could call?\u201d Holly asked.</p><p>Adam looked strangely at her for a moment. \u201cWe\u2019ve helped track missing persons before for her.\u201d</p><p>Holly bit her lip to keep from saying anything further. There was nothing more unattractive than a shrew.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call if I\u2019m going to be too late.\u201d</p><p>Adam bent and gave her a quick kiss then turned to the door. He put his Stetson on and walked outside.</p><p>Holly watched him go, hating the way it made her feel. She glanced at Ryan and Ethan and winced. It was obvious they could see right through her. She seemed to have a knack for humiliation lately.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged, and she turned to head down the hallway toward the bedrooms. She stopped in the middle. Hysterical laughter bubbled from her. Whose room would she take refuge in?</p><p>She opted for the bathroom instead. She ran cool water in the sink and splashed her face. When she raised her head up, she saw Ryan\u2019s reflection in the mirror. He stood in the doorway, leaning against the frame.</p><p>\u201cWanna play Monopoly with me and Ethan?\u201d</p><p>She managed a shaky smile and nodded. At least he wasn\u2019t trying to dissect her emotions.</p><p>She waited a second then headed back to the living room. Ethan was setting up the Monopoly board on the coffee table, and Ryan was carrying in three mugs from the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cWant some hot chocolate?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>\u201cSounds yummy,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She took position on the couch while Ethan and Ryan both sat on the floor at either ends of the coffee table. She cupped the mug in her palms and sipped at the cocoa. Anything not to think of where Adam was and who he was with.</p><p>\u201cI hate to see you so upset,\u201d Ethan said in a low voice.</p><p>She jerked her glance sideways, startled from her own thoughts. Her jealous thoughts.</p><p>She sighed and set her mug down. She rubbed tiredly at her temple. \u201cI\u2019m being unreasonable.\u201d</p><p>Ryan muttered something under his breath.</p><p>She turned to him, sensing an ally. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you like her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a manipulative bitch.\u201d</p><p>Holly laughed. \u201cThanks. I needed that, I think. She doesn\u2019t seem to like me, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p><p>Ryan grunted. \u201cShe\u2019s pissed because she set her sights on Adam, and he never took the bait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNever?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cIt seemed to me that you and Ethan were all that stood between Adam seeking a deeper relationship with her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan fixed Ryan with a hard stare.</p><p>\u201cIs he sleeping with her?\u201d</p><p>She meant the question to sound casual, but instead it came across as fearful.</p><p>Ethan swore. \u201cLook, sweetheart, I don\u2019t know if he ever slept with her. I know that he isn\u2019t now. Not after you.\u201d</p><p>Somehow the idea that Adam had slept with Lacey didn\u2019t make her feel any better. It wasn\u2019t as though Holly had been here any length of time.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not saints, Holly. We\u2019ve had our share of women, but we\u2019re not faithless jerks. Adam wouldn\u2019t screw around with another woman. Not after committing himself to you.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded in agreement.</p><p>\u201cThen why is he going to her?\u201d Holly strained out.</p><p>\u201cHe can\u2019t stand the idea of not helping a woman in need,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe has a weakness for damsels in distress.\u201d</p><p>Holly felt the blood drain from her face. Was that what she was? God, she certainly fit the mold. Tears swam in her vision, and she blinked hard to keep them back. She didn\u2019t want to make an ass of herself. More than she already had.</p><p>Ethan threw one of the dice at Ryan, hitting him in the head. \u201cYou\u2019re not the brightest bulb are you?\u201d</p><p>Holly got up. She wasn\u2019t going to bother keeping the pretense up any longer. She was far too upset to act like nothing was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to go to bed,\u201d she said. \u201cIs there a room I can use?\u201d She hoped her meaning came across. She wanted a room to herself.</p><p>\u201cUse Adam\u2019s,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cHe can take the couch when he comes in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d she mumbled as she headed toward the hall.</p><p>As soon as she was out of sight, she bolted toward Adam\u2019s bedroom. When she was inside, she locked the door and leaned against it.</p><p>The tears she\u2019d tried so hard to hold back spilled down her cheeks. All the pent-up emotion from the last several years came roaring to the surface. The disappointment and the sense of betrayal, her humiliation over the horrible lack of judgment she\u2019d demonstrated. It was enough to make her cringe.</p><p>She didn\u2019t bother undressing. She jerked back the covers and crawled underneath, pulling them tightly around her as she curled into a ball.</p><p>Chapter Thirteen</p><p>Adam stepped inside the cabin and hung his Stetson and his coat on the hook by the door. He glanced around but only saw the dying embers of the fire. Everyone else must have gone to bed already.</p><p>His groin tightened. Would he find Holly in bed with his brothers? He knew Ethan and Ryan had both fucked her separately, and the truth of the matter was, he looked forward to doing the same.</p><p>He walked quietly down the hall and frowned when he saw his door closed. None of them ever slept with a closed door. He tried the knob and found it locked. What the hell? Locked out of his own bedroom?</p><p>He spun around and walked a door down to Ethan\u2019s room to see if he was there. The door was ajar. Adam nudged it further open and peered inside. Ethan was asleep amidst rumpled sheets. Alone.</p><p>He walked over and shook Ethan\u2019s shoulder. Ethan came awake instantly.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell time is it?\u201d Ethan demanded in a groggy voice.</p><p>\u201cThree A.M.\u201d</p><p>Ethan sat up and rubbed his eyes. \u201cWhere the fuck you been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelping Lacey find the Turner boy. Where\u2019s Holly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn your room,\u201d Ethan replied.</p><p>\u201cWhy\u2019s the door locked?\u201d</p><p>Ethan reached over and flipped on the lamp beside the bed. He pinned Adam with a disgusted stare. \u201cShe\u2019s hurting, Adam.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s heart lurched. He didn\u2019t like to think of Holly hurting. She\u2019d been upset before he left, but he\u2019d hoped Ethan and Ryan would have soothed any worries she had.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you and Ryan solve the problem?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hurting her, Adam. Not us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe? What the fuck did I do?\u201d</p><p>Adam felt his anger rising. He wasn\u2019t into playing stupid mind games, and Ethan was fast pissing him off.</p><p>Ethan sighed and slid his legs over the side of the bed. \u201cLook, Adam, she\u2019s having a rough time, and you running off at Lacey\u2019s calling isn\u2019t helping matters. She\u2019s insecure and who can blame her with what that fuckhead of a husband did to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s upset because I went to help Lacey?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe if you had explained the nature of your relationship with Lacey, Holly wouldn\u2019t feel as she does, but she knows something is between you two, and she knows Lacey doesn\u2019t like her one bit. Lacey\u2019s acted like a jealous bitch at every turn. Much like a woman scorned. Holly isn\u2019t stupid, Adam. Neither am I. Something went on between you two.\u201d</p><p>The muscles in Adam\u2019s face twitched, and he pressed his lips together. \u201cWhat did or didn\u2019t happen between us isn\u2019t any of your business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Ethan said evenly. \u201cDead wrong. It is very much my business. I love Holly. And I think you do too, Adam. I think Ryan probably does as well although he may have a hell of a time admitting it to himself. Anything you do that hurts Holly is my business. She\u2019s as much mine as she is yours and Ryan\u2019s. If this relationship is going to work, you\u2019re going to have to pull your head out of your ass.\u201d</p><p>Adam blew out his breath in one long sigh. \u201cChrist. Nothing happened between me and Lacey tonight, Ethan. I wouldn\u2019t do that to Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Ethan said quietly. \u201cBut she doesn\u2019t know that. Not yet. We haven\u2019t earned her trust. She\u2019s not going to offer that lightly after what she\u2019s gone through.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd in the meantime, I\u2019m locked out of my fucking bedroom.\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled. \u201cI guess you get the couch. I wonder if we\u2019ll have a steady rotation when one of us pisses her off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood night. Sorry I woke you,\u201d Adam said as he turned to leave.</p><p>He eased the door shut behind him and stared down the hall at his locked door. It was nothing a screwdriver wouldn\u2019t fix. Maybe it was time he and Holly had a little time alone.</p><p>A few minutes later, he quietly slipped into his bedroom. Holly had left the lamp by the bed on and the soft glow poured over the bed. He set the screwdriver down on the dresser and shrugged out of his clothing.</p><p>He walked to the bed and looked down at Holly\u2019s curled up body. Only her face peeked out from underneath the covers. A face that was red and blotchy. His chest tightened at the evidence of her tears.</p><p>He gently pulled back the covers and climbed in beside her. He pulled her tightly into his arms, liking the way her soft curves melted into his hard body.</p><p>She stirred and opened bleary eyes. They flared in surprise when she saw him.</p><p>\u201cHow did you get in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite easily actually. Why did you lock me out?\u201d</p><p>She looked away. He trailed a finger over a lock of her hair that rested on her neck.</p><p>\u201cI just needed some time alone,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s understandable, but you don\u2019t have to lock the door to get your point across.\u201d</p><p>She looked back at him again, her eyes troubled, uncertainty lurking in their depths.</p><p>He sighed. Ethan was right. He should have just explained his involvement with Lacey from the get-go. Then maybe he\u2019d be sliding his dick into Holly\u2019s pussy instead of lying here with a raging hard-on about to become embroiled in sensitive talk. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He checked his impatience and cupped her cheek in his palm. \u201cListen to me, baby. There is nothing going on between me and Lacey. I\u2019m sorry if you got the wrong impression.\u201d</p><p>Holly shifted and pulled the sheets up higher around her. The gesture looked protective in nature but instead of making her look stronger, it only made her seem more vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>Her voice came out soft and breathy, the kind that would make a man instantly hard. If he wasn\u2019t already. She was everything soft and feminine, what a woman should be.</p><p>\u201cWhat don\u2019t you understand, baby?\u201d</p><p>She looked away again. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you choose her?\u201d</p><p>Adam frowned. That wasn\u2019t what he expected her to say.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s everything I\u2019m not,\u201d Holly continued. \u201cShe\u2019s strong, tall, pretty. I bet she doesn\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned back against the pillows, taking Holly with him. He cradled her against his chest, and she laid her cheek on his shoulder. He stroked his hand up and down her arm.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lie to you. There was a time when I was attracted to Lacey. I even went as far as to bring her home, introduce her to Ryan and Ethan. But I knew immediately that she wasn\u2019t the one. I didn\u2019t feel a connection with her. Not like I did with you, and it was obvious the others didn\u2019t either. Ryan outright despised her on sight. I still haven\u2019t figured out why. Ethan, well, he was indifferent. I stopped seeing her directly after that.\u201d</p><p>Holly stilled against him. He could feel another question coming. One that apparently was difficult for her if her body language was any indicator.</p><p>\u201cRyan said...he said you were a sucker for a woman in distress.\u201d</p><p>The light bulb went on immediately. Adam sat up, dragging Holly up with him. He cupped her chin in his hand and forced her to look him directly in the eye.</p><p>\u201cBaby, I\u2019ll always protect you, but that isn\u2019t why you\u2019re here. Ryan\u2019s a dumbass. He talks to hear his head rattle, I swear. If you want an explanation as to why you and not her, well I don\u2019t know. I can only tell you what I feel here.\u201d</p><p>He clenched his other hand into a fist and thumped his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s you, baby. And maybe in time you\u2019ll believe that.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes glittered suspiciously in the lamplight.</p><p>\u201cI want it to be me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d There was clearly a but in her statement. Doubt clouded her voice, and it made him uneasy.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m scared of making the wrong decision. Again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes it feel wrong?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer immediately.</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t feel wrong. That\u2019s what scares me.\u201d</p> <p>Adam let out a small sigh of relief. He could fight uncertainty. He couldn\u2019t fight a made up mind. Ethan\u2019s words echoed in his mind. Was he right? Did Adam already love her? It was hard to separate his satisfaction with finding the woman who would complete their family and the idea of love.</p><p>He knew one thing. He wasn\u2019t letting her go. If that meant he loved her, then maybe Ethan was right. And he\u2019d try his best to make her love them as well.</p><p>He slid his hand down her side and over her hip. \u201cI want to make love to you,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of little else all night.\u201d</p><p>She stared up at him, her bottom lip caught between her teeth. He saw hesitation in her expression, but he also saw desire. Was she still afraid of him?</p><p>He lowered his head to hers, meeting her lips with his. She tasted sweet. Just like she looked. He wanted to feel those lips around his cock, her wet mouth sucking him deep. He was ready to explode just thinking about it.</p><p>\u201cTake your clothes off,\u201d he said hoarsely. \u201cI want to watch you.\u201d</p><p>She rose up on her elbow then slowly scooted off the bed. She stood for a moment, staring at him, her bottom lip tucked between her teeth. Then her fingers began to fumble with her pants.</p><p>He propped up on his elbow and watched as the smooth skin of her legs came into view. His fingers itched to touch her.</p><p>She began unbuttoning her shirt, her hands working down as the shirt loosened around her breasts. When she parted the shirt, he sucked in his breath. Damn she was beautiful. She had perfect breasts. They bobbed and swayed as she shrugged completely out of her shirt and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>He crooked his finger at her. \u201cCome here.\u201d</p><p>She crawled back onto the bed, her eyes bright with desire. Her lips wavered inches from his and then she kissed him. He ran his hand over her shoulder then down her side and underneath her breast. He cupped it in his hand, loving the feel, how it filled his palm.</p><p>His dick was hard as a rock, and it was becoming more painfully engorged by the minute. There was no part of his body that didn\u2019t scream out for her.</p><p>He continued to taste her, loving the raspy sounds of her breath as they skittered across his lips. But he wanted those lips around his cock, could think of little else.</p><p>Cupping his hand around the back of her neck, he slowly, but firmly eased her down toward the juncture of his thighs. With his other hand, he circled his fingers around the base of his dick and guided it toward her waiting mouth.</p><p>He groaned as her wet tongue slid down the length of his cock.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, you feel so damn good.\u201d</p><p>Her hair fell forward across his thighs. He moved his hand from his cock and tangled it in her hair, holding her in place as his hips jerked forward.</p><p>Slow and easy, she took him deeper, her tongue swirling around the head. He butted against the back of her throat then withdrew so she could catch her breath. She was magnificent.</p><p>She made small sucking noises as she coaxed him deeper. Her tongue rasped erotically over the vein on the underside of his dick. He closed his eyes and clenched his jaw as tight as he could.</p><p>He stroked his hand down her back and over the globes of her ass. He slid his finger into her wetness, and she flinched in reaction. He smiled as she took him deeper. They were driving each other crazy.</p><p>He burrowed his fingers deeper, seeking her swollen clit. He began to rotate his finger, parting the folds, baring the flesh for his touch.</p><p>He withdrew and ran his fingers up again, delving into the cleft of her ass. She tightened in reflex as he ran a finger around the puckered opening to her ass. God, she was tight.</p><p>He took his hand away and tangled it in her hair, pulling her away from his cock. Just the thought of plunging into her ass nearly made him come right then and there.</p><p>\u201cLay back,\u201d he commanded, rotating over her body.</p><p>She fell back, her mouth swollen, her eyes glazed with heady desire. Her legs fell open and he crawled between them, cupping her ass in his hands, spreading her.</p><p>In one hard thrust, he was inside her. She cried out, he cried out. Her hands clawed at his shoulders, pulling him closer. He smiled and bent down to capture her mouth with his.</p><p>\u201cDo you trust me?\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He slowly withdrew. \u201cTurn over.\u201d</p><p>When she complied, he stood up and walked across the room to the bathroom. He rummaged in the drawer for a tube of KY then walked back into the bedroom.</p><p>He smoothed a hand over her buttocks. \u201cScoot back,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He positioned her at the edge of the bed on all fours, her ass to him. He squeezed some of the KY onto his fingers then gently slid his hand between her ass cheeks. She moaned softly when he eased one finger into the tight opening.</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes flew open when his finger breached her ass. A multitude of sensations washed over her. A little fear, a lot of longing, a little pain, and a whole lot of pleasure.</p><p>She braced herself on one hand and smoothed the other over her stomach and to her pelvis below. Her fingers found her clit, and she began moving it in a circular motion. Pleasure rocketed through her abdomen.</p><p>His fingers left her for a moment and then she felt the head of his penis press against her sphincter. Slowly, ever so slowly, he pushed forward, allowing her to adjust to the sensation.</p><p>Her fingers stroked harder as she sought to offset the burning. She moaned deep in her throat. Then with a soft release, she felt him gain entrance.</p><p>She heard him say something unintelligible and then he sank all the way into her. She\u2019d never felt such an exquisite fullness. Ryan\u2019s words filtered back to her. Adam in your ass, me in your pussy. God, what would it feel like to have them both so deeply within her?</p><p>Adam began to thrust in and out. She was at a complete loss as to how to describe the overwhelming pleasure. It was part pain, part delicious ecstasy, and they combined to send her spiraling into the most excruciatingly, wondrous agony she\u2019d ever endured.</p><p>His hips pressed into her buttocks, and she knew he was as deep as he could possibly go, and yet, she wanted more. She pressed back against him, rocking her hips in time with his thrusts.</p><p>Her orgasm blossomed and grew until it consumed her. She needed it. She was going to fly apart at the seams.</p><p>Behind her, Adam cried out, and then she felt the flood of his release. And then she shattered. She buried her face in the covers to keep from screaming. Adam\u2019s hands gripped her hips tightly, holding her against him as he finished.</p><p>Her entire body quaked, shivered, convulsed. She fell limply to the bed as he withdrew. She closed her eyes, her breath coming in torturous gasps. Then she felt a warm cloth wiping over her tender flesh.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Adam asked huskily.</p><p>She nodded, unable to form a coherent response.</p><p>The bed dipped and then Adam gathered her in his arms. He kissed the top of her head and held her tightly against his chest. His heart beat wildly against her cheek.</p><p>\u201cYou are the most amazing woman,\u201d he whispered. \u201cNo one has ever made me feel like this.\u201d</p><p>Nothing he could have said would have evaporated her fears as quickly as that simple statement. Suddenly, Lacey was gone from her mind and her worries. She wrapped her arms around Adam\u2019s waist and closed her eyes. For the first time, she really believed that she might just hold the hearts of three men, and that they held hers.</p><p>Chapter Fourteen</p><p>Sinful, delicious sensations woke Holly up. She opened her eyes to Adam\u2019s broad chest. She was flung across him carelessly, and she smiled to think how possessive she must look. A woman staking her claim.</p><p>\u201cAah, she\u2019s awake.\u201d</p><p>She turned her head to see Ethan beside her. His hands stroked over her back, down over her behind and back up again.</p><p>And what a way to wake up.</p><p>A look to the end of the bed revealed Ryan. A bare-chested, incredibly sexy Ryan.</p><p>She looked up to see Adam staring down at her, lust emblazoned in his eyes.</p><p>He grinned. A predatory, all male grin. One that said he had his woman right where he wanted her. \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you to wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just bet you were.\u201d</p><p>Adam bent his head to kiss her. She felt Ethan\u2019s lips press against the small of her back, and she shivered as goose bumps traveled up her spine.</p><p>Then Adam scooted out from underneath her and stood up beside the bed. He held out a hand to help her up. When she\u2019d stood, Ryan peeled off his shorts, crawled onto the bed and laid crossways over the sheets, letting his legs dangle off the side, his feet planted on the floor.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d Ryan directed, holding out his hands for her.</p><p>She needed no further urging. She knew what was coming. She quivered from head to toe as she straddled Ryan. She looked down into his eyes, eyes that blazed into hers. She splayed her hands across his hard chest and lifted her bottom just enough that she could cradle his straining cock between her legs.</p><p>A sheen of sweat beaded on Ryan\u2019s forehead. \u201cTease,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>She smiled, delighting in her power. Slowly, she sank down onto him, taking him deeply inside her. She closed her eyes and let herself feel every delicious inch of him.</p><p>He gripped her hips in his large hands and held her tightly. She began a slow, sensuous ride. The bed dipped again as Ethan came to her on his knees. She rolled her tongue over the head of his erection then sucked it into her mouth. Ethan\u2019s breath came out in a hiss as he slid further beyond her lips.</p><p>Behind her, she felt Adam step between Ryan\u2019s legs, and her heart sped up. Ryan moved his hands from her hips and cupped her buttocks in his palms. He massaged them then spread them as the broad head of Adam\u2019s cock nudged her opening.</p><p>He eased lubricant around the puckered opening then pressed forward as gently as he had the night before. She felt the muscle tighten in resistance then give way under his persistent push. She cried out around Ethan\u2019s penis as Adam surged forward with one determined thrust.</p><p>They were all a part of her, all buried deeply within her. She couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t process the bombardment of ecstasy. Ryan helped her, moving her hips as he and Adam set the pace, thrusting in unison. Ethan stroked into the wet depths of her mouth, and she wrapped her hand around his cock, wanting him deeper, wanting all of him.</p><p>She was fast losing control. She moved in mindless rapture, allowing Ryan to control the pace.</p><p>Adam stiffened behind her. He pressed against her as tightly as he could and then she felt him explode inside her. But still Ryan thrust into her pussy. When Adam gently slid from her, she moaned in protest. She was close to the most explosive orgasm of her life, and she didn\u2019t want to lose the sense of fullness that was fast driving her over the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan pulled from her mouth and quickly moved behind her. Almost before she could adjust to the loss of Adam, Ethan slid into her in one long stroke. She screamed at the sensation. No preamble, no gentle coaxing. One minute he was nudging at her back entrance and the next he was fully seated within her.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it baby, feel,\u201d Adam murmured next to her. His hands stroked over her breasts, loving her, urging her on.</p><p>Ryan and Ethan surged into her, and she threw back her head, her mouth open in one long cry of triumph. This was it. This was what she\u2019d waited for her entire life. A sense of belonging. True belonging. She was theirs, but by God they were hers as well.</p><p>\u201cCome with us,\u201d Ryan whispered, as his mouth closed around her nipple.</p> <p>\u201cOh God, yes!\u201d</p><p>She bucked wildly between them. Ethan drove powerfully into her behind, his hands gripping her hips, holding her against him.</p><p>Her pussy tightened around Ryan\u2019s cock, her stomach clenched in red hot need. Waves of explosive pleasure rained down over her. She gripped Ryan\u2019s shoulders and screamed as her orgasm claimed her.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s big body shuddered beneath her, and Ethan bucked against her ass as they poured themselves into her.</p><p>She fell forward, and Ryan caught her against him, wrapping his arms tightly around her. She rested against his chest, breathing deeply, trying to catch her breath. She curled her arms around Ryan and buried her head in his neck.</p> <p>Behind her, Ethan withdrew. He bent and kissed the small of her back. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back, doll, don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><p>As if she could.</p><p>Soon a warm cloth soothed over her skin.</p><p>Ryan rolled her beneath him and gently withdrew from her quivering pussy. He propped himself on his forearms so as not to crush her with his weight then bent and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re ours,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>The words slid over her like warm honey. Comforted her in a way nothing else could. She was theirs.</p> <p>\u201cStay with me,\u201d she whispered. She yawned sleepily.</p><p>Ryan gathered her in his arms then pulled the covers over them both. \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Fifteen</p><p>Adam peeked into the bedroom to see Holly still sleeping soundly in the bed. He smiled. She looked like a sated kitten, curled up with her arms around his pillow. It was amazing that in such a short time he couldn\u2019t imagine life without her.</p><p>He knew via his own upbringing that such a situation could work and work well for all parties involved, but seeing it, experiencing it firsthand was more validating.</p><p>And speaking of, he needed to phone his parents. They\u2019d be interested to know about Holly, and he nor Ethan and Ryan had talked to them in over a month.</p><p>He quietly withdrew from the bedroom and walked down the hall to the living room.</p><p>Ethan looked up from the computer. \u201cShe still sleeping?\u201d</p> <p>Adam nodded. \u201cI think we wore her slap out.\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled and Adam marveled at how settled and content his brother looked. \u201cYou seen Ryan? I thought we\u2019d call Mom and let her know about Holly.\u201d</p><p>Concern flared in Ethan\u2019s eyes. \u201cHe went out to the barn. I think he\u2019s in a lot of pain today, though he wouldn\u2019t say so. Got pissed off at me when I asked.\u201d</p><p>Adam swore. Ryan had been doing so much better lately. Much of the darkness in his eyes had faded, and he knew Holly had everything to do with it, but Ryan had improved physically as well since his return from Iraq. He was a far cry from the battered shell of a man Adam and Ethan had collected from the Army Hospital a year ago, but his leg still bothered him on occasion.</p><p>He turned and strode from the living room toward the back door. Not bothering with his coat, he crossed the short distance from the cabin to the barn. He slipped inside and saw Ryan sitting on a hay bale in the back. As he drew closer, he could see Ryan\u2019s face drawn in pain. Sweat beaded Ryan\u2019s brow, and he was pale.</p><p>Ryan was bent over massaging the area above his knee. When Adam was a few feet away, Ryan looked up and saw him. He dropped his hands and stood up. Ryan cried out as his leg buckled. Adam reached over and yanked his brother up against him to prevent him from falling.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ryan gritted out.</p><p>\u201cNo, you\u2019re not fine, damn it. Stop trying to hide from the rest of us, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust leave it, Adam. I can deal with this on my own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could,\u201d Adam agreed. \u201cBut don\u2019t be stupid. Ethan and I are here to help. And now Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want her to know,\u201d Ryan said fiercely.</p><p>Adam blinked in surprise. \u201cHere, sit down,\u201d he said, shoving Ryan back down onto the hay. \u201cNow what the fuck is your problem?\u201d</p><p>Ryan rubbed absently at his leg.</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do? Do you want a pill?\u201d</p><p>Ryan shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want any fucking pills. It\u2019s just a bad morning. I don\u2019t know why the fuck it hurts. It just does.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should take you back to the doctor, let him check you out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing he can do.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cDamn it, Ryan, don\u2019t be so fucking difficult. I wish you\u2019d talk to me. I still don\u2019t have a goddamn clue what the hell happened over there.\u201d</p><p>Pain lashed across Ryan\u2019s face before his eyes turned cold and stony. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to talk about. I\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Adam knew the subject was officially closed. Ryan could be a brick wall when he put his mind to it. He\u2019d like nothing better than to kick his little brother\u2019s ass, but it wouldn\u2019t do a damn bit of good. Ryan wouldn\u2019t budge. Not until he was ready.</p><p>\u201cI was going to call Mom and Dad. Thought you might want to talk to them.\u201d</p><p>Ryan waved his hand. \u201cYou go ahead. I\u2019ll be there in a minute.\u201d</p><p>Adam started to argue, but Ryan stopped him.</p><p>\u201cJust go. Please.\u201d</p><p>It was the please that did it. Ryan rarely said please, and pain edged his voice. Adam knew he didn\u2019t want to be weak in front of his brothers. Anger choked him. Anger at whatever the hell had destroyed so much in his brother.</p><p>Adam turned around and walked out of the barn.</p><p>Holly burrowed deeper under the covers, not wanting to leave her warm nest. She was tired, deliciously exhausted, and she had about as much motivation to get up and move as she did a trip to the dentist.</p><p>She closed her eyes and relived the ecstasy she\u2019d experienced as the three men had made love to her. Alone they were a force to be reckoned with, but together they were positively mind-blowing.</p><p>She missed them already. That feeling drove her out of the bed as she went in search of them. She pulled on one of Adam\u2019s discarded shirts and let it fall to her knees. She walked barefooted down the hall, hoping to find one of them in the living room so she could indulge in a good snuggle session.</p><p>She found Ethan on the couch. He smiled at her and patted the spot beside him. She immediately curled herself around him, loving the warmth that emanated from his body.</p><p>\u201cWant a blanket?\u201d he asked as he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d She burrowed further into his arms until his heat had soaked into her body. \u201cWhere is everybody?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s out in the barn and Adam\u2019s on the phone in the kitchen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s he talking to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur parents.\u201d</p><p>She stiffened. Until now she hadn\u2019t given their parents a single thought. They\u2019d existed as a non-entity. She remembered Adam mentioning them once when he explained that his mother, like her, participated in a relationship with three men.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>\u201cYour parents...do they know about me?\u201d</p><p>He smiled down at her. \u201cThey do now.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t control the look of dismay, and she knew Ethan saw it.</p><p>He arched an eyebrow. \u201cYou look less than thrilled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they know everything?\u201d</p><p>Ethan continued to stare at her. \u201cI\u2019m sure Adam has filled them in on the situation.\u201d</p><p>Holly groaned. \u201cNot the image I want to present to your parents.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh hush. They\u2019ll love you. They\u2019ll be thrilled we found you.\u201d</p><p>Adam walked in holding the phone to his ear. \u201cAll right, Dad. I\u2019ll give you to Ethan, and I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d</p><p>He handed the phone to Ethan, and Holly moved away. She felt awkward being talked about. She headed to the kitchen to escape the conversation. As she poured a glass of juice from the fridge, Ryan stepped in the back door.</p><p>She smiled shyly at him. \u201cGood morning.\u201d</p><p>Pain glittered brightly in his eyes, and he limped as he walked.</p><p>\u201cRyan, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d she exclaimed. She set her juice down and rushed over to him.</p><p>As soon as she touched him, he stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She backed off, hurt at his demeanor.</p><p>He closed his eyes and put out a placating hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d</p><p>She curled her hand back around her juice and maintained her distance. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so she said nothing.</p><p>Ryan stared at her for a long moment then limped into the living room. His rebuff stung, but more than that, she wondered what had happened.</p><p>She sipped at her juice and sighed. Living with three unique personalities could get exhausting. If she were more secure in the relationship maybe she wouldn\u2019t be on eggshells all the time, but she was still learning all three of them.</p><p>Ethan was so open, and Ryan was his complete opposite. Reserved, shut off from the rest of the world. And Adam, well, she was still trying to figure him out, too.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t take it personally,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>She looked up to see him standing in the doorway Ryan had left through.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d</p><p>Adam opened the fridge and took out a beer. He popped the cap and took a long swig. \u201cIt\u2019s his leg. He got a leg full of shrapnel over in Iraq. Did a lot of damage. He\u2019s getting better, but it still gives him a lot of pain from time to time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he won\u2019t talk about it to anyone?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cI wish to hell he would.\u201d</p><p>Holly set her glass down and ran her finger around the rim. \u201cYour parents. They\u2019re like us, aren\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded.</p><p>\u201cSo they won\u2019t think anything bad about me.\u201d</p><p>She tried not to make it a question, but somehow it came out inquiring anyway.</p><p>Adam smiled. \u201cRelax, baby. They\u2019ll love you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan ambled into the kitchen. Adam looked up from his beer. \u201cYou done with Mom and Dad?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, Ryan\u2019s talking to Mom now. I expect he\u2019s getting an earful. She\u2019s pretty worried about him.\u201d</p><p>Adam looked over at Holly again. \u201cYou probably ought to get packed up today. We\u2019ll head out early in the morning.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNot much to pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll remedy that in Denver,\u201d Ethan said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you shopping for whatever you need.\u201d</p><p>She grinned mischievously. \u201cEven underwear?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially underwear,\u201d Ethan replied.</p><p>\u201cIf I had my way, you wouldn\u2019t wear underwear,\u201d Adam murmured close to her ear.</p><p>Ryan walked into the kitchen, his features drawn. He slid the phone across the bar then turned and limped out.</p><p>Holly followed his progress, her heart aching at the pain in his expression. What would it take to get beyond the barriers he\u2019d erected?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what had awakened her, but her eyes fluttered open and searched the darkness for what had disturbed her sleep.</p><p>Holly strained her ears for the source of the noise she\u2019d heard. A low moan filtered down the hall then an inarticulate cry. She sat up and glanced frantically around. Adam and Ethan were sound asleep in bed next to her, but Ryan was gone.</p><p>As carefully as she could so as not to wake the guys up, she eased from the bed. The house was chilly, and she shrugged on Adam\u2019s flannel shirt for warmth.</p><p>She padded down the hall toward the noise, ending up at Ryan\u2019s door. She pushed it open and peered inside. Ryan was on the bed in a tangle of sheets. The comforter was twisted and lay discarded on the floor.</p><p>He moaned again and stirred restlessly, his head shaking from side to side.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said in a thick voice. \u201cGod, no. Stop for God\u2019s sake, she can\u2019t take any more.\u201d</p><p>Holly moved closer, shocked to see Ryan\u2019s face bathed in tears. Her chest constricted painfully. She sat down on the bed next to Ryan and put her hand on his forehead.</p><p>\u201cRyan, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s me, Holly. Wake up.\u201d</p><p>He let out a torturous cry, the sound hitting her directly in the heart. She wrapped her arms tightly around him, pulling him against her. She held him, rocking back and forth, running her hands through his tangled hair.</p><p>In response, he curled his arms around her, squeezing her tightly against him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m here, Ryan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be afraid any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d</p><p>His voice was muffled by her chest. He sounded confused. Uncertain.</p><p>She trailed her fingers through his hair, soothing him. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d</p> <p>He tensed in her arms then pulled slightly away. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you.\u201d</p><p>But she wouldn\u2019t let him shove her away. \u201cTalk to me, Ryan,\u201d she said softly. \u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back closing his eyes. She followed him down to the pillow, curling her arm around his stomach. She waited, not pressing him. She sensed an internal battle raging.</p><p>He scrubbed a hand over his face and took a deep breath. \u201cWe got caught with our pants down behind enemy lines. Our mission went down the toilet in a matter of minutes. Most of my team managed to get out but I got a leg full of shrapnel from a mortar round. I fell behind. They fucking left me there.\u201d</p><p>She sucked in her breath. Granted she knew next to nothing about military matters, but wasn\u2019t their creed never to leave behind a fallen comrade?</p> <p>His breath came out wavery, and she knew he struggled to keep his emotions in check.</p><p>\u201cI wanted them to go. I didn\u2019t want to weigh them down. But they left me. I was captured and taken to a shit hole.\u201d</p><p>His words came out rambling, in a rush as if he had a hard time formulating his thoughts. This was likely the first time he\u2019d talked about the experience at all.</p><p>\u201cFor two weeks, I saw and endured things I never imagined.\u201d</p><p>His voice came out in a croak, breaking at the end.</p><p>\u201cThere was one soldier. She was British. They wouldn\u2019t leave her alone. They enjoyed tormenting her. After six days, she died and they left her there to rot.\u201d</p> <p>Tears streamed down his cheeks. She held him closer, kissing his chest, trying to keep her own tears at bay.</p><p>\u201cAfter she died, they turned their attention to me and another American soldier being held there. My leg was infected. I was running a fever and half out of my mind, but I\u2019ll never forget the pain.\u201d</p><p>He broke off again, his chest heaving with unspent emotion.</p><p>She pressed her forehead to his, her tears mingling with his. She hugged him to her, desperately wanting to alleviate his pain.</p><p>He wrapped his arms around her and buried his face in her breasts. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>She let him shove her shirt over her head, and soon they were naked, flesh pressing tightly against flesh. She kissed him hotly, allowing the full breadth of her passion and loving to flow into him.</p><p>Tonight she was the aggressor, making love to the man of her dreams. Their tongues mated and dueled. She rained a trail of kisses down his jaw to his neck and then down his chest to his taut belly.</p><p>His hands tangled in her hair, pulling her closer, holding her tightly. Her hands smoothed over the hard planes of his body, touching, feeling, showing him her love.</p> <p>She straddled him, cupping his hardness in the cradle of her pelvis. She bent forward, sinking her hands into his hair. She pulled him to her mouth, kissing him fiercely. Then she reached down and grasped his cock, guiding him into her hot wetness.</p><p>Her fingertips trailed down his chest as she rose up, threw her head back and began to ride. He cupped her breasts in his rough palms, thumbing her nipples, plumping the soft flesh in his hands.</p><p>They rode fast, hard, each reaching for the waiting pleasure. She could feel him tighten beneath her, deep inside her, and knew he was close to his release. She felt the pinch of her abdomen, the wonderful pressure as it built, spread and finally burst into an explosion of color and ecstasy.</p><p>She leaned forward, panting against his chest as she bucked and writhed in her orgasm. Then she felt the flood of semen into her womb. He wrapped his arms around her, holding her close, murmuring things in her ear she couldn\u2019t make out.</p><p>He shifted enough that they rolled so she was cradled in his arms. He stroked her hair and kissed her forehead. \u201cI love you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>She tucked her head underneath his chin, letting the words spill over her. She knew he didn\u2019t utter them lightly. She didn\u2019t say anything. She just held him until she felt the even breathing of sleep overtake him.</p><p>Chapter Sixteen</p><p>Adam shuffled into the living room, looking around for the others. For the first time in longer than he could remember, he\u2019d slept past dawn. He\u2019d joked about wearing Holly out, but the truth was, she was exhausting him. He grinned and flexed his tired muscles. A man could only dream of that kind of tiredness.</p><p>He continued into the kitchen, expecting to see everyone there. However, Ethan was the only one there.</p><p>\u201cMornin\u2019,\u201d Ethan said around his mug of coffee.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ryan and Holly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the barn.\u201d</p><p>Adam slouched down at the bar. \u201cThe barn? They going riding? We need to be hitting the road.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s lips curled into an amused grin. \u201cHe\u2019s teaching her self-defense moves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><p>Ethan shrugged. \u201cThey\u2019ve been at it for the last hour.\u201d</p><p>Adam grunted. \u201cRyan must be feeling better.\u201d</p><p>Ethan set down his mug. \u201cHolly got up last night after Ryan went to his room. When I got up this morning, they were wound as tight as two springs around each other. Ryan looked more at peace than I\u2019ve ever seen him.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s heart lightened at that announcement. Maybe Holly was chasing the demons from Ryan\u2019s soul. Lord knows he\u2019d lived with them long enough.</p><p>He leaned forward on the bar, crossing his arms in front of him. She was nothing short of a miracle. To all of them.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>Adam looked up and knew Ethan had read his thoughts, knew they were of Holly. He nodded. \u201cThat she is. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve found her.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t describe his sense of awe. He knew his brothers had harbored their share of doubts as to whether or not they\u2019d ever find the woman that would complete them, but he\u2019d known they would. Felt it. He just hadn\u2019t known when or how.</p><p>\u201cI hope Cal can take care of the divorce as quickly as he thought,\u201d Ethan spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be careful, Adam. I don\u2019t see her husband being willing to walk away so easily if he knows she can destroy him.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded, a knot of concern growing in his stomach. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same thought.\u201d</p><p>The door to the kitchen burst open and Holly stumbled in giggling, Ryan right behind her. Adam watched the ease on their faces. No torment, no darkness edged their eyes. Ryan looked happy.</p><p>Holly flashed him and Ethan broad smiles then she threw herself into Adam\u2019s arms. He caught her in surprise, and she burrowed into his chest, shivering even as she laughed.</p><p>He kissed the top of her hair and wrapped his arms tightly around her. He looked at his brothers over the top of her head and saw in their eyes how affected they were by Holly\u2019s presence.</p><p>\u201cYou ready to hit the road?\u201d Adam asked as he pulled Holly away from his chest.</p><p>She wrinkled her nose and grinned. \u201cOnly if I get to ride up front.\u201d</p><p>He laughed and kissed her chin. Then he swatted her on the butt. \u201cGo get your bag and we\u2019ll head out.\u201d</p><p>The drive to Denver went quickly. Holly enjoyed the scenery, the peace of feeling safe and secure. She hoped getting a divorce was as simple as the brothers made it appear. In the back of her mind, she wondered if Mason would really let her go so easily.</p><p>As they pulled into a downtown hotel, Holly gazed around in awe. Then she glanced sideways at Adam and quirked her lips into a smile.</p><p>He raised an eyebrow.</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have expected you guys to want to stay here. Downtown.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cWe\u2019re not complete backwoods hicks. Don\u2019t get me wrong. We\u2019re a lot more comfortable out of the city, but we thought you\u2019d like this, and plus, Cal\u2019s office isn\u2019t far from here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re near shops,\u201d Ethan said leaning forward from the backseat. \u201cSo you can do whatever shopping you need to do before we go back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long are we staying?\u201d Holly asked.</p><p>\u201cA few days,\u201d Adam said as he opened his door. \u201cThought we all might enjoy the break.\u201d</p><p>Holly, Ethan and Ryan waited as Adam went to check in. A few minutes later, he returned and pulled the Land Rover forward into the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go in, get cleaned up then we can go get something to eat,\u201d Adam said as he turned the engine off.</p><p>\u201cA steak maybe?\u201d Holly asked hopefully. Her mouth watered at the thought of a nice thick ribeye.</p><p>Ryan chuckled. \u201cNo worries about her fitting in.\u201d</p><p>They climbed out and Holly shivered at the shot of cold air. Ryan curled an arm around her and pulled her close to his side as they hurried for the entrance.</p><p>They all crowded into the elevator and Adam pushed the button for the top floor. They got off and walked down the hall to the end. Adam opened the door and Holly eased past him into the room.</p><p>She sighed appreciatively at the large suite. To the right, a bathroom complete with Jacuzzi and shower, to the left, doorways to two bedrooms. Ahead was a cozy sitting room with a couch and two chairs, a big screen TV and cocktail bar.</p><p>\u201cWant me to draw you a bath?\u201d Ethan asked her.</p><p>She shook her head as she wandered through to one of the bedrooms. \u201cJust a quick shower. I\u2019m starving.\u201d</p><p>She hurried into the large bathroom and turned on the shower. Then she dug around in her suitcase and pulled out a pair of jeans and a shirt along with a fresh change of underwear. She smiled ruefully at the plain Jane white briefs and bra. When she hit the shops, lingerie was going to be one of the first things she bought.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, she came out of the bathroom to where the guys were watching TV. \u201cReady?\u201d she asked.</p><p>They stood and headed for the door. Downstairs, they walked out to the Land Rover and climbed in.</p><p>\u201cThey have a good steakhouse not far,\u201d Adam said. \u201cHas great atmosphere. Laid-back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds good,\u201d she said enthusiastically.</p><p>In truth, she didn\u2019t care where they went. The thought of a juicy steak had her positively slobbering. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she\u2019d have to wipe the drool off her chin.</p><p>They soon pulled into a crowded parking lot. A large rambling old-style restaurant spread out across two lots. It was fashioned like a southern bayou cabin with cedar wood and a front porch boasting knobby rocking chairs.</p><p>Holly walked to the entrance, her arms snug around the waists of Ryan and Ethan. This was her first true outing with the three of them, and she felt self-conscious, but at the same time, devilishly happy. What woman wouldn\u2019t be green with envy? She had three of the most drop-dead gorgeous guys in the entire state of Colorado all to herself.</p><p>Adam gave their name to the woman manning the front, and within seconds, she was shepherding them to a table in the far corner of the room.</p><p>Ryan held out her seat for her, and Holly sat down next to Adam. The waitress came by and they rattled off their drink orders while they started looking over the menu.</p><p>Adam curled a hand around Holly\u2019s neck and massaged gently. She loved his touch. Loved that he touched her so often. They all did. It comforted her in ways words never could.</p><p>She leaned back in her chair and absorbed the surroundings. In the middle of the room, a zydeco band cranked out upbeat Cajun songs. Smiling couples navigated the tiny dance floor in various stages of the two-step.</p><p>\u201cWanna dance?\u201d Ryan asked with a slow, sexy drawl.</p><p>She arched an eyebrow in surprise. \u201cYou dance?\u201d</p><p>He gave her a wounded look. \u201cMy mama taught me to dance just fine.\u201d</p><p>Holly laughed and scooted her chair back. \u201cBy all means, let\u2019s dance. I can\u2019t two-step, but if your mama taught you, you can teach me.\u201d</p><p>Ryan led her onto the floor, his hands curving possessively around her hips. His fingers splayed out over the curve of her ass and tucked into her back pockets. He pulled her close to him, until she fit perfectly in his groin.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we too close for the two-step?\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cWho cares,\u201d he growled into her ear. \u201cI like you just where you\u2019re at.\u201d</p><p>She felt his cock swell against her belly, and a thrill shot through her system. Her knees went weak with wanting. She trembled against him and wrapped her arms around his waist.</p><p>He nuzzled his face into her hair and blew gently over her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou are evil,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDon\u2019t think I won\u2019t get you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live in hope.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>Feeling bold, she slid one hand between their bodies, wiggled her fingers into the waistband of his jeans and down to his hard cock.</p><p>\u201cJesus, woman.\u201d</p><p>He mashed their bodies closer together, and she laughed again.</p><p>\u201cAfraid someone will see?\u201d</p><p>His response was to fuse his lips hotly to hers. She was robbed of air as Ryan feasted hungrily on her mouth. When he pulled away, his eyes glittered with desire, molten lava about to explode. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat answer your question?\u201d</p><p>A tug at her waist prevented her reply. She turned to see Adam cutting in, a cocky expression on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re hogging her, little brother.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLater, babe,\u201d Ryan said, promise etched in his eyes.</p> <p>Adam tugged her into his arms, a wicked grin on his face. \u201cYou two trying to make it on a public dance floor?\u201d</p><p>She blinked innocently at him.</p><p>\u201cOh, I saw your hands down his pants, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cHell yeah. Only I don\u2019t want your hands there. I want those sweet lips wrapped around my dick.\u201d</p> <p>Her body jolted at his explicit words. Her nipples hardened to the point of aching. He smiled a slow, satisfied smile. \u201cAre we turning you on, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this a plan y\u2019all have hatched?\u201d she demanded. \u201cTry to make me as horny as possible in the middle of a restaurant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it working?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell yes,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>He chuckled and nipped playfully at her ear with his teeth. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Another tug at her waist, and she moaned in protest. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair and you both know it,\u201d she complained.</p> <p>\u201cAre you wet?\u201d Ethan whispered as he took her into his arms. \u201cAre you imagining the three of us licking, sucking, biting, fucking...?\u201d</p><p>She groaned low in her throat. \u201cOh my God, you have to stop,\u201d she said weakly. \u201cCan\u2019t we skip dinner?\u201d</p><p>He laughed, low and husky. \u201cOh no, doll. We have all night.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and thunked her head against his chest. \u201cI\u2019m so going to make you all pay for this. I\u2019m gonna give prick tease a whole new definition.\u201d</p><p>He threw back his head and laughed. \u201cSomehow I think I\u2019ll enjoy whatever punishment you come up with.\u201d</p><p>He picked his head up and looked over her shoulder. \u201cFood\u2019s here.\u201d</p><p>She looked over to where Adam was motioning to them.</p><p>She walked back over and wilted into her chair. She shot them all dirty looks and ignored their innocent grins.</p> <p>\u201cOhh, this smells heavenly,\u201d she said as she sniffed the delicious aromas floating over the table.</p><p>\u201cTry mine,\u201d Ryan offered, holding a fork out to her.</p><p>She examined his offering. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBacon wrapped shrimp in butter sauce.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmmmm.\u201d She opened her mouth and he gently tucked it between her lips.</p><p>\u201cSuch a sweet mouth,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He extended his finger and wiped a small bit of butter from her lip then slid his finger into her mouth. She sucked at his finger, swirling her tongue around the tip.</p><p>\u201cWitch.\u201d</p><p>She withdrew, smirking at him.</p><p>She cut into her steak and savored each and every bite of the tender meat. In between bites of her own food, the men gave her samples of their entrees, each one given with a dose of sensuality that left her weak and aching. She\u2019d never existed in such a haze of sexual awareness. Each look, each touch sizzled and burned, awakened a powerful yearning within her.</p><p>She knew they were drawing attention from nearby tables, and she didn\u2019t care. Let them look. How could she possibly feel awkward about something that felt so intrinsically right? Never in her life had she felt with such absolute conviction that she was where she needed to be.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, doll?\u201d</p><p>She smiled at Ethan, allowing the full force of her contentment to shine.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking how perfect this evening is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd to think it\u2019s just getting started,\u201d Ryan murmured.</p><p>Adam slid his hand over to rest on her thigh. His thumb drew lazy circles above her knee, and his fingers slipped further between her legs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re having a good time, baby.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back in the chair, her glass of wine in hand. She sipped leisurely at it.</p><p>\u201cAnyone up for dessert?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Three pair of eyes sizzled over her skin. She shivered in reaction.</p><p>\u201cI know exactly what I want for dessert,\u201d Ethan drawled.</p><p>Her cheeks blazed, and her legs clenched together to squelch the unbearable tightening in her pussy.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to taste you,\u201d Ethan whispered. \u201cSo sweet. Soft.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe we should go,\u201d she mumbled.</p><p>\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>She shot him a dirty look. Then she leaned over, brushing her breasts against his arm. She dipped her hand low, slid it over his thigh, between his legs until she cupped his bulge in her hand. She squeezed gently, kneading and fondling.</p><p>\u201cNot a thing,\u201d she said sweetly.</p><p>He stood and hauled her up next to him. \u201cNever let it be said I didn\u2019t accommodate a lady. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>The ride home was quiet. Tension radiated throughout the vehicle, and Holly\u2019s legs stayed tightly pressed together. Her clit pulsed and hummed. If she so much as touched herself there, she\u2019d go off like a rocket.</p><p>When they arrived at the hotel, she walked to the elevator on shaky legs. Once inside, Ryan pulled her against him, his hands fumbling with her jeans.</p><p>\u201cOff,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an elevator,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He gave her a wicked grin as the elevator did a slow rise to the third floor. \u201cDon\u2019t make me rip them off you.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed then quickly shucked her shoes and jeans. Oh God, don\u2019t let anyone be going up!</p><p>Ryan unbuttoned his jeans, pulled them down then hoisted Holly up in his arms. In the time the elevator climbed to the sixth floor, he had sunk his cock deep inside her.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and buried her face in the curve of his shoulder. His palms cupped her ass, squeezing, lifting as he plunged deeper.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t going to last. She was too aroused from the night of teasing.</p><p>The elevator whooshed open and Ryan started forward, his steps measured as he worked around his jeans that were pulled down to his hips.</p><p>She\u2019d never experienced such a rush. Ryan buried deeply within her pussy, walking down a public hallway of a hotel, knowing someone, anyone could walk out and see them at any time.</p><p>Adam walked in front, and behind them, Ethan carried Holly\u2019s shoes and jeans.</p><p>She moaned, biting her lips to keep the cries of pleasure at bay. She gripped Ryan harder and rocked her hips closer in to him.</p><p>Adam opened the door and Ryan walked inside, carrying Holly. Ryan pressed her to the wall next to the bathroom, reminiscent of their interlude in the barn. Holly couldn\u2019t hold on any longer.</p><p>Her stomach tightened, her pelvis constricted, every muscle in her pussy exploded in pleasure. She cried out as Ryan\u2019s mouth smashed into hers. He rocked her against the wall, driving harder.</p><p>She was adrift in mindless pleasure, her body drawn as tight as a bowstring. And still she kept climbing.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s mouth slid down her neck, nipping and sucking as his hips rocked between her thighs.</p><p>\u201cLet go,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll catch you. I\u2019ll always catch you.\u201d</p><p>His words, so heartfelt, were her complete undoing. She splintered into a hundred different pieces, each going a different direction. The room blurred and slipped out of focus, and she went limp against Ryan.</p><p>He gathered her tighter in his arms, his body going rigid as his own release gripped him. Slowly, with extreme care, he lowered her until her legs released his waist and her feet hit the floor.</p><p>As Ryan stepped away, Adam curled an arm around her waist and guided her toward the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cFirst a nice, hot shower. Then we have plans for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean there\u2019s more?\u201d she asked weakly. Honestly, if there was much more, she was going to live a very short life. How much pleasure could one woman stand?</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cOh yeah, baby. The night is just beginning.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Seventeen</p><p>Holly closed her eyes as Adam gently washed her body under the hot spray of the shower. He kissed and sucked in between rubs and strokes until she was very nearly out of her mind with pleasure.</p><p>When his hands slipped between her legs, delved into the soft folds surrounding her clit, her entire abdomen clenched and spasmed. He ran his fingers through the layers, thumbing her clit as he gently soaped the curls.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she begged.</p><p>\u201cPlease what?\u201d he asked as he removed his hand.</p><p>\u201cOh God, don\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>He chuckled and reached over to turn the water off. He stepped out of the shower, and she watched in unabashed appreciation as water beaded and ran down his muscular body.</p><p>He quickly ran a towel over his naked skin then reached back into the shower for her. He wrapped the large towel around her body and pulled her into the front of the bathroom. He dried her skin then her hair then tossed the towel aside, leaving her naked in front of him.</p><p>He wrapped his big hands around her waist and hoisted her up onto the counter by the sink. She looked at him in surprise as he gently spread her legs, baring her pussy to his hands and his eyes.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this for some time,\u201d he said as he reached into the small overnight bag that housed their toiletries.</p><p>She watched in fascination as he took out a razor and a small can of shaving cream.</p><p>\u201cJust the thought of your pussy all pink and bare, smooth and soft...makes me hard every time,\u201d he said in a husky voice.</p><p>She shivered, small goose bumps dotting her skin.</p><p>He slid a finger into her wet center then moved it upward, parting her folds as he went. Then he bent his head and sucked her clit into his mouth.</p><p>She nearly shot off the counter, her body convulsing at the out of control sensation that shot through her belly.</p><p>He lifted his head back up and grinned.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so mean,\u201d she complained.</p><p>He laughed then wet a washcloth in the sink beside her. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the mirror as he began applying the cream to her pussy.</p><p>His strokes were feather light, each one making her clench her teeth a little harder. Teasing, soft, not hard enough to make her come, each touch drove her crazier with lust.</p><p>Several torturous minutes later, he stepped back. He ran a finger over her bare skin and murmured his satisfaction.</p><p>\u201cEthan and Ryan are going to be very pleased,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAnd you?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cOh baby, I couldn\u2019t be any more pleased with you.\u201d</p><p>He reached forward and plucked her off the counter and carried her into the sitting area of the suite.</p><p>Ethan and Ryan both sat sprawled on the couch. Naked. Looking so absolutely delicious, she wanted to run her tongue over their entire bodies.</p><p>And then it hit her. She had to be dreaming. None of this was real. She\u2019d wake in a few hours, be back in the mess that was her life, drenched in sweat from the most wonderful dream she\u2019d ever had in her life. Depressed as hell because it was all a fantasy.</p><p>Ethan must have seen the dismay on her face. His eyes darkened in concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s that look for, doll?\u201d</p><p>She glanced between both of them, then to Adam who still held her tightly in his arms.</p><p>\u201cIs this real?\u201d</p><p>She had to ask. What woman could possibly believe such a fantastic thing could happen to her?</p><p>Adam\u2019s hand slipped over her hip and pinched hard on her ass.</p><p>\u201cOw!\u201d she exclaimed. \u201cWhat was that for?\u201d</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI pinched you. Still think you\u2019re dreaming?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head in amazement. \u201cIf I am, I hope I never wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPut her down, Adam,\u201d Ryan drawled. \u201cI want to see the finished product.\u201d</p><p>She slid down Adam\u2019s body until she was on her feet. Ethan crooked his finger at her, and she walked to where they sat on the couch.</p><p>She felt bare. Exposed. The current of air that blew over her bare skin tickled and tingled.</p><p>Ethan leaned forward, sliding a finger over her belly, around her navel, down the centerline of her body to the newly shaved skin of her pussy.</p><p>\u201cJust like I imagined. Pretty. Pink. So soft. I can\u2019t wait to taste you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan pulled her down to him until she straddled his big body. He sucked one taut nipple into his mouth then the other. Then he swung her over until she lay on the couch between him and Ryan, her head on Ryan\u2019s lap. Ethan slid down until his mouth was level with her hips.</p><p>Firmly, with hands that sent sensation racing up her body, he parted her thighs. He blew gently over the swollen skin. A chill crawled up her spine until she shook to rid herself of it.</p><p>His tongue darted out, and she moaned as it made contact with her quivering pussy. He used his fingers to part the flesh, and his tongue delved deeper.</p><p>\u201cSweet. So sweet,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>He folded her legs and pushed her knees to her chest, completely baring her to his touch and sight. His fingers explored her, then he sank one inside her. Withdrew. Then two took the place of one.</p><p>He moved his fingers back and forth as he sucked her clit into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the taut flesh. She quivered and shook, her legs going weak, her belly convulsing.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s hands went to her breasts, tweaking her nipples until they were stiff and erect. Adam stood to the side, his arms folded across his broad chest. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Ethan continued his sensual assault between her legs, until her entire body was bathed in sweat. She arched into him, so close to coming again.</p><p>Then his head came away. Ryan\u2019s hands fell to the couch. Her body heaved with exertion. She started to protest, but Adam was there, pulling her up.</p><p>\u201cOn your knees,\u201d he directed, helping her into position. \u201cThere. Put your hands on the back of the couch. Let your feet dangle off the edge of the cushions.\u201d</p><p>She positioned herself according to Adam\u2019s instructions, kneeling so that her head faced the back of the couch. Her hands slid over the edge as she looked away from the men.</p><p>Adam walked around until he faced her. His cock was inches from her mouth. She moved toward it, wanting to taste him, wanting him to slide it to the back of her throat.</p><p>His soothed his hands through her hair, caressing her face, running the tips of his fingers around her lips.</p><p>Behind her, she felt hands move over her buttocks, dipping into her pussy, spreading her legs. She burned with need.</p><p>Adam gathered her hair in one hand, collecting it in a makeshift ponytail at the back of her head. With the other hand, he guided his cock into her mouth. She closed her eyes and savored the taste and feel of him sliding along her tongue.</p><p>\u201cYesss,\u201d Adam hissed out. \u201cYou feel so good, baby. Just like that. Take it deep.\u201d</p><p>As Adam began to work his cock in and out of her mouth, Ethan slid into her pussy. She made soft sounds of appreciation as the two men worked in unison. They were exquisitely gentle. She gave up complete control to them, allowing them to set the pace. She merely felt. Enjoyed the thrill of their seduction.</p><p>Adam let his hand fall, allowing her hair to cascade over her shoulders. Then he withdrew from her mouth, and she whimpered in protest.</p><p>Ryan walked around to replace Adam. Adam disappeared from her view as Ryan sank into her mouth. Ethan caressed her hips, holding her as he slowly thrust within her. Then he too withdrew, and cool air blew over her exposed pussy.</p><p>Then she felt Adam\u2019s hands close around her waist. They skimmed the surface of her skin and settled possessively on her buttocks. He massaged then spread her ass cheeks and settled his lubricated cock at her anal opening.</p><p>The broad head of his penis penetrated the tight muscle and sank inward with a soft pop. Inch by inch, he pressed forward until his taut abdomen rested against her behind.</p><p>She licked and nibbled, swirled her tongue around Ryan\u2019s cock as he sank his fingers into her hair. She was buffeted between the two men, their cocks deeply within her body.</p><p>Her hands curled tightly around the edge of the couch, her fingers bloodless from the pressure. Suddenly Ryan withdrew. Her head came up in surprise as Adam grasped her by the waist and picked her up, his dick still seated within her ass.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d</p><p>He turned until she was faced away from the couch and then he slowly eased himself down until he sat on the couch, her on top of him.</p><p>He leaned back, spreading her legs. The fullness in her rear was all consuming. Hot. The pinch of pain was heady. She rode a fine line between the most unbearable pleasure she\u2019d ever experience and the bite of erotic pain.</p><p>Ryan stepped between her widespread legs and fisted his cock with one hand. She finally understood the position Adam had put her in.</p><p>She relaxed her body against Adam\u2019s chest, letting her head fall back until her cheek rested against his.</p><p>Ryan bent and pressed the head of his dick to her pussy, exerting pressure until he slid into her tightness. The fullness was more than she\u2019d ever experienced. Ryan leaned into her until she was sandwiched tightly between him and Adam. Then Ryan began to thrust.</p><p>They fit together like a dream. Adam cradled her body with his, absorbing the motion of Ryan\u2019s thrusts along with Holly.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful, so giving,\u201d Adam whispered against her ear. \u201cYou were made for us.\u201d</p><p>She reached back and curled her arms around Adam\u2019s neck, stretching between the two men. She closed her eyes as Ryan\u2019s mouth found her nipple.</p><p>She tuned into the multitude of sensations wracking her body. Currents of fire arced through her like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>\u201cCome for me,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI want to watch you.\u201d</p><p>Cradled between the two men, their bodies worshipping hers, Ryan\u2019s husky words washing over her like fine wine. She let go. Allowed herself to free fall into the dark abyss that rushed up to claim her.</p><p>She felt tugged in forty different directions as her body jumped and spasmed. She closed her eyes to black out the splashes of color so bright in her vision.</p><p>It was if someone cut a tightly pulled rubber band. Her body melted into Adam\u2019s. She heard soothing words against her ear, but couldn\u2019t make sense of them.</p><p>Hands stroked up and down her slick body as Ryan pulled gently away. Adam rotated her underneath him, her belly flat to the sofa. He pushed forward, thrusting slowly into her. Once, twice and then she felt his release flood into her. Then he eased from her.</p><p>\u201cMy turn,\u201d Ethan said above her as he scooped her into his arms.</p><p>She sagged limply against him, wondering what else they could possibly do that could top this.</p><p>Ethan walked into the bedroom and laid her on the bed. Something warm and slick splashed onto her back. Then gentle hands began to massage her tired muscles.</p><p>She moaned in pure satisfaction. So she was wrong. It could get better.</p><p>Chapter Eighteen</p><p>Holly wiped the palms of her hands on her jeans as they stood in the reception area of the lawyer\u2019s office. So much was riding on what the guys\u2019 friend would tell them.</p><p>Logically, she knew there was nothing Mason could do to prevent the divorce. Make things difficult? Yes. But he could not simply prevent it from happening. She hoped her threat was enough to persuade him not to contest.</p><p>Her money was another issue, but her parents had put it in trust, and unless she gave the money to Mason, he had no claim on it. But it didn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t try.</p><p>She closed her eyes and shuddered. Would she ever be free of her horrible mistakes?</p><p>Warm, comforting hands squeezed her shoulders. Ethan. Already she could recognize his touch. Distinguish it from Adam\u2019s or Ryan\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much, doll. We\u2019ll take care of this. I promise.\u201d</p><p>She turned around and smiled weakly. \u201cI want it to be over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. And it will be.\u201d</p><p>A tall, well-dressed man appeared in the waiting room. He crossed to where Adam stood and extended his hand.</p><p>\u201cAdam, it\u2019s damn good to see you again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCal,\u201d Adam returned.</p><p>Cal turned to shake hands with Ethan and Ryan then settled his gaze on Holly.</p><p>\u201cYou must be Holly.\u201d He smiled warmly at her, and she relaxed some.</p><p>She extended her hand and shook Cal\u2019s. \u201cThank you for seeing us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d He turned and extended a hand toward the hallway. \u201cIf you\u2019ll all come this way to my office, we can get started.\u201d</p><p>Adam reached for Holly, and she went willingly into his embrace. His hand squeezed her waist comfortingly as they followed Cal into a large, expensively furnished office.</p><p>Cal gestured for them to sit down then settled behind his mahogany desk. \u201cAdam has filled me in on most of the details.\u201d He looked up at Holly. \u201cMay I call you Holly? Somehow I don\u2019t think you\u2019d like to be called Mrs. Bardwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, please, call me Holly,\u201d she said huskily.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cOkay, Holly.\u201d He opened a folder and pulled out a sheaf of papers. He slid them along the polished surface of the desk in her direction.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you look over and sign these so I can get the ball rolling. Your case is pretty straightforward. If there aren\u2019t any complications or objections, you\u2019re divorce can be final in as little as ninety days. Obviously if problems arise, it will go longer.\u201d</p><p>Holly stared down at the papers in front of her. It sounded so simple. Ninety days. She could be free in three months.</p><p>\u201cWhat if...what if he doesn\u2019t agree?\u201d she whispered. \u201cI mean what if he won\u2019t sign the papers?\u201d</p><p>She looked up at Cal, trying to keep the fear from her expression. She wanted to appear calm and confident, but inside she was a wreck.</p><p>\u201cThen we kill him,\u201d Ryan muttered.</p><p>Cal chuckled. \u201cAs much as I like Ryan\u2019s idea, we\u2019ll leave it in the hands of the legal system. Once your husband is served, he can do one of three things. He can sign the papers, he can ignore them or he can hire a lawyer and show up in court to contest.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and put a hand over Holly\u2019s. \u201cNo matter what he does, though, he can\u2019t prevent you from divorcing him. All he can do is delay the inevitable. Remember that.\u201d</p><p>Holly blew out her breath. \u201cThank you.\u201d It was all she could manage without betraying how badly she was shaking. She felt like standing up and yelling. Finally she was taking a proactive stance in deciding the course of her life. And it felt damn good.</p><p>She glanced sideways at Adam, Ethan and Ryan, unable to keep the small smile from tugging at her lips. Then she looked back at Cal. \u201cIs that all? I don\u2019t have to do anything else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Cal said.</p><p>She paused for a moment and took in several steadying breaths. \u201cWill I...will I have to face him in court?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>The answer came from at least three different sources and she turned in all directions.</p><p>Cal chuckled. \u201cNo. If he opts to go to court that is his prerogative, but you aren\u2019t asking him for anything. There\u2019s nothing to dispute, so I doubt he\u2019ll want to appear, and if so, I will appear on your behalf as your counsel.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, felt her entire face relax. The more she tried to contain her joy, the wider she felt her face split. Adam slipped a hand up and down her back then rested his palm on her shoulder and squeezed.</p><p>Cal looked intently at her. \u201cThis will end soon, Holly. You have my assurances.\u201d</p><p>A tear slipped down her cheek. She wiped it away impatiently, not at all sure why she was crying. She was thrilled. She was relieved.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d she said again.</p><p>Adam stood beside her and reached across the desk to shake Cal\u2019s hand. \u201cWe appreciate everything, Cal.\u201d</p><p>Cal also stood. \u201cI\u2019m glad to do whatever I can. You know that. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>Holly followed the men out of the office. Ryan hung back in the hallway and immediately pulled her into his arms. She hugged him back, feeling just as relieved as he seemed to be.</p><p>\u201cWant to find a salon now?\u201d Adam asked as they stepped out into the cold air.</p><p>She bobbed her head enthusiastically. They walked over to the Land Rover and Holly slid into the front seat. She let out a long whoosh of air and briefly closed her eyes.</p><p>\u201cFeel better?\u201d Ethan asked from the back.</p><p>She opened her eyes and swiveled her head to look at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>\u201cI know I feel better,\u201d Ryan muttered. \u201cThe sooner she no longer bears that bastard\u2019s last name, the better.\u201d</p><p>Holly wrinkled her brow. She hadn\u2019t considered the issue of last name. Once she was divorced, would she resort to her maiden name? She didn\u2019t see how she could take Colter since it wasn\u2019t exactly legal to marry more than one man. But at the same time, she wanted to belong to them, didn\u2019t want to be viewed as merely a lover or a girlfriend.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about, baby?\u201d Adam murmured as he started the engine.</p><p>She paused not wanting to admit exactly what had crossed her mind. It seemed presumptuous at best. She hated the insecurity that crept in despite her best efforts to keep it at bay.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but couldn\u2019t make the words come out. \u201cNothing,\u201d she said with a slight stammer.</p><p>Adam braked and shoved it into park halfway out of the parking place. \u201cWhat are you afraid of? What is it you won\u2019t say? You have to know you can tell us anything.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>Adam cupped her chin, rubbing his thumb gently over her jaw. \u201cI hate that you worry so much around us. Now tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe whole name thing,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI just wondered.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWondered what?\u201d Ethan asked leaning forward in his seat.</p><p>\u201cI kind of liked the idea of being a Colter,\u201d she said, her cheeks flaming. \u201cBut I know it isn\u2019t possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Ryan demanded. He grasped the back of her headrest and pulled himself forward until he met her gaze. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it possible?\u201d</p><p>Ethan and Adam also wore questioning expressions.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t exactly marry all of you. Legally. That is if you\u2019d even want marriage. Oh hell, I\u2019m making a mess of this,\u201d she muttered, closing her eyes.</p><p>\u201cBaby, do you doubt how much we want you?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for the briefest of moments then finally shook her head.</p><p>\u201cAs soon as possible you will have our name,\u201d Adam continued. \u201cCall me old-fashioned, but you belong to us. We want you to be a Colter.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBut how?\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cYou\u2019re over thinking this, baby. It\u2019s quite simple. You\u2019ll marry one of us in a legal ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth rounded to an O. How stupid of her. That idea had never occurred to her and yet it made perfect sense.</p><p>\u201cHell, I like the idea that she\u2019s finally talking about us in a permanent sense,\u201d Ethan said.</p> <p>She glanced back at him to see his eyes twinkling. Truth be known, she\u2019d surprised herself. Was she a masochist to jump into another relationship on the heels of extricating herself from her first big disaster?</p><p>This wasn\u2019t a mistake. Couldn\u2019t be a mistake. She wouldn\u2019t allow herself to think it.</p><p>Adam pulled out of the parking lot and drove off down the street. A few minutes later, he pulled into the lot of a sleek-looking hair salon.</p><p>Holly looked over at him in surprise.</p><p>He smiled back. \u201cI asked for recommendations. This place came up several times.\u201d</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him full on the lips then quickly piled out of the Land Rover.</p><p>\u201cHey, it was my idea to ask,\u201d Ethan grumbled as he slammed the back door.</p><p>Holly grinned and gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek. She walked ahead of them into the salon and was greeted by a cheerful lady who looked to be in her forties.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have an appointment,\u201d Holly began.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, honey?\u201d the woman asked.</p><p>\u201cHolly Bar...just Holly,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The woman jotted down something on a pad of paper then beamed up at Holly. \u201cWell, you\u2019re in luck, Holly. I can take you right now. My name\u2019s Jolene. Come on around and let me get you settled in. Then we\u2019ll talk about what you need done, though I can tell you definitely need some color.\u201d</p><p>Holly blinked as the woman herded her around the counter, chattering brightly the entire way. She glanced back at the men who had taken seats in the small waiting area. Adam smiled back at her then winked.</p><p>Jolene whipped a cape out and secured it around Holly\u2019s neck then ran her fingers through Holly\u2019s shoulder length hair. \u201cHoney, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but you need to fire your stylist. This is one of the worst dye jobs I\u2019ve ever laid eyes on.\u201d</p><p>Holly smiled. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I did it. I was in a hurry. Messed it up. Can you fix it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to go blonde?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019d like my natural color back.\u201d</p><p>Jolene studied the strands of hair in her hands for a minute. \u201cSure, I can fix it, honey. Don\u2019t you worry about a thing. Come over to the sink and let me wash it for you.\u201d</p><p>Several minutes later, Holly sat back in the chair, her hair damp from the washing. Jolene began combing her hair out and Holly relaxed.</p> <p>Jolene leaned forward and in a loud whisper said, \u201cNow, honey, I\u2019m not one to pry, but you have to tell me which one of those gorgeous hunks is yours.\u201d</p><p>Holly froze, a smile hovering on her lips. For a brief moment, she considered just pointing out one of them, but why should she care what this woman thought of her?</p><p>\u201cThey all are,\u201d Holly said softly.</p><p>Jolene\u2019s brows shot up. \u201cAll? Oh honey, tell me you\u2019re joking. Surely no woman is that lucky!\u201d She shot Holly an exaggerated wink in the mirror.</p><p>Holly chuckled then blushed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re serious, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Holly nodded.</p><p>Jolene shook her head. \u201cLordy. You have to tell me how you do it. I\u2019d give my eyeteeth for two, much less three men who looked like that.\u201d</p><p>Holly stared at her in amazement. There was no shock or outrage in the woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cWell, never mind, honey, you\u2019re obviously telling the truth. Would you look at the way they\u2019re looking at you? Like they could eat you up for lunch.\u201d Jolene sighed wistfully. \u201cThere was once a time when a man looked at me like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Holly asked, curious at the longing in the other woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cOh, we wanted different things. Or at least I thought I did. I just couldn\u2019t accept what was staring me in the face. Lean back, honey, let me get this cotton around your forehead.\u201d</p><p>Holly dutifully leaned back and waited for her to continue.</p><p>\u201cHe finally got tired of waiting, I guess. Took off on his Harley and I never saw him again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad,\u201d Holly said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how to find him?\u201d</p><p>Jolene looked startled. \u201cWell, I never considered trying to find him. Of course, that was years ago. He\u2019s probably married with a passel of kids by now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe,\u201d Holly murmured.</p><p>Two hours later, Jolene whirled Holly around in her chair to face the mirror.</p><p>\u201cThere you go, honey. What do you think?\u201d</p><p>Holly stared back at her reflection. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d she whispered. No streaks of blonde shone in her light brown hair. The ends had been trimmed and the tresses gleamed in the soft light.</p><p>Jolene beamed back at her. \u201cI thought you\u2019d like it.\u201d</p><p>Holly stood and impulsively hugged the older woman. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>Jolene steered her toward the waiting room. \u201cGo see how your young men like it.\u201d</p><p>Holly walked over to where the brothers sat. Adam stood and reached for his wallet.</p><p>\u201cYou look beautiful, baby.\u201d</p><p>She smiled and ducked her head. She glanced over at Ethan and Ryan who also nodded their approval.</p><p>\u201cWant to hit the shops and buy you some clothes?\u201d Ethan asked. \u201cThere\u2019s several down this street.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d she replied.</p><p>She\u2019d also noticed a boutique specializing in lingerie. A small smile curved her lips and she bit the inside of her cheek so as not to betray her thoughts. She\u2019d love to buy a sexy new outfit and surprise them.</p><p>Ryan held out her coat for her and she slipped it on. As they walked out, Holly caught Jolene\u2019s eyes, and the hairdresser threw her a saucy wink and a thumbs up.</p><p>At first, Holly hurried through the shops, sure that the men would be bored silly watching her clothes shop, but she soon realized they enjoyed seeing her try on new things.</p><p>Her last stop was the lingerie store, and she made the excuse that she needed bras. Inside, she picked out two sexy outfits and grinned in delight at the idea of surprising them when they returned home.</p><p>When she stepped back out, Ryan and Ethan reached for her bags.</p><p>\u201cAdam\u2019s gone over to warm up the Rover,\u201d Ethan explained as they stepped out to cross the street.</p><p>They hurried forward. Out of the corner of Holly\u2019s eye, she saw a sedan pull out from where it had been parallel-parked. She blinked in surprise when it barreled out into the street. Straight for them.</p><p>Ryan and Ethan were a step in front of her, and she threw all of her weight into their backs, desperate to shove them out of the way. In the distance, she heard Adam shout.</p><p>Ryan and Ethan stumbled forward just as the car careened by. Pain exploded in her hip as she felt the hard bumper glance off her leg. She went sprawling, her hands out to brace her fall.</p><p>Chapter Nineteen</p><p>Adam watched in horror as the car struck Holly and sent her spiraling to the street. He yelled her name again as he ran for her. Ryan and Ethan knelt beside Holly, and he shoved his way in. His breath caught in his throat when he saw her beautiful eyes open and stare up at him.</p><p>Her face contorted in pain, and she struggled to get up.</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d he shouted. \u201cNo,\u201d he said in a lower voice when she winced at his tone. \u201cStay there, baby. Oh my God, are you okay?\u201d</p><p>He yanked his cell phone out of his pocket and punched in 911.</p><p>\u201cNo, Adam, don\u2019t,\u201d she protested, holding her hand up. \u201cI\u2019m fine, really. It\u2019s just my hip. The car mostly missed me.\u201d</p><p>Mostly. Jesus. Was she trying to give him a heart attack?</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell was that idiot doing?\u201d Ryan demanded, his voice shaking as he stroked over Holly\u2019s hair.</p><p>Adam shot Ryan a quelling look. The hit-and-run was no accident, and he didn\u2019t want Holly more afraid than she already was.</p><p>\u201cHolly, we need to call an ambulance,\u201d Ethan said gently. \u201cYou could be hurt.\u201d</p><p>By now a small crowd had assembled up and down the street. Adam heard the wail of a siren.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go to the hospital,\u201d Holly said, her eyes pleading with Adam. \u201cLet me get up. I\u2019m only a little banged up.\u201d</p><p>He wavered a moment, his concern for her overriding all else. She moved against Ryan\u2019s hand, trying to squirm her way up.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby,\u201d he cautioned.</p><p>Adam reached down and lifted her easily into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCan you stand?\u201d he asked, unwilling to set her down yet.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine, really. Just a little shaken.\u201d</p><p>With great care, he set her down on her feet. Ethan\u2019s hands came out to steady her as she wobbled the slightest bit. She rubbed her hip with her hand, her fingers catching in the torn material down her leg.</p><p>\u201cThese were my favorite pair of jeans,\u201d she said ruefully.</p><p>Unable to stand it a moment longer, Adam crushed her to him, his arms holding her tightly against him. He drew in several steadying breaths, trying to calm the adrenaline that buzzed through his veins.</p><p>Some son of a bitch had just tried to kill her. He\u2019d bet his entire cabin that it was her soon-to-be-ex-husband. He stared over at his brothers and saw answering rage in their eyes. He put a finger to his lips and they nodded their understanding.</p><p>A police cruiser roared up seconds later, followed quickly by an ambulance. People crowded round as the paramedics examined Holly and the cops questioned everyone.</p><p>An hour later, Holly signed no transport papers, and the crowd began to disperse. The responding officer took the last statement and climbed into his cruiser.</p><p>Holly\u2019s eyes were etched with pain and fatigue. Adam knew she hadn\u2019t been completely honest about the extent of her injuries, and he planned to remedy the situation immediately.</p><p>He tossed the keys to Ethan. \u201cYou drive.\u201d</p><p>He bent and picked Holly up into his arms and cradled her gently against his chest. She didn\u2019t protest, only expelled a weary sigh as she rested her head on his shoulder. He walked over to the Land Rover and eased into the backseat with her.</p><p>Ryan turned around in the front seat, his eyes bright with worry. \u201cAre you all right, Holly?\u201d</p><p>She stirred in Adam\u2019s arms and put out her hand to touch Ryan\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I promise. Just a little shaky now that it\u2019s all over with.\u201d</p><p>But even as she offered Ryan reassurance, Adam could feel the tension in her body, see the pain in her eyes. He knew Ryan could see it too.</p><p>At the hotel, Adam carried Holly to their suite and laid her on the bed. He wanted to see her injuries, make sure she was truly all right.</p><p>Ethan and Ryan crowded in as Adam slowly pulled her tattered jeans away from her body. His hands trembled in rage as he saw the large bruise already forming on her hip and upper leg. Blood from a three-inch gash smeared her pale skin.</p><p>Holly lay still on the bed, her eyes closed as Adam took stock of her injuries. He hated to disturb her, but he needed to know if she hurt anywhere else.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She opened her eyes, her eyelashes fluttering delicately against soft skin. She looked so damned vulnerable.</p><p>\u201cAre you hurt anywhere else?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head slowly.</p><p>\u201cWe need to clean this up,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I draw you a bath, can you soak for a bit and let me clean your leg?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go run the water,\u201d Ethan said. He trailed his hand down her cheek then bent down and kissed her forehead. \u201cBe back in a sec, doll.\u201d</p><p>Adam watched as Ethan walked away with clenched fists. His brothers were as eaten up with worry as he was. And with anger.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s get you out of the rest of your clothes,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>He eased the shirt over her head, careful not to move her more than necessary. Ryan sat at her head, smoothing his hand over her hair.</p><p>Adam felt her begin to tremble. At first, tiny quakes shuddered over her body, but then she began to shake in earnest. Tears leaked from beneath her eyelids, and Adam\u2019s chest tightened.</p><p>He bent over and pulled her naked body into his arms. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now, baby.\u201d</p><p>She hiccupped softly, her breath snagging as she sucked in.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me,\u201d she said as she scrubbed at her face.</p><p>Ryan scowled. \u201cYou had a terrible fright.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHer bath is ready,\u201d Ethan said from the door.</p><p>\u201cCome on, baby. A nice, hot bath will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Adam stood up and carried her into the bathroom. He set her gently down into the sudsy water. She hissed in pain as the water hit her leg.</p><p>Adam cursed under his breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>She slumped against the back of the tub, eyes closed. \u201cYou were right. This feels wonderful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt tomorrow,\u201d Adam said as he knelt beside the tub. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hurt now,\u201d she said wryly.</p><p>Adam reached down with a washcloth and gently began to clean the cut on her hip.</p><p>She turned troubled eyes on him. \u201cYou think it was him, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201cYeah, baby, I do.\u201d</p> <p>She sank lower in the tub, her shoulders hunched in defeat. \u201cHe could have killed Ryan and Ethan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe could have killed you,\u201d Adam growled.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand for anything to happen to one of you,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t stand for anything to happen to you. Now come on, I\u2019ll dry you off and put you to bed.\u201d</p><p>He lifted her from the tub and wrapped a big fluffy towel around her. When they left the bathroom, Ryan caught Holly in his arms and hugged her tightly.</p> <p>\u201cYou scared me,\u201d Ryan said gruffly.</p><p>Holly stretched on tiptoe and curled her arms around Ryan\u2019s neck. She felt incredibly safe in his arms, like nothing could touch her.</p><p>\u201cMake love to me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d Ryan said against her ear.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be gentle,\u201d she said with absolute conviction. She knew of anyone, these men would never hurt her. \u201cI need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCome to bed,\u201d he said, tugging her forward.</p> <p>She went willingly and allowed him to remove the towel that covered her body. He pulled back the covers and gestured for her to get in. She nearly groaned aloud as the soft linens enveloped her.</p><p>She glanced up to see Adam and Ethan standing beside Ryan. Ryan shrugged out of his shirt and climbed in beside her. Adam walked around to the other side of the bed and sank down behind her. Ethan sprawled across the end of the bed, propping himself up on his elbow.</p><p>They weren\u2019t going to make love to her. Even as a teeny bit of disappointment tugged at her, fatigue settled in. She burrowed against Ryan\u2019s hard chest and sighed in contentment as his strong arms curled around her.</p><p>Warm lips sent a shiver up her body as Adam gently kissed her bruised leg.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep, baby,\u201d he murmured. \u201cWe\u2019ll be right here.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes, reveling in their warmth and strength. She couldn\u2019t allow herself to think about what could have happened today. As much as she feared the decision to stay with the brothers, she knew she couldn\u2019t live without them.</p><p>But what if her staying was what brought them harm?</p><p>Chapter Twenty</p> <p>\u201cWe could have lost her today,\u201d Adam said. Anger still surged hotly through his system. He wanted to kill someone. With his bare hands.</p><p>He turned to stare at his brothers. \u201cWe can\u2019t stay here. We can\u2019t protect her here in the city. It\u2019s too open.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Ryan said in a steely voice. \u201cWe should get back home.\u201d</p><p>The three brothers paced the living room of the suite like caged predators. Holly slept a few feet away in the bedroom, the door ajar so they could hear if she wakened.</p><p>\u201cThe question is, what are we going to do about her husband?\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cWe protect Holly and wait for Cal to do his job,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Ryan scrubbed through his hair impatiently. \u201cSomething has to be done. We can\u2019t sit around with our thumbs up our asses. You and I both know this isn\u2019t over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m well aware of that,\u201d Adam said, trying to curtail his irritation. He knew Ryan was as worried as he was. \u201cWe go home and keep our guard up. He\u2019s at a disadvantage on our turf. No one knows those mountains better than we do. When we\u2019re out here in the open, we\u2019re little better than sitting ducks.\u201d</p><p>Ethan nodded in agreement. \u201cI saw something in Holly\u2019s eyes I didn\u2019t like tonight. More than fear. It was the knowledge that something she did could have harmed us. I don\u2019t want her thinking that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t do anything,\u201d Ryan snarled.</p><p>Ethan held his hands up. \u201cI didn\u2019t say she did, Ryan. Back off. I just know what she\u2019s thinking, and I don\u2019t like it. She thinks she\u2019s the reason for all of this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEnough,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThe important thing is we get Holly back to the cabin and make damn sure one of us is with her at all times. We don\u2019t want to do anything that could complicate a divorce. As soon as it\u2019s final, then we can figure out the best way to deal with the asshole.\u201d</p><p>A sound from Holly\u2019s room called a halt to the conversation.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Ryan said. Before Adam or Ethan could respond, Ryan strode across the room.</p><p>\u201cHe loves her,\u201d Ethan said quietly.</p><p>Adam nodded, satisfaction filling his chest. Getting close to Ryan was as hard as peeling a pit bull off your ass, but once Ryan allowed someone in, he embraced them wholeheartedly. And he was fiercely protective of those he loved.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019ll watch over her well,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cWe all will,\u201d Ethan corrected.</p><p>Adam checked his watch. Two A.M. But he wasn\u2019t going to sleep much tonight. If it weren\u2019t for the fact Holly needed to rest, he\u2019d head them all out now and get out of town. Back to their cabin.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get some rest?\u201d Ethan offered. \u201cI\u2019m wide-awake. I\u2019ll hang out here and make sure everything stays quiet.\u201d</p><p>Adam expelled his breath in a long whoosh. \u201cAll right. I doubt I\u2019ll sleep, but I\u2019ll kick back for a few hours. We\u2019ll drive home in the morning.\u201d</p><p>Adam shuffled into the bedroom. He glanced over to see Ryan wrapped around Holly, their legs entwined. Ryan\u2019s hand rested possessively on Holly\u2019s hip, his fingers splayed out over the curve of her ass.</p><p>Ryan opened his eyes and stared at Adam from an angle. Adam lifted his brow in silent question. Ryan nodded, signaling all was well with Holly. Adam shucked his boots and jeans and quietly crawled into bed on the other side of Holly.</p><p>She stirred restlessly beside him, scooting her backside into his stomach. He kissed her bare shoulder then nuzzled his face around her hair before relaxing onto the pillow.</p><p>But when he closed his eyes, all he saw was the car hitting Holly. Over and over. His heart raced and a knot grew in his throat. How close they\u2019d come to losing her.</p><p>He\u2019d been lax, they all had, but it wouldn\u2019t happen again. He\u2019d sworn to protect Holly from the moment she\u2019d appeared in their lives. And already he\u2019d failed her.</p><p>Holly eased out of the bed, wincing as her leg bore the full brunt of her weight. She contorted her body, looking down at the dark purple bruise and the tender gash that slanted diagonally from her hip.</p><p>Warped amusement burbled up. Her first thought had been she felt like she\u2019d been hit by a car. At least now she had good reference for the old clich\u00e9.</p><p>She stretched and rotated her shoulder. She felt old and decrepit, as stove up as a ninety-year-old woman. But at least she was alive. No thanks to Mason.</p><p>She limped toward the bathroom, wondering where the guys were. The digital clock on the bedside table told her it was early. She carefully dressed, brushed her teeth then ran a brush through her hair. She still looked like hell, but at least she felt marginally better.</p><p>A noise at the door caused her to look up. Ryan stood in the doorway to the bathroom, staring intently at her.</p><p>\u201cI thought I heard you. How are you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cStiff and sore, but considering the circumstances, it could be a lot worse, so I\u2019m grateful.\u201d</p><p>Warring emotions swirled in Ryan\u2019s eyes. Anger, concern, and what looked like fear. She put down her brush and walked silently into his arms. She wrapped herself around him, hugging him tightly.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, Ryan. Really.\u201d</p><p>Strong arms nearly squeezed the life out of her. Against her cheek, his heart thudded in his chest.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do if anything happened to you,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>She leaned back, tilting her head up to look at him. \u201cBut nothing did,\u201d she said lightly.</p><p>He cupped her cheek in his hand then leaned in to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d he murmured against her lips.</p><p>She opened her mouth to respond, but the words stuck in her throat. Instead, she kissed him back, allowing their tongues to mingle and swirl.</p><p>He pulled away then rested his forehead on hers, their noses and mouths barely an inch away. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt that kind of fear since I left Iraq,\u201d he admitted.</p><p>She reached up and tangled her hand in his hair, smoothing it over his ears. She bumped and rubbed her nose to his playfully. Then she kissed his lips. \u201cLet\u2019s put it behind us and go home,\u201d she said.</p><p>Fire ignited in his eyes. \u201cHome sounds damn good to me. Adam and Ethan have already packed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me get the rest of my things then,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYou go on out and let the others know you\u2019re okay. I\u2019ll finish packing for you,\u201d he offered.</p><p>She smiled and ran her hand over his cheek once more. He caught her hand and kissed each fingertip before allowing her to pull it away.</p><p>She left the bathroom smiling. Not even the pain and stiffness in her hip could overshadow the happiness she felt. When she entered the living area of the suite, Adam and Ethan both looked up from where they sat.</p><p>Ethan stood and met her halfway, enfolding her into his arms. \u201cHow are you feeling today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay, just a little sore.\u201d</p><p>He urged her over to where Adam sat, and she curled onto the couch between them.</p><p>\u201cSorry to cut our trip short, baby, but I think it\u2019s best if we head home this morning,\u201d Adam said, regret creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready to go home,\u201d she said firmly.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Glad you think of it as home.\u201d</p><p>Ryan trudged out of the bedroom, suitcase and carry-on bag in hand. \u201cEverything\u2019s out of the bedroom,\u201d he announced.</p><p>Adam turned back to Holly. \u201cI thought we could get something to eat on the way. I\u2019d like to get out of town as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m ready when you all are.\u201d</p><p>She eased up from the couch. Ethan stood beside her and wrapped an arm around her waist.</p><p>\u201cRyan and I\u2019ll go down with the luggage and warm up the Land Rover. Give us a few minutes then meet us out front. I\u2019ll pull around to the entrance,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Ethan nodded, and Adam and Ryan collected the bags and walked out.</p><p>\u201cYou sure you\u2019re feeling okay today, doll?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m sore, but the more I move, the better I feel.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m sorry we didn\u2019t look out better. It should have never happened.\u201d</p><p>She scowled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault. Any of yours.\u201d She sighed and leaned further into his embrace. \u201cI just hope it\u2019s over soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt will be, doll. It will be.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-One</p><p>They arrived in Clyde by noon and Adam pulled into the small parking lot of the sheriff\u2019s office. Holly looked less than thrilled when she realized where they\u2019d stopped.</p><p>\u201cWe need to tell Lacey what\u2019s going on so she can be on the lookout for Mason,\u201d he explained. \u201cIf she sees him, she can let us know. Added protection.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut will she?\u201d Holly asked softly, turning her wide eyes on him. \u201cTell us, I mean?\u201d</p><p>The question hung between them, hovering in the air.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why we need to involve her,\u201d Ryan spoke up.</p><p>Adam ignored Ryan. \u201cDo you trust me, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know I do,\u201d Holly said. \u201cIt\u2019s her I don\u2019t trust.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen know I\u2019d never do anything to endanger you.\u201d</p><p>Holly stared back at him for a long moment then nodded.</p><p>Satisfaction rolled and flexed inside him. He reached over and squeezed her hand. \u201cCome on, this won\u2019t take but a second.\u201d</p><p>Holly sucked in a deep breath and opened her door to get out. Personally, she\u2019d rather pluck her fingernails off one by one than have to deal with the jealous redhead.</p><p>The four trekked into the small building and Lacey looked up from where she sat behind her desk. She lifted a brow in question as Adam strode across the floor toward her.</p><p>Holly hung back, and Ryan slipped his arm around her neck, letting his hand dangle loosely over her shoulder.</p><p>Lacey stood, her eyes warily glancing over Adam and beyond to where Holly, Ryan and Ethan stood.</p><p>\u201cAdam,\u201d she said nodding in his direction. \u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got a problem, Lacey. We could use your help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMason Bardwell,\u201d Adam said harshly. \u201cWe have reason to believe he\u2019s trying to kill Holly.\u201d</p><p>Lacey leaned back against her desk and folded her arms across her chest. \u201cYou sure about that, Adam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure. Now can we expect help from you?\u201d</p><p>She swept her gaze up and down Holly before her eyes darted back to Adam. \u201cYeah, whatever I can do. You know that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI need to know if you see him,\u201d Adam said. \u201cImmediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t want me to detain him?\u201d Lacey asked. \u201cYou want to press charges?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t have proof. Yet,\u201d he added.</p><p>\u201cYou gonna hole up at the cabin then?\u201d</p> <p>Adam nodded. \u201cFor now. Until we\u2019re sure Holly\u2019s safe.\u201d</p><p>Something that looked remarkably like hurt flashed in the other woman\u2019s eyes. Holly felt a pang of sympathy. It was obvious Lacey had feelings for Adam, and just as obvious that he didn\u2019t return them.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll keep my eyes open, and I\u2019ll tell my deputies to do the same,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cBut if he shows up, don\u2019t do anything stupid, Adam. You call me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll do whatever it takes to ensure Holly\u2019s safety,\u201d Adam said evenly. \u201cI won\u2019t make any promises as to how that happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood enough. I\u2019ll check in on y\u2019all when I\u2019m up there next.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks, Lacey. We appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>He tipped his Stetson in her direction then turned to face Holly and the others. \u201cLet\u2019s get on home now.\u201d</p><p>Holly glanced back at Lacey one more time before she followed the guys out. Unmistakable dislike glittered in the other woman\u2019s eyes, and Holly didn\u2019t look away, unwilling to be intimidated. Finally Lacey\u2019s gaze fell, and Holly walked out.</p><p>\u201cWe should stop by Riley\u2019s and ask him to keep a look out as well,\u201d Ethan said as they piled into the Land Rover.</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019ll stop and run in. You all can wait in the truck.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, they drove out of Clyde after stopping at Riley\u2019s. When they finally pulled into the drive of the cabin, Holly expelled a long sigh of relief. She\u2019d never been so happy to be anywhere before.</p> <p>She walked inside with the guys and promptly sagged onto the couch. She reached for the afghan strewn to the side and pulled it up to her chin.</p><p>\u201cCold, doll?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>She nodded and snuggled deeper into the couch.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll build a fire.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll case the perimeter,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go with you,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI need to check on the horses anyway.\u201d</p><p>Holly watched as they walked out the back door then she turned to Ethan and arched her brow. \u201cCase the perimeter?\u201d</p><p>Ethan chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s Ryan\u2019s way of saying he\u2019s going to check out the property, make sure nothing\u2019s been disturbed and probably set a few traps.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTraps?\u201d she echoed.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s ex-military, doll. He thinks like a soldier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll come for me here?\u201d</p><p>His eyes softened. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but if he does, we\u2019ll be prepared.\u201d He headed toward the back door. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m going to get some wood for the fire.\u201d</p><p>She settled back against the sofa cushions and closed her eyes. She was home. She\u2019d done it. She\u2019d sought a divorce from Mason. The ball was rolling, and all she had to do now was wait until she was free. And then she could begin her life with three men she wasn\u2019t sure she could live without.</p><p>Over the next few weeks, Holly became more convinced than ever that she had made the right decision. She was happy. Happier than she\u2019d ever been in her life. As great as the sex was, there were plenty of nights when they just enjoyed each other\u2019s company. Those were some of her favorite times.</p><p>They played games. Talked about good times. Eased further into their lives together. Whatever reservations Holly\u2019d had about committing to three men, they were fast disappearing.</p><p>One day after a fresh snowfall, Holly went riding with all three brothers. They took her further up into the high-country where they hunted elk every fall.</p><p>There on top of a plateau, Holly understood what it was that had drawn the brothers to the mountains here. She remembered Ryan\u2019s statement that there wasn\u2019t another place as pretty as the Rockies. He was right. If there was, she hadn\u2019t seen it.</p><p>Her life had taken such a drastic turn. Never would she have imagined that her spoiled existence would take her to a rustic cabin high in the Rockies. It was only now she realized how fake her entire life had been. Devoid of reality.</p><p>She\u2019d floated through her young adult life with no goal, no direction, no aim. Here, in the arms of three men, instead of feeling like she\u2019d traded one dependency for another, she felt alive and free. Capable of making her own decisions. Encouraged to be strong and stand on her own.</p><p>She sat on her horse, high above the valley and stared out over the horizon. Behind her, she knew Adam, Ethan and Ryan waited, but they didn\u2019t rush her, and she wasn\u2019t in any hurry to leave the magnificent view she beheld.</p><p>There was no explanation for the change she felt blossoming within her. It surged and swelled until it was all-encompassing. It demanded release. Wanted acceptance. Wanted her to acknowledge it.</p><p>For the first time in longer than she could remember, she felt completely at peace with the direction of her life.</p><p>Adam exchanged looks with his brothers. They all wore expressions of satisfaction. Holly had greatly changed from the scared, wary woman he\u2019d rescued from the ditch. In her place stood a strong, confidant woman.</p><p>He was exceedingly proud of her. They all were. He couldn\u2019t imagine a better mate for them.</p><p>She turned around in her saddle, her brown eyes all soft and warm.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen anything more beautiful,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her breath came out in a visible cloud in the cold air. He disagreed with her. He\u2019d seen something more beautiful. He was looking at her.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see it in the fall when all the aspens are in color,\u201d she added.</p><p>He smiled back at her. He got a ridiculous thrill every time she mentioned the future. He felt like an adolescent with a first crush. He knew his brothers weren\u2019t any more immune than he was.</p><p>She nudged her horse away from the ledge and drew abreast of him and his brothers.</p><p>\u201cI could stay here forever.\u201d</p><p>He smiled again at her use of forever. He was turning into a goddamn pussy. And liking it at that. God help him.</p><p>\u201cYou are staying here, forever,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe can come up here as often as you like.\u201d</p><p>She smiled sweetly at him, delight shining in her eyes.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you say we head back?\u201d Ethan spoke up. \u201cI\u2019ll make us some hot chocolate, and we can play Monopoly. I want revenge for the last time Holly cleaned me out.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s laughter rang out over the mountainside. White flurries began drifting downward, and Holly\u2019s eyes lit up in delight.</p><p>\u201cMore snow!\u201d</p><p>They all smiled indulgently at her and turned their horses back toward home. As they continued, the snow began to fall harder. They\u2019d get several inches before it was over with. Added to the six they\u2019d already received, they\u2019d get quite the dump before the night was over.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Two</p><p>It had the makings of a perfect evening. The snow had finally stopped falling, leaving the landscape covered in a fresh blanket of white. A fire blazed in the hearth, and Holly sat on the floor playing Monopoly with Ethan and Ryan. Adam shut down the computer and ambled over to sit behind Holly.</p><p>He stroked her hair, enjoying her interaction with his brothers. Yes, it was a perfect night. So it shouldn\u2019t have surprised him when the phone rang.</p><p>He sighed in disgust and dropped his hand from Holly\u2019s hair.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t answer,\u201d she said huskily, turning to smile at him sweetly.</p><p>For a moment, he almost heeded her request. But it could be Cal calling with news, or it could be Mom and Dad. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back,\u201d he said, dropping a kiss on her upturned lips.</p><p>He shoved himself from the floor just as the phone quit ringing. Before he could settle back down, his cell phone started buzzing.</p><p>Fuck. Whatever it was, it must be important.</p><p>He walked over to the computer desk and flipped open his cell phone.</p><p>\u201cAdam here,\u201d he said shortly.</p><p>\u201cAdam? It\u2019s Lacey. Look, I need your help. All of you if you can swing it. I\u2019ve got a missing kid. Fresh snowfall\u2019s made it impossible to pick up any tracks. I could use you.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Damn. The last thing he wanted to do was trek out into the cold, but he couldn\u2019t very well leave a child out to freeze to death.</p><p>\u201cWhere do we need to come?\u201d he asked in resignation.</p><p>\u201cMeet me in town. We\u2019re organizing our search here at headquarters. And listen, Adam. Bring your rifles. We have reason to believe this is an abduction.\u201d</p><p>Adam shut the phone and looked up to see three pair of eyes watching him.</p><p>Holly uncurled her legs and stood up. She walked over to him, worry creasing her brow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Behind her, Ethan and Ryan also stood, their attention focused solely on Adam.</p><p>\u201cThat was Lacey,\u201d he said. He glanced down at Holly to gauge her reaction.</p><p>She frowned slightly but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><p>\u201cWhat did she want?\u201d Ryan demanded.</p><p>\u201cShe needs our help. Got a kid gone missing and with the fresh snowfall, they can\u2019t get any tracks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMan...\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cYou have to go,\u201d Holly said softly. \u201cI mean, you have to find the child.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded.</p><p>\u201cYou go on. I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d she said, hugging her arms around her.</p><p>\u201cOne of us should stay,\u201d Adam said, looking to his brothers for confirmation. \u201cHolly shouldn\u2019t be alone.\u201d He didn\u2019t want to alarm her, but there was no way they\u2019d leave her unprotected with her husband out there. The incident in Denver was still too fresh in his memory.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cYou and Ethan go on.\u201d</p><p>Adam nodded. \u201cAll right.\u201d</p><p>He enfolded Holly in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back as soon as we can, baby.\u201d</p><p>She reached up on tiptoe and kissed him. \u201cBet your ass you will.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. Then he turned to Ethan. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p><p>Ethan brushed his lips across Holly\u2019s hair then hurried over to the closet where they kept their gear.</p><p>Five minutes later, they walked out the door and got into the Land Rover. As he backed down the drive, heaviness settled in his chest. He couldn\u2019t explain the feeling, but worry nagged at him.</p><p>Holly turned to Ryan as the door closed and spread her arms out. \u201cJust you and me.\u201d</p><p>He grinned and sauntered over to her. \u201cI can think of worse things.\u201d</p><p>Her heart turned over in her chest.</p><p>\u201cOh, the things I\u2019m going to do to you,\u201d he said wickedly.</p><p>She smiled and shoved him playfully. \u201cOh no, bad boy, what I\u2019m going to do to you.\u201d</p><p>He raised a brow. \u201cI think I like the sound of that.\u201d</p><p>She fluttered her eyelashes. \u201cMeet me. Bedroom. Five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He reached out to grab her, but she darted from his grasp. She ran for the bedroom, shrieking with laughter. \u201cFive minutes!\u201d she called back.</p><p>She shut the door behind her and headed for the closet where she\u2019d hidden the sexy lingerie she\u2019d bought in Denver. She pulled the silky, peach camisole top from the tissue where it was wrapped then snagged the matching silk shorts.</p><p>Quickly shimmying out of her jeans and shirt, she danced out of the closet on one foot as she thrust the other into the shorts. She tossed her hair with her hand and headed into the bathroom for a quick check.</p><p>The smiling, laughing girl in the mirror was a long way from the tattered, scared rabbit who\u2019d run for her life just weeks ago.</p><p>She picked up a brush and ran it through her now light brown hair. She only had about one minute before Ryan would break down the door. She dropped the brush and scurried out of the bathroom and headed for the bed.</p><p>To her surprise, Ryan was there waiting for her. Naked.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re bad,\u201d she scolded. \u201cYou were supposed to wait five minutes.\u201d</p><p>He grinned sheepishly at her. \u201cTelling time has never been my strong point.\u201d</p><p>She stood there, hand on her hip.</p><p>\u201cCome here,\u201d he ordered.</p><p>\u201cI ought to make you wait,\u201d she grumbled as she crawled up the bed.</p><p>He curled an arm over her waist and rolled her underneath him in one smooth motion. His lips rested an inch above hers, and he lowered them until they brushed across her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou look hot in that outfit,\u201d he rasped. \u201cIt\u2019s a damn shame I\u2019m going to have to take it off so quickly.</p><p>She laughed. \u201cA terrible shame.\u201d</p><p>He pulled at the top until it bared one breast.</p><p>\u201cI love your nipples. They\u2019re perfect. Pink. So feminine.\u201d</p><p>He rolled his tongue across the puckered tip. \u201cThey taste as sweet as they look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a miserable tease,\u201d she groaned out.</p><p>He tugged at the camisole top until the straps fell down her shoulders. He continued to pull at it until it gathered around her waist. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI could suck them all night.\u201d</p><p>He licked and nipped at the stiff points. His tongue circled one, outlining it in a wet trail. Then he sucked it between his teeth and exerted firm pressure with his mouth.</p><p>The bite of pain mixed with the nearly unbearable pleasure had her squirming restlessly beneath him.</p><p>\u201cI like having you at my mercy,\u201d he murmured. \u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to have to tie you up and have my wicked way with you. I bet Adam and Ethan would love it as well.\u201d</p> <p>Oh Jesus. She didn\u2019t think it was possible for her to become any more aroused, but she was so wrong. Images of her bound, subject to their every whim and desire sent threads of desire through her pussy and deep into her pelvis.</p><p>\u201cYou like that idea, I see,\u201d he teased.</p><p>Yeah, she liked that idea. Too damn much if her reaction was any clue.</p><p>He scooted down her body and pulled at her lacy waistband with his teeth. As more of her skin was bared, he licked and nibbled at the sensitive flesh.</p><p>Finally, he pulled her underwear all the way down and threw them over his shoulders. Then he moved back up her body, spreading her legs as he went.</p> <p>He settled between her legs, his large cock nestled in the hot wetness of her pussy. She quivered in response, every nerve ending on fire.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>She felt him swell even larger between her legs.</p><p>\u201cGod, I love it when you talk dirty,\u201d he muttered.</p><p>She grinned and sank her teeth into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDamn, woman, are you trying to make me come before I ever get inside you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019d hurry your ass up, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cImpatient little minx.\u201d</p><p>He shifted over her, put a hand between them and guided himself to her entrance.</p><p>\u201cMuch better,\u201d she said with a breathless sigh.</p><p>\u201cI ought to make you wait.\u201d</p><p>She bit him again. \u201cFuck me.\u201d</p><p>He surged inside her in one powerful stroke. He gathered her tightly in his arms, held her close as his hips began undulating between her legs.</p><p>\u201cHarder,\u201d she urged.</p> <p>\u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cWuss.\u201d</p><p>He yanked at her hair. \u201cWatch it, wench.\u201d</p><p>He pushed himself up off her and grasped her legs in his hands. He doubled her knees to her chest and withdrew, arced above her.</p><p>He slid forward inch by agonizing inch until she was breathless with wanting. Then he plunged deep, his hard thighs slapping against her butt. She gasped at the depth.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d she gasped when he paused.</p><p>He grinned down at her. \u201cNot so cocky now, are we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so going to get you back for this,\u201d she gritted out.</p><p>He pulled back and stopped. She bucked her hips, trying to seat him fully again.</p><p>\u201cFuck me,\u201d she begged.</p><p>He groaned and slid into her again. \u201cI love a woman with a potty mouth.\u201d</p><p>She laughed.</p><p>He began to thrust harder, setting a breathtaking pace. She tried to catch up, to breathe, but she was robbed of air.</p><p>He let her legs go and they slumped to the side. She wrapped her arms around him, pulling him as close to her as she could. Then she circled his waist with her legs, locking him into place.</p><p>They kissed hotly, wetly, their tongues imitating the sliding motion of his cock in and out of her pussy. His hands tangled roughly in her hair as he pulled her mouth to his.</p><p>Urgency mounted in her groin. Her orgasm raced upon her with speed she\u2019d never experienced. There was no slow build to the finish. It exploded around her in a violent surge. Every muscle in her body strained painfully and then released like an arrow from a bow.</p><p>Ryan thrust powerfully against her, his hips rocking her forward on the bed. \u201cOh, damn,\u201d he strained out.</p><p>Yeah, damn. She collapsed beneath him as he surged forward again, his seed rushing into her body. His hips twitched and jerked as he continued to jet his release.</p><p>Finally he slumped between her legs, his forehead resting on hers. His breaths came in jerky spurts as he sucked in mouthfuls of air.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill me,\u201d he groaned.</p><p>\u201cBut what a way to go,\u201d she said.</p><p>He rolled to the side of her and drew her into his arms. \u201cWant me to draw you a bath?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNo, I\u2019d much rather stay right here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wore me out,\u201d he complained.</p><p>\u201cWhiner.\u201d</p><p>He tweaked her nipple with his free hand. \u201cWatch your mouth or I\u2019ll slide my dick in it to shut you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPromises, promises,\u201d she chided.</p><p>He chuckled and rested his chin on top of her head. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou going to get the lights or shall I?\u201d</p><p>He groaned but slid out of bed and padded toward the light switch. Before he reached it, the lights flickered and went out, plunging the room into darkness.</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d she called out in a wavery voice.</p><p>Icy dread snaked down her spine. She knew he hadn\u2019t flipped the switch. He hadn\u2019t even touched it yet.</p><p>Ryan strode back to the bed. He reached down for his jeans and threw her clothes onto the bed. \u201cGet dressed,\u201d he commanded.</p><p>She hurried out of bed and pulled the camisole over her head. She reached for the underwear and thrust a leg into them.</p><p>\u201cCome with me,\u201d Ryan said, reaching for her arm.</p><p>He hustled her down the hallway, his arm curled protectively around her.</p><p>\u201cIs it the weather?\u201d she asked as they entered the living room.</p><p>Ryan bent over the desk and dug out a flashlight. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>Fear formed a hard ball in her stomach. \u201cWhat is it then?\u201d</p><p>He turned to her, his face barely outlined in the darkness. \u201cListen to me. I want you to go into the guest bathroom and lock yourself in. There\u2019s no windows. Stay until I come get you.\u201d</p><p>Terror swept over her. \u201cRyan, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>He bent and kissed her hard, taking her breath. \u201cGo.\u201d</p><p>She ran. Through the dining room and down the other hallway where all the guestrooms were situated. She felt her way in the darkness, her hands sliding down the walls. She threw open the door to the bathroom and rushed in, slamming it behind her.</p><p>She bolted the lock then felt around in the darkness. The counter, the rim of the toilet. She fumbled with the seat and quietly set it down then sat and hunched forward, hugging her knees to her chest.</p><p>Hours passed or was it minutes? It felt like an eternity. Where was Ryan? There was no sound, only the suffocating cape of darkness.</p><p>Then she heard footsteps. Slow, wary footsteps. Closer they came until they stopped outside the door. She sucked in her breath and battled the panic that threatened to overtake her.</p><p>\u201cHolly, it\u2019s me. Open the door.\u201d</p><p>She surged from the toilet and yanked open the door. She threw herself into Ryan\u2019s arms. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve checked the house, the grounds. The fuses are fine, no cut wires. Must be trouble in the line.\u201d</p><p>She sighed in relief. \u201cI was scared.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. Come on out into the living room. I want you where I can see you. I\u2019ll build up the fire.\u201d</p><p>She followed him down the hallway, her hand tucked securely into his. As they stepped into the living room, a shadow darted into her line of vision. Before she could react, a shot rang out and Ryan jerked. He fell to the floor inches from her feet.</p><p>Holly screamed. Oh God, Ryan had been shot! She dropped to the floor, uncaring of the danger to her. \u201cRyan! Ryan!\u201d she screamed.</p><p>She ran her hands across his chest, and they came away warm and sticky. Blood.</p><p>Pain exploded in her head as someone yanked her up by her hair. She reacted in fury, kicking and hitting. The dark figure threw her away from him, and she hit the wall. Before she could run, he was on her. He backhanded her across the face, knocking her to the floor.</p><p>She lay there stunned, pain flashing in her vision. The attacker yanked her hands behind her and slapped handcuffs on her. She struggled wildly, but he had her pinned beneath his knee. He bent her legs, putting them together then he snapped a pair of cuffs around her ankles.</p><p>\u201cGet off me, you bastard!\u201d she shrieked.</p><p>He slapped her again then shoved a cloth in her mouth. Then he tied a bandana around her head, securing the gag. With his knee still squarely in her back, he fumbled for a minute then she heard the beeping of a phone. He was calling someone. Who?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah. Taken care of.\u201d He paused for a minute. \u201cI\u2019m taking her to the cabin. It\u2019s remote. No one will find her, and I\u2019ll make sure all loose ends are tied up.\u201d</p><p>He clapped the phone shut then grabbed her arms and hauled her up. \u201cYou and I are going for a ride, bitch.\u201d</p><p>He dragged her toward the door, and she stared back at Ryan, straining to see him in the dim light. Tears flooded her eyes. Ryan. Oh God. The bastard had killed him.</p><p>Sobs welled in her throat, escaping around the gag. A blast of cold air washed over her naked legs as the attacker pulled her outside into the snow. Her skimpy nightwear offered no protection from the biting cold.</p><p>As if she were nothing, the man threw her over his shoulder and headed for the road. A few minutes later, he stopped and dumped her into the ditch.</p><p>She looked up to see a dark vehicle, an SUV of some type. The man yanked open the back then turned to pull her up. He threw her into the back, and she landed with a thump, all the breath knocked from her.</p><p>He slammed the door, and seconds later, she heard the driver\u2019s door open and then the engine started.</p><p>Grief and rage poured over her, swirling, a storm she couldn\u2019t control. She ignored the cold, her injuries, she could only think of Ryan lying lifeless on the floor.</p><p>The SUV rounded a corner, jostling her. Something smooth and cool slid into her chin. It took her a moment to realize it was a cell phone. He must have dropped it when he threw her in the back.</p><p>Her heart beat furiously as she tried to figure out a way she could use the phone. Her hands were secured behind her back, her legs were handcuffed, and the cloth was stuffed in her mouth.</p><p>First the gag had to go. She slid her head repeatedly on the floor, trying to move the bandana down her head. After several agonizing attempts, she felt the bandana slip and loosen. She scrubbed her cheek until finally she worked the bandana down around her neck.</p><p>She chewed and worked her tongue, shoving the cloth from her mouth. Finally it fell and she sucked in huge breaths, trying to make the panic subside.</p><p>Getting the phone open would be tricky. She rolled and contorted her body, flipping over to her other side. She wiggled her fingers, reaching, straining for the phone. Her fingers slid over the surface, and she dug her fingers into the seam until finally she cracked it open.</p><p>She glanced her fingers over the buttons, feeling for which was which. Awkwardly, she pushed one, then another until finally she had the sequence of Adam\u2019s cell phone number inputted. Then she felt for the send button, praying she guessed right.</p><p>As soon as she pressed the last button, she rolled and squirmed, rotating back over until her mouth and ear were close to the receiver.</p><p>Let him answer, she prayed. Let him answer.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Three</p><p>Bitter cold pierced Adam\u2019s heavy coat. They\u2019d finally been able to pick up a faint trail in the snow about a mile outside of town. He and Ethan shined their floodlights over the terrain, moving as quickly through the drifts as possible.</p><p>Heavy, wet flakes fell, covering the tracks almost as quickly as they could find them.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a shed just ahead,\u201d Adam shouted back to Lacey who was bringing up the rear.</p><p>He waded through the last heavy drift and shoved his way to the ramshackle shed a few feet away. He grabbed his gun sling and hauled his rifle over his shoulder until his hand curled around the stock.</p><p>Ethan shuffled up behind him, rifle trained on the door.</p><p>\u201cShine the light, I\u2019ll go in,\u201d Adam directed.</p><p>He counted to three then rammed his shoulder into the rickety wooden door. It shattered and Adam stumbled inside. Ethan rushed in behind him, light raised, gun sweeping the area.</p><p>\u201cThere, in the corner!\u201d Adam exclaimed.</p><p>Lacey burst in behind them, her pistol drawn. \u201cFind anything?\u201d she asked breathlessly.</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t respond. His attention was focused on the small child huddled in the corner of the shed. Dropping to his knees in front of the boy, Adam reached out and touched the child\u2019s cold skin.</p><p>To his relief, the boy stirred and opened his eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d Adam murmured.</p><p>Lacey immediately began barking orders into her radio as she relayed their position. She requested EMS and told the dispatcher to inform the parents the child had been found.</p><p>\u201cSam,\u201d Adam said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to take you home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bad man said I couldn\u2019t go home,\u201d Sam stuttered out. \u201cNot until...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot until what?\u201d Lacey demanded.</p><p>Sam\u2019s brow furrowed in confusion, his lips shook with the cold. \u201cSaid I had to serve my purpose. What\u2019s that mean?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Adam looked at the others and shrugged. What sicko had taken the child and left him here in the cold to freeze to death?</p><p>He reached down and picked Sam up, cradling him in his arms. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take you home now, Sam. Your mama\u2019s been awfully worried.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let the bad man hurt her,\u201d Sam mumbled against Adam\u2019s shirt.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, son. He can\u2019t hurt your mama.\u201d</p> <p>Sam raised his head. \u201cNot Mama. The woman. The bad man said he had to take care of a woman.\u201d</p><p>Icy prickles danced up Adam\u2019s spine. He glanced over at the others, tendrils of dread clinging to him like a vine. \u201cTake him for me,\u201d he directed Ethan.</p><p>After Ethan hefted the boy into his arms, Adam dug for his cell phone. He punched in his home number and waited as it rang. He let it ring twenty times before he closed his cell phone. He swore softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night,\u201d Lacey offered. \u201cThey\u2019re probably asleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah and my signal sucks,\u201d Adam said, trying to dispel the heavy foreboding that swelled in his gut. \u201cI\u2019ll try again when we get to town.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReady to head out?\u201d Lacey asked as she secured the rope to the rescue sled.</p><p>Ethan laid Sam down and arranged blankets around him. Then he and Adam took the rope and began pulling the sled through the snow. It was at least an hour trek back to town, and Adam carried a knot the size of a softball in his stomach.</p><p>Forty-five minutes later, out of breath and slogging much slower through the snow, Adam and Ethan stopped a moment to rest.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not much further now,\u201d Lacey said.</p><p>Adam nodded, too winded to speak. The peal of his cell phone ringing rent the night air. Adam dropped the rope and dug frantically for his phone.</p><p>He flipped it open. \u201cThis is Adam.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdam...\u201d Holly\u2019s voice, faint and wavery, filtered through the line.</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d Relief surged through him.</p><p>\u201cAdam, thank God.\u201d Her voice got a little stronger. \u201cI don\u2019t have much time.\u201d He could hear tears, thick in her voice, and his pulse began pounding in his head. \u201cHe killed Ryan,\u201d she sobbed.</p><p>Adam\u2019s blood ran cold. \u201cHolly, Holly, baby, where are you? Are you all right?\u201d he shouted.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where I am,\u201d she said, her voice desperate. \u201cHe took me. Please come get me.\u201d Her voice broke.</p><p>\u201cYou bloody bitch, give me that!\u201d</p><p>Adam held the phone, paralyzed as he heard the scene play out over the phone. Holly cried out. Adam heard the smack of flesh. Then the phone went dead.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus.\u201d</p> <p>Ethan grabbed him by the shoulder. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly,\u201d Adam said hoarsely. \u201cShe said Ryan\u2019s dead. Someone has her.\u201d</p><p>Ethan dropped the floodlight he\u2019d been carrying.</p><p>\u201cWe have to get to the cabin. Ryan. My God.\u201d Adam couldn\u2019t form another coherent thought.</p><p>\u201cYou two go on,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cI can take Sam from here. You\u2019ll go quicker without the sled. I\u2019ll radio for backup, get a car out there as fast as I can. My guys are still out on the east end coming off their search.\u201d</p><p>Adam didn\u2019t wait to hear anymore. He and Ethan began running through the snow. Ryan. Dead. The words hummed over and over, running through his mind in a sick litany.</p><p>The bastard had lured them out, kidnapped a child, and now he had Holly. His blood ran cold. Colder than the snow that wrapped around his legs. Holly would die if they didn\u2019t get to her and get to her fast.</p><p>Ahead, the shine of the town lights glistened off the snow. Adam put on a burst of speed, his single-minded focus to get to the Land Rover as fast as possible. Ethan kept pace beside him, neither voicing the fears uppermost in their conscience.</p><p>The reached the back of Riley\u2019s store and raced around to the parking lot and across the street to where the Land Rover was parked. Several townspeople, including Sam\u2019s parents called out to them, but Adam ignored everything but the Land Rover.</p><p>He threw himself into the driver\u2019s seat, started the engine and threw it into reverse. Ethan barely made it inside before Adam roared down the street.</p><p>The drive up the mountain took forever, and every minute, Adam whispered a prayer. God, don\u2019t take them from me.</p><p>He gripped the steering wheel, taking the turns and switchbacks faster than he ever had. Let him be okay. Don\u2019t take Ryan from us.</p><p>They tore into the driveway, and both men bounded for the door. The house was dark. Adam burst in, shouting Ryan\u2019s name. Ethan shoved past him, flipping at the light switches.</p><p>Ethan swore a blue streak when the lights failed to come on then shouted Ryan\u2019s name again.</p><p>Adam stopped cold when he heard a low moan. He leaped over the couch toward the hallway leading to the guestrooms.</p><p>\u201cGet me a light!\u201d he barked back at Ethan.</p><p>\u201cRyan! Ryan!\u201d Adam threw himself to the floor beside his brother\u2019s crumpled form.</p><p>Ethan appeared with a flashlight and shined it over Ryan\u2019s body. His chest was bathed in blood, but his eyelids fluttered as the light hit his face.</p><p>\u201cRyan, it\u2019s me, Adam. Can you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could I not when you\u2019re yelling in my damn ear?\u201d Ryan grumbled.</p><p>Adam wilted in relief, his body going slack. \u201cYou ornery bastard, you scared ten years off me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly,\u201d Ryan began, his voice cracking. \u201cHe got Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere are you hit?\u201d Adam demanded, not focusing on Holly for just a moment. He had to take care of them one at a time, and at this minute, he had to make sure Ryan was okay.</p><p>\u201cShoulder,\u201d Ryan said, his breath coming in short gasps.</p><p>\u201cCan you get up?\u201d</p><p>Ryan moved then moaned in pain.</p><p>\u201cAdam!\u201d Lacey called from the door. \u201cYou in here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOver here,\u201d Ethan called, shining a light toward her. \u201cHow\u2019d you get here so fast?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI dumped the kid in town and got up here as fast as I could. Jesus Christ, what the hell happened?\u201d she demanded as she knelt beside Ryan.</p><p>\u201cHelp me up, damn it,\u201d Ryan said desperately. \u201cHe\u2019s got Holly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho has her, Ryan?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>He and Ethan lifted Ryan, and Adam wrapped an arm around him so he wouldn\u2019t fall. They guided Ryan to the couch and set him down.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get you to the hospital,\u201d Ethan said.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan, you\u2019re in no shape to be anywhere but in the hospital.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a flesh wound,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI\u2019m not going anywhere with Holly out there with that bastard.\u201d He broke off. \u201cHe hurt her. I heard him hit her.\u201d</p><p>Adam clenched his fingers into tight fists. He\u2019d also heard the asshole strike Holly.</p><p>\u201cWhat else did you hear, Ryan? Did he say anything? We have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe made a phone call. He said something about a remote cabin and tying up loose ends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChrist.\u201d Remote cabin. Like there weren\u2019t enough of those spread out across the Rockies.</p><p>\u201cHe acted like it was close,\u201d Ryan said as he put a hand over his shoulder. Bright red blood smeared across his fingers.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get to the hospital. Lacey, can you make sure he gets there?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going,\u201d Ryan bit out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll only slow us down,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste a minute. He\u2019ll kill her.\u201d</p><p>Ryan looked bleakly at Adam. \u201cI failed her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe thinks you\u2019re dead,\u201d Adam said. \u201cThe best thing you can do is get your ass to the hospital so what she thinks doesn\u2019t come to pass.\u201d</p><p>Ryan surged to his feet. \u201cHow do you know what she thinks?\u201d</p><p>Adam quickly explained the phone call then he made arrangements for Lacey to get Ryan to the hospital. His mind worked furiously, trying to come up with a plan of action.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Ethan.\u201d</p><p>He stopped long enough to collect more ammunition for their rifles then he raced out of the house to the Land Rover. Ethan jumped in beside him.</p><p>\u201cClose, remote cabin. You think he could be taking her to Blythe Meadow?\u201d Ethan asked as Adam roared down the drive.</p><p>\u201cGood call,\u201d Adam said. \u201cIt certainly fits. If not there, maybe the old miner\u2019s cabin. We\u2019ll hit both.\u201d</p><p>Ethan stared out the window in silence. Then he turned agonized eyes to Adam. \u201cWhat if we\u2019re too late?\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head and pressed his foot into the accelerator. \u201cWe can\u2019t be too late, Ethan. We just can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Four</p><p>Holly slowly opened her eyes, surprised at the effort it took. The air was frigid around her, and her jaw ached. She didn\u2019t recognize her surroundings. She was in a one-room cabin, lying on the floor. She tested her arms and found they were free from the handcuffs she\u2019d worn earlier.</p><p>Pale shades of light beamed through the one window. Dawn. So she\u2019d been here at least two hours.</p><p>Tears leaked from her eyelids. Ryan. She\u2019d never even told him she loved him. And now she\u2019d never get that chance.</p><p>A sound startled her then pain assaulted her hip as her captor kicked her.</p><p>\u201cI see you\u2019re awake. Good. Now get up.\u201d</p><p>She gazed warily up at him. It was the first good look she\u2019d gotten of him. She\u2019d expected a mean brute of a man, but she stared at what appeared to be a mild-mannered man of average height and size.</p><p>He smirked as if reading her thoughts.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let my appearance fool you, my dear. Now you can get up of your own accord or I\u2019ll get you up, and I assure you, it won\u2019t be a pleasant experience.\u201d</p><p>Terror washed through her system. She wanted to vomit. She put her hand out to prop herself up and shoved herself from the floor. As soon as she stood, the man grabbed her arm and jerked her toward a chair.</p><p>\u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>She sank down in the chair situated by an old desk. The chair heaved and groaned as she settled her slight weight on it, and for a moment, she feared it would collapse.</p><p>She put out her hand to the desk to balance herself. She was cold. Colder than she\u2019d ever been in her life. There was no heat in the cabin. No protection from the biting cold. Her limbs felt like blocks of ice. She shivered uncontrollably. Once she started, she couldn\u2019t stop.</p><p>The man lit a cigarette and lazily blew smoke. He leaned against the small sink and watched her with cold eyes.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t beat around the bush. I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d</p><p>Panic flooded her. Her throat tightened, and for a moment she couldn\u2019t breathe. She didn\u2019t want to die.</p><p>\u201cBut I\u2019m going to be civil about it.\u201d</p><p>He looked amused at his proclamation. He even emitted a dry chuckle.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll offer you a choice. A very quick, painless death, or,\u201d he paused for effect, \u201cit can be a very messy, very prolonged, very painful death. Your choice.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth went dry.</p><p>\u201cAll you have to do is tell me who all knows what happened on your wedding night. Very simple. Mr. Bardwell is very keen to protect his interests. Which would be difficult in a jail cell, as I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\u201d</p><p>He took out a large, sharp-looking knife as he spoke. He caressed the sleek metal with his fingertips, running them over the edge to the point.</p><p>Holly\u2019s mind raced. He was a talkative bastard. He was clearly enjoying the situation. Obviously if she talked, it would be over with in a matter of minutes. She eyed the knife, abject terror raging through her body.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to summon her courage. She pictured Ryan and bit the inside of her cheek to keep from weeping. She couldn\u2019t allow this bastard to get away with what he\u2019d done.</p><p>\u201cSo what will it be, Mrs. Bardwell? Shall we enjoy a brief conversation before your untimely demise?\u201d</p><p>Her hand splayed out over the desk and she stood to her feet. \u201cGo to hell,\u201d she spat.</p><p>His eyes hardened. He crossed the space between them and without warning, grabbed her arm and yanked it behind her back. He whirled her around until she faced the desk. She cried out in pain as he continued to exert enormous pressure on her arm.</p><p>Higher he pushed. She screamed in agony and then she felt a pop. He\u2019d broken her arm!</p><p>He let go and her arm fell, dangling at her side. Spots dotted her vision, growing larger until she feared she\u2019d black out from the pain. Her hand scraped the desk trying to hold herself upright. Her fingertips brushed across a pencil and she curled her hand around it.</p><p>Rage taking control, adrenaline pumping through her veins, she whirled around, pencil in hand and plunged it into his face. It sank into his cheek, and he stumbled back howling in pain.</p><p>She wasted no time. Ignoring the horrific pain in her left arm, she flew at him, ramming her knee into his groin. Once, twice and a third time until he fell to the floor.</p><p>She didn\u2019t hesitate even for a moment. She ran. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She threw open the door to the cabin and plunged into the snow. Icy wetness met her hips as she scrambled to gain her footing.</p><p>Her heart sank. She\u2019d never make it out alive. The snow was too high. Too deep. She\u2019d freeze to death in her scanty clothing long before she could make it to safety.</p><p>She set her jaw until it ached. She wasn\u2019t going to die at the bastard\u2019s hands. If she died, it wouldn\u2019t be without a fight.</p><p>Ignoring the pain, the cold and the horrible numbness affecting her limbs, she struggled on, determined to put as much distance between her and her abductor as she could.</p> <p>She headed for the trees, hoping to lose herself in the wooded area. A hysterical laugh bubbled from her throat. How could she lose anyone in three feet of snow?</p><p>Her head popped back. She was yanked backwards, a hand wrapped tightly in her hair. She turned on him, fighting tooth and nail. Her survival was at hand.</p><p>Metal glistened in the early morning sun. Then tearing agony exploded in her chest. She fell back into the snow, dimly aware of the man holding a knife above her. Her uninjured arm sank into the snow. Her hand grasped for purchase and knocked against a rock. She gripped it tightly, prepared to make her last stand.</p><p>With a cry of rage, she hauled her arm forward and bashed the man\u2019s head with the rock as he plunged downward with the knife again. This time the knife glanced off her shoulder, cutting a long gash down her arm.</p><p>He fell face first into the snow, and she gave him no time to recover. She rolled, raising the rock high again and hitting him as hard as she could. He went still, and she dropped the rock.</p> <p>She rolled and scooted away, trying desperately to regain her footing. The world tilted and swayed around her, her mind swimming in sheer agony. He\u2019d stabbed her in the chest. She could feel hot blood running over her skin. Her left arm dangled uselessly beside her. Somehow she had to find a way home.</p><p>She stumbled down the hill, away from the cover of the trees. She needed to be in plain sight now. Her only hope was rescue.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She\u2019d never told them she loved them. Hot tears fell, mixing with the blood that ran freely down her body. If only she\u2019d told them.</p><p>Adam drove the Land Rover to its limits. For two hours, they\u2019d searched every nook and cranny of the mountain. There was only one possibility left, and despite his best effort, he was fast losing hope.</p><p>\u201cAround the next bend, take the path off the road,\u201d Ethan directed, his voice grim. \u201cWe have to hope the snowfall hasn\u2019t made the trail impassable.\u201d</p><p>Adam tore around the corner and braked as the turnoff rushed to greet them.</p> <p>\u201cAdam look!\u201d Ethan cried out.</p><p>Adam wasted no time. A fresh trail down the path. One made recently. By a vehicle. He sped up the bumpy incline, slipping and rocking in the snow. The four-wheel drive made quick work of the path, and soon they rounded the bend to the old mining cabin.</p><p>A black SUV glinted in the sunlight. Adam roared to a stop, grabbed his rifle and piled out of the Rover. Ethan followed quickly behind, his gun up and ready.</p><p>Adam frowned when he saw the door wide open. He ducked under the window and peered inside through the entryway. It was empty.</p><p>He and Ethan rushed inside.</p><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s been here,\u201d Ethan muttered. \u201cVery recently.\u201d</p><p>Ethan picked up a still lit cigarette lying on the floor and flicked it away.</p><p>Adam\u2019s heart sank as he looked around. There were visible signs of a scuffle. Blood on the floor. He whirled around and ran out the door, his eyes searching the snow for fresh signs.</p> <p>Deep trenches in the snow led away from the cabin and into the trees in the distance. He and Ethan leapt off the porch and began charging after the tracks.</p><p>A few seconds later, Ethan put a hand out to halt Adam.</p><p>\u201cLook!\u201d</p><p>Ethan pointed to a body in the distance. They ran over to find a man slumped in the snow. Blood seeped from a wound in the back of his head.</p><p>Adam rolled him over. He was unconscious. Hope beat a steady rhythm in his heart. Had Holly been able to escape him?</p><p>Then his eyes came to rest on the dark red blood that stained the snow. Blood that did not come from the man. His eyes followed the splatters across the snow where it continued down the hill.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he shouted.</p><p>They powered down the hill. Adam prayed the whole way. God let them find her. Let her be okay.</p><p>\u201cAdam, there she is!\u201d</p><p>Adam looked ahead in time to see Holly wobble and slump into the snow. He ran the remaining thirty yards, his heart screaming the entire way.</p><p>When he got to her, he reached down and pulled her up to his chest.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d he moaned.</p><p>There was so much blood. It bathed her entire front. Her left arm lay at an odd angle, swollen and discolored.</p><p>\u201cHolly! Holly, baby,\u201d he cried.</p><p>Ethan sank down beside him and helped Adam lift her from the snow.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered weakly. Disorientation clouded their depths. She pushed and shoved, trying to stand.</p><p>She was running on adrenaline, and she was fast running out. She began to shake violently.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going into shock,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe have to get her out of here now. Radio in. Tell them to have the chopper waiting. We\u2019ll have to get her as far down the mountain as we can.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she cried out. \u201cOh God, Ryan.\u201d She struggled weakly against Adam, tears slipping down her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cShhh, baby. Ryan\u2019s okay. I swear it.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t seem to hear him.</p><p>\u201cI never told...I never told them I loved them,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>Adam held her tighter against him. He buried his lips in her hair and blinked back tears. \u201cGod, I love you too, baby. I love you too.\u201d</p><p>He stood up, holding her carefully in his arms. He had no idea the extent of her injuries, but he had to get her down the mountain fast.</p><p>Ethan rushed ahead, clearing a path in the snow for Adam. They struggled up the hill, each step excruciatingly slow. Finally the Land Rover was in sight. Ethan surged forward, redoubling his efforts.</p><p>\u201cGet me the first aid kit,\u201d Adam barked. \u201cI\u2019ll sit in the backseat and lay her down. I need to try and stop the bleeding.\u201d</p><p>Ethan threw open the back and hauled out the first aid kit, several blankets and a wad of bandages.</p><p>As soon as Adam got into the back with Holly, Ethan cranked the engine and roared back down the trail toward the main road.</p><p>\u201cHow is she, Adam? I need to know something,\u201d Ethan said, desperation creeping into his voice.</p><p>\u201cThe bastard broke her arm. Looks like he stabbed her in the chest. Christ, there\u2019s so much blood!\u201d</p><p>Helplessness had him in a firm grip. He kept a finger to her neck, feeling for her pulse. It was weak and erratic, but it still beat against his skin.</p><p>He wadded the bandages in his hand and pressed them to the wound on her chest. He needed to slow the flow of blood.</p><p>\u201cRyan...\u201d</p><p>Holly was only half-conscious and completely unaware of Adam and Ethan. Adam smoothed his free hand over her cheek.</p><p>\u201cRyan\u2019s okay, baby. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head, soft moans rasping from her throat.</p><p>\u201cCold...so cold.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn up the damn heat,\u201d Adam barked at Ethan.</p><p>He gathered the blankets tighter around her, trying to infuse warmth into her body.</p><p>The squawk of the radio interrupted him, and he heard Ethan respond, but Adam\u2019s focus was on Holly and the blood-soaked bandages in his hand.</p><p>\u201cThe chopper\u2019s almost here,\u201d Ethan called back. \u201cThey\u2019re landing in Duffy\u2019s pasture. We\u2019ll be there in about two minutes.\u201d</p><p>Adam sucked in a breath of relief. They were nearly there, and the sooner Holly got to a hospital, the better her chances of survival.</p><p>\u201cAny word on Ryan?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>\u201cLacey said they life flighted him to Denver. Same hospital they\u2019ll take Holly to. They were worried at the amount of blood he lost.\u201d</p><p>Ethan\u2019s voice carried an undercurrent of concern, one that jarred Adam\u2019s nerves all the more.</p><p>\u201cBut he was okay, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSaid he lost consciousness right before they took off. Don\u2019t know any more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes and wanted to howl in fury and frustration. Tears stung his lids, and he shut his eyes even harder to prevent them from leaking out. He\u2019d never felt so damn helpless in his life.</p><p>The two most important people in his life aside from Ethan could be taken from him.</p><p>He grabbed at the seat to steady himself when the Land Rover came to an abrupt stop. The door flew open, and a flight medic peered in.</p><p>The medic yelled back instructions, and two responders ran over with a backboard and jump bag. Adam backed out of the Rover and let them take over.</p><p>A hand slipped over Adam\u2019s shoulder and he turned to see Lacey standing there.</p><p>\u201cI just want you to know how sorry I am this happened, Adam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you are, Lacey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs there anything I can do?\u201d</p><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cWe left the man up at the old mining cabin. He\u2019s probably dead by now. You might want to have a deputy go up and get him.\u201d</p><p>Lacey gave him a sharp look. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill him, did you, Adam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I wish I had,\u201d he returned softly.</p><p>The medics pulled Holly out of the Land Rover and laid her on the backboard. Adam and Ethan ran over but were warded back by the paramedic.</p><p>\u201cThis is a load and go situation, sir. I\u2019m sorry, but we don\u2019t have any time to waste.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s mouth opened, wanting to ask the question, but it stuck. He wouldn\u2019t allow himself to voice it. Instead, he watched as they hustled the backboard onto the chopper. The flight medic jumped in and signaled the pilot to take off. Seconds later, the bird lifted into the air and flew toward Denver.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Adam,\u201d Ethan said in a strained voice. One that sounded very much like he was holding back tears as well. \u201cIt\u2019s a few hours\u2019 drive to Denver.\u201d</p><p>Adam followed numbly behind Ethan and they climbed into the Rover. He was afraid. Afraid of what they\u2019d discover when they arrived at the hospital.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Five</p><p>Adam managed to piss off no less than six people before he discovered where Ryan and Holly were. He\u2019d torn through the busy ER until he\u2019d been threatened with arrest if he didn\u2019t settle down.</p><p>Holly had been taken to surgery, but Ryan was still in the ER where he was receiving a blood transfusion. At first, Adam and Ethan had been told they couldn\u2019t see Ryan yet, but after Adam swore he\u2019d take down the waiting room piece by piece, the nurse had relented and allowed them back.</p><p>Adam shoved into the door, anxious to see his younger brother. Ryan\u2019s appearance shocked him. Beside him, Ethan sucked in his breath as well.</p><p>Pale, haggard, weary lines etched around his eyes, Ryan looked like hell, plain and simple. His shoulder was heavily bandaged, and he had enough wires and lines running from him to keep a small city supplied in electricity.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes fluttered open when the two brothers walked in. His head surged up, pain creasing his brow.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she? Did you find her?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Adam stopped by the bed, his knees weak with relief. There was nothing wrong with Ryan a few days in the hospital wouldn\u2019t fix.</p><p>\u201cWe found her,\u201d Adam said quietly.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d Ryan gritted from behind clenched teeth.</p><p>Adam ran a hand through his hair, trying desperately to maintain his composure.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here. In the hospital,\u201d Ethan spoke up.</p><p>Ryan\u2019s eyes blazed. \u201cHow is she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Ryan jerked his head back toward Adam. He swallowed heavily then opened his mouth. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Adam closed his eyes. \u201cHe stabbed her in the chest. Broke her arm. She\u2019s in surgery. They airlifted her here. We don\u2019t know much.\u201d</p><p>Ryan sank back against his pillows, his face white. Tears streaked down his cheeks. Adam felt a painful twinge in his chest. He hadn\u2019t seen Ryan cry since they were kids.</p><p>\u201cWill she...will she be okay?\u201d he rasped.</p><p>Adam exchanged looks with Ethan. He didn\u2019t want to lie to Ryan, but Ryan was in no shape for this kind of burden.</p><p>\u201cI think she\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Adam said, hoping he hadn\u2019t just lied.</p><p>\u201cI let her down. I failed her,\u201d Ryan said bleakly.</p><p>\u201cI let you both down,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI should have never left either of you. But we can\u2019t think of that right now.\u201d</p><p>Ethan put a hand on Ryan\u2019s uninjured shoulder. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m pissed,\u201d Ryan said angrily. \u201cI let that bastard get the drop on me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did the doc say about your shoulder?\u201d Adam said, pushing the subject firmly back to Ryan.</p><p>Ryan closed his eyes again and sank further into the pillow. \u201cSays I\u2019ll be fine. Gave me two pints of blood, patched up the wound. Wants me to stay a day or two, but overall, he said I was one lucky bastard.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He cracked one eye to stare at Adam. \u201cHow did you find her? What happened? You haven\u2019t told me anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can talk about it later,\u201d Adam said. He was sure he didn\u2019t need to rile Ryan up any more than he already was.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t coddle me,\u201d Ryan said fiercely. \u201cTell me what the fuck happened out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t calm down, you\u2019re going to get us kicked out of here,\u201d Ethan said.</p> <p>They were interrupted when the door eased open, and a nurse stuck her head in. \u201cMr. Colter? Mrs. Bardwell is out of surgery. I thought you\u2019d want to know. She\u2019s in recovery, but the doctor will be down in a few minutes to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen can we see her?\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask the doctor. He knows you\u2019re here. He won\u2019t be long.\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed in frustration. \u201cDo you at least know how she\u2019s doing?\u201d</p><p>The nurse smiled kindly. \u201cShe made it through surgery fine.\u201d</p> <p>His stomach dropped, and for a moment, he thought he might be sick. Relief poured over him so heavy, he had to find a place to sit down quick or he was going to fall.</p><p>He sank into the chair situated by Ryan\u2019s bed and dropped his head into his hands.</p><p>\u201cThank God,\u201d he heard Ethan whisper.</p><p>Adam hadn\u2019t realized just how frightened he was. Not until now. His breath came in sporadic fits as he struggled to calm his raging emotions. He clenched his fingers into fists then curled them outward again.</p><p>Several minutes passed and the brothers sat in silence. Then the door opened and an older man wearing green scrubs walked in. He glanced between the brothers and adjusted his glasses.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here for Mrs. Bardwell?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t call her that,\u201d Ryan growled. \u201cHer name is Holly.\u201d</p><p>The doctor blinked in surprise. \u201cI take that as a yes.\u201d</p><p>Adam surged to his feet and stuck out his hand. \u201cAdam Colter. And yes, we\u2019re here for Holly. How is she?\u201d</p><p>The physician shook Adam\u2019s hand. \u201cDr. Phillips. I performed surgery on Mrs...Holly,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cIs she okay?\u201d Ethan asked anxiously.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing well considering the condition she arrived in. She lost quite a large amount of blood. She suffered a compound fracture of her left radius. She also suffered a six-inch laceration to her left shoulder as well as a severe knife wound to her chest. I repaired some of the damaged tissue and stitched the cut. Luckily the blade missed all her major organs. Two centimeters more to the right and it would have sliced her lung.\u201d</p><p>Adam sat back down heavily. \u201cWhen can we see her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s in recovery. We\u2019ll be moving her to a step down unit, kind of a level below ICU and a step above the floor. I want to monitor her progress for a few days. I don\u2019t see any reason you can\u2019t step in to see her when she\u2019s moved from recovery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll let us know when she goes?\u201d Ethan spoke up.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have the nurse come get you,\u201d Dr. Phillips said.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Adam said. \u201cWe appreciate it.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded and walked back out the door, shutting it behind him.</p><p>Adam turned to Ryan. \u201cWhen are they moving you to a room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Ryan grumbled. \u201cThey poked and prodded on me for damn ever.\u201d</p><p>Adam saw the pain in Ryan\u2019s eyes. He glanced over to Ethan to see if he noticed as well. Ethan\u2019s lips set into a fine line.</p><p>\u201cHave you had anything for pain, buddy?\u201d Adam asked.</p><p>Ryan shot him a dirty look. \u201cFuck no. I wanted to be awake and aware until I knew Holly was safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell you know she\u2019s fine now, so I\u2019m going to call the nurse so she can give you something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d Ryan said through his teeth.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you were shot. It can\u2019t feel that great,\u201d Ethan spoke up. \u201cQuit being so goddamn stubborn and take the medicine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can take it willingly or I swear to God I\u2019ll hold you down while the nurse sticks a needle in your ass,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>\u201cFuck off,\u201d Ryan snarled.</p><p>But Ryan slumped down into his bed, his eyes weary and pain-filled. Adam reached for the call button and pressed. A few minutes later, a nurse bustled in, syringe in hand.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time you let me give you something, young man,\u201d she said with a reprimanding stare in Ryan\u2019s direction.</p><p>She bent over and swabbed the IV port at Ryan\u2019s wrist and swiftly injected the pain medication. She patted Ryan on the arm. \u201cTry and get some rest now.\u201d</p><p>Adam pulled the chair up so he faced Ryan and sat back down. Ethan snared the only remaining chair and positioned it at the foot of the bed.</p><p>\u201cTell Holly...tell her I love her,\u201d Ryan slurred out.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Adam said quietly. \u201cNow get some rest so you can tell her yourself.\u201d</p><p>Ryan\u2019s head slumped and his eyes closed.</p><p>Adam leaned back in his chair and laced his hands behind his head. He stared at the ceiling, the tiles swimming in his vision. He was so tired. He\u2019d aged a decade overnight. Had it only been last night that he\u2019d sat in the living room reflecting on how good life was?</p><p>Things had changed in an instant.</p><p>He and Ethan sat in silence as the minutes ticked by. Ethan looked every bit as tired as Adam felt. But neither would rest until they saw Holly.</p><p>He must have dozed momentarily because the opening door startled him.</p><p>\u201cAre you Adam and Ethan?\u201d a nurse asked.</p><p>Adam scrambled up. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, that\u2019s us.\u201d</p><p>She motioned for them to follow her outside.</p><p>Once in the hall, she turned concerned eyes on them. \u201cWe\u2019ve moved Mrs. Bardwell from recovery, but she\u2019s quite distraught. She\u2019s asking for you. We don\u2019t want to have to sedate her so soon after coming off the anesthesia. Maybe your presence will calm her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Adam demanded.</p><p>They followed the nurse and Adam had to check his stride in order not to pass her. His impatience nearly boiled over as he allowed her to lead them down the twisting halls to the elevator.</p><p>A lifetime later, the nurse entered a large room that housed several smaller cubicles. In the center stood the nurses station where two other nurses walked briskly to and from the cubicles.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bardwell is at the end,\u201d the nurse said.</p><p>She walked down and shoved aside the curtain and gestured Adam and Ethan in. Adam shoved past her. He sucked in his breath as he saw Holly lying in the bed, a multitude of tubes and wires coming from everywhere.</p><p>Quiet sobs emanated from her, and tears spilled down her cheeks. She faced away from him, and he surged forward.</p><p>\u201cHolly. Holly, baby, I\u2019m here,\u201d he said as he approached the bed.</p><p>Ethan followed closely, going to Holly\u2019s other side.</p><p>She closed her eyes and turned further away from Adam.</p><p>Ethan slipped a hand to her hair and bent to kiss her.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re breaking my heart,\u201d Ethan said in a hoarse voice.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she whispered. \u201cOh God, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Adam bit the inside of his cheek to keep from breaking down. He leaned forward, needing to touch her, reassure himself she was alive. \u201cBaby, Ryan\u2019s okay, I swear it. He\u2019s down in the ER waiting for a room.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and moaned, the agony spilling from her throat.</p><p>\u201cDoll, listen to us,\u201d Ethan pleaded. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for you to be so upset.\u201d</p><p>Adam watched her, panic rising fast within him. The nurse hovered in the doorway, concern etched in her face.</p><p>Holly wasn\u2019t cognizant of her surroundings. She was too caught up in her grief. She thought Ryan was dead.</p><p>Adam turned to the nurse as Ethan continued to comfort Holly. \u201cOur brother, Ryan Colter is down in ER waiting for a room. Have them bring his bed up here.\u201d</p><p>The nurse\u2019s brow crinkled. \u201cAbsolutely not. We aren\u2019t set up for a double room here. This is a step down unit. We have to be able to closely monitor our patients.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you the only way you\u2019re going to calm her down is to bring him up here,\u201d Adam gritted out. \u201cI don\u2019t care what you have to do to make it happen. Just do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have that kind of authority,\u201d the nurse protested. \u201cI\u2019ll have to call the doctor in and risk sedating her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ll turn this damned hospital upside down if I have to,\u201d Adam snarled. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me. Not over this. He needs a room. He needs the care. He can come here. There\u2019s room for another bed. Hell, you could put him next door and take down the curtain. I don\u2019t care how you get it done, just do it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t authorize something like that,\u201d the nurse said. \u201cOnly the attending physician can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen call him up here,\u201d Adam demanded. \u201cI want to talk to him. Do it now. We\u2019re wasting time.\u201d</p><p>The nurse retreated, and a few seconds later, Dr. Phillips stuck his head in the door.</p><p>\u201cMr. Colter, what\u2019s going on in here?\u201d</p><p>Adam quickly explained his request. As he spoke, the doctor hustled to Holly\u2019s bedside and took in her quiet sobs. He glanced around the room as if considering Adam\u2019s request. Then he sighed.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t take well to bullying, Mr. Colter. What you\u2019re asking is highly irregular. However, I tend to agree that perhaps the best thing for this young lady is to see your brother. Maybe it will calm her. I\u2019ll have to call the ER physician and arrange it with him, but I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t make an exception this once. Much will depend on how stable your brother\u2019s condition is. I understand he suffered a gunshot wound.\u201d</p><p>Relief flood through Adam. \u201cThank you, Doctor.\u201d</p><p>Adam resumed his position next to Holly\u2019s bed, his hand curling around her uninjured one. Her left arm was surrounded by a cast and her entire chest and left shoulder were swathed in heavy bandages.</p><p>He\u2019d never seen her looking so vulnerable. Tears continued to seep from her closed eyes, and his chest tightened in response. He leaned forward and kissed her temple.</p><p>\u201cI love you, baby,\u201d he whispered. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry I never told you.\u201d</p><p>As he and Ethan kept watch over Holly, she finally drifted off to sleep. Her breathing became more even, and the flow of tears finally stopped. Her head lay limply against the pillow, her face pale with red blotches from the crying.</p><p>A few minutes later, the same nurse Adam had gone up against came bustling in. She eyed him with a look of annoyance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been instructed to open up the cubicle next to Mrs. Bardwell\u2019s. Since I don\u2019t imagine you\u2019ll agree to go home, I\u2019m having a chair and a small sofa brought in as well.\u201d</p><p>Adam eased his scowl. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cThis means the world to us.\u201d</p><p>The nurse\u2019s expression softened. \u201cI know you\u2019re worried about her. But we\u2019re doing our best to take excellent care of her.\u201d Then she grinned a little mischievously. \u201cBesides, chances are your brother would have ended up here anyway. The hospital\u2019s pretty full, and he needs care beyond the floor, but he\u2019s not a candidate for ICU. And from what I hear, he\u2019s not exactly cooperative.\u201d</p><p>Adam\u2019s lips quirked into a smile. \u201cYep, that\u2019s Ryan. But he\u2019ll straighten up when he\u2019s able to see Holly. He\u2019s been pretty worried about her.\u201d</p><p>Within the hour, the curtain between the two rooms had been pulled, and two orderlies hauled in a chair and a sofa and set them between the two beds.</p><p>Thirty minutes afterward, a nurse rounded the corner, pushing Ryan in a wheelchair. She looked less than happy with her charge, and Ryan didn\u2019t look like he gave a fuck.</p><p>She rolled him toward the other bed, but he put his free hand down to jam the wheels. The nurse\u2019s lips pressed together, and she shook her head.</p><p>\u201cInto bed with you, Mr. Colter. You got your way. I took you up in a wheelchair when you shouldn\u2019t be out of bed, but you\u2019ll go now, or I\u2019ll haul you back to the ER.\u201d</p><p>Ryan ignored her, his haunted eyes stroking over Holly.</p><p>\u201cHelp me up,\u201d he said hoarsely, his gaze going to Adam.</p><p>\u201cRyan, you should be in bed,\u201d Adam began.</p><p>\u201cI have to see her,\u201d Ryan said.</p><p>Adam looked at the nurse who shrugged in defeat.</p><p>\u201cDo whatever it is that will get him into bed the fastest,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cGive me a hand, Ethan,\u201d Adam directed. \u201cLet\u2019s make this quick.\u201d</p><p>Adam bent over Ryan, and Ryan curled his good arm around Adam\u2019s neck and pulled himself upwards. Sweat broke out on Ryan\u2019s forehead, and he trembled against Adam. Ryan\u2019s face had gone pasty white, and Adam knew it had cost him dearly to expend so much energy.</p><p>He and Ethan helped Ryan to the bed where Holly lay. Tears filled Ryan\u2019s eyes as he gazed down at her. He reached his hand out to touch her cheek then pulled it back to scrub the moisture from his own face. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d he choked out.</p><p>She stirred in her sleep.</p><p>\u201cRyan,\u201d she murmured. Then tears slid from beneath her lids once more.</p><p>Ryan finally lost the battle to stay upright. He sagged and Adam and Ethan scrambled to catch him. They hauled him over to the bed and with the help of the nurse settled him in. She then proceeded to lug in the IV poles and reattach the lines.</p> <p>She fussed over him for a good hour before finally leaving them alone.</p><p>\u201cPromise me, you\u2019ll wake me when she does,\u201d Ryan said as he stared at Adam in exhaustion.</p><p>\u201cI will,\u201d Adam replied. \u201cNow get some rest. You aren\u2019t any good to her in your present condition.\u201d</p><p>Ryan nodded and closed his eyes. He was asleep before his head fully reclined against the pillow.</p><p>Adam turned and sank down onto the sofa while Ethan took the chair next to it.</p> <p>\u201cWe came close to losing them,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>Ethan nodded. \u201cToo close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething has to be done about the bastard.\u201d</p><p>Again Ethan nodded.</p><p>Adam curled his fingers into fists then flexed them outward again. He repeated the action over and over. \u201cI\u2019ll kill the son of a bitch myself before I let him close to my family again.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Six</p> <p>Holly slowly opened her eyes and blinked a few times to clear the cobwebs. For a moment, she had no recollection of where she was or why she was in such an unfamiliar place. And when she did remember, pain the like she\u2019d never felt crawled through her system.</p><p>Ryan.</p><p>She closed her eyes and tried to remember all that had transpired, but all she could conjure was the memory of Ryan falling, of her hand coming away from his chest covered in blood.</p><p>Hot tears filled her eyes and escaped from her lids. She felt the slow trickle as they trekked down her cheeks. A warm hand cupped her face and gently wiped at the moisture.</p><p>She opened her eyes to see Adam standing over her, a concerned look on his face. She blinked again to bring him into focus. She slowly became aware of the rest of her surroundings. She was in a hospital room. Her gaze darted to her other side where she saw Ethan slumped in a chair asleep.</p><p>Just the fact that Ryan was so conspicuously absent sent another slow crawl of agony through her heart. A sob welled in her throat\u2014one that she tried to call back\u2014it threatened to choke her with its intensity. She was finally forced to let it out.</p><p>It sounded harsh and ugly, even to her own ears. And once released, more surged forth until every breath brought another cry.</p><p>\u201cHolly, listen to me, baby. You have to listen to me. Ryan is okay. He\u2019s not dead. He\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>Adam cupped her chin, forcing her to look at him, piercing her with his green eyes.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d he demanded.</p><p>Then she heard someone in the background.</p><p>\u201cLet me up, damn it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cRyan?\u201d she whispered. It couldn\u2019t be. She\u2019d seen him fall. She\u2019d heard the shot. Felt his blood.</p><p>She struggled to sit up and nearly blacked out as pain lanced through her chest. Adam swore above her and held her down with his hand.</p><p>\u201cEasy, baby. Don\u2019t hurt yourself.\u201d</p><p>Behind Adam, Ryan came into view, his face haggard, eyes bloodshot, his upper half wrapped in bandages. He blurred before her as her eyes swam with tears. She\u2019d never seen such a beautiful sight in her life.</p><p>\u201cChrist, Ryan, you shouldn\u2019t be up,\u201d Adam protested.</p><p>Ryan pushed Adam aside, and in the next moment, Holly felt herself enveloped by Ryan\u2019s body. She pressed her cheek into his chest, the bulk of bandages shoving into her face. She didn\u2019t care. Didn\u2019t care how much it hurt for her to be in such an awkward position.</p><p>He pressed his lips to her forehead. \u201cThank God you\u2019re all right,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He pulled away and Holly grabbed at his hand with hers. \u201cDon\u2019t go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate to break this up,\u201d Adam began. \u201cBut both of you are in a lot of pain and neither of you should be doing anything but resting. Which means get your ass back in bed, Ryan. I want you both well so we can go home.\u201d</p><p>Holly heard the worry in his voice. She also saw the pain in Ryan\u2019s eyes. Her own pain was fast taking over all else. But she had to say it first.</p><p>She reached out her hand to touch Ryan\u2019s face. \u201cI love you. I should have told you before.\u201d</p><p>Ryan caught her hand and pressed his lips into her palm. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d</p><p>Adam wrapped an arm around Ryan and pulled him away. Ryan slumped against his brother. Holly looked up to where Ethan now stood beside her.</p><p>\u201cIs he okay?\u201d she asked in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing better than you are,\u201d Ethan said dryly. He paused for a moment before touching her hair with his hand. \u201cYou scared us, doll.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond. How could she say that they couldn\u2019t have been any more scared than she was? She\u2019d never been so terrified in her entire life. She hadn\u2019t wanted to die with so much regret. Things had become so clear in those horrible minutes in the snow when she was sure she would never see Adam, Ethan or Ryan again.</p><p>\u201cI love you,\u201d she said, allowing all the emotion to escape her in those three little words.</p><p>Ethan bent to press his forehead to hers. \u201cI love you, too, doll. So much. I never want to come that close to losing you again.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes as he kissed her softly on the lips.</p><p>\u201cI hurt,\u201d she said in a low voice.</p><p>Ethan immediately stood upright. \u201cI\u2019ll call the nurse.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, wincing at the effort it took. She felt Adam\u2019s hand smooth up her arm and over her shoulder. He tenderly pushed back the tendrils of her hair over her ear.</p><p>\u201cGet some rest, baby. We\u2019re all right here. We aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Holly heard the nurse come in, felt her fiddle with the IV, and seconds later, Holly felt welcome oblivion seep into her system.</p><p>\u201cL-love you,\u201d she slurred, as Adam\u2019s face weaved back and forth in her shaky vision.</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, baby. Rest now.\u201d</p><p>Over the next several days, Holly slept the majority of the time. Ryan became crankier and crankier until finally the nurses gave up trying to keep him in his bed. On the fourth day, they officially discharged him.</p><p>The same day, Holly was moved from the step down unit to a regular room. Adam finally relaxed. Both Ryan and Holly were out of the woods. Soon he\u2019d have his family back home where they belonged.</p><p>He sat in a chair next to Holly\u2019s bed while she slept and flexed his neck. He rubbed tired eyes and wondered if he\u2019d ever sleep another night until he knew for certain the threat of Holly\u2019s husband was removed.</p><p>Across the room, Ryan sat propped on the couch, several cushions around him. His younger brother hadn\u2019t rested nearly enough after his injury, Adam knew, but short of tying him to a bed, Adam didn\u2019t know how to make Ryan settle down.</p><p>Ethan sat in a chair next to Ryan, fatigue ringing his eyes. They were all so damned tired. They all wanted the same thing. To go home.</p><p>Adam\u2019s cell phone rang, and he hastily scooped it up so it wouldn\u2019t wake Holly.</p><p>He stood and walked toward the door, away from Holly\u2019s bed. \u201cAdam here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdam, it\u2019s Lacey. Is this a bad time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>Lacey hesitated for a moment. \u201cHow are Ryan and Holly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter. They discharged Ryan today and moved Holly to the floor. Both need a lot of rest, but they\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, that\u2019s great, Adam. Look, I called because I thought you ought to know we found the guy who shot Ryan and tried to kill Holly. He\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, tell me about it. I wanted the bastard alive. Adam, you know this makes it hard to pin anything on Mason Bardwell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Adam growled.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d</p><p>Adam sighed and ran a hand through his hair. \u201cDon\u2019t do anything yet. I need to talk to Cal as well as Ryan and Ethan. We can\u2019t take Holly back there if it isn\u2019t safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if my investigation uncovers anything else,\u201d Lacey promised.</p><p>\u201cThanks,\u201d Adam said as he closed the phone.</p><p>He turned around to see Holly studying him.</p><p>\u201cHey,\u201d he said as he walked toward the bed. He bent and kissed her forehead then smoothed her hair from her cheek with his hand. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d</p><p>Her cinnamon eyes stared apprehensively at him. \u201cWho was that on the phone?\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to upset her, but he wasn\u2019t going to lie to her either. \u201cThat was Lacey. The man who hurt you...he\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><p>Something savage flashed across her face.</p><p>\u201cGood. He nearly killed Ryan,\u201d she bit out.</p><p>\u201cHe nearly killed you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow is Ryan?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Adam blinked at the abrupt change in topic. But then Holly\u2019s sole concentration when she was awake was Ryan\u2019s well-being. He knew she was still dealing with the fright of nearly losing him. It was a feeling he was intimately familiar with.</p><p>He glanced over to where both Ethan and Ryan were slumped over asleep.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s resting.\u201d</p><p>Holly closed her eyes for a moment then opened them and nodded her approval. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be out of bed.\u201d</p><p>Adam leaned in to kiss her again. He couldn\u2019t touch her enough. He kissed her, held her every chance he had.</p><p>\u201cI want to go home,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cI know you do, baby. Soon. I promise.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair and settled on the edge of her bed, careful not to jar her too much.</p><p>She seemed to withdraw within herself. Something he\u2019d witnessed with more frequency as she spent more time awake. It worried him. He had no idea what she was thinking.</p><p>He started to ask her, but her eyes fluttered, and she slowly closed them. He sat with her until he heard her soft, even breathing then he eased from the bed and sank down into his chair. He could use a few winks himself.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Seven</p><p>Holly stared at the ceiling, her thoughts in chaos. Adam, Ethan and Ryan were all asleep. They looked uncomfortable as hell, but she didn\u2019t want to do anything to wake them.</p><p>Guilt weighed a ton in her chest. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw Ryan falling again. Her worst fear had been the danger she was bringing to the brothers\u2019 doorstep. A fear that had now been realized.</p><p>It was time for her to make sure nothing more happened to Adam, Ethan or Ryan. Especially Ryan. She loved them all so much. The idea of losing any of them created an unbearable ache in her heart.</p><p>She glanced over at Adam just a few feet away. His cell phone lay on the small table next to her bed. She stared at it for a long moment then slowly reached for it.</p><p>She knew Lacey had been the last to call so her number should be stored. Holly quietly flipped the phone open and punched the series of buttons to pull up the last received call. Then she hit send.</p><p>A few seconds later, Lacey\u2019s voice filtered over the line.</p><p>\u201cLacey? This is...this is Holly Bardwell,\u201d she said in a stronger voice.</p><p>There was a long pause. \u201cWhat can I do for you, Mrs. Bardwell?\u201d</p><p>Holly took a deep breath and checked to make sure she hadn\u2019t already wakened the men.</p><p>\u201cI need you to contact the district attorney for San Francisco County,\u201d she said in a voice just above a whisper.</p><p>Another long pause. \u201cDoes Adam know you\u2019re calling me?\u201d Lacey asked.</p><p>\u201cNo, and I want to keep it that way,\u201d Holly said firmly. \u201cLook, Lacey. I know you don\u2019t like me, but I do know you like Adam. Do you want what happened to Ryan to happen to him? I have to do what I can to keep him safe. Keep them all safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to say to the D.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell him I have some information on Mason Bardwell he would be very interested in. Tell him where to find me. I won\u2019t talk over the phone. It has to be in person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s wise?\u201d Lacey asked.</p><p>If Holly didn\u2019t know better, she\u2019d swear there was actual concern in the other woman\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my only option. I can\u2019t let them be killed because of me.\u201d</p><p>Silence descended between the two women. Finally Lacey spoke.</p><p>\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll make the call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Holly said softly.</p><p>She closed the phone and carefully replaced it. Then she sank into her pillows, exhausted from the energy she\u2019d expended.</p><p>Two days later, the D.A. arrived, two Colorado state patrol officers flanking him. They walked into Holly\u2019s room, eliciting immediate reactions from the brothers.</p><p>Dread tightened Holly\u2019s chest, squeezing her until she struggled for breath. She knew who he was and why he was here.</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is going on?\u201d Adam demanded as he stood to his full height.</p><p>Ethan and Ryan also stood. Heavy tension clouded the room, so thick you could stir it with a spoon. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cEasy, son. My name is David Masterson. I\u2019m the district attorney for San Francisco County.\u201d</p><p>Adam crossed his arms and stood, legs apart, staring defiantly at the D.A. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked him to come,\u201d Holly said quietly.</p><p>All eyes turned to her. Ryan moved closer to her bed, hovering protectively over her. Which was laughable at best. He still looked like a half-dressed mummy with the bandages wrapped around his chest and shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I could have a moment alone with Mrs. Bardwell,\u201d the D.A. spoke up.</p><p>\u201cLike hell you will,\u201d Ryan snarled.</p><p>Holly put up her free hand to rest on Ryan\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Ryan.\u201d</p><p>Adam stared at her, his gaze never leaving her face. \u201cWhat have you done, Holly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease understand, Adam. I can\u2019t allow any of you to come to harm because of me.\u201d</p> <p>Adam swore long and hard. She winced at the ferocity.</p><p>David Masterson gestured at the two policemen. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, escort the gentlemen out so Mrs. Bardwell and I can talk privately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hell you say!\u201d Ethan burst out.</p><p>\u201cEthan, please,\u201d Holly pleaded. \u201cLet me do this my way. I\u2019m asking you to leave. For me.\u201d</p><p>Looks of hurt mixed with anger were thrown her way, but the three finally turned and stalked out the door.</p><p>The D.A. turned and gave her a speculative look.</p> <p>\u201cMind if I sit down?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head and watched as he settled into the chair Adam had vacated.</p><p>\u201cMy office has been looking for you for some time, Mrs. Bardwell. Any particular reason you disappeared?\u201d</p><p>She stared hard at him. He wouldn\u2019t get the upper hand over her. This meeting would be on her terms and her terms alone.</p><p>\u201cI asked you here, Mr. Masterson. I\u2019ll ask the questions.\u201d</p><p>He lifted one brow. \u201cVery well. What can I do for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have come all this way if you weren\u2019t keenly interested in Mason Bardwell,\u201d she began.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw him murder a man on our wedding night,\u201d she said baldly.</p><p>The D.A. sat forward, urgency lighting his eyes. \u201cYou saw him? Unmistakably?\u201d</p><p>She shuddered and closed her eyes momentarily. \u201cThere was no mistaking what I saw, Mr. Masterson. He shot a man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWere there any other witnesses? Think hard about this, Mrs. Bardwell. It\u2019s very important.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t call me Mrs. Bardwell,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cMy name is Holly. And yes, there was one other person present. His business partner Thomas Goins.\u201d</p><p>David sat back, a gleam of triumph in his eyes. \u201cAre you willing to testify to what you saw?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I asked you here,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have conditions.\u201d</p><p>Again he quirked his eyebrow at her. \u201cWhat sort of conditions are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want protection. He\u2019s why I\u2019m in the hospital. He\u2019s why Ryan Colter nearly died. He won\u2019t hesitate to kill me or them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, we\u2019d take all the necessary precautions,\u201d he said quickly.</p><p>\u201cI want Adam, Ethan and Ryan protected as well. They won\u2019t like it. They won\u2019t want it. But I won\u2019t set foot in a courthouse unless you guarantee that someone will be looking out for their best interests until this is all over with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHolly, if you help me put away Mason Bardwell, I\u2019ll personally baby-sit them. We\u2019ve been after him for years. He\u2019s up to his neck in organized crime in the San Francisco Bay area. Until now, we\u2019ve never been able to pin anything on him. When Sheriff McMillan called me and said you wanted to see me, I took the first flight out here, hoping you\u2019d tell me what you have.\u201d</p><p>Holly blanched. \u201cOrganized crime?\u201d</p><p>David nodded. He studied her for a moment. \u201cThis probably isn\u2019t the best time to tell you, but then I can\u2019t imagine there ever being a good time, but we strongly suspect he had a hand in your parents\u2019 death.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth in shock. \u201cBut they died in an accident! It was ruled an accident.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo it was. A rather suspicious accident. He was involved in several investments with them. Investments that went very bad. A week before their accident, they came to my office with claims they had evidence he was involved in fraud.\u201d</p><p>Holly dropped her head onto her pillow. Tears stung her eyes and she wiped angrily at them. \u201cAnd you never did anything about it?\u201d</p><p>His voice dropped to a softer tone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have enough evidence to pursue an indictment. Believe me if we did, I would have done everything in my power to convict him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do I have to do?\u201d she asked. \u201cI want the bastard in jail for what he did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take your statement. Then I\u2019ll put together an arrest warrant and have the police pick Mr. Bardwell up. We\u2019ll move you to an undisclosed location where you\u2019ll remain until the trial. I\u2019ll arrange for police protection for the Colters as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long will this take?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cThat I don\u2019t know. I won\u2019t lie to you. It could drag on for some time, but I\u2019ll do the best I can to make sure we get a rapid trial date.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed the knot in her throat. How long would she be separated from Adam, Ethan and Ryan, and would they even want her back by the time it was all over with? As much as she hated the idea of being separated from them, she knew what she had to do. For her parents, for the men she loved, and most importantly, for herself.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d she whispered. \u201cMake the arrangements.\u201d</p><p>He leaned forward and folded her hand in his. \u201cThank you, Holly. You\u2019re doing a very brave thing.\u201d</p><p>Brave? Or stupid? She wasn\u2019t sure which. She knew she\u2019d have three very angry men. Men she loved more than anything else in her life. And here she was doing the one thing she wanted to do the least. Leaving.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Eight</p><p>Adam sat in brooding silence, his feet perched on the windowsill of the hospital room. After the district attorney had come out of Holly\u2019s room, she\u2019d fallen asleep, clearly exhausted by the encounter.</p><p>The floor had gone into a flurry of activity, directed by the two Colorado state troopers. Even now, a police guard had been posted at the door, and no one but hospital staff and the Colter brothers were allowed in.</p><p>Adam could feel the clock ticking, and he didn\u2019t like it a damn bit. He glanced over at Holly\u2019s pale face. She was too damn weak, not nearly recovered enough to take on her bastard husband. She needed rest, to recuperate.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think\u2019s going on?\u201d Ethan muttered as he sat down beside Adam.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be talking in low voices, thinking I won\u2019t hear,\u201d Ryan said sourly. \u201cIf there\u2019s something to be said, I want to hear it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to wake Holly up,\u201d Adam said pointedly. He turned back to Ethan. \u201cI wish the fuck I knew what was going on in her head. She blames herself for what happened to Ryan, and she\u2019s acted on that.\u201d</p><p>Ryan swore a streak that would have their mother washing his mouth out with soap.</p><p>\u201cSo what do we do?\u201d Ethan asked.</p><p>Adam shook his head. He felt so damn helpless. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It has to be her decision. We can\u2019t make it for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to lose her,\u201d Ryan said in a tight voice.</p><p>\u201cDo you think we do?\u201d Ethan asked. Anger and frustration simmered in his eyes.</p><p>Adam rubbed his face tiredly. They were all on pins and needles. Tired. Frustrated beyond belief. And scared to death of losing the one woman who meant everything to them.</p><p>\u201cHow can we just let her walk away?\u201d Ryan demanded. \u201cWho\u2019s going to make sure that bastard husband of hers isn\u2019t going to hurt her again?\u201d</p><p>Adam turned his head to the bed when he heard Holly shift and sigh softly. Her eyes fluttered open, and he leaned forward in his seat.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019re you feeling, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTired,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He felt guilty for what he was about to do, but he wasn\u2019t going to let go without a fight. She didn\u2019t need to be pushed, but that was exactly what he was going to do.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, baby? Why did you call the D.A.? I don\u2019t like what that implies.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him with her beautiful eyes. Eyes that were awash in sadness. And fear. Almost as if she was afraid of how he\u2019d react when she answered his questions.</p><p>His gut tightened uncomfortably.</p><p>\u201cIt had to be done,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it didn\u2019t,\u201d Ryan refuted.</p><p>Tears welled in her eyes. \u201cYou almost died, Ryan. Because of me. Do you have any idea what that did to me? How badly it hurt? I can\u2019t stand the thought of any of you gone. I love you too much.\u201d</p><p>Adam glanced over at Ryan. His brother looked to be near losing all control. Rage and grief festered like a gangrenous sore.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who let you down,\u201d Ryan said in a near shout. \u201cDon\u2019t you get it? I let that bastard into our home. I let him take you away from us. I let him nearly kill you. I let you down just like I let those prisoners down in Iraq.\u201d</p><p>Tears streamed down Holly\u2019s face. \u201cRyan...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t let you do this, Holly. I won\u2019t let you sacrifice yourself for us,\u201d Ryan said fiercely.</p><p>She struggled to sit up, and Adam leaned further into her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders to help.</p><p>\u201cI made a bargain with the district attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cA bargain I won\u2019t back out of. It\u2019s something I have to do. For all of us.\u201d</p><p>Nausea welled in Adam\u2019s stomach, and he and Ethan exchanged panicked looks.</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of bargain?\u201d Ethan asked dully.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to testify against Mason.\u201d</p><p>Adam shook his head. \u201cNo. No, no, no! It\u2019s too dangerous. He\u2019ll go after you with everything he has.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going away,\u201d Holly added softly. \u201cUntil the trial. I\u2019ll be in protective custody.\u201d</p><p>Adam surged to his feet. He clenched his fingers into tight balls. God, he wanted to hit something. Put his fist through the wall.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why are you doing this?\u201d he demanded. He no longer cared that he sounded so angry. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to treat her so gently when she was tearing him apart on the inside.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m doing it for you.\u201d</p><p>The statement was firm. Accentuated by a sharp lift to her chin. Fire blazed in eyes that had been so fatigued just moments ago.</p><p>Adam closed his eyes, drawing a tight rein on his anger. He wanted to fucking howl. Instead, he turned and walked out. He couldn\u2019t trust himself to speak when all he wanted to do was shout.</p><p>Holly watched as he left and felt her world splinter and break into tiny pieces. He was angrier than she\u2019d ever seen him. At her.</p><p>Looks of betrayal loomed in Ethan and Ryan\u2019s eyes. Did they all hate her?</p><p>\u201cGo after him,\u201d she said softly. \u201cHe needs you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe needs you,\u201d Ethan pointed out.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him do anything stupid,\u201d she continued.</p><p>\u201cI need some air,\u201d Ryan said in a defeated voice she cringed at.</p><p>Ethan shook his head and followed Ryan out the door.</p><p>Holly clapped her hand to her face as the sobs she\u2019d tried so hard to contain came bubbling out. She tried to suck in steadying breaths, but loud, raspy, harsh sounds kept spilling from her throat.</p><p>The nurse came in the door, a concerned expression marring her face. David Masterson followed closely behind.</p><p>\u201cDo you need something for pain?\u201d the nurse asked.</p><p>For pain? If only a simple drug would take away the agony that clawed at her heart.</p><p>Holly shook her head. She wanted her wits about her. She was going to need all she could get in the coming days.</p><p>\u201cMrs. Bardwell...Holly, I\u2019ve spoken with your doctor, made extensive arrangements to have you transferred to a private facility in another state. If you\u2019re agreeable, we\u2019ll have you transported within the hour.\u201d</p><p>Holly\u2019s mouth gaped open. \u201cSo soon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s imperative we move you to a safe place as soon as possible. Your husband has already proven he is capable of anything. He hasn\u2019t had any trouble finding you. It\u2019s only a matter of time before he finds you here.\u201d</p><p>The brothers. Mason would also find Adam, Ethan and Ryan. Where she was, so were they. If he could find her so easily, what did that do for the Colters?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready,\u201d she said in a steady voice.</p><p>Adam knew something was wrong the minute he stepped off the elevator. The nurse who\u2019d cared for Holly this shift wouldn\u2019t meet his gaze. In fact, she scurried off in the opposite direction as fast her legs would take her.</p><p>He growled low under his breath. It had taken him the better part of two hours to cool off enough to think rationally. Ethan and Ryan hadn\u2019t helped. They\u2019d been as pissed as he was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The three of them strode down the hall toward Holly\u2019s room. Adam noticed the absence of the guard who had been posted earlier. When he opened the door, he was greeted to a freshly made bed. An empty bed. He rushed through the door, slamming it against the wall.</p><p>The room was empty. Completely empty. No trace that Holly had ever been there could be found.</p><p>He stormed back into the hallway, his brothers close on his heels. He stalked to the nurses\u2019 station and slammed his hands down on the counter.</p><p>\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded.</p> <p>An older lady, the head nurse, maybe, walked over to him and put out a placating hand.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s been transferred to another facility. One that has better security than we do here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Adam bit out.</p><p>\u201cShe can\u2019t tell you that.\u201d</p><p>Adam whirled around to see David Masterson standing a few feet away. He itched to plant his fist square onto the D.A.\u2019s nose.</p> <p>\u201cShe left this for you,\u201d David said, extending a folded note. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mr. Colter. We\u2019ll take excellent care of her.\u201d</p><p>Adam watched, stunned, as David turned and walked down the hall toward the elevator. He stared down at the paper in his hand, his stomach rolling and tumbling.</p><p>With shaking hands, he pulled it open. Three words. So simple.</p><p>I love you.</p><p>He crumbled the note and sent it flying into the wall. His brothers wore expressions of disbelief. Ryan punched the wall, shoving a hole into the plaster.</p><p>\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Ethan asked in a quiet voice.</p> <p>\u201cWe go back to the cabin. And wait for her to come home,\u201d Adam said.</p><p>Chapter Twenty-Nine</p><p>Holly stood at the end of the winding driveway, staring up at the cabin. Summer had come to the mountains. Everywhere she looked, the earth burst with green. She\u2019d only seen the landscape when it was covered with a sheet of white and had thought at the time it couldn\u2019t be more beautiful. She\u2019d been wrong. It couldn\u2019t possibly look any better than now when she was coming home.</p><p>She\u2019d parked down the road, exactly as she had done once before. Somehow she\u2019d wanted to replicate the journey she\u2019d made so many months before.</p><p>She smiled as the breeze lifted her long hair and blew it gently around her shoulders. She slid a hand over the bulge of her abdomen, rubbing absently at the gentle swell.</p><p>With a deep breath, she started the long walk up the hill to the front door. Butterflies danced in her stomach. In response, the baby kicked and turned over. She stopped and put a hand to her stomach again until the sensation passed.</p><p>She smiled and continued on. When she reached the front porch, she hesitated. The door was merely inches away, and yet, she didn\u2019t knock. Should she just go in? No. She\u2019d been gone too long.</p><p>Would they welcome her back? Would they still love her? Uncertainty nibbled away at her confidence. Adam had been so angry the last time she\u2019d seen him. She closed her eyes to banish the look of betrayal she\u2019d seen in his expression.</p> <p>Tears swam in her eyes. She\u2019d missed them terribly. She\u2019d lain awake so many nights longing for their touch. She looked down and scrubbed at her eyes. It was over now. She was finally free to live the life she wanted. It was up to her to reach out and take it.</p><p>Slowly, she raised her hand and knocked quietly. She waited a moment then mustered her courage and knocked harder.</p><p>Her heart lurched when she heard firm footsteps from inside. The door opened and Ryan stood in the doorway, a stunned look on his face.</p><p>\u201cHolly?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, praying he didn\u2019t turn around and shut the door.</p><p>Before she could say anything, she found herself enfolded in his arms. He picked her up and whirled her around, burying his face in her chest.</p><p>The baby rolled and kicked between them and he froze. He let her slowly down then backed a space away. He reached out with a shaky hand to cup her swollen belly.</p><p>\u201cIs this...is this...?\u201d he broke off his voice hoarse with emotion.</p><p>She covered his hand with hers, holding it in place against her stomach. \u201cYes,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>He stared at her in stunned silence. Then he hugged her to him again. He buried his face in her hair and stroked her back. He reached between them to palm her abdomen again as if he couldn\u2019t quite believe the evidence in front of him.</p><p>\u201cOur baby,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>He tugged her to the couch and sat down. He reached for her hands and pulled her down until she straddled his lap. Then he placed both hands on her stomach, a look of wonder in his eyes.</p><p>He looked back up at her, and his hands traveled over the arm that had been broken then up to where the knife wound had torn her chest.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine. Now that I\u2019m here,\u201d she added.</p><p>He reached up and framed her face in his large hands then pulled her down to kiss him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much,\u201d he said hoarsely.</p><p>Tears slid down her cheeks. \u201cI missed you too.\u201d</p><p>A noise across the room had her jerking her head in that direction. She tensed as she saw Adam and Ethan standing in the doorway to the living room.</p><p>Ethan\u2019s face split into a wide smile, but Adam stared in brooding silence. Her heart flipped and her stomach dropped. He hadn\u2019t forgiven her for leaving.</p><p>She shakily crawled back off Ryan\u2019s lap and stood, her fingers wrapped tightly together.</p><p>Adam took a step forward. \u201cPromise me.\u201d He stared directly at her, his eyes penetrating every layer of her skin. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll never do anything so completely stupid again. Swear to me you\u2019ll never leave us again.\u201d</p><p>She flew to him, throwing herself into his arms. He caught her tightly against him. He held her head against his chest. He kissed the top of her hair, leaving his lips there for a long moment.</p><p>When she pulled away, she found herself tugged into Ethan\u2019s arms.</p><p>\u201cWelcome home, doll.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her lingeringly then hugged her again.</p><p>\u201cDo you have something you want to tell us?\u201d Adam asked, his eyes drifting to her stomach.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be fathers.\u201d</p><p>Ethan let out a whoop and twirled her around the living room.</p><p>\u201cPut her down, dumbass,\u201d Ryan said sourly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need you throwing her around like a sack of grain.\u201d</p><p>Ethan set her down and molded his hand to her belly.</p><p>\u201cAre you hungry? Want me to fix you something to eat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m starving,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to stop even for a moment until I got here.\u201d</p><p>They herded into the kitchen and Adam sat Holly down at the bar. He settled in beside her, his hand caressing her back.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>She let out her breath in a sigh. \u201cIt went faster than we all thought. Mason showed no sign of cooperating even with my damning statement. Then the night before the trial was set to start, he entered into a plea bargain with the district attorney. He pleaded guilty and forewent the trial.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s no longer a threat?\u201d Ryan asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019ll be in jail for a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a brave thing, baby,\u201d Adam said. \u201cI\u2019m pissed that you did it, but it took incredible courage on your part.\u201d</p><p>She gave him a sad smile. \u201cI missed you all so much. I was so lonely without you.\u201d</p><p>Adam hugged her to him. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be without us again, baby. That I promise.\u201d He glanced down at her belly. \u201cWhen did you know?\u201d</p><p>She looked down, not sure she should answer truthfully. He nudged her chin up until she looked at him once more.</p><p>\u201cYou knew before you left.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cIt was such a shock. Amidst all the blood loss, the injuries, when they got routine lab work back, they told me I was pregnant. They fully expected me to miscarry, but I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She paused before continuing. \u201cI knew...I knew if I told you, that you would never let me go. And I knew I had to do what I did to protect you and our baby.\u201d</p><p>Ethan set a plate in front of her along with a glass of milk. She wrinkled her nose. \u201cMilk?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the baby,\u201d he said.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI hate milk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDrink up,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cYou need it and so does the little one.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, allowing her full joy to roll through her. She was home. It was almost as if she\u2019d never left. A single tear slipped down her cheek, and she smiled harder.</p><p>Adam reached over and thumbed the wetness away.</p><p>\u201cNot a day has passed that we haven\u2019t thought about you. Worried about you. Cursed you,\u201d he added with a wry grin. \u201cWelcome home, baby,\u201d he said in a more serious tone. He bent over and pressed a kiss to her belly. \u201cWelcome home, baby Colter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy divorce is final,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cAnd don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to wait another day to make you ours,\u201d Ethan commented as he sat down across the bar from her.</p><p>A tingle snaked its way up Holly\u2019s spine. \u201cWhat does that mean exactly?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt means we\u2019re going down to the clerk\u2019s office tomorrow and getting a license. A judge friend of ours will perform the ceremony. He\u2019s aware of our situation. While you\u2019ll legally be wed to me, he\u2019s willing to arrange the ceremony to accommodate your commitment to all of us,\u201d Adam spoke up.</p><p>Holly stared at them for a long moment then felt her heart swell until she feared it would burst right out of her chest. They still wanted her. Acted as though she\u2019d never left them, hadn\u2019t been gone nearly six months.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll really be yours,\u201d she said in awe.</p><p>Ryan snorted. \u201cYou\u2019ve always been ours. Make no mistake about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill you marry us?\u201d Adam asked, fingering her hair, wrapping the ends around his hand. \u201cWill you stay with us always? Love us as much as we love you? Be the mother to our children?\u201d</p><p>She stood and wrapped herself around Adam as tightly as she could. She hugged his neck to her and held on for dear life.</p><p>\u201cI love you so much,\u201d she whispered. \u201cYes. Yes, I\u2019ll marry you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan let out a whoop and Ryan sat back on his chair, folding his arms across his chest in a gesture of supreme satisfaction.</p><p>Adam kissed her long and hard, leaving her breathless. For the first time in six months, she allowed herself to relax and revel in the moment.</p><p>Tomorrow she\u2019d be legally, emotionally, completely belonging to the three brothers, and more importantly, they would belong to her.</p><p>Life was full of ironies. Only in running from a past riddled by mistakes, had she found a future so perfect, so bright that she still had trouble believing it was her reality.</p><p>\u201cAnyone want to play Monopoly?\u201d she asked.</p><p>Only later, as they sat on the porch watching the sun go down over the mountains, did Holly wrap herself in the comfort that she was indeed home. For the first time since her parents\u2019 death, she felt a sense of belonging.</p><p>Adam reached over to take her hand, his thumb massaging her palm. \u201cI love you, baby.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI love you, too.\u201d Her gaze drifted to Ethan and Ryan, both of whom wore relaxed, easy expressions. \u201cI love all of you.\u201d</p><p>Ethan smiled. \u201cWe know, doll. After all, you came back to us.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
