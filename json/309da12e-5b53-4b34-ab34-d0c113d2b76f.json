James Tucker, his best friend, former partner and probably the love of his life had stopped answering his cell phone, and no one had heard from him in over three weeks.</p><p>It had been a long drive the day before from the Gulf coast of Florida to North Carolina, and once he arrived, he\u2019d spent some time going from place to place in the small town of Sylva, even though it was early evening, asking questions in a few of the shops still open and in the small caf\u00e9s, just like he\u2019d done all day today. He went anywhere he could think of, really, that might get him results. The local sheriff\u2019s department had been his first stop that morning, of course. They looked at his credentials and were polite enough, but claimed never to have heard of any cult operating in the area. When Kevin admitted Tucker left Florida willingly, they told him there was nothing they could do.</p><p>Everyone in town, as a matter of fact, claimed never to have heard of any kind of cult, religious or otherwise. They also claimed never to have heard of a former detective from Florida named James Tucker or his lover, a man Kevin knew only as Gavin\u2014but then, he hadn\u2019t really expected to get information so quickly. He was really only hoping to stir things up and get a lead.</p> <p>Using cell phone records, he\u2019d tracked Tucker to this general area, but that was as close as he could get. If Tucker had fallen victim to a dangerous cult, like Kevin thought he had, he believed there would be other cult members in the area, whether they were willing to admit it or not. If he asked enough questions, nosed around enough, he might be able to attract the attention of the group. He was hoping the cult members would come looking for him and save him further trouble.</p><p>He sat up on the side of the bed and stretched. He\u2019d spent the morning in town and most of the afternoon searching on the internet for various churches or religious groups in the area. It was late afternoon now, and he needed to figure something out for dinner.</p><p>Levering himself off the bed, he stretched again. Damn, his back was a little stiff from the long drive. At the ripe old age of thirty-four, he shouldn\u2019t have this many aches and pains, should he? Maybe if he actually did more cardio like his trainer told him to when he worked out at his gym, he might be in better shape. Up to this point, he\u2019d been mainly interested in shaping his body and sculpting his muscles so he usually concentrated on the weights. Tucker used to laugh at him and say at least he\u2019d look pretty when he wound up in the hospital with a heart attack someday. Tucker, himself, was a runner.</p><p>Tucker\u2014Kevin felt the familiar twinge in his chest that he always got when he thought of him lately. He\u2019d been in love with Tucker for so long, it seemed like a part of him by now. Tucker had never wanted to be involved romantically, claiming it was because they worked together, and saying it would ruin things if a relationship between them went wrong. So Kevin had reluctantly accepted the status quo and remained Tucker\u2019s partner and eventually became his best friend. Of course, he was still in love with Tucker, and always would be. That went without saying. And he wouldn\u2019t forsake him now, if there was any chance this crazy group was holding him against his will. He wanted to talk to him and see for himself, and he wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with anything less.</p><p>There had been almost no word from Tucker since he left Florida to travel to Tennessee almost a month before with a man he barely knew, this Gavin. The guy was from somewhere in the state, close to the border of North Carolina, and Tucker said he wanted to go with Gavin to explore his newly discovered family home. Gavin had told Tucker that he was taken from the area as a baby by his grandparents, and his real father was still alive and looking for him. The fact that Tucker was given no proof of any of this, and that he\u2019d been hiding out from Gavin just a few days before, somehow no longer seemed to matter to Tucker, no matter what Kevin tried to tell him. Tucker had told Kevin he suspected Gavin was the leader of some kind of cult. What could have happened to change his mind so radically?</p> <p>To make things even worse, they\u2019d been right in the middle of a murder investigation, and the chief was so furious when he discovered Tucker\u2019s absence and his refusal to return, he\u2019d fired Tucker on the spot, a not surprising reaction. As it turned out, the man was a homophobic asshole anyway. Tucker had long suspected that about him, and he kept his orientation secret within the department. When Tucker left the way he had, word had inevitably gotten out about him.</p><p>At Kevin\u2019s persistent urging, the chief had sent some investigators to check into the situation, and they questioned people at the Nightstick, a bar Tucker frequented, and at the hotel where Gavin had been staying. It hadn\u2019t taken him long to discover Tucker and Gavin were lovers. At that point, the chief closed the investigation, saying Tucker had \u2018gone off with his fag boyfriend.\u2019</p><p>He\u2019d called Bryson in his office to tell him he was no longer looking into the situation. \u201cI guess he fooled us all with his homo lifestyle, huh? Let him go. Good riddance. And leave it alone, Bryson, or we\u2019ll start to wonder about you too. End of story.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t the end of the fucking story for Kevin. For him, it was only the beginning. The assholes he worked with could wonder about him all they wanted to. If Tucker was in trouble, he wouldn\u2019t turn his back on him to save himself.</p><p>Since the day Tucker left with Gavin, Kevin had only heard from him once. He\u2019d called to tell Kevin he was about to go through with some kind of commitment ceremony with the guy, and that he would be staying in Tennessee. Nothing Kevin could say would talk him out of it, and Tucker had actually hung up on Kevin while he was still pleading with him, saying he\u2019d be in touch. That was the last time he\u2019d heard from him, and Kevin was worried sick.</p><p>A loud knock on the door startled him for a second. He moved to the door cautiously. It was probably only hotel staff, but this whole thing had made him jumpy. The people in the small town were friendly enough, until he started asking questions. Way too many of them had clammed up after that, and acted, not exactly with hostility, but like he\u2019d definitely worn out his welcome.</p> <p>Another loud, insistent knock sounded on the door, and he went over to the peephole. Who could be calling so late? He\u2019d learned a long time ago it paid to be careful until he knew exactly what he was dealing with.</p><p>At first, Kevin couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Tucker stood in front of the door, his head slightly lowered as he waited, fidgeting a little. Behind him stood a big, dark-haired man Kevin had never seen before. As Kevin watched, this man leaned across Tucker and took hold of the door knob, shaking it impatiently.</p><p>Kevin took an involuntary step back. What the hell? Part of him wanted to rip the door open and enfold Tucker in his arms, but another part of him was alarmed. Who was this big guy with Tucker? At the first sight of him, Kevin\u2019s heart had started racing.</p><p>Tucker called out, \u201cBryson, open the door. It\u2019s me, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s heart leaped again at the sound of his voice. Whoever the other man was, Kevin didn\u2019t like the look of him. He wished he had his gun on him, but it was all the way across the room and from the way the door was shaking, it wouldn\u2019t last long enough for him to retrieve it. Taking a deep breath, he flung the door open, tensed and jumped back, ready for whatever was about to come through it. Instead of the trouble he was expecting, Tucker stood in the doorway, looking like he always did, a big smile on his handsome face. Relief surged through Kevin, so strongly it made his legs a little weak.</p><p>Tucker\u2019s eyes darted nervously around the room as he stepped over the threshold, though. The man, who had been standing protectively behind him, a little too close in Kevin\u2019s opinion, came in with him. This guy was definitely not Gavin. Kevin had seen Gavin a couple of times behind the yellow crime scene tapes in Florida, while investigating the murders which remained unsolved. The last time Kevin had talked to Tucker he\u2019d implied that the case was solved and no longer an issue, though when he\u2019d pressed him for details, pleading with him to think this thing over and come back home for a while, he\u2019d hung up on him. Indeed, there had been no more murders in the area, and the consensus was the perpetrator had been a transient and had moved on.</p><p>This was another reason to be wary of the guy who came in with Tucker. The muscular guy was no one he\u2019d ever seen, but the expression on his face told Kevin he wasn\u2019t exactly pleased to meet him. His eyes were scanning the room, as if to discover someone else hidden away, or some as yet unseen threat to them both.</p><p>Tucker met Kevin\u2019s gaze and gave him a big smile, as he stepped all the way inside the room. He walked right up to Kevin and into his arms, surprising him. Tucker had never been physically affectionate with him before. Kevin held him close for probably too long, just breathing in his sweet scent with relief and reveling in the feel of the hard body against his. The big guy who had walked in behind him made a noise deep in his throat that sounded suspiciously like a growl, and Kevin reluctantly let Tucker go. Kevin cast a glance at the other man, wondering who the hell he was and what claim he seemed to feel he had on Tucker.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Bryson,\u201d Tucker said, taking a step backward, his cheeks turning pink. \u201cI...uh...got word you were looking for me.\u201d</p><p>Kevin couldn\u2019t prevent himself from touching him again, and reached for his arm to draw him over to the bed to sit down. \u201cYou got word, huh? But how did you know where to find me? God, I\u2019ve been worried about you, Tucker. You said you\u2019d call, but I haven\u2019t heard anything in weeks. You can\u2019t just disappear like that, man. Your apartment...your car...everything\u2019s waiting for you to come back home. I paid the rent on the apartment for you last month.\u201d</p><p>A definite growl came from the throat of the big man hovering near them this time, and Kevin looked up at him in exasperation. He stood between them and the door, like he thought Kevin might snatch Tucker up and make a run for it. Not a bad idea at that...</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry you had to do that, Bryson. I\u2019ll pay you back, of course. And I am home,\u201d Tucker was saying firmly. \u201cI thought you understood I live here now. I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t gotten in touch sooner.\u201d He waved one of his hands in that slightly old-fashioned, elegant way of his that should have looked feminine, but didn\u2019t. \u201cI don\u2019t need any of the things I left behind, Bry. In the apartment, I mean. I\u2019ll ask Gavin to send someone to pick up the car though and pay off the lease.\u201d He brushed his dark hair off his forehead. Kevin watched him closely, trying to discern any kind of hidden message he might be trying to send him, and observing him for any changes in his demeanor. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTucker,\u201d Kevin tried again after a few moments. \u201cWon\u2019t you come back home with me and think this over a little?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think that question has been already been answered, Detective.\u201d The man behind Tucker had taken an aggressive step forward as he spoke, and Kevin rose to his feet to meet his challenge. \u201cTucker is home, and there\u2019s nothing to think over.\u201d</p><p>The guy was huge, at least six foot three or four, and muscular, like a damned body builder. He looked to be probably thirty or so and looked vaguely Native American, with his tanned skin and high cheekbones. His eyes were intense and thickly lashed. The bastard was gorgeous, and if he\u2019d met the guy in a club somewhere, Kevin might have been all over him. Kevin usually didn\u2019t like men to be so much bigger than he was, but for this one he might have made an exception. Right now, however, the man was just pissing him off.</p> <p>\u201cChill, dude, I\u2019m not talking to you,\u201d Kevin said, not backing down an inch. \u201cWho the hell are you anyway? Are you some kind of damn bodyguard? Afraid the newest member of your cult will come to his senses if he talks to a normal human being?\u201d</p><p>The guy tensed and clenched his fists, but Tucker stood up and insinuated himself between them, putting a hand on Kevin\u2019s chest. \u201cBryson, please. This is my...uh...this is Richard. Gavin was busy and couldn\u2019t come with me, so Richard volunteered to drive me here. I came to tell you to go back home and drop this. Please, Bryson. I know you think I\u2019m being coerced in some way, but...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you?\u201d He put his hand over Tucker\u2019s and trapped it on his chest.</p><p>Tucker tried to pull his hand away and step back, but Kevin held on to him. \u201cJust send this dude outside, and let me talk to you alone for a few minutes. Please, Tuck.\u201d</p><p>The man Tucker introduced as Richard put a big hand on Kevin\u2019s chest and pushed him back away from Tucker as he pulled Tucker behind him. At the same time the guy touched Kevin, a stunned look came over his face and he glanced down at his hand and back up at Kevin. Pulling his hand away sharply, he shook his head as if to clear it. \u201cI\u2019m not going outside or anywhere else, dude. And this conversation is finished. Let\u2019s go, Tucker.\u201d</p> <p>The man turned to hold out a hand to Tucker, and Kevin grabbed his arm to stop him. So fast he never knew what hit him, Richard took Kevin by the throat with one hand, pushing him backward and slamming him down on his back on the bed. He came along with him, straddling him and leaning down way too close over him.</p><p>Kevin had never thought of himself as weak, but in comparison to this guy, he was like a damned kid. He couldn\u2019t budge either Richard\u2019s body or his hands. He bucked up hard against him, trying to tumble him off, but it didn\u2019t work. The hand, which had been holding him firmly, but not really hurting him, tightened a little around his throat as Kevin struggled. Richard glared down at him, his eyes widening just a little, his nostrils flaring. Kevin was aware of dark stars sparkling around his peripheral vision as he fought to get more air in his lungs.</p><p>Kevin could hear Tucker yelling, but it wasn\u2019t until he stopped fighting and sagged in defeat that the pressure on his throat relaxed, and he was able to drag in a deep breath. Richard was crouching over him, breathing deeply, a dangerous glint in his eye. Richard didn\u2019t move his hand, only whipped his head back to Tucker, almost snarling at him.</p><p>\u201cLet me handle this, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>He leaned down until his face was only inches from Kevin\u2019s, coming so close Kevin could feel his hot breath blowing over his lips. \u201cI\u2019m going to let you up now, and you\u2019re going to behave yourself, you got that?\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded\u2014the brief movement of his head was all that the man\u2019s hand allowed him. The pressure on his throat remained for another few seconds while Richard continued to lock eyes with him. If the cold stare was intended to intimidate him, it was pretty damn effective with his hand still gripping Kevin\u2019s throat. Finally, Richard got up slowly, releasing him, and Tucker rushed to sit down beside Kevin and put his arm around his shoulders. \u201cAre you all right? Did he hurt you?\u201d He cast a furious glance up at the other man, not seeming to be the least afraid of him. Richard gazed serenely back at him and shrugged, folding his arms across his chest.</p> <p>Kevin shook his head and put a hand up to the sides of his neck. He\u2019d have bruises there tomorrow. He glared up at Richard, who was still standing way too close to Tucker for Kevin\u2019s peace of mind. \u201cThis shit just proves my point, Tucker. I\u2019m not leaving here without you. And there\u2019s nothing this son of a bitch or anybody else can do to stop me.\u201d Irritatingly, he noticed how hoarse his voice sounded, and he shot Richard an angry look.</p><p>Richard gave him a slow, soft smile. \u201cYou know better than that, don\u2019t you, Detective?\u201d</p><p>Kevin glared at him. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough out of you, asshole.\u201d His voice came out way shakier than he intended. \u201cYou just assaulted a police officer, and I may not have jurisdiction here, but I can still bring charges for what you just did. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t do it. And while I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll have a word with the state police about your little operation here, since the locals don\u2019t seem interested. Last I heard, kidnapping and holding someone against their will was still illegal in this state.\u201d</p><p>Richard gazed at him for another moment before addressing himself to Tucker. \u201cYou see? Are you satisfied now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust stop it, both of you, damn it. I\u2019m not a bone for you two to fight over, for God\u2019s sake.\u201d He grabbed Kevin\u2019s arm, turning him to face him. \u201cLook at me, Bryson, and listen up. I wasn\u2019t kidnapped, and I\u2019m not being held against my will. No one brainwashed me. Shit, Bryson, give me some credit here. I\u2019m a grown man, and I know what I want, so back off.\u201d</p><p>Kevin huffed out a furious breath. \u201cI want to believe that Tucker, but I can\u2019t. People who are brainwashed aren\u2019t exactly aware of it, you know.\u201d He jabbed a finger at Richard. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not letting this son of a bitch off so easy!\u201d</p><p>Tucker rolled his eyes as the man he called Richard made another move toward him. Tucker stood up again and shoved the man back before turning to put a hand on Kevin\u2019s chest. \u201cWait a minute. Damn it, calm down, both of you. Give me a minute to think.\u201d</p><p>Both Kevin and Richard glared at each other around Tucker as he stood in the middle of the floor, a hand on each of their chests. It would have almost been funny, if Kevin hadn\u2019t known how high the stakes were. This could be his last chance to get Tucker away from these people.</p> <p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tucker finally said. \u201cCome with us then. See for yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker...\u201d Richard said in a warning voice.</p><p>\u201cI know, damn it. But can\u2019t you see he\u2019ll never believe me? What choice do we have?\u201d Tucker turned back to Kevin. \u201cWell? Will you go with us and see for yourself? We can put you up at the lodge for a few days, and you can see that I\u2019m not in a cult, as you call it, and I\u2019m not there against my will.\u201d</p><p>Kevin glanced up at Richard and saw that he was furious. That alone decided him. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll go with you to this lodge. Why not? I told the chief I wouldn\u2019t be back for a week, so I have some time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou told him you were coming here after me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t have appreciated that,\u201d Kevin said with a bitter tone. \u201cYou were right about his knee-jerk reaction to finding out he had a gay officer. When he read the reports of the investigators, he acted just the way you were afraid he would.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe had me investigated? Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was at my insistence. I\u2019m sorry, Tucker. I thought...well, you know what I thought, and when I talked to you I wasn\u2019t overly reassured. The investigators talked to a few people at the Nightstick and at Gavin\u2019s hotel. They even found out about the club you used to go to over in Ft. Walton.\u201d He sighed. \u201cI think he suspects me too. After all we were partners for a long time. Obviously I would have known. He made a few comments, so when I left I didn\u2019t want to give him any more ammunition to use against either of us. I told a couple of the guys I was going to visit my parents.\u201d</p><p>Tucker exchanged a glance with Richard, and he nodded curtly, like something unspoken had passed between them. Tucker held out a hand to Kevin. \u201cThen come with us. I\u2019d like you to meet my new family.\u201d</p><p>As Richard stared at Kevin Bryson, talking quietly with his son, he felt a strange stirring in his chest. What the hell was the smell emanating from him? It was delicious, and seriously driving him crazy. He hadn\u2019t meant to overreact as he had, but being so close to him, he couldn\u2019t think straight. When he\u2019d touched him the first time, he felt something like a jolt of electricity shoot up his arm.</p><p>It had been a long time since he\u2019d been so immediately attracted to anyone like this. Not since he\u2019d met his bloodmate more than twenty-five years ago. Richard thought about the incensed glare the man had fixed on him when Richard had his hand around his throat, and he was laid out on the bed beneath him. Just before he gave in and lowered his eyes, he\u2019d given Richard a smoldering, passionate stare. Kevin would have to be assimilated into the pack and become a mate to one of the wolves, it was clear to him now. The man would never give up. But damn, he was going to be a handful for somebody.</p><p>He\u2019d be a handful for somebody, but not him. Richard put the attraction he felt for the man firmly aside. He would never mate again, no matter what. The last time he\u2019d felt so much for someone so quickly was when he\u2019d met Tucker\u2019s mother, his one true bloodmate and the woman who would become his wife. He had taken one look at her and knew she was destined for him. Luckily the feeling was mutual, and they\u2019d been married only a week later. He hadn\u2019t regretted it, even though she had lost her life in an accident not even a year after that. Losing her had left him so heartbroken and devastated, no one thought he would recover at first. Wolves mated for life, and the loss of their bloodmate was usually enough to kill a wolf. Richard came close, but the thing that brought him back was his love for his infant son. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tucker was Richard\u2019s only son, and Richard was beyond protective of him. They\u2019d been kept apart for many years, since Richard\u2019s in-laws had kidnapped the baby after their daughter\u2019s death and taken him away. Richard had never stopped searching for him, but his efforts failed again and again. Gavin, the pack alpha, discovered Tucker coincidentally when he went to Florida to investigate a rash of killings there instigated by their enemy, the Hunters. They had taken a natural pet and cruelly changed him into a monstrous killing machine, targeting humans. During the investigation and attempt to intervene, Gavin realized Tucker was his bloodmatch and convinced Tucker to come back to Tennessee with him. They\u2019d had their mating ceremony only a couple of weeks later. Now this person from Tucker\u2019s past was here to talk Tucker into leaving again and to make trouble for them all.</p><p>When news reached the pack that a detective from Florida was in the nearby town of Sylva, North Carolina, asking questions, both Richard and Gavin had been incensed. Gavin, in particular, was fuming.</p><p>\u201cWhy would he come here, Tucker?\u201d Gavin asked. \u201cWhat is this man to you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKevin Bryson was my partner, you know that, and he\u2019s my best friend. As to what he\u2019s doing here, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s just very...protective, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut why, Tucker?\u201d Gavin asked his mate. \u201cWhy so protective and why would this man come all the way up here from Florida to find you? You said you called him and told him everything was fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI did,\u201d Tucker said, flopping down on the sofa and looking up at his mate and his father with that mulish look he got when he didn\u2019t want to discuss something. Richard continued to regard his son with determination. His stubbornness wasn\u2019t going to do him any good this time.</p><p>Richard sat down in an armchair across from his son and tried not to let his irritation show. He knew Tucker well enough by now to know it would only make him worse. Gavin was a good alpha and a good mate to his son, but he\u2019d neglected to give Tucker the loving discipline every pet needed, in Richard\u2019s opinion. Richard may have been a little old-fashioned in his thinking in that regard, but the old ways worked. Why change them?</p><p>Richard saw Tucker glance up nervously at him, and knew he was hiding something. Gavin glanced over uneasily too. Though Gavin outranked Richard, he probably knew his beta father-in-law thought he spoiled Tucker outrageously. Richard had told him so often enough. Richard loved Tucker more than his own life, but he wanted him to be a good alpha\u2019s pet, and in his mind, at least, keeping secrets from your mate only caused problems. If Tucker had been his mate, he\u2019d already be over his knee.</p> <p>Richard pressed his lips together, though, and let his alpha handle things. He, at least, knew his place in the pack hierarchy. Gavin sat down beside Tucker and put an arm around his shoulders. \u201cHoney, please. This is important. How did he know where to find you? He came directly to the closest town to the lodge, and you said you only told him you were somewhere in Tennessee. He shows up in North Carolina, just across the state line from us. How did he manage that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s smart. And a detective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker,\u201d Richard said in a warning voice.</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tucker said, his shoulders sagging. \u201cI called him just before our mating ceremony on my cell phone. I guess he got the cell phone records and found the nearest tower.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut how could he...\u201d Gavin flushed and fell silent when Tucker raised an eyebrow at him. \u201cOh, right. Police officer.\u201d</p><p>Tucker snorted. \u201cWell, yeah, and he has a key to my apartment. All he had to do was look through my phone bills. He knows where I keep everything.\u201d</p> <p>He sat back on the sofa for a couple of seconds before leaning toward Tucker again. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t answer the question of why. What in the hell did you say to him? He was telling everyone in town that you were a missing person, and he feared for your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t tell him that. Like I said, he\u2019s just protective...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, about that, Tucker. Why would he be so protective of you?\u201d Richard leaned forward. \u201cIs there more going on than what you\u2019ve been telling us?\u201d</p><p>Tucker gave his father a startled glance and then sighed. \u201cI guess he\u2019s kind of...in love with me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gavin said with a growl. \u201cWhat the hell, Tucker, you told me your partner was straight, married and had a baby on the way. Did you lie to me?\u201d</p><p>Tucker shrugged and would have gotten up if Gavin hadn\u2019t gripped his arm. \u201cYes, okay, so I lied. I\u2019m sorry, but you were jealous, especially when you found me in his parents\u2019 condo, and I didn\u2019t want you to think there was anything between us, because there\u2019s not. I mean, he wanted a relationship, but I told him it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. We were partners, after all, and I know what would have happened if things hadn\u2019t worked out between us. They probably wouldn\u2019t have, either, because he\u2019s not my type.\u201d</p><p>Gavin glared at his mate. \u201cBullshit, Tucker. I\u2019ve seen your partner when we did surveillance on you and at the crime scenes in Florida. The guy is good-looking.\u201d</p><p>Tucker slanted him a smoldering look and leaned over until he was inches from Gavin\u2019s face. \u201cYeah, if you like the blond, Brad Pitt look. I\u2019m more into tall, dark and incredibly sexy myself.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin looked unconvinced, but dropped a kiss on his lips as if he couldn\u2019t help himself when Tucker was that close. Richard leaned back in his chair, shaking his head. \u201cYou should have told us everything, Tucker, so we could have taken precautions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Dad, I had no idea he would do something like follow me up here. I told him I wasn\u2019t in a cult, and I was perfectly happy, and that maybe Gavin would let me come back to Florida for a visit soon.\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cGavin would let you, huh? That was like waving a red flag, Tucker, especially if he was concerned that you were being held against your will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, hell, I didn\u2019t think about that. Look, let me just go talk to him and send him on his way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOut of the question,\u201d Gavin said firmly.</p><p>Tucker whipped his head around to argue, and Richard broke in. \u201cHe\u2019s right, Tucker. Best case scenario, he won\u2019t believe you. He\u2019ll think you\u2019ve been brainwashed and keep digging until he learns too much, and we\u2019ve been compromised. Worst case, he\u2019d throw you over his shoulder and haul ass with you tied up in his trunk and put you in some kind of therapy for cult members. I won\u2019t lose you again.\u201d</p><p>Tucker blew out a frustrated breath. \u201cOh for God\u2019s sake. Okay, then what are we going to do about it? He won\u2019t stop, you know. He\u2019s like a bulldog when he\u2019s after something like this, and he\u2019s very good at what he does. He\u2019ll just keep investigating until he finds out everything he can. He might even go to the state police and try to flush me out that way.\u201d</p><p>Richard looked at Gavin and met his steady, implacable gaze. Tucker glanced from one to the other. \u201cWhat? What did I say?\u201d A light dawned on his face, and he jumped angrily to his feet. \u201cOh no! Oh, hell no, you\u2019re not going to hurt him.\u201d He grabbed Gavin by the shirt front. \u201cI will not stand for you hurting him. I\u2019d go to the state police myself before I let you touch one hair on his head, do I make myself clear?\u201d</p><p>Gavin gripped his wrists and pushed him gently away, still keeping hold of him. \u201cCalm yourself, Tucker. Nobody\u2019s going to hurt him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker, I\u2019m surprised at you,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou know we don\u2019t deliberately hurt humans unless they attack us first. And even then, we\u2019d try not to injure them. Even the Hunters were given a chance to assimilate into our pack last year when we destroyed their compound. Those that gave up were taken care of and found mates within the three branches of the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo then...wait...you want to assimilate him? Is that what you\u2019re trying to say? What the hell does that even mean? You\u2019d force him to become a part of the pack?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh for God\u2019s sake, Tucker,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a fate worse than death...you seem to be pretty happy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but I chose this life for myself, damn it. I wasn\u2019t forced into it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere would be no question of forcing,\u201d Gavin said in a soothing tone. \u201cIf he received a mating bite, he\u2019ll be eager, as a matter of fact.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah, that makes it so much better.\u201d Tucker shook his head. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t agree to something like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from a decision like that anyway,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cToo many factors are involved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike whether or not he\u2019s already told a lot of people where he was going, or if he has close family members who would come looking for him...that kind of thing. His personality too, would have to be considered. If he became the mate of a wolf, he\u2019d have to have a somewhat submissive nature, and not be resistant to being dominated, especially during...uh...\u201d he cast a glance over at his father-in-law and blushed. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean sex? Good Lord, Gavin, my dad knows we have sex.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker,\u201d Richard said reprovingly.</p><p>\u201cWell, you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, well, what I may know, and what I like to think about are two different things, son. And this conversation is becoming uncomfortable. What Gavin is trying to tell you is that we do have different methods, depending on the individual. What works for some might not work for others. We\u2019ve been in this area for a long, long time, Tucker, and of course your friend, the detective, is not the first human to get a little too curious about us. When that has happened over the years we\u2019ve had to take steps to mitigate the damage. Not just for ourselves, but for everyone in our pack.</p><p>\u201cLike what? Besides assimilation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe used to keep prisoners inside the compound years ago.\u201d He held up a hand at the look on Tucker\u2019s face. \u201cBut not anymore. It\u2019s cruel, and we\u2019re not interested in becoming jailers. In recent years, some mild brainwashing techniques have been used, though we don\u2019t like that either...too unpredictable and too much chance of the person losing all their memories.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWell, then that\u2019s out. It\u2019s just inhumane.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned his head slightly to regard him. \u201cBut we\u2019re not human, Tucker. You seem to forget that. And our first priority has to be the pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut there must be other humans who know about you. You said my mother told my grandparents before she died.\u201d</p> <p>Richard nodded. \u201cYes, some family members of the pets do know something about our nature. But we\u2019re careful to decide who is given information. Close family members of the pets have a stake in keeping our secrets. Their children\u2019s happiness is at risk, after all. But we\u2019re very selective in who we tell. We have natural pets who work with us in the police departments and various state agencies to help ensure our privacy. Not much is left to chance, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least let me go see him. Then if I see it\u2019s not working, we can bring him to the lodge and make a decision about what to do. I understand what you\u2019re saying, but I won\u2019t be a party to hurting him in any way. He\u2019s always been a good friend to me. You can go with me to make sure he doesn\u2019t throw me in his trunk or whatever,\u201d he said, with a slight rolling of his eyes. Putting a hand on Gavin\u2019s chest, Tucker leaned into him. He was making his appeal directly to Gavin, who he knew had trouble denying him anything. If Richard hadn\u2019t been so irritated, he might have had a grudging admiration for how manipulative his son could be.</p><p>\u201cOkay, honey, you can talk to him,\u201d the alpha said. \u201cBut keep in mind that it probably won\u2019t do any good. If he continues to not believe what you tell him or if it looks like he\u2019s going to make trouble, then bring him here and we can decide what to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s cross that bridge when we come to it, okay? I think I can talk to him and convince him to go back home and leave us alone. Let me try, anyway.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded and pulled Tucker into his arms. Over his shoulder, he gave Richard a significant look. They\u2019d give Tucker his chance, but if this man was as persistent and stubborn as Tucker was, Richard didn\u2019t hold out much hope that it would work.</p> <p>Coming back to the present, Richard signaled to Tucker to step outside the hotel room with him. Tucker inclined his head slightly and turned to Kevin, who was getting his things together to leave with them. \u201cGo ahead and get packed. I need to speak to Richard a moment.\u201d At the detective\u2019s look of alarm, he smiled and put a hand on Kevin\u2019s arm. \u201cI\u2019ll be just outside the door, don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t leave without you.\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded, and turned to get his things from the bathroom, while Tucker followed Richard to the corridor. Once outside the room, Richard regarded his son, who shifted restlessly from foot to foot. Taking Tucker\u2019s hand in his, he spoke softly to him. \u201cI want to make sure you realize he won\u2019t be leaving the lodge again if he goes with us. But at least you\u2019ve had your chance to talk to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, and I feel like shit about this. I\u2019m betraying him, but I don\u2019t know what else to do. He\u2019ll make good on his threats. Since I couldn\u2019t convince him to keep his mouth shut, he\u2019ll be assimilated, won\u2019t he?\u201d</p><p>Richard shrugged, looking uncomfortable. \u201cIt does seem as if no one knows he\u2019s here. Assimilation would work, I suppose. You told me his parents live in another state?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, taking care of Kevin\u2019s elderly grandparents. They won\u2019t be concerned for a while, at least.\u201d He gazed up at his father. \u201cBut eventually they\u2019ll come looking for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we decided to take him into the pack, then by that time, he\u2019d be recovered enough to be able to talk to them himself and make reassurances. It seems like we have about a week before anyone from Florida gets concerned, and even then they wouldn\u2019t know where to look for him.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker glanced back at Kevin through the partially open door. Kevin had finished his packing and was sitting on the bed, probably trying to overhear what they were saying.</p><p>Richard put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was anything else you could have said that would have made him leave without seeing for himself, son. He\u2019s pretty damned stubborn. At least this way, we don\u2019t have to take him by force and possibly cause him an injury.\u201d He glanced over at Kevin, who was staring at them suspiciously. His dark, sooty lashes contrasted with the fair skin of his cheeks, and his eyes were narrowed in concentration. Richard felt another strong stirring in his groin and shifted his feet. What the hell was the matter with him? He leaned down and whispered in Tucker\u2019s ear. \u201cHe\u2019s a fighter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Tucker said, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cHe always has been. And now he\u2019s in this mess because of me. Damn it, it\u2019s all my fault. He came after me to help me, and I\u2019m screwing him over.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s in it because he\u2019s pigheaded. Not to mention jealous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDad, put yourself in his place. Wouldn\u2019t you try to help me escape if you thought I was being brainwashed and held against my will? Can\u2019t we talk to him and try to convince him to keep quiet about all this? If we could convince him we\u2019re not any kind of threat to humans...\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not only up to us. The other two alphas have a say in this as well. Too many lives could be ruined if word gets out.\u201d</p><p>Richard was silent for a moment, gripping his shoulder. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody to blame here. You\u2019re both doing what you have to do. Now let\u2019s get your boy here back to the lodge. It\u2019s a good thing the hotel owner is one of us. We should be able to get him to erase any evidence of his stay here, just in case.\u201d He glanced over at the man sitting on the bed. \u201cYour friend\u2019s going to be supremely pissed and hard to handle when he realizes what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Two</p> <p>Following the big SUV along the dark, twisting mountain roads, Kevin glanced over at the big man sitting next to him. Damn, the asshole was good looking. The light coming off the dash highlighted his high cheekbones and accentuated the planes of his scowling face. He was obviously not happy about something. Kevin supposed he was upset because he was going to this lodge of his. Fuck him. Kevin shifted his gaze firmly back to the road, even as his cock enthusiastically agreed with him.</p><p>As he\u2019d feared, Tucker drove the SUV. Richard had not allowed him to ride with Kevin. He was probably afraid Kevin would take off with him if he got him alone in his car. Damn right, too. So he\u2019d half expected to be told to follow them to their mountain lodge. What he hadn\u2019t expected was that Richard would slide into the front seat of his car with him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d he\u2019d asked. Kevin knew it was a rhetorical question.</p><p>\u201cIn case we get separated on the dark mountain roads,\u201d Richard explained. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to lose your way if you don\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d Kevin agreed, trying to hide his reluctance. It was bad enough to have him sitting so close to him, let alone be so affected by his presence. For one thing, his cologne or his natural smell, whatever, was driving him crazy. It was a clean, woodsy, outdoor scent, mixed with something slightly musky underneath. Whatever it was, it was making his cock thicken in his damn crotch, and he hated the idea of being so attracted to this man.</p><p>Despite his physical attraction to him, he hadn\u2019t forgotten lying helplessly on his back on the bed with this guy\u2019s hand at his throat not an hour earlier. He figured he had bruises coming up already. Strange how big and powerful these men were. Gavin had been huge too, and the reports were that all of the men traveling with him to Florida had similar builds. Tucker had spoken of a family, and it was possible, of course, that their size was a family trait. If so, this bunch had certainly won the genetic lottery, if they were all as handsome and well-built as Gavin and Richard. And none of them, according to the investigator\u2019s reports, appeared to be over the age of thirty or so. It was mysterious, and Kevin hated mysteries.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, he was following the tail lights of the SUV in front of him when a deep voice broke into his thoughts. \u201cYou\u2019re wasting your time, you know. You won\u2019t seduce Tucker away from Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Kevin turned his head sharply toward the man in the seat next to him. \u201cWhat makes you think I want to seduce Tucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see the way you look at him.\u201d Richard turned his gaze toward Kevin. \u201cHe\u2019s in love with Gavin. They\u2019re married for all intents and purposes. Tucker is a loyal person, and he thinks the world of you, but only as a friend. You\u2019ll never be more than that to him.\u201d</p><p>Stung by his words, Kevin snapped at him. \u201cWhat the hell is any of this to you? Why don\u2019t you let me worry about it?\u201d</p><p>Richard glanced over at him, his dark brown eyes gleaming in the light from the dash. \u201cSo long as you know...\u201d he said cryptically and focused his gaze back on the road. \u201cBesides the two of you would never have worked out. You both need a strong man to be in charge of you.\u201d</p><p>Kevin shot him a furious look. \u201cWhat the hell do you know about me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that when I put you down on the bed back there in the hotel room, your dick was as hard as a rock.\u201d</p><p>Kevin could feel his face flaming, and he was glad for the dark interior of the car. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Richard answered serenely, staring out at the road ahead. \u201cDon\u2019t get pissed off. Forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou better hope I\u2019ll forget it. I could still bring charges against your ass for what you did back there.\u201d</p><p>Richard made an inscrutable little grunt, and for the next few miles there was silence in the car. Kevin was furious. Mainly because the son of a bitch was right. He had been a little turned on, and he didn\u2019t know exactly why.</p><p>\u201cWhy are you so convinced Tucker is in some kind of cult? Does he seem different to you?\u201d</p><p>Tightening his grip on the steering wheel, Kevin huffed out a long breath. \u201cNot exactly different, no.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen why are you so suspicious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I know Tucker a lot better than you do. I know how cautious he is and how long it takes him to trust people and let them get close to him. There\u2019s something not right about all of this, and I\u2019m not going to give up until I find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>Richard stared at him speculatively for a long moment before turning back to gaze out the windshield. Ahead of him, Tucker was pulling off onto a road with a gate and a high fence. As they watched, Tucker rolled down his window, spoke into a speaker fixed to a post in front of the gate, and the gate swung slowly open.</p> <p>\u201cDamn, what is this, Fort Knox?\u201d Kevin commented as he followed the SUV through the gate.</p><p>\u201cAs we\u2019ve told you, we\u2019re a private family.\u201d</p><p>Kevin blew out an irritated breath, feeling even more pissed off when Richard\u2019s lips curved up in a mocking smile. Once through the gate, the road stretched for at least two miles or so into the forest. Trees lined the road closely on either side, rather ominously, Kevin thought. He was beginning to feel claustrophobic when they finally came to an opening, and he could make out lights piercing the utter blackness ahead.</p><p>They pulled up to a huge log structure, about three stories high. There was a semi-circular driveway in front that Tucker followed, and he parked right next to the massive double front doors. It was made of huge logs that appeared to be rough-hewn, both rustic and handsome. The place was a far cry from what he\u2019d imagined. It looked almost like a big hotel of some kind, though of course, there were no signs outside and no big parking lot full of cars. As a matter of fact, if they had more vehicles than the big SUV, he didn\u2019t see them. Possibly they had a garage somewhere out back. He pulled his car up behind Tucker\u2019s and got out, aware that Richard had grabbed his bag from the back seat.</p><p>It was around nine o\u2019clock in the evening, and a few people were walking around outside, though a stiff breeze made the air seem chilled. They nodded to Richard and Tucker as they passed and looked at Kevin suspiciously. When he followed Tucker inside, he saw a big open area, like a hotel lobby. On the left side of the room were tables and chairs, set up like a dining area, and leading up to the upper floors was a big, wide staircase in the middle of the room. There were maybe twenty people in this area, either talking quietly in armchairs and sofas by the fireplace or moving up and down the stairs. There was an almost equal mixture of men and women. A few were sitting at the tables, drinking something and relaxing together. Nothing was alarming in the scene, but it all felt a bit off to Kevin.</p> <p>For one thing, many of them seemed to look very much alike with their coloring. Again, that could have been the family resemblance, but they all had similar, wary expressions as they glanced at him and then quickly away. There were more normal sized people, like him and Tucker in evidence, but still there were all the bigger ones, filling at least half the room, and they looked at him with outright hostility. Some of them actually tucked their smaller companions behind them as they regarded him, as if he were some kind of threat to them.</p><p>He felt Richard\u2019s hand at the small of his back, nudging him forward, and he saw Tucker beckoning to him from the stairs. Tucker was smiling down at him from a few steps above, and after running the gauntlet in the big living area, he was only too glad to walk toward him. \u201cLet me take you to a guest room and get you settled. There\u2019ll be time to meet everyone in the morning, okay?\u201d</p><p>He nodded uneasily and followed Tucker upstairs. Richard followed closely behind with his suitcase. They walked past a few doors in the hallway on the second floor when Tucker stopped and swung open a door. Kevin stepped into a pleasant room, large and spacious, with a king-sized bed draped with snowy linens. \u201cYou have a bathroom here,\u201d Tucker said, indicating a side door. He turned to him with a big smile that didn\u2019t quite reach his eyes. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try to get settled in and I\u2019ll go find Gavin. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll want to say hello.\u201d He glanced over at Richard. \u201cWill you go with me? Um, Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou go ahead, Tucker. I\u2019ll follow you in a moment. I need to have a word with Kevin first.\u201d</p><p>Tucker glanced back and forth between them, and shoved his hands in his pockets. \u201cI can wait for you. If you think that\u2019s best?\u201d</p><p>Richard gave him a look that had Tucker glaring back at him for a long moment before finally lowering his gaze. \u201cGo ahead, Tucker,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI\u2019ll be there in a few minutes. I won\u2019t take long.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker nodded and left the room. Since when did Tucker take orders from this guy? Kevin glanced at him. \u201cOkay, what now? You want to warn me away from Tucker again? I assure you I got the message, but there\u2019s something weird about this place, and I\u2019m not going to rest until I find out what it is.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cYes, Kevin, I think you will find out.\u201d He came slowly toward him and without meaning to, Kevin took a backward step. Something feral in the man\u2019s eyes alarmed him, and he turned to take a half step toward the door. Richard grabbed his arm in a strong grip and with his free hand drew a hypodermic needle covered with a rubber tip from his pocket. Staring down at it in horror, Kevin yelled loudly for Tucker and tried to wrench away, but before he could, Richard used his teeth to rip away the rubber tip and bury the needle in his upper arm. Even as he struggled, a feeling of weakness and warmth spread over him, and he felt his knees collapse. Before he fell toward the floor, Richard caught him, holding him up against his firm body. He only had time to glare up at Richard accusingly, his curses coming out as garbled nonsense, before the darkness swallowed him up. As Richard laid him back on the bed, he could have sworn the man was sniffing at him again.</p><p>Richard looked down at the sleeping figure on the bed and then back at his alpha. Gavin was a handsome man, but if he didn\u2019t know how much his son loved Gavin, he might have been worried. As a matter of fact, he found it hard to understand how Tucker could have resisted Kevin\u2019s advances so long. There was no doubt that Kevin Bryson was one very beautiful and tempting human. Richard thought he might be fucking irresistible, in fact, and he longed to get his hands on his body again.</p><p>When they arrived back in the compound with him, he\u2019d told Tucker he wanted to talk to the detective, but he hadn\u2019t been truthful. He only wanted Tucker out of the way before he took care of Kevin. Richard had already made a decision on the way to the lodge that this stubborn man would never rest until he\u2019d uncovered their secrets. He wasn\u2019t sure the brainwashing techniques would be effective either. This man was too strong-minded and resistant. No, he had to be assimilated into the pack, even though he knew Tucker still wanted to talk things over. The first step in the process was to immobilize the man and make sure he wasn\u2019t wired, or being tracked in some way.</p><p>Once he got rid of Tucker and gave Kevin the injection, he\u2019d sent for Gavin. Gavin glanced down at Kevin\u2019s sleeping form on the bed. \u201cTucker\u2019s going to be furious at both of us, you realize that, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but it had to be done. He\u2019s been making a lot of threats to call in the local authorities.\u201d Richard gazed down at him and shook his head disapprovingly. \u201cStubborn, willful boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds a lot like your son,\u201d Gavin said, grinning.</p><p>Richard huffed out a breath and began to unbutton Kevin\u2019s shirt. \u201cMay as well get started. See if he has any kind of tracking devices on him that could lead someone to the compound.\u201d Though gammas usually handled something like this, Richard hadn\u2019t wanted any gammas touching Kevin. He told himself it was because Kevin was Tucker\u2019s friend, and he felt protective of him. They already had gammas downstairs going over his car before taking it back down the mountain to a secure location.</p> <p>When Gavin put his hands at Kevin\u2019s waistband, though, and started tugging off his pants, Richard felt both hot and cold at once, a feeling of possessiveness washing over him, a feeling so powerful he yelled, \u201cNo!\u201d at his alpha in alarm. Gavin froze, looking up at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cI mean, uh, let me do that, Alpha. Please.\u201d He gently nudged Gavin aside and took over, the thought of Gavin\u2019s hands on Kevin made him uneasy and nervous.</p><p>They had found nothing on him. Kevin was already stirring a bit as he came out of the mild sedative he\u2019d been given. His face was pale, and Richard checked his pulse for the third or fourth time to make sure it was still steady.</p><p>Kevin had a nice body underneath the sheet that was covering him. His face actually did look a bit like Brad Pitt\u2019s, as Tucker said, though softer, his face not so angular. Richard thought he was better looking too. His hand strayed to Kevin\u2019s hair, and he pushed it off his forehead. It was too long for a policeman, really. He wondered if they gave him a hard time about it. He noticed Gavin staring at Kevin, and felt vaguely jealous and uneasy. He reached down to pull the sheet up higher on Kevin\u2019s chest and saw his alpha give him a strange look.</p><p>\u201cHow are we going to proceed?\u201d Richard asked, and Gavin shrugged.</p><p>\u201cHell if I know,\u201d Gavin replied. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a situation like this before. If no one knows where he is, we keep him in here for a few days to let him get used to us. Tucker\u2019s already furious. He wanted one more try to convince him to leave and keep his mouth shut, but you made that decision easy for me. We\u2019re pretty much committed now. I\u2019ll have to consult with the other alphas, but I know they\u2019ll agree assimilation is our best option. Tucker will have to come to terms with it, somehow. In the meantime, we\u2019ll have time to convince him to let us select a mate for him. I don\u2019t want to have to force him. The full moon is in another few days, so we\u2019ll need to keep a close watch on him until afterward. There\u2019ll be enough going on then without adding this to the mix.\u201d He stared down at him and frowned. \u201cPerhaps in time, he\u2019ll want to join us. Or we can persuade him. Are you sure you couldn\u2019t tell about him from your talk in the hotel or on the way over here? Do you think he\u2019ll be able to join the pack and follow orders? Pack hierarchy is usually the hardest thing for humans to adjust to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard shook his head. \u201cHe was too resentful of me and too anxious to protect Tucker for me to get a good read on him. I couldn\u2019t get a clear notion of how submissive he is. When I put him down on the bed, he did give in, but not right away. I think the right man could master him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe right man, huh? And who would that be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. It would have to be someone my age or older, probably. Someone\u2019s who\u2019s learned some patience. Someone who isn\u2019t still trying to find a bloodmatch, yet attractive enough that he can seduce him. Tucker insists this can\u2019t be a forced mating, and I\u2019d really hate to resort to any kind of mind altering techniques with him. He\u2019s been a good friend to Tucker. He came here out of concern for him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gavin said thoughtfully. He regarded his beta speculatively. \u201cActually, this prospective wolf mate you\u2019re describing sounds a little like you.\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head firmly. \u201cNo. No way. My bloodmate died a long time ago, and I have no interest in a love match. No. We\u2019ll find him someone, if not here, then at one of the other lodges. That is, if he\u2019s suitable. We don\u2019t want to pair him with someone who\u2019ll make his life miserable...and vice versa.\u201d</p><p>A door closing behind Richard caused him to turn as Tucker came in the room. He walked up beside Gavin, hugging his arms to his chest, obviously still upset. \u201cNot awake yet, huh? Damn, he\u2019s going to be so angry. I wonder if he\u2019ll ever speak to me again.\u201d He turned to his father. \u201cI should have been given a chance to explain things to him first. You didn\u2019t have to drug him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you think he would willingly have let us strip search him and take his car, then you don\u2019t know him as well as you think you do.\u201d</p><p>Gavin broke in. \u201cTucker, it\u2019s not up to you, honey. This is a pack decision.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry, Tucker, and I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Richard said. \u201cI have to do what I think is best for all of us, and we had to make sure he didn\u2019t have any tracking devices. From what I\u2019ve seen of him so far, I knew he\u2019d fight me. I didn\u2019t hurt him...the doctor assured me the sedative was fairly mild, even though it was fast-acting. He\u2019ll wake up soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you still determined to be in here with him alone when he wakes up?\u201d Tucker asked his father.</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s best. He\u2019s familiar with me, and he already thinks of me as the bad guy. Let him cuss me for a while and calm down before I call you in,\u201d Richard said.</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re doing the bad cop, good cop thing, hmm? Okay, but don\u2019t get him too crazy, or I won\u2019t be able to settle him down enough to get him to listen to me,\u201d Tucker said. He pointed his finger at his father. \u201cAnd don\u2019t make him mad. You guys don\u2019t always realize how overbearing you can be.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cI make no promises. He\u2019s got a short fuse.\u201d</p><p>Kevin groaned and raised his knee restlessly, trying to turn over. The cuff on one wrist attached to the headboard prevented it.</p> <p>\u201cIs cuffing him really necessary?\u201d Tucker asked.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t keep it on him long. Just making a point with him, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Tucker opened his mouth to say more, but a loud groan from the bed stopped him. Kevin thrashed his head on the pillow. \u201cBetter get out of here,\u201d Richard said. \u201cIt looks like he\u2019s waking up. I\u2019ll call you after we talk.\u201d</p><p>Tucker left with reluctance, allowing Gavin to tug him away, and Richard was alone with the beautiful man on the bed. Giving into the temptation to touch him, he brushed his fingers over one flushed cheek. He thought about what Gavin had said about him taking this man for a mate.</p><p>It had been so long since he\u2019d allowed himself to have someone to love. As the beta, he lived his life mostly for the good of his alpha and his pack. Only once had he allowed himself to love someone who belonged only to him, and for that brief span of time, he\u2019d had a treasure in his hands, only to have it snatched cruelly away. Now this new treasure was here within reach. Was it possible to have it all again? Did he dare to even try? There had been cases\u2014a few\u2014where a wolf had managed to not only survive the death of his mate but to find love again. The beta of the North Carolina pack had managed it. It was very rare, but possible.</p><p>His wolf stirred inside him, restless and edgy. He dropped his hand and turned away. No, it was too risky, and there was too much to lose. This time, if he lost, he knew he wouldn\u2019t survive. The pain would surely kill him. He wouldn\u2019t risk it all again, no matter how much he wanted this man. He stood up and crossed to the window as Kevin moved his head on the pillow, trying to wake up. Richard stared out the window and hardened his heart. He wouldn\u2019t be hurt like that again. A love like he\u2019d had with his wife only came once in a blue moon, and never came again. Besides, this guy didn\u2019t even like him. He glanced back over at him. If only he wasn\u2019t so desirable.</p><p>Kevin\u2019s eyelids fluttered and then opened, as he tried to wake up. He lay on his back, one wrist bound above his head. Groggily, he took stock of his situation. His head ached and his stomach twisted with nausea when he tried to sit up. He was cuffed to a soft bed in a darkened room. His clothing had been removed, but he didn\u2019t seem to have any injuries. Tucker must have prevented that. Tucker...it hurt to think he was part of this, but he knew he wasn\u2019t really responsible for the betrayal. The bastards who brainwashed him were behind all of it.</p><p>He heard a slight noise to his left and saw the man who had attacked and drugged him standing by the window. He was silent, watching. It was a little scary to realize he could be so quiet and unmoving. It didn\u2019t seem natural, somehow. Had he been watching Kevin as he slept? The idea caused a chill to run down Kevin\u2019s spine. Richard\u2019s gaze seemed to be measuring Kevin, though his posture was relaxed, and his face calm. His expression gave no indication of what he had planned for him.</p> <p>The silence grew as they stared at each other. Richard let his unreadable gaze travel slowly over Kevin\u2019s body and though Kevin was covered with a sheet, Richard\u2019s eyes seemed to map every inch of him. Kevin was irritated to feel a hot blush starting on his cheeks. He had no doubt who had undressed him as he lay unconscious. He glanced up into the man\u2019s eyes and saw the cool, steady regard. Once they arrived at the compound, Kevin had let his guard down, and now he would pay the price. This man was a predator, and he would do well to remember that.</p><p>His mouth felt as dry and dusty as a backcountry road as he cleared his throat to speak. \u201cWell, I should have known you\u2019d be here. Where\u2019s Tucker? Why the fuck am I cuffed to this bed?\u201d</p><p>Richard prowled closer to the bed, his eyes intent on Kevin\u2019s face. \u201cTucker\u2019s fine. He\u2019ll be in to see you soon, but first you and I are going to have a little talk.\u201d</p><p>Kevin pulled viciously at the cuff on his wrist. \u201cGet me out of this shit!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down before you hurt yourself. I\u2019ll release you in a moment, but first we need to get a few things straight between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have nothing to say to you, asshole. Do you have any idea how much shit you\u2019re going to bring down on your heads by attacking me and holding me like this? I\u2019m an officer of the law\u2014do you really think you can get away with it?\u201d</p><p>Richard lifted one shoulder in a shrug. \u201cWe already have, Kevin. And I don\u2019t think you told anyone where you were going when you decided to come up here on your little rescue mission, because you didn\u2019t want anyone to know in case Tucker turned you down. You\u2019re here on your own because you couldn\u2019t stand to let him go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit.\u201d Kevin glared at him, putting everything he felt, all the anger and frustration, even a little of the fear and desperation at the situation he found himself in\u2014everything\u2014into that look. He saw something move on Richard\u2019s face and it softened, just the slightest bit as he came toward him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you go, so long as you remember you\u2019re a prisoner here. You can stop making threats, because none of this is under your control anymore. Understand?\u201d</p><p>Kevin glared up at him silently, feeling cold fury, his gaze promising retribution.</p><p>Richard met his gaze unflinchingly. \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, damn it. I understand.\u201d</p><p>Richard pulled a key from his pocket and released him from the cuff. He stepped back as Kevin sat up, rubbing his wrist, and swung his bare legs over the side of the bed. He was careful to keep the sheet over his lap, and he could feel another flush slowly rising over his cheekbones. He resisted the urge to put his hands over his cock, instead meeting his captor\u2019s gaze with a steady stare.</p><p>\u201cSo now what happens? You try to brainwash me too?\u201d</p><p>Again, an odd look passed over Richard\u2019s face but he sat down in the armchair next to the bed and leaned forward. \u201cFor the next day or so, nothing much happens. I\u2019ll let you talk to Tucker, and you\u2019ll mostly stay here until we can make preparations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPreparations for what, damn it?\u201d</p><p>Richard shrugged, and Kevin made a sound of anger and impatience.</p><p>\u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for Tucker, you\u2019d be waking up in a cell down in the basement right now, so count yourself lucky.\u201d Richard said sternly. \u201cThis is a private group, Kevin. We don\u2019t appreciate outsiders coming to spy on us and threaten us, and we protect our family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFamily?\u201d Kevin snorted. \u201cSave the bullshit, Richard, I\u2019m not drinking your kool-aid. If you let me go and take Tucker with me, I\u2019ll tell the police you cooperated and maybe they\u2019ll go easy on you. It\u2019s your best chance.\u201d</p><p>Richard raised one eyebrow. \u201cNo, actually, I don\u2019t think it is. We have something different in mind for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what? I\u2019m warning you, asshole...\u201d Kevin stood up, clenching his fists around the sheet to keep it around his hips. He hated this, hated the smug bastard in front of him, hated the fact that he\u2019d allowed himself to walk right into their trap. He wanted to smash his face in, make him feel as frustrated and furious as he did right that moment. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Aggressively, he took a step toward him. \u201cWho the hell are you anyway? Are you fucking Tucker too? Is that it? Are you guys in some kind of three-way?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s reaction was immediate. He jumped up from the chair, his face dull red, his mouth open in surprise. His hands shot out and shoved Kevin hard on his chest, knocking him back on the bed.</p><p>Kevin scrambled back to his feet, throwing the sheet down in his fury. He took a step forward and shoved back, putting everything he had into it, all his fear and his rage. Richard stumbled backward, his big body mostly absorbing the shock, but Kevin was gratified to see he\u2019d surprised him.</p> <p>Richard stood still for a moment, seeming to gather himself, taking in deep breaths and clenching his fists. In seconds, his face was smooth and calm again, and Kevin could see that he\u2019d mastered the flash of anger his words had caused. Suddenly, he didn\u2019t want Richard to be so in charge of his feelings anymore. He wanted him to experience the same savage passion and rage he was feeling. He sneered at him, taunting him deliberately. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Richard? Afraid your little secret will get out? Doesn\u2019t Gavin know about you and Tucker? Are you two sneaking around behind his back? How does it feel to have your cock up that sweet little ass? Or does he put his dick up yours? Is that what you like?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d He reached for Kevin, who put his hands up defensively, expecting to be hit in the face. Richard grabbed his wrists instead, and they struggled, each determined to get the upper hand. As they scuffled back and forth, Kevin trying his best to break Richard\u2019s incredibly strong hold on his wrists, Kevin was slammed back into the wall by the bed, and Richard forced his hands above his head.</p><p>They were almost nose to nose, and once again, he was almost overwhelmed by Richard\u2019s scent, which was teasing him and making him foggy with desire.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk shit you don\u2019t know anything about! What you\u2019re saying is disgusting!\u201d Richard yelled.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Because Tucker is a man? You\u2019re not into men, is that it? Or you just think you\u2019re not? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a straight guy wanted to have a little something on the side. Tucker\u2019s pretty sweet, isn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Richard kept his tight hold on his wrists, and bent to take Kevin\u2019s mouth in a punishing kiss. At first he practically ground his lips against Kevin\u2019s, but when Kevin reacted instinctively and parted his lips, he stopped his rough assault, just holding his lips against his, breathing hard into his mouth. The next second, Kevin heard a low growling sound coming from his throat, and he was licking gently at his lips. Kevin opened his own mouth farther and tentatively pushed out the tip of his tongue to meet Richard\u2019s. Richard swept his tongue over Kevin\u2019s and thrust inside his mouth.</p><p>Kevin let out a low moan as his body betrayed him. He could no longer concentrate on anything except the man\u2019s tongue sweeping over the inside of his mouth, the heat making his balls draw up and his cock thicken. He couldn\u2019t catch his breath and the bastard holding him wasn\u2019t letting up. He thrashed his head from side to side, trying to escape, but Richard only laughed and put up one hand to hold his chin, while the other hand effortlessly held both of Kevin\u2019s wrists against the wall. His laugh was a low, throaty rumble that made Kevin\u2019s balls tighten to the point of pain. He kissed him until Kevin\u2019s lips felt raw and only when he sensed Kevin\u2019s surrender did he slowly withdraw, giving his lips a final little lick. It was scary how easily he controlled him, and Kevin slowly became aware of how very naked he was.</p><p>He froze when Richard\u2019s large hand grasped his cock. For a long moment they simply stared at each other, the intimacy of standing so close with Kevin\u2019s cock in this virtual stranger\u2019s grip made his knees almost collapse. When Kevin glanced down to stare at the hand wrapped tightly around him, Richard\u2019s voice rasped at him. \u201cLook at me.\u201d</p><p>Kevin obeyed, feeling almost compelled.</p><p>\u201cDo you want me, Kevin? If you want this, all you have to do is nod. Just tilt your head up and back down.\u201d He blew softly in his ear. \u201cThat\u2019s all it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! I don\u2019t want any of this. I didn\u2019t want you kissing me, and I don\u2019t want your hand on me either!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Richard leaned forward, his own breathing fast and hot in Kevin\u2019s ear. \u201cIs that why you were moaning in my mouth just now? Is that why you\u2019re so hard?\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s legs were trembling. Why couldn\u2019t he just tell him to fuck off? Strangely, he wasn\u2019t frightened of him, even though he was holding him so tightly. Kevin had a feeling he wouldn\u2019t hurt him. He raised his eyes to Richard\u2019s and caught his steady gaze. Richard\u2019s lips curved up in a beautiful smile. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Look at me. Can you see how much I want you? You\u2019re so goddamned beautiful. All you have to do is ask me to pleasure you.\u201d</p><p>Kevin took a deep, shaky breath. God knew he wanted it. It had been a long time since he\u2019d been so attracted to anyone, since anyone\u2019s hand had felt so good. Holding Richard\u2019s gaze, he nodded his head slowly up and down.</p><p>Richard smiled at him in triumph and slowly pumped his dick in his hand, never taking his eyes off him. \u201cFeel good?\u201d he whispered, leaning down to lick the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Kevin flicked his gaze up at him, and Richard responded by holding that gaze, his grip on Kevin incredibly firm and hot. Kevin heard himself whimper as the hand sped up, the pressure increasing. He pumped him slowly up and down, only gradually increasing the speed and the tempo. His thumb grazed over the leaking tip of Kevin\u2019s cock and he smeared the pre-cum over the sensitive head.</p><p>Kevin was so close he thought he was about to embarrass himself by coming so soon. He slammed his head back against the wall to distract himself, but Richard followed him and took his mouth again, pressing those warm, full lips against his, his tongue flicking out to lick at the corners of his mouth. Then without warning, he flicked his thumb down into the sensitive slit and squeezed. Kevin threw back his head and his orgasm raced through him, the hot cum pulsing from his body in long streams. He was coming in Richard\u2019s hand, helpless to prevent it, and the man smiled down at him, capturing his groans in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, come on.\u201d Richard continued to milk his cock for every drop until his grip became painful and Kevin was sagging. Only then did he release him and catch him around the waist when he would have fallen. He put him back on the side of the bed. \u201cSit still,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>He disappeared through one of the two doors in the room and when turned on the light, Kevin could see it was a bathroom. Kevin heard the water running. He came back in only a few minutes with a cloth, while Kevin was still trying to catch his breath. Kevin reached for the cloth, but Richard shook his head and pushed his hand away, cleaning Kevin himself. He made him spread his legs while he washed him thoroughly, to Kevin\u2019s hot embarrassment and then draped the sheet back over his lap, looking into Kevin\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>\u201cSweet boy,\u201d he said, and moved his hands so they were trailing across Kevin\u2019s shoulders. Finally, he let him go and crossed back over to the window.</p><p>When the silence dragged out to the point where it became excruciating, Richard finally spoke. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I shoved you before. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. I don\u2019t why you make me so...\u201d he stopped in mid-sentence, looking up at the ceiling as if to find an answer there. Finally he started again. \u201cDid I hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Kevin shook his head, still unwilling to look at him.</p><p>\u201cWhat you said about me and Tucker...it\u2019s not true. Tucker is my...Tucker is a relative. A close relative and what you said made me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was just popping off. I didn\u2019t really believe it,\u201d he said grudgingly.</p><p>Richard stood for another few moments, and Kevin could almost feel the restlessness radiating off him. Finally he spoke. \u201cI have to go, but Tucker will be in to bring you something to eat, and I\u2019ll be back later. You\u2019ll be seeing a lot of me until...\u201d Kevin darted a glance up at him, and he smiled, shaking his head. \u201cRelax for now. Try to get some rest, and Tucker will be in soon.\u201d He strode toward the door, not even glancing back at him once before he left the room.</p><p>Kevin looked down at his traitorous cock, \u201cA fat lot of help you were...\u201d he muttered, wishing he\u2019d never come on this crazy rescue mission, wishing he could just close his eyes and fade away, escaping this room, this situation and the crazy attraction he was feeling for a man who could so easily eat him alive.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>He was still sitting on the side of the bed a few minutes later when a soft knock came at the door and it opened slowly. Tucker came in alone, holding some clothes folded in his hand. He stood just inside the door for a long moment, as if unsure of his welcome. He seemed nervous and uneasy.</p><p>Kevin sighed. \u201cIf those are for me, give them to me. It\u2019s cold in here, and I\u2019m freezing.\u201d</p><p>Tucker looked concerned and turned first to the controls on the wall, giving them a turn. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize.\u201d He brought the clothes over to him. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any pants that would fit you, but I brought some shorts, and a shirt. You\u2019re a little bigger than me, but I think they\u2019ll fit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about my things? I saw him bring in my suitcase.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Well, they\u2019ve been taken away, Kevin. You know, in case there was any kind of tracking device or anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my clothes? God, I\u2019m not James Bond.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but they\u2019re being really cautious.\u201d He stuck his hands down in his pockets and rocked back and forth on his heels nervously. \u201cI, uh...I guess you\u2019re pretty pissed off at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d Kevin stood up, letting the sheet fall and noticed how Tucker averted his gaze. That was new. He\u2019d never been hesitant to look at him before in the locker room at the gym or the couple of times they\u2019d gone swimming in the nude late at night on the beach outside his parents\u2019 condo. He pulled on the clothes Tucker had brought him quickly, half afraid Richard might come back in the room. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hoped you\u2019d understand,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I tricked you, Bry. The more we talked, and the things you were saying...I knew you had to come with us. I thought if you came on your own, it would be easier on you, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is that guy, anyway? He acts like he has the right to boss you around.\u201d</p><p>Tucker lowered his gaze and pressed his bottom lip between his teeth before he spoke. \u201cYeah, he kind of does have the right. In a way. I don\u2019t always pay attention, though,\u201d he said, a wry smile tilting up the corners of his mouth.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell, Tucker, are you trying to be cryptic? Who is he?\u201d</p><p>When Tucker crossed his arms and shook his head, Kevin lost patience. \u201cTucker, I\u2019m getting out of here, and I\u2019m taking you with me, whether you go willingly or not,\u201d Kevin said grimly.</p><p>Tucker shook his head. \u201cGod, Kevin, what does it take to get through to you? You won\u2019t be able to leave. They won\u2019t let you! In case you haven\u2019t noticed, you\u2019ve been locked naked in a room inside the lodge. How the hell do you think you\u2019re getting out of here? And I\u2019m here because I want to be. You don\u2019t understand. There\u2019s a secret here, but it\u2019s not about any kind of religion or cult. Actually I\u2019m a part of it all, but I-I can\u2019t tell you yet. But I can promise you, I\u2019m all right. I\u2019m in love with Gavin, and he gives me everything I need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat kind of damn secret? What do you mean you\u2019re part of it but you can\u2019t tell me yet? How could you just walk away from everything...your job, your home...your whole damn life, just to be with him? Why is everything such a fucking mystery?\u201d</p><p>Looking miserable, Tucker put a hand on his arm. \u201cI will tell you, but not yet. You\u2019ll know everything soon, Kevin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh? How is that? Because they\u2019re about to do to me whatever they\u2019ve done to you? You say it\u2019s not brainwashing...well, then what is it? Some kind of drugs? Is it what Richard shot into me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I promise you, Kevin, that was only a sedative, and I\u2019m not taking any kind of drugs.\u201d He raised his eyes to the ceiling. \u201cDamn it, this is too hard. I just need to go ahead and tell you.\u201d</p><p>The door opened and Richard strode back in. His eyes went straight to Kevin and roamed over him almost possessively before he stopped beside Tucker and put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI came back to tell you they\u2019re serving dinner downstairs. Would you mind getting Kevin a tray, since you know more about what he likes than I do?\u201d</p><p>Tucker nodded. \u201cSure. Be back in a few minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTake your time. I\u2019m not eating anything either of you give me.\u201d Kevin pushed the words through clenched teeth, more for Richard\u2019s benefit than Tucker\u2019s. Casting an accusing glare at Richard, who was standing way too close to Tucker to suit him, he wondered just who he was most jealous of, Tucker or Richard? What the hell was wrong with him, damn it?</p><p>Richard regarded him calmly. \u201cYou need to eat. You\u2019ll get sick if you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll get sick.\u201d</p><p>Richard got a stubborn look on his face, and for just a moment, he reminded Kevin of somebody, but he couldn\u2019t put his finger on it. \u201cYou\u2019ll eat or I\u2019ll make you eat. Suit yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you,\u201d Kevin said and raised a fist to smash it into that arrogant mouth. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, would you? Go ahead, take your best shot.\u201d Richard stepped forward, seeming ready to take him on, but before they could clash, Tucker was between them, pushing back on Richard\u2019s chest.</p><p>\u201cPlease stop,\u201d he said, looking up at Richard. He spoke over his shoulder to Kevin. \u201cI told you I wouldn\u2019t drug you, and I won\u2019t. Damn, chill out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cChill out? You invited me to come here, and this guy drugs me with a hypodermic needle and cuffs me naked to a bed. Not exactly chill inspiring.\u201d</p><p>Richard growled at him, low in his chest, but Kevin refused to back down. Kevin grabbed Tucker, pushing him aside and squared off to the big man opposite him. Kevin drew back his fist again. \u201cGo ahead, asshole. Do what you need to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, stand down.\u201d A commanding voice from the open doorway made them all whip their heads around to see Gavin. He strode forward and gently put Tucker behind him before turning to Kevin. \u201cNo one will drug you again, Kevin, and you need to eat, though I understand how you must feel. Would you feel better if Tucker tasted everything for you and let you watch him? He can do that for you if you like. We don\u2019t have to resort to drugging your food. You should realize that by now. If we wanted to drug you, we\u2019d just do it, like we did before.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kevin said tiredly, flopping down on the side of the bed. He felt stupid for making such a big deal about it. He didn\u2019t really think the food would be drugged, and he actually did kind of trust Tucker not to hurt him willingly. It was Richard, really. Everything about the damn man set his teeth on edge. He was angry at himself for noticing Richard\u2019s scent as he walked in again, too, a woodsy, subtle cologne mixed with a very male odor. It had assaulted his nose the second he came through the door and he\u2019d had to shift his feet a little to hide his sudden erection. Damn the man. How could he possibly be attracted to him? Besides, Tucker had been about to tell him something when he walked in. Maybe something that would help him figure out how to get out of this mess.</p><p>Richard shoved his hands in his pockets and stared moodily at him. \u201cI\u2019ll go then, since I just upset him.\u201d He got to the door and turned, glaring back at Kevin. \u201cI don\u2019t think it does any good to coddle him, though. He needs to learn some manners. Tell him what to do, and I\u2019ll make sure he does it.\u201d</p><p>As he left, Kevin muttered, \u201cYeah, like hell you will. Fuck you,\u201d mostly under his breath, but Gavin heard him. He frowned a bit, but didn\u2019t say anything, just folded his arms over his chest and regarded Kevin quietly.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll go get that tray,\u201d Tucker said, clearing his throat. \u201cGavin?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll stay here with Detective Bryson until you get back. I\u2019d like to have a word with him.\u201d</p><p>Tucker nodded and cast Kevin an anxious glance as he left. Kevin turned to Gavin belligerently. \u201cWhat the fuck now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you\u2019re angry, but you came looking for us, remember? We didn\u2019t come and drag you up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike you did with Tucker?\u201d</p><p>Gavin made a noise of impatience. \u201cSurely you know Tucker well enough to know he wouldn\u2019t have stood for that. And if I had tried to just overpower him and bring him here against his will, do you really think he\u2019d have gone through a commitment ceremony with me?\u201d</p><p>Kevin shrugged. \u201cYou played mind games with him. Coerced him somehow, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>Shaking his head, Gavin sighed. \u201cYou know better than that. No, I convinced him to stay because I love him, and he loves me. Even after he knew exactly what I am, and what he is too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you are? What the hell does that mean? More mysteries, I guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKevin, this is my home, and the people you saw downstairs are all part of my...family. We call it a pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA pack?\u201d Kevin said blankly. \u201cLike wolves?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, exactly like wolves,\u201d he said eagerly, his dark eyes lighting up. \u201cWolves feel more comfortable together in a close family unit. Wolves have rankings within the pack. Their leader is the alpha.\u201d He regarded Kevin steadily, maybe checking for his reaction to this drivel. Kevin tried to keep his face blank. He was finally getting some information, no matter how crazy, and he wanted to learn everything he could.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the alpha of this pack, Kevin. Richard is my beta, or my second in command.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Kevin said slowly. \u201cAnd what does that make Tucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker is my mate. Tucker is related to our pack too, even though his grandparents took him from us when he was only a baby. When we found him again, and explained things to him, he agreed to come here with us and meet everyone, including his father, who\u2019d been searching for him for years. Of course, I wanted him to stay, and I tried my best to convince him. His father did too. In the end, he made his decision, and I think I can safely say he doesn\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd if he\u2019d decided not to stay? Would you have taken away his clothes and cuffed him to a bed like you did me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker\u2019s situation was different, and I\u2019m not sure what would have happened if he\u2019d decided he didn\u2019t want to stay once he\u2019d seen the compound and knew...all he knew about us. I guess I\u2019m only just realizing what a chance I took with him. I told him before he came that he could leave here if he didn\u2019t want to stay, but I know now I wasn\u2019t telling him the complete truth of the matter. I let my own emotions cloud my judgment. I would have let him go, because I wouldn\u2019t have broken my promise to him, but the others wouldn\u2019t have felt the same way and might have gone after him. No, I took a terrible risk with him, and I\u2019m so relieved it turned out for the best. I\u2019m afraid my luck has run out though, with you, Kevin.\u201d</p><p>Kevin felt an icicle of fear spear down his spine. He shifted uncomfortably. \u201cYour luck or mine?\u201d</p><p>Gavin glanced up, startled. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it that way. We\u2019d never hurt you, Kevin, any more than we already have. I promise you. What I meant was, we can\u2019t just let you leave. You\u2019ve been a good friend to Tucker over the years, and I owe you honesty at least. You have to be assimilated into our pack, Kevin. I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s the best possible scenario for you now.\u201d</p><p>We can\u2019t let you leave. Those words terrified him, but he couldn\u2019t let that show. He stood up and walked to the window, gazing out, trying to calm his nerves. A few people were walking around outside, looking purposeful, as if they were doing some nightly chore. Everything looked so fucking normal. Except that nothing was normal about any of this. Clenching his fists so hard he could feel his nails biting into his palms, he took a couple of steadying breaths. He had to keep his wits about him. Try to play along until he could find a way out. He knew Gavin was waiting for some kind of response. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAssimilated? What does that mean?\u201d he asked sharply.</p><p>\u201cIt means you\u2019ll be staying here with us, and you\u2019ll become one of us. You\u2019ll have to let your parents and friends know about it eventually, of course, once you\u2019ve settled in a bit. You\u2019ll have a good life here though, and I think you\u2019ll be happy one day. I hope so anyway.\u201d</p><p>Good life? As a prisoner?Was he serious? Before Kevin could even figure out a response to this, he heard a noise at the door. It was Tucker, holding Kevin\u2019s dinner tray in his hands, and he looked furious. \u201cSo much for your promise to let me be with you when you explained things to him. Are all your promises lies then? Are any of you people even able to tell the truth?\u201d</p> <p>Gavin crossed over to him and tried to take him in his arms, but Tucker pulled away in anger. He went over to put the tray down on the bed and stood beside Kevin protectively, his body vibrating with emotion. Gavin followed him and turned him to look at him.</p><p>\u201cYou misunderstood, Tucker. I haven\u2019t exactly explained things yet. I was just telling him he has to stay with us. I thought maybe we should explain things a little at a time.\u201d</p><p>Tucker rolled his eyes. \u201cBecause that will make any of this acceptable to him? Don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker, I\u2019ve been speaking with Marco and Zack. Both of them were quite clear that they\u2019d never go along with just letting him go back to Florida. There\u2019s too much at stake. He\u2019ll have to join the pack. I should have waited for you, but I saw an opportunity and...\u201d He sighed. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Again, he tried to take Tucker in his arms and again, Tucker shied away from him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He turned back to Kevin and took his hand in his. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got you into this. I know you came here out of concern for me, and I promise you I never meant for any of this to happen. I should have called you sooner. I should have reassured you more often.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin tried again to put an arm around him and this time Tucker let him, even leaning against him a little. \u201cYou were sick for a long time, honey. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSick? What was wrong with him?\u201d Kevin asked, narrowing his eyes. \u201cDid you do something to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Both Tucker and Gavin spoke at the same time. Tucker put a hand on Gavin\u2019s chest and turned to face Kevin. \u201cRight after our ceremony, something happened. I was...attacked by some of the same killers who were operating in Florida. It\u2019s hard to explain, but I will explain it all to you, Kevin. I promise. It\u2019s just that it\u2019s going to be hard for you to believe. It was for me at first. There\u2019s just so much...I mean it goes against everything we ever believed about the world...about everything...\u201d His voice trailed off, and he seemed completely at a loss.</p><p>Kevin looked back and forth between them. \u201cOkay, if this is supposed to reassure me\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gavin spoke up. \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to scare you, Kevin, but Tucker\u2019s right. All of this will be difficult for you to believe. I\u2019m no good at explaining this. When I told Tucker the first time, he passed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, what exactly is about to happen? I demand to know the truth. I\u2019m not understanding any of this, and you\u2019re freaking me out.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker opened his mouth to speak, but Gavin cut in. \u201cThere are only two ways to proceed from this point, Kevin. Neither is a great option, but it\u2019s all we have. We thought about trying some drugs on you that would wipe away your memories, but that method is risky in that it\u2019s unpredictable. It could wipe away all your memories. The risk is too great, in my opinion, and we don\u2019t want to risk harming your mental faculties. The other thing we can do, and the thing we\u2019ve decided on is to join you to someone in the pack. You\u2019d become their mate, like their husband, and stay here with us. Once you\u2019ve settled, you\u2019d be free to come and go as you pleased, so long as your mate agreed. You\u2019d be like Tucker, in a way. Fully a member of our pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pack? Mate someone? I can\u2019t even fathom what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d He shuddered and gazed over at Tucker then down at himself. \u201cDo I have it on me, Tucker? I feel like I got the crazy all over me, and I need to wash it off.\u201d</p><p>Tucker allowed a surprised chuckle to slip out. Even Gavin smiled a little. \u201cI know it sounds outrageous, Kevin. You don\u2019t understand fully yet, and I can\u2019t explain it more right now. It would be too much to for you to take in. The day after tomorrow\u2019s the full moon. Maybe afterward...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happens on the full moon? You talk like you\u2019re all vampires or some shit.\u201d He got a horrified look on his face. \u201cIs that it? You think you\u2019re vampires or creatures or something? Tucker, tell me you haven\u2019t been sucked into this.\u201d</p><p>Tucker shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t been sucked into anything, Kevin.\u201d He turned back to Gavin. \u201cHe\u2019ll never believe it until he sees it for himself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>They both gazed back at him, Tucker nervously twisting his hands and Gavin with a speculative expression. Gavin finally spoke. \u201cDay after tomorrow, Kevin. Can you trust us just a little until then? We\u2019ll take you to our ceremony. We have one each month on the night of the full moon. Everything will be explained to you then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell no, I want to know now. I want to know what craziness you\u2019ve made Tucker believe.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin shook his head. \u201cLater.\u201d His voice held that hint of steely determination and command Kevin had heard earlier. He doubted he could budge him further.</p><p>\u201cTucker, you can visit more with Kevin in the morning, but for now I\u2019d like you to come with me.\u201d Gavin held out his hand.</p><p>Tucker took the hand, smiling at Kevin, probably trying to reassure him. It wasn\u2019t working. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning, Kevin. Try to get some rest if you can. There are extra blankets in the closet if you need them.\u201d</p><p>They left together and Kevin sat on the bed for a few minutes before he put the tray down on the floor. He was hungry, but he still couldn\u2019t get the idea of being drugged completely out of his head. Tucker wouldn\u2019t drug him deliberately, but it seemed to him that Tucker wasn\u2019t in charge of much of this. He got up and moved restlessly to the window. There was a steel mesh screen bolted to the window. So much for trying that as a way out of the room. Gazing across the yard, he saw that the outside lights were still on, lighting up the grounds of the complex. The woods outside the light seemed so dark and thick. He was reminded of the Robert Frost poem\u2014</p><p>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,</p><p>But I have promises to keep,</p><p>And miles to go before I sleep...</p><p>Exhausted, he rested his head against the cold glass, and tears stung his eyes. What the hell had he gotten himself into? Would he ever be able to go home?</p><p>A brief knock on the door made him turn to see Richard coming in with a small tray. He dashed the moisture from his eyes, but he thought Richard noticed him doing it. He stood by the door and looked meaningfully at the still full dinner tray on the floor. \u201cI was afraid of that. Stubborn. Pigheaded...\u201d He came farther into the room and held out the smaller tray toward Kevin. On it was an apple, a banana, several unopened packets of crackers and a wrapped piece of soft cheese, along with a canned cola. \u201cHere, you have to eat. I figured maybe you\u2019d know this was all safe.\u201d</p><p>Kevin took the tray and couldn\u2019t resist a brief glance up into those dark eyes. \u201cThanks. There. Is that any improvement in my \u2018manners\u2019?\u201d He smiled a little when he saw the blush begin on the big man\u2019s cheeks.</p><p>\u201cSorry about that. I lost my temper, but you don\u2019t need to get sick or not sleep well because you\u2019re hungry. You can carry this defiance shit too far.\u201d</p><p>Kevin took a bite of the apple. \u201cWell...thanks.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded and turned to leave. When he got to the door, he turned. \u201cI\u2019ll come back in the morning. I usually take an early morning walk. I\u2019d like you to go with me. You need to see things are not as bad here as you\u2019re thinking, and it\u2019ll get you out of here for a little while.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d Kevin replied.</p><p>He frowned and went out, but just before he closed the door, he leaned back in. \u201cGoodnight, Kevin.\u201d The door closed gently behind him and Kevin heard the door locks snick to. Locked in, of course. He popped the lid on the can of soda and took a long sip. Well, it had been an interesting trip so far, to say the least. Maybe even life changing. He couldn\u2019t wait to see what happened next, except for the cold chill he got every time he thought about the word assimilated.</p><p>It was like something out of some science-fiction series. Some of his favorite Star Trek and Doctor Who episodes were the ones with the Borg and the Cybermen, who went around sucking the humanity from people, saying in their robotic voices, \u201cYou will be assimilated.\u201d</p><p>That image almost brought a smile to his face. Almost. He took his tray over to the armchair by the window\u2014also locked, of course\u2014and chewed thoughtfully on his apple, staring out onto the compound. Just exactly what kind of craziness had he stumbled onto here? And what was in store for him the day after tomorrow on the night of the full moon?</p><p>Sunlight shone through his windows early the next morning, waking Kevin up. He stretched, then got up and wandered into the bathroom. He\u2019d slept a lot better than he thought he would. All that adrenaline had exhausted him, he supposed. Staring at himself in the mirror over the sink, he decided he looked pretty rough. He was unshaven and badly in need of a shower. He turned the water on in the big tiled shower and used the toilet. Then he stepped under the hot stream and let the water just soak him for a while. It felt good running down his back and he stood under the spray for several minutes, using the shower gel already there to clean himself. He got out and dried off on fluffy, expensive-looking towels, then looked through the drawers in the vanity. There he found toothbrushes still in the wrappers, toothpaste and even a new razor. After making use of all of it, using shower gel to help soften his beard, he felt a hundred percent better. He heard someone come in the door, and he came out to see who it was. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood, you\u2019re up.\u201d Richard said, standing near the door. He glanced down at the towel around Kevin\u2019s hips. \u201cIf you\u2019ll get dressed, I\u2019ll take you down to breakfast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? You mean you\u2019re not going to handcuff me or blindfold me or anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I can handle you, Detective Bryson, just as you are. Are you interested, or should I bring you another tray?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh no, I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. I may not have that many more chances...as I\u2019m about to be assimilated and all. Who knows when I\u2019ll have a chance to go downstairs again?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAssimilated? Who used that word with you? Did Tucker tell you that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gavin did. After you left me with him last night, he told me that he\u2019d considered wiping out all my memories, but graciously decided instead to let me join your uh...pack. Oh, and find me a mate too.\u201d Though he was proud of his flippant tone, he could feel his knees start to tremble. To cover, he sat down on the side of the bed and gripped them hard, looking up at Richard defiantly. \u201cWhat...doesn\u2019t he tell you everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him or Tucker since last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d He meant to give a bitter little laugh, and was horrified that it came out almost a sob. He dropped his eyes to the floor, embarrassed to be showing emotion in front of any of his captors. A warm hand landed on his shoulder and Tucker tried to shrug him off. He didn\u2019t want pity from any of them, especially Richard. The hand only tightened.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about all this, Kevin. I wish you\u2019d never come here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, that makes two of us.\u201d</p><p>Richard sat down beside him, his thigh brushing up against Kevin\u2019s and lighting a fire in his groin. Damn, why couldn\u2019t he control his reactions to this man? He put his hands in his lap to hide the way the towel was beginning to tent outward. \u201cI\u2019m okay. I\u2019m not freaking out. Much.\u201d</p><p>Richard sat quietly, not saying anything for a few minutes, just letting him get control of his emotions again. Richard cleared his throat. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get dressed in what you were wearing last night and I\u2019ll take you down to breakfast? Things always seem better after coffee.\u201d</p><p>Kevin snorted. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough coffee in the world for any of this to seem better.\u201d He got up and grabbed the clothes Tucker brought him from the dresser. \u201cI guess this will have to do. No shoes, though.\u201d He turned to head toward the bathroom to get dressed in private. Even though Richard had already seen him naked, he had some standards. Not many apparently, considering how easily he\u2019d already given in to Richard, but some.</p><p>Before Richard could reply, a knock came on the door and Tucker entered, carrying an armful of clothes. He looked surprised to see Richard sitting on the side of the bed. \u201cOh, hi...um...Richard. I brought Bryson some more clothes.\u201d He turned to him and held them out. \u201cI found someone who was about your size, and he loaned me these jeans and this shirt. I could only find flip flops for your feet, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat works, thanks.\u201d Taking them, he ducked into the bathroom and quickly dressed. The jeans were tight, but the right length. The shirt was a button up and he left it untucked. No underwear, but he wasn\u2019t sure about wearing anybody else\u2019s anyway. He could hear Tucker and Richard talking in soft tones through the door, but when he put his ear to it, the voices were still garbled. He recognized his name, but little else. He opened the door and stepped out and saw Richard\u2019s eyes flicker over him briefly before he dropped his gaze.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming to breakfast with you, if that\u2019s okay,\u201d Tucker said brightly. He came over and grabbed Kevin\u2019s hand. \u201cC\u2019mon, Bryson, I\u2019m starving, and the food is really good here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call him by his last name. His name is Kevin.\u201d</p><p>Both Kevin and Tucker looked at Richard in surprise, and he shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s the name his parents gave him. They probably wanted him to be known by that instead of his last name. Tucker.\u201d</p><p>Tucker actually laughed and blushed a little as Kevin looked back and forth between them. What the hell was the relationship there, and why did he resent their closeness like he did?</p><p>He allowed himself to be tugged along with nothing more said, and the three of them left the room and headed down the stairs. Again, as soon as he came into view, people in the common area grew quieter, and a few of the big ones said something to their smaller companions, who then got up and left the room. Gavin was eating breakfast at one of the tables on the side of the room, and they headed there. He smiled up at them when they came closer.</p><p>\u201cSit down and have some breakfast. How are you this morning, Kevin?\u201d</p><p>Kevin shrugged, unwilling to pretend. \u201cHow should I be? I\u2019m ready for you to give me back my things and my car and let me get the hell out of here.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin kept chewing and only nodded. He looked up and caught the eye of a young girl standing nearby with a coffee pot. \u201cEmily, can you bring our guest some breakfast please? You like bacon and eggs, don\u2019t you, Kevin?\u201d</p><p>Kevin only stared at him, but he kept talking as if he really were just a guest here. \u201cRichard, I need to talk to you about tomorrow night\u2019s ceremony later on, when you get a chance.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded, shifting to the side so the girl Gavin called Emily could pour him a cup of coffee. He handed her Kevin\u2019s cup too, since she seemed afraid to come close to his side of the table, darting nervous glances over at him and back over at a large, dark haired man who sat at the table next to them. His mouth was turned down in a frown, and he scowled at Kevin when he caught his eye.</p><p>Tucker leaned over and whispered to him. \u201cThat\u2019s Christian and he\u2019s an ass. Don\u2019t pay any attention to him. He\u2019s part of Gavin\u2019s personal guard, but he\u2019s really hanging around here to make sure you don\u2019t grab Emily up and take off with her.\u201d Tucker laughed. \u201cAs if, right?\u201d He shook out his napkin and gave Christian a dirty look. \u201cIgnore him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything okay, baby?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>Tucker looked up with a smile. \u201cSure, except for Christian staring a hole in us. Surely you can find him something to do.\u201d</p><p>Gavin looked over at Christian and gave him a stern nod, and Christian stood up quickly and left, casting a warning look over his shoulder at Kevin. It would have been funny anywhere else, but not here. Not when his circumstances were so uncertain. Kevin was embarrassed to see his hand tremble a little when he raised his coffee mug.</p><p>Richard must have noticed too, because he felt his warm hand grip his thigh under the table and give him a gentle squeeze. \u201cKevin doesn\u2019t have to worry about Christian.\u201d His hand moved up his thigh to rest against Kevin\u2019s groin.</p><p>Kevin was so surprised he almost choked on a sip of coffee. Richard gave him an amused glance, but kept his hand where it was.</p><p>Gavin took a sip of his own coffee and shook his head. \u201cSorry, Kevin. That wasn\u2019t anything personal. He\u2019s newly married to Emily, and he\u2019s a bit possessive.\u201d</p><p>Tucker scoffed. \u201cA bit? I\u2019m surprised he lets her out of their room long enough to do her job.\u201d</p><p>Kevin looked over at him wide-eyed, but Richard squeezed him again. If Richard kept this up, Kevin was going to embarrass himself. \u201cTucker\u2019s joking,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t see many strangers actually here inside the lodge, and it\u2019s got folks nervous, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p><p>Emily came in, balancing three plates on her arms, and the next few minutes were taken up with sorting out breakfast. The food was good, and he ate it all, not even thinking about drugs any more. Gavin had been right. If they wanted to drug him, they\u2019d just do it. It wasn\u2019t like they needed to trick him.</p><p>As they were finishing their coffee, a man approached the table. He was one of the big men so common there, and he had the look of the Cherokee Indians so common in the Smoky Mountains. He nodded to both Gavin and Richard and looked directly across the table at Kevin. His gaze swept over him before he spoke to Gavin. \u201cThis the one you were telling me about?\u201d</p><p>Tucker stiffened next to him, but Gavin nodded. \u201cYes, but we can talk about it later, Russell. Not now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure,\u201d he said, giving Kevin one last appreciative glance before moving away. Tucker\u2019s mouth fell open.</p><p>\u201cRussell? You can\u2019t be serious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI said we\u2019d discuss it later, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019d like to discuss it right now. Not Russell. I forbid it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh you do, huh? Well, that\u2019s not really your decision to make, Tucker. And what\u2019s wrong with Russell anyway? He\u2019s a nice guy, a good gamma. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with him.\u201d</p><p>Tucker\u2019s voice had dropped down to a deeper timbre, mimicking Russell. \u201c\u2018Is this the one you were talking about?\u2019 Oh yeah, such finesse and charm. Nope, no fucking way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t exactly have an unlimited choice, Tucker, and please lower your voice. Russell\u2019s mate was killed in a Hunter raid a few years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute...\u201d Kevin said in a choked voice. \u201cThis is about me? Are you thinking that me and that guy...\u201d</p><p>Richard scooted his chair back from the table and stood up abruptly, taking hold of Kevin\u2019s arm. \u201cKevin and I are going for a walk,\u201d he said, tugging Kevin from the chair. We\u2019ll be back in a while, and I\u2019ll come find you, Gavin.\u201d</p><p>Kevin stumbled to his feet and allowed Richard to lead him from the room and out onto the grounds. It was a sunny morning, with only a slight chill in the air, so Kevin was glad of the long sleeves on his shirt. He was feeling distinctly chilled, and he didn\u2019t think it came only from the air temperature.</p><p>\u201cTell me he\u2019s not planning on having that guy fuck me.\u201d</p><p>Richard looked at him with shock. \u201cGod, the way you talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, is he?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGavin is looking for a suitable mate for you, yes. But no one will force you. We\u2019ll find someone you can agree to.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis whole thing is crazy.\u201d Kevin stopped walking down the path they were on that led into the woods, shoving his hands down into his pockets. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here, before I\u2019m as nutty as the rest of you.\u201d</p><p>Richard turned to stare down at him. \u201cDamn it, don\u2019t you listen? We\u2019ve been over this. We can\u2019t let you leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? Well, what if I took off right now? Just took off running and got away from you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Kevin suddenly shoved Richard hard, surprising him and making him stumble back off the narrow pathway into the bushes. Kevin leaped off the other side, plowing through some thick bushes to get to a more open area in the woods. He took off as fast as he could, losing the flip flops after about three or four steps, but forging on despite the beating his bare feet were taking, dodging around trees and rocks, hearing Richard crashing through the brush behind him. Suddenly, strong arms lifted him off his feet and held on tight, crushing his body back into a solid, large form. He struggled wildly, kicking back against Richard\u2019s legs, pulling fiercely against the arms around his waist. He fought to escape, but his struggles were useless. He couldn\u2019t break Richard\u2019s grip around his waist, no matter how hard he tried. Breathing hard, he cursed and went limp, letting his head fall back against Richard\u2019s chest. Only then did Richard let him go to sink down to the ground and sat down beside him while he caught his breath.</p><p>After a few minutes, Kevin glanced up at him, a little out of breath. \u201cNot my best escape attempt ever,\u201d he managed.</p><p>Richard glared at him, but his lips twisted up a little. \u201cHad a lot of escape attempts, have you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really,\u201d he said, with a shrug and a short bark of laughter. \u201cThat one played out better in my head than in actual execution, though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDamn it, Kevin, you have to accept this. You can be happy here if you just let yourself. We\u2019ll find someone you\u2019ll like. He can train you to be a good mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrain me? Like a dog? Fuck you, Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can cuss me all you want. It\u2019s not going to change a thing. You\u2019ll still be mated to a member of our pack.\u201d</p><p>Kevin snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t want to mate with anybody! You\u2019re talking about sex, right? Forget that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t seem to mind it so much last night,\u201d Richard said quietly.</p><p>\u201cDamn you. Get this through your head. I\u2019m not fucking mating with anybody. I don\u2019t want that!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah? Even with me?\u201d</p><p>The question seemed to surprise both of them. Kevin caught his breath with a hitch as he stared at Richard, almost nose to nose. The tension between them was thick, and the air felt charged. Kevin could hear the faint sound of voices way far in the distance, but the woods where they sat were dense and solid. They could almost have been the last two people on earth. He felt his cock strain against the zipper of his jeans, and looked down to see the front of Richard\u2019s pants bulging too. He suddenly wanted to see Richard\u2019s cock very badly. He was so big and muscular. Would his dick be on the same scale? What was wrong with him that he was so attracted to this guy? How could he want him so much?</p><p>\u201cAnswer me, Kevin. Would you want to mate with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He started at the unexpected question, coming a little too close to what he was thinking. \u201cI-I thought we sort of already did a little of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot yet. I\u2019m talking about something more, Kevin. A commitment. If you became my mate, I\u2019d keep you with me forever. Make no mistake.\u201d He leaned over and put his lips next to Kevin\u2019s ear. \u201cI think you want someone to make you feel things you\u2019ve never felt before. I could do that for you. I could take you in hand, make you want to be on your knees with my cock buried deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>His breath caught when Richard began stroking him through his pants. They both watched as he unzipped him and pulled Kevin\u2019s cock out. It sprang to life in Richard\u2019s hand, growing thicker and longer. \u201cThen I could have this whenever I wanted it, and as often as I wanted it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike hell.\u201d He pushed on Richard\u2019s chest as hard as he could, but the man never budged and never stopped stroking.</p><p>\u201cTell me to stop, then, baby. Tell me to leave you alone. I will, if you ask. If you tell me you don\u2019t want this...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not your baby. Stop calling me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you are. And before I finish with you, I think you\u2019re going to tell me you are.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>Richard looked down at his prey and his wolf leaped inside him. From the moment he walked in on Kevin and saw him with a towel wrapped low around his hips, water droplets still clinging to his chest from the shower, he\u2019d wanted him in a primal, powerful way that had nothing to do with the way a good beta acted with someone like Kevin, someone who wasn\u2019t yet a member of the pack, and who was supposed to mate with another wolf. The thought of anyone else\u2019s hands on him made him furious, though. He\u2019d been relieved when Tucker came in that morning, bringing him clothes, but then Kevin had put on those damn tight jeans. He looked so delicious it made Richard want to gather him up in his arms and take off somewhere with him. Whatever cologne the man was using still clung to him too. It was maddening, and he had to breathe through his mouth to keep his erection at bay.</p><p>Wolf shifters in the southern Blue Ridge were the ultimate predators, outside of wildcats and bears, but even the bears took a backseat to the huge beasts of the Dark Hollows pack. Something ancient and primal took over in Richard\u2019s brain as he watched his prey running from him, and now after the short chase through the woods, his wolf was clamoring to stake a claim on his mate. This man was his, damn it, and it had been all he could do to sit passively when Russell had come to the table at breakfast and looked Kevin over with lust written on his features.</p><p>He moved his hand up under Kevin\u2019s shirt. His skin was warm and soft under his fingers, and there was a slight trembling. Was he frightened, staring up at Richard with those wide eyes, or was he excited? Kevin\u2019s groin was still bulging in his pants, his hard cock straining for freedom. Richard rubbed his palm across it and listened with pleasure to Kevin\u2019s little whimper.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be scared. If you want me to stop, I will. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you want, is it?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, Kevin shook his head. Then he leaned over to kiss Richard. His lips parted, allowing Richard to slip his tongue inside to explore Kevin\u2019s mouth. He heard Kevin\u2019s soft moans of pleasure, and it made him wild to have him underneath him. He wanted all of him. He wanted to put his scent and his mark on him so everyone would know whom he belonged to. He released him for a moment and pulled his hands away to give him his instructions. \u201cStrip. Get those damn jeans off. Now.\u201d</p><p>Kevin scrambled to his feet, his hands going to his fly. In seconds he had them off and began on his shirt, not even bothering to unbutton it, but just pulling it over his head and throwing it on the ground beside his pants. He was breathing hard as he stood there, letting Richard look his fill as he skimmed off his own pants, but kept his underwear. Kevin didn\u2019t know about his knot, and it wasn\u2019t yet time for him to find out.</p><p>God, he was beautiful. Richard had seen his cock before, of course, but now he had time to truly admire him. His body was lean, yet well-defined. His pubic hair was as blond as the hair on his head, and his cock was thick. Not as long as Richard\u2019s, but very nice. Perfect, really. It was sticking out from his body, dark red and fully erect. A glistening drop of pre-cum was poised on the tip and Richard fell to one knee in front of Kevin to catch it with his tongue.</p><p>Kevin\u2019s knees buckled, and he might have fallen if not for Richard\u2019s hand on his hip, steadying him. He knelt in front of Kevin, looked up at him with a grin and swallowed him down in one smooth motion. Kevin\u2019s whole body convulsed and he made a sweet little sound like a moan. Richard licked slowly up the length of his shaft, following the pulsing vein to the head. He played with that for a few seconds, dipping his tongue into the slit and then sucking hard at the entire head while he fondled his balls.</p><p>\u201cWait, I\u2019m going to come!\u201d</p><p>Richard pulled his head away. \u201cNo you won\u2019t. Not yet.\u201d He pulled him down beside him and onto his stomach. Kevin squirmed as Richard explored his rounded ass, first kissing each delectable ass cheek and then running his tongue down his crease. Kevin was pushing his stiff cock against the ground below him, obviously trying to get some relief.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t,\u201d Richard said. \u201cYou won\u2019t come until I tell you.\u201d Getting up on his knees behind him, Richard pulled Kevin up so that he was sitting on his lap. He was careful to keep Kevin\u2019s gaze to the front so he couldn\u2019t get a glimpse of his cock. Like all the wolves, he was well-endowed, but he also had an extra ring of flesh around the base of his penis that humans didn\u2019t have. Used during the first mating, the ring swelled to lock the wolf together with his mate for over an hour, while the gland secreted chemicals to complete the mating. Wolves called it their knot, and it wouldn\u2019t do for Kevin to see his at this point.</p><p>He took Kevin in his hand and pumped him. Kevin gasped out loud, and Richard laughed softly in his ear. Still pumping his dick, he murmured to him. \u201cNow, I believe you were about to tell me whose baby you are.\u201d</p><p>Kevin moaned and shook his head, squirming under Richard\u2019s hand. \u201cStubborn boy...all you have to do is tell me. C\u2019mon, sweet boy, don\u2019t be defiant.\u201d</p><p>Moving his hand more quickly, he listened to his boy\u2019s moans with pleasure. He put him back on his knees and held him there, pushing his head down to lie flat on the ground, his ass in the air. He put his fingers on either side of his ass cheeks and pulled his crease open to reveal his pink hole. He thrust his tongue inside it, holding Kevin firmly in place when he tried to pull away with a muffled scream. Burying his face in Kevin\u2019s ass, he laved it with his tongue until Kevin was practically squealing. Pre-cum was dripping from Kevin\u2019s cock, puddling on the ground beneath him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cTell me...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>Richard buried his face again and worked Kevin\u2019s hole with his tongue until the boy was incoherent and quivering.</p><p>\u201cOkay! I-I\u2019m your baby, whatever. God, please!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, beg me a little more. Beg me to take care of my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, please, Richard. Take care of me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery sweet. Okay, sweet boy, since you asked so nicely...\u201d</p><p>Richard poised his cock at Kevin\u2019s entrance. Holding him around the waist with one hand, with his free hand he painted the little pink hole with the white fluid seeping copiously from his own cock. Wolves were immune from human diseases, so he had no qualms at taking him just as he was. His wolf was clamoring at him to give him the mating bite and his knot, but he pushed the urge down, unable to deny himself the pleasure of taking his boy, but not ready to give him the mating bite yet. That time was coming. He was sure of it now. No one else would be allowed to have his prize, and he would have fought the alpha himself if it had been necessary.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t want to hurt his smaller mate, and he needed a bed and some proper lubricant before he gave him his knot. Besides, he wanted to ask Kevin properly to be his mate, and not while he was in the throes of passion. He would wait. In the meantime, though, there was nothing to stop him from pleasuring both of them. He ran his hands over the globes of Kevin\u2019s ass and stroked down the crease gently, parting it with the tips of his fingers so he could lick it again. Kevin literally screamed, and Richard had to take a moment to put a hand over his mouth. He leaned over his back and soothed him. \u201cHush now. We\u2019ll have half the compound down here.\u201d He rubbed and stroked his back. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</p><p>Kevin groaned and nodded, too far gone to speak, and Richard started a litany of softly spoken words close to his ear. \u201cIs this what you want, sweet boy? Is this what you need? I\u2019m going to take care of you. You need me to take care of you. Tell me how much you want it. Tell me, baby.\u201d</p><p>So far gone he was almost delirious with lust, Kevin could only nod his head and whimper, thrusting his ass up for more attention. This was all the answer Richard needed, but he wanted to hear the words. He needed to hear him admit it. He thrust his cock against him, letting him feel it so close and ready to penetrate him. \u201cAsk me, sweet boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cP-please,\u201d he finally managed, twisting his head back to look at him. \u201cFuck me, please.\u201d</p><p>Richard pressed forward, his copious pre-cum lubricating Kevin, and he felt Kevin\u2019s tight ring pop as he entered him. He hesitated for just a moment, allowing him to adjust to his size before he thrust in all the way up to his knot in one smooth, hard motion. Kevin cried out, but didn\u2019t resist the invasion. He was breathing rapidly, but he was still with him, still caught up in passion. Richard began to fuck him in earnest, pulling out almost to the tip of his cock and then sliding back in again. It was a slow, measured pace that made Kevin hum with pleasure. He pulled him back up on his lap and impaled him there, using his strength to pull him up and then push him back down on his cock over and over again, picking up the pace until he was fucking him rapidly, really thrusting into him. It took only the slightest touch of Richard\u2019s hand, sliding over his erection to bring Kevin to his climax. He put back his head and came hard, white streams of cum shooting out in front of him. Seeing that, Richard felt his own orgasm clawing at him as he strained against his mate. He pulled out to shoot his cum over Kevin\u2019s ass and the back of his thighs. He gathered some of his cum on his fingers and smeared it over Kevin\u2019s chest as well. He was marking his territory, and he defied anyone to come around Kevin now that his scent was on him.</p><p>Lowering him to the ground, he pulled up his pants, grimacing at the stickiness. He would have to take another shower when he got back to the lodge. He looked down at his mate and smiled. He was lying on his side, seemingly completely spent, Richard\u2019s cum smeared all over him. He would have been content to let him lie there and rest before he took him again, but he could hear someone approaching from the direction of the lodge. He lifted his nose to sniff. It was more than one gamma, coming toward them fast. Richard leaned down and shook Kevin, rousing him. \u201cGet dressed, baby. We\u2019re about to have company.\u201d</p><p>He stood protectively in front of Kevin as the wolf-shifters approached, aware that Kevin was scrambling into his pants behind him. Before he had a chance to put back on his shirt, four gammas burst into the clearing. They stumbled to a halt when they saw the big beta glaring at them belligerently. Richard saw that it was Christian, along with Todd, Benjamin and Marissa, all members of Gavin\u2019s personal guard. \u201cWe heard a scream.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s under control. Don\u2019t concern yourselves.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis man is under my supervision. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, sir. Sorry, sir. Didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d The four gammas practically bowed their way back out of the clearing, and Richard scowled after them. Those four had been pissing him off since Tucker had first arrived, and he was going to speak to Gavin about them. First he had to take care of Kevin. Turning back to him, he saw him standing, his face a dull red, staring at the ground.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right?\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded, glancing up at him with an unreadable look. Richard figured he was embarrassed by the group coming up on them and seeing them together. He may as well get used to it, though, since he belonged to Richard from now on.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go back and find those so-called shoes Tucker brought you. I\u2019ll have to take you into town after we\u2019re mated and buy you some boots, and some new clothes.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin looked up at him strangely, but only nodded, and Richard felt like he\u2019d made some progress with the stubborn man. At least he wasn\u2019t cussing and fighting everything he said, anyway. Taking him by the hand, he led him back toward the original trail they\u2019d been walking on. Tomorrow night, after the ceremony, he\u2019d explain everything to him before taking the final step. That is, if he was still in any shape to, after witnessing the shifting of the whole pack. It could be a frightening thing, he\u2019d been told, but other pets had witnessed it and come through okay. Kevin was strong and he\u2019d have Tucker there to help him. Then when he came back from the pack run under the moonlight, he\u2019d be able to mate with him properly. Everything was going to work out just fine.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? You\u2019ve been acting strangely since you came back from your walk with Richard? Did he say or do anything to upset you?\u201d Kevin and Tucker were in Kevin\u2019s room after lunch. Kevin had talked Tucker into sitting with him in his room so he could talk to him.</p><p>Kevin felt a slow burn come up his neck. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cBut if you need me to talk to him, I will.\u201d</p><p>Kevin slanted him a look. \u201cWhat is there between you two anyway? Tell me the truth, Tucker. Are you fucking him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod no!\u201d Tucker jumped to his feet in outrage. \u201cHow could you ask me something like that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, don\u2019t get pissed. I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. You\u2019re important to him, that\u2019s all, and I-I need to know how he feels.\u201d</p><p>Tucker cocked his head. \u201cYou need to know? Why? What\u2019s happened between you?\u201d</p><p>Kevin shrugged and Tucker said, \u201cOh...\u201d Then, \u201cOh. My. God.\u201d His eyes were wide as he gripped Kevin\u2019s arm. \u201cAre you two...\u201d</p><p>Shrugging again, Kevin pulled away, only to be shocked when Tucker threw both arms around his shoulders. \u201cDamn!\u201d he said again. \u201cBut this is fantastic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how fantastic it is. He\u2019s an arrogant prick, a goddamn toppy bastard. God knows why I haven\u2019t knocked his head off by now. He does things to me, Tucker. Things nobody ever did before, and I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUm, okay, I don\u2019t think I want to hear anymore. Not that I\u2019m not happy for you both. I am. I can\u2019t tell you how much, but no details, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? Since when? When we were back home you liked a play by play.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, we\u2019re definitely not in Florida anymore. Have you agreed to mate with him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Yes. Hell, I don\u2019t know anymore. When I\u2019m with him I know he\u2019s exactly what I want, even though I never knew I wanted it. I\u2019ve never been much for the D/s stuff, you know that. I\u2019m still not, except...when I\u2019m with Richard, he makes me want it. I want to please him and make him proud. I want to fulfill his needs, and I know that only I can do that. No one else knows him or cares about him like I do. No one else will put his pleasure first, even above their own. But I can\u2019t walk away from my whole life, Tucker. What about my job? My parents? I don\u2019t understand how you did it, though the thought of leaving Richard\u2014never seeing him again makes me physically ill. I don\u2019t think I can do it.\u201d He ran his hands through his hair. \u201cListen to me. I\u2019m talking as if I\u2019m actually considering this thing. The longer I\u2019m here the more my brains are turning into mush!\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, come off it, Bryson. Is your life really so great in Florida? You\u2019re not seeing anyone, and your parents have moved away. You work with a bunch of assholes. It\u2019s not like you love your job so much anymore. Would it be so unthinkable to move here and start a new life with Richard?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoing what? Sitting around and being his little pet? His fucking little sex toy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what you think I am?\u201d Tucker frowned at him, bristling. \u201cWhat you two do together behind closed doors is your business, but no one is asking you to be a toy. Plenty of us here have full lives and even careers now. I was even thinking about starting up my own private detective agency in town. I may have already done it by now if I hadn\u2019t been hurt. You could do it with me, if you wanted to. It won\u2019t be the same, of course. I\u2019ll probably be doing a lot of pre-divorce work, like following cheating spouses around. Boring stuff, but maybe some missing person work, too. Who knows? Whatever I decide, it\u2019s a choice I made, and I\u2019ll live with it. There are no perfect lives, Bryson. We all make compromises for the people we love.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere are so many unanswered questions. I have to know what all of this is about, Tucker. Are you finally ready to tell me what happened in Panama City? Were any of these people the killers? I have to know. Did Richard have anything to do with those murders?\u201d</p><p>Kevin sat across from Tucker in his room, watching Tucker\u2019s mouth drop open at the question. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve told you. Why would you think Richard or any of the pack had anything to do with the murders?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of reasons. Gavin was seen lurking around at least two of the crime scenes, and the whole holding you in his hotel room thing down in Florida when you first met. That\u2019s what you told me then anyway. I don\u2019t really know, and it\u2019s driving me crazy.\u201d Kevin slumped down into his chair. \u201cYou used to be able to tell me anything,\u201d he said quietly, waiting Tucker out. He was playing on Tucker\u2019s emotions, trying to guilt him into telling him more about what the hell was going on. He knew from his time as Tucker\u2019s partner that Tucker had to think things through in his own time. Rushing him or pumping him with questions never worked well, so he waited for him to get ready to talk. Finally, he looked up into Tucker\u2019s eyes, and took a deep breath. \u201cWon\u2019t you tell me, Tucker? The killer we were looking for in Panama City? Did Richard or Gavin or any of the others have anything to do with killing those guys?\u201d</p> <p>Tucker leaned forward. \u201cNo. I swear to you they didn\u2019t. I\u2019ll try to explain, but you won\u2019t believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, here goes...you see, there was this group called the Hunters. They hated our pack and want to destroy us completely. They\u2019d been kidnapping certain members of the family, the more vulnerable, weaker members, and shooting them up with a potentially lethal cocktail of drugs. Really crazy stuff. A mixture of methamphetamines, growth hormone, and God knows what all. It works with our body chemistry to make us...not ourselves. It makes us wild and puts us in a rage. Basically, it turns us into killers. That\u2019s what was killing those people in Florida, Kevin, and Gavin and his men were there to try to stop it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t they come to the police then, and tell us what they knew? You can\u2019t just withhold information in a murder investigation, Tucker. You know better than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but at the time they didn\u2019t know what was causing it. I mean, they\u2019d seen the end results, of course, but they didn\u2019t know who was behind it. They thought the Hunters had been eradicated. They had no idea that a new leader had taken over, one even crazier and more deadly than the first leader. Look, it\u2019s complicated, but the bastard kidnapped me right after my ceremony with Gavin. Me and the mate of another alpha leader in a neighboring pack. Between us we managed to get away, but he almost got me, Kevin. I barely survived.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin stared at him, unable to believe most of what he was hearing. \u201cYou know how this sounds, don\u2019t you, Tuck? Alphas and hunters....you sound as crazy as the rest of the people around here. They really have converted you, haven\u2019t they?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh shut up, Kevin!\u201d Tucker jumped to his feet and leaned across the table. \u201cThis refrain of yours is beginning to get old to me too. You asked and I told you. I also warned you that you wouldn\u2019t believe me. I\u2019m tired of having to defend our way of life and who we are. You came to us, remember. If you can\u2019t even believe me when I\u2019m telling you the truth\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, okay, settle down. Maybe if somebody told me what the hell was going on sometimes...but you have to admit this shit is hard to believe.\u201d Kevin put up both hands in defense. \u201cSorry. I\u2019m listening. If you say this happened, then I\u2019ll believe you, no matter how crazy it sounds. So let me get this straight. These guys, these hunters, hate your family and want to destroy them. They thought that by kidnapping some of the family members and using drugs to turn them into killers, then...what? You lost me on that part.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not sure,\u201d Tucker shook his head. \u201cIt could have been to discredit us in the area. That\u2019s what Gavin thinks. We have a huge family, spread out over Tennessee, Georgia and North Carolina. Not to mention our extended family and families of the um...people who are kind of adopted into our family. Like you will be.\u201d</p><p>Kevin pressed his lips together and nodded shortly. \u201cMe? That remains to be seen, but go ahead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, that makes a huge network. We hear things that could be a threat to us from the people in that network. That\u2019s how we knew you were in town, for example. So if the Hunters could spread fear and mistrust of those of us who live in the compound and even those who live in town, think of how that would undermine us. People would be less willing to protect us and tell us things. They could even go to the authorities and then...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen people like me would be getting assimilated all over the place. Or the villagers would come here in a mob with torches to burn you out, like in the Frankenstein movies?\u201d</p><p>Tucker smiled. \u201cSomething like that. Anyway, that\u2019s one of the theories we\u2019re working with. The other is that the guy running the group is just bat-shit crazy. He says he\u2019s the illegitimate son of the old leader, and he\u2019s brilliant but fucked up, you know? So far he\u2019s responsible for the confirmed deaths of at least two members of the pack, with more missing. Not to mention the people in Florida whose deaths he caused.\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded somberly. \u201cSo where is this guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know. He got away at the hospital the day we were rescued in all the confusion. We think he left the area, at least for a while, but no one is sure. That\u2019s one reason why everyone is jumpy and Gavin has those body guards. Our pack has been doing that for a while now, since before I came, protecting our alpha, and the other packs are doing it now too since we know the Hunters might still be out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis place is like Fort Knox, with all the fences and alarms, steel mesh on the windows. I said that the first time I saw it. Why are you still so afraid?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have over four hundred acres here and the North Carolina pack has even more. We can\u2019t possibly defend the woods as well as we\u2019d like, though we do have frequent patrols. Besides, there\u2019s something going on here, Kevin, that I can\u2019t quite put my finger on. I can feel it.\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded. He had a healthy respect for Tucker\u2019s instincts. That weird sixth sense of his had saved both their butts on several occasions in the past.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve expressed my concerns to Gavin and to Richard, but they don\u2019t take it seriously. There\u2019s something about Gavin\u2019s private guard...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw them in action earlier. Bunch of punks. Who\u2019s the Amazon?\u201d</p><p>Tucker smiled briefly. \u201cMarissa. She was none too happy about me showing up, I can assure you. She had Gavin picked out for herself. I think she hates me, though Gavin disagrees. Says she\u2019s only being protective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo Gavin is bi...\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. All of the wol...all of them are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll of them? But that\u2019s just weird, Tucker. How can they all be bi-sexual?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know; they just are.\u201d Tucker began to look uncomfortable.</p><p>\u201cMore of the stuff you can\u2019t tell me, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess so. Look, Kevin, change the subject, okay? You\u2019ll know more tomorrow night, after the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you keep saying. What\u2019s so special about it anyway?\u201d</p><p>Tucker smiled at him. \u201cIt\u2019s the blue moon. And you\u2019ll see for yourself why it\u2019s so special.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p>It was late afternoon and Kevin sat on the sofa next to Tucker in the main hall waiting for the dinner service to begin. His head was back on the seat cushion, and he was staring up at the ceiling and thinking about Richard. Damn it, how had he allowed himself to become so fucking attracted to the man in such a short time? And what the hell was wrong with him that he would like the kind of treatment Richard had been doling out since the first time he\u2019d been in the same room with him? The sex with Richard earlier had been just about damned perfect, though, there was no denying that. He\u2019d never felt so fulfilled, so satisfied by a lover. It scared the shit out of him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, lose himself like Tucker had. He\u2019d keep his wits about him and keep looking for a way to escape. This had to be Stockholm syndrome, where abducted victims begin to identify and even side with their captors. That had to be it. It was a common thing in hostage situations, probably some form of evolutionary survival mechanism. This had to be what was happening here. Surely knowing it was half the battle.</p><p>Now if he could only work on a way to steel himself against the attraction he felt for Richard, he might be able to survive this thing. He wouldn\u2019t give into him so easily again. Richard actually had some nerve seducing him after the way he\u2019d treated him from the very beginning.</p><p>Richard walked into the room then, and Kevin felt an immediate tug on his emotions seeing his handsome face. Richard hadn\u2019t even seemed to notice him yet, so Kevin turned his attention back to a young man who had suddenly appeared in front of him, and was looking down at him curiously. He had no idea who the guy was, but he\u2019d been staring at Kevin intently for a while now. He was one of the big ones, and up to now he\u2019d been standing with a group of his buddies over by the huge fireplace as they\u2019d also presumably been waiting for dinner to be served. Now the young man had moved closer and was saying something to Kevin, and he tried hard to drag his attention back.</p><p>\u201cWhat? I\u2019m sorry, what did you say to me?\u201d he asked, gazing up at the man.</p><p>\u201cI said, it\u2019s nice to finally see you up close. I saw you when you came in the other night but you disappeared pretty fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Kevin said, trying to pull his hand away from where the young man still had it tightly in his grip. \u201cYeah, well, nice to see you too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re very nice-looking,\u201d the young man said. \u201cMy name is Derek, by the way.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cUh, thanks?\u201d A little unnerved at this direct approach, he looked over at Tucker for help, but Tucker was carrying on a conversation with someone on the other side of him.</p><p>\u201cI understand you haven\u2019t been spoken for yet...Maybe later this evening you\u2019d have a cup of coffee with me?\u201d</p><p>Kevin stared up at him as his mouth dropped open. Spoken for? Was he kidding? He was saved from having to answer that question when a warm hand dropped on his shoulder.</p> <p>\u201cDo you need something, Derek?\u201d Richard was standing right behind him, gripping him hard enough that Kevin thought he might be leaving the mark of his fingerprints. Kevin glanced up at Richard in irritation as Derek dropped his hand and took a quick backward step.</p><p>\u201cNo. No, sir, nothing at all. I was only saying hello to Kevin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery friendly of you. I appreciate your making him welcome, Derek. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>The young man\u2019s gaze traveled from Kevin back up to Richard and back down again, and his eyes changed. He gave a stiff little nod and backed away to rejoin his friends.</p><p>Kevin sat in stunned surprise. What the hell was that about? Had Richard just staked some kind of claim on him? He\u2019d thanked the guy in a very proprietary way. I appreciate your making him welcome, Derek. Fuck.</p> <p>How in the hell had this happened in the span of two days? Richard had stormed into his life, turned him inside out and left him craving his touch. If the truth were told, he\u2019d been sitting here pouting over the fact that Richard was nowhere to be seen, when he was probably talking with Gavin or doing whatever it was he did all day. Kevin was the one sitting here mooning over the guy like a love-sick idiot. He needed to put a stop to this and right damn now. And why was his cock so hard at just the sound of Richard\u2019s voice and his hand on his shoulder? Damn it. This was getting out of hand.</p><p>He leaned forward to put his coffee mug on the table in front of him, dislodging Richard\u2019s hand. Richard came around to stand in front of Kevin. \u201cWhy was Derek talking to you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho? Oh, that guy. Why don\u2019t you ask him? Is talking not allowed for the prisoner? He said he thought I was nice-looking and wants to drink coffee.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was holding your hand and staring at you like he was about to take you to his room. What did you say to him to cause a look like that?\u201d Richard\u2019s face was stern and cold, the red patches on his cheeks the only sign that he was angry.</p><p>\u201cWhat did I... Are you kidding me? I was sitting here minding my own business when your boy over there came up and grabbed my hand, talking about me not being spoken for, or some shit.\u201d Kevin raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy? How does whatever I do have anything to do with you?\u201d</p><p>Richard stared down at him, clearly furious. \u201cEverything you do has to do with me. And don\u2019t you forget it again.\u201d</p> <p>He turned on his heel and walked away, leaving Kevin staring after him, angry and frustrated. His heart beat a rapid tattoo in his chest. Tucker leaned over and whispered to him. \u201cWhat the heck was that about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamned if I know,\u201d Kevin said, not bothering to hide his irritation. \u201cArrogant prick.\u201d</p><p>Tucker drew back as if offended. \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. He\u2019s probably only concerned about you. And you told me about your feelings for each other, so don\u2019t try to deny them now. He\u2019s probably a little jealous. Besides, Richard takes his job very seriously, and one of those jobs is the welfare of the people in his pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in his fucking pack, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s chosen you for his mate, you are. The most important member to him.\u201d Tucker frowned and turned away.</p><p>Great, alienate the only friend I have here, that\u2019s the ticket. Kevin dropped his head on the back cushion of the sofa again, hating feeling so lost and hating the idea that he\u2019d put himself in this stupid situation in the first place. He realized he was beginning to care\u2014too much\u2014about what Richard thought, and that frightened him and pissed him off in equal measure. Richard\u2019s presence in the same room made him want him more than he\u2019d ever wanted anybody in his whole life. He had to put a stop to this and fast. Maybe if he played along, he could get them to let their guard down so he could escape.</p><p>He moved closer to Tucker and put a hand on his arm. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tucker. I know you like the guy. All this is getting on my nerves, I guess.\u201d</p><p>Tucker patted his knee. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I understand. We\u2019ll have dinner, and then I\u2019ll walk up to your room with you. Maybe we can watch a movie or something. Or I could bring you a book? It might be a long evening.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I am pretty tired.\u201d</p><p>Kevin wearily glanced around the room, looking for Richard. He was nowhere to be seen, and he felt a little pang in his chest. He felt like he had disappointed the man in some way and it was messing with his head. That had to be all it was. Hell, he had plenty of experience disappointing people. He\u2019d been doing it all his life.</p><p>Kevin\u2019s parents were wealthy, and his father had a thriving law practice. He made it clear that he fully expected Kevin to join the firm after college. College was, in fact, where the relationship with his parents had begun to unravel. First, his father had pushed him to join his old fraternity. The fact that they were the fraternity on campus with the reputation for hard drinking and even harder partying had certainly not put Kevin off too much. He was young, and liked to drink and have a good time with the best of them, but the fact that the fraternity brothers were also homophobic assholes had definitely not counted in their favor.</p><p>The boy who roomed across the hall from him in campus housing was a nice guy from a small town in south Florida. They had met the first day in their new dorms and had a few casual conversations when they saw each other in the following days. He also had a legacy from his father, and was being pushed to join the same fraternity, so they had that in common. The boy was a slight figure, very shy, a cello player, who wanted to major in music, but his jerk father was pushing him into a business career. At the first recruitment party for the fraternity, it was made clear to all of the potential pledges that although they could not deny a first invitation to the legatees, it was by no means a sure thing that person would be offered a bid. The brothers made that clear by pretty much aiming their remarks at Kevin\u2019s friend from across the hall.</p><p>Of course, the boy hadn\u2019t received any further invitations and one of the brothers had confided to Kevin at the next recruitment party that some of the members had decided he looked like a fag. They didn\u2019t want any of his kind in their house.</p><p>The funny thing was that he said this to Kevin, who had known he was gay since he was fifteen years old, while the boy from the dorm was straight as an arrow, with a girlfriend he was serious about.</p><p>That was the last recruitment party Kevin had attended, and shortly afterward, he had come out to his parents. They were shocked, and his mother cried, but eventually they came around. He was their only son, and they loved him. It simply became a topic not to be discussed.</p><p>In his junior year, he had told his long-suffering parents he would not be attending law school or becoming a lawyer either. He had neither the grades nor the aptitude for it. Instead he switched his major from Pre-Law to Criminal Justice, with the vague idea of becoming an FBI agent someday. Another pipe dream that his solid C average kept him from, but he was honestly fine with going back home after graduation and joining the local police force. He loved the job and within a few years had worked his way up to detective and fallen in love with his gorgeous partner, who made it clear that he wanted only friendship from Kevin.</p><p>So he\u2019d been drifting, it seemed, for a long time. He had a job he liked, though truthfully, he\u2019d come to like it less in the last few years. But he had a nice home, plenty of men to warm his bed, even if the one he\u2019d really wanted had gotten away. He knew he was good-looking enough. People had been telling him that all his life, and he was always cruised hard when he entered a club. Having enough men was not a problem. So everything was good enough in his life. Maybe not ideal, but good enough. And if he ever felt like something was missing, he shrugged it off.</p><p>Nobody\u2019s life was perfect, after all, but his was damn close. He lived in a tropical paradise, for God\u2019s sake, and he brought men home from the clubs from time to time who were eminently fuckable. The fact that he never felt quite satisfied after fucking them was stupid and his own damn problem. He figured maybe he wasn\u2019t capable of any real feeling beyond the superficial. He enjoyed the men he brought home, fucking them into the mattress most nights, but up to now hadn\u2019t made a real connection. Something was always missing, always leaving him wanting more.</p><p>It was different with Tucker, of course, but they\u2019d never had sex, never really connected in an intimate way. Tucker was more like an unattainable goal. Something to strive for, but not anything he ever thought he\u2019d really have. Over the years, their relationship had become more about friendship, in fact.</p><p>Not like the connection he had with Richard. \u2018If you want me to stop, I will. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you want, is it? I think you want my cock buried deep in your ass.\u2019 Why did those words keep resonating in his head? \u2018Before I finish with you, you\u2019re going to tell me you\u2019re my baby.\u2019 Damn it, he hated the way Richard treated him. He wasn\u2019t anybody\u2019s little bitch, and he was going to make that clear the next time he saw him.</p><p>After dinner, he followed Tucker upstairs, deciding that what he needed more than anything was a good night\u2019s sleep. He left Tucker in the hallway and went inside his room without even turning on the lights, collapsing on his bed in exhaustion. He desperately needed a shower, but he was too tired right this minute. He remembered how Richard had shot off all over his ass and thighs and then smeared cum on him. God knows he needed a shower after that, but a small part of him liked the idea that Richard had marked him with his cum. Hell with it, he\u2019d get a shower when he woke up in the morning. He stripped off his clothes and got in under the covers naked. He hoped Richard would stay away from his room, though, and leave him the fuck alone. He needed rest and distance from the man and not necessarily in that order. He needed to turn his mind off for a little while and get off this crazy emotional merry-go-round that his life had somehow become. It was only about seven o\u2019clock but it was already getting dark outside. He wondered where Richard was, and then blew out a frustrated breath. Damn it, why can\u2019t I stop thinking about him? Why can\u2019t I turn off these thoughts in my head? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d said the words out loud until a voice coming from the chair beside him answered. \u201cBecause you need something from me. Why don\u2019t you tell me what it is, sweet boy?\u201d</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cShit, you scared me to death. Why the hell were you sitting here in the dark? Don\u2019t you ever knock?\u201d Kevin scooted up in bed to sit with his back against the headboard.</p> <p>Richard\u2019s deep voice rumbled in the dark room. \u201cIt isn\u2019t dark. Not really. And I did, but you weren\u2019t in here. So I came in to wait for you. Actually, I\u2019m here to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Kevin snorted. \u201cYou? Apologize? I must not have heard you correctly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so short with you downstairs. It wasn\u2019t your fault that Derek came over to you. Even with my scent all over you, I guess he couldn\u2019t resist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, I hope I didn\u2019t smell that bad. I was sitting right next to Tucker, and he never said anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker wouldn\u2019t have noticed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut that boy would have from across the room? You and your cryptic comments.\u201d</p><p>Richard stood and came over to the bed to sit on the side. Kevin pulled the sheet higher on his chest, uneasy at Richard\u2019s proximity. \u201cOkay, apology accepted, but I need to sleep.\u201d</p><p>Richard stretched out his arm and Kevin felt his fingers trail gently along his jaw. \u201cI need to claim you soon,\u201d he said, almost as if he were talking to himself.</p><p>Kevin leaned into his touch, craving it, hating himself for needing it so much. \u201cWhat about what I need?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me what that is, baby,\u201d Richard said softly.</p><p>\u201cI-I need to get out of here, to go home.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Richard\u2019s hand moved down to his shoulders, massaging, stroking, making him ache even more in his groin. He dropped his head back on the headboard.</p><p>Richard\u2019s hand moved down to his nipples, gently circling each one, one thumb rubbing over the small nub. \u201cI know all that, sweet boy. But what do you want me to do for you right now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want you to do anything.\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s hand stilled, and he raised one eyebrow as he pulled his hand away. Unable to bear it, Kevin grabbed for it and pulled it back to his chest, his breathing quickening. Kevin shook his head, tightening his grip on Richard\u2019s hand. He couldn\u2019t put it into words. He just had this aching need inside him that he wanted filled. It had always been there, throughout every encounter with every man, all of his life. No matter how much sex he had, it was never quite enough. Today, in the woods, was the closest he\u2019d ever come to fulfillment. He wanted, he needed more.</p><p>\u201cI-I want it rough. I want you to take me. To make me like it.\u201d</p><p>Something blazed in Richard\u2019s eyes for just a moment before his lashes fell to cover the spark. His voice, low and sexy in the quiet room, sent chills through Kevin\u2019s body. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you...\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s breath hitched, and he nodded, letting his hands fall away from Richard\u2019s and gripping the sheets beneath him. He was almost ready to beg, but he pressed his lips together, swallowing the things he wanted to say. Then Richard\u2019s voice came again.</p><p>\u201cWhat I will do is turn you over my lap and spank your pretty ass until it pinks up under my hand, until you squirm and beg me to stop, until you\u2019re coming on my thighs, because you can\u2019t help yourself. Then I\u2019ll turn you over on this bed and fuck you so hard you forget your own name. So hard you\u2019ll plead with me to stop, but I won\u2019t. Until I think you\u2019ve had enough. All you have to do,\u201d he leaned over and whispered in Kevin\u2019s ear, his hot breath sending waves of pleasure through his body. \u201cAll you have to do is ask for it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, God...\u201d His heart was beating wildly at the image that sprang into his mind. His body spread out across another man\u2019s knees. The humiliation, the pain, the loss of control. \u201cOh God, please.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d Richard pulled Kevin across his lap as if he were a child, his ass in the air. Despite what he said he wanted, now that the reality was here, he panicked and struggled, trying to get up. A strong hand held him down, held him in place. He knew that if he cried out and told Richard to stop, he would. That was why Richard was hesitating, waiting for Kevin to find his balance, to be sure. Richard rubbed his hands over the globes of his ass, soothing what he intended to spank in just seconds. \u201cReady?\u201d</p><p>Kevin took a deep breath and nodded, and then Richard\u2019s hand came down on his bare skin hard twice in succession. The heat from his face quickly transferred itself to his ass, and he bucked his body as the hand fell again and again. His cock lay against the rough material of Richard\u2019s jeans, and as his balls tightened, he rubbed frantically against his thighs. Richard never relented, never gave him a chance to get used to it, to get ready for the next one before the hand fell again. His hips began to writhe, his body well aware of what it wanted, what it needed from this man. His cock was engorged with blood, and he was becoming mindless.</p><p>He felt himself arching like a cat, trying to turn to watch the hand as it came down on him, but the hand on his back was relentless, pushing him back down and making him take it. He could hear the choked cries coming from his throat, hardly able to breathe for the sensations that were rocking his body, the pain and the pleasure coming in equal measures so fast it was overwhelming him.</p><p>He cried out then as his orgasm gripped him and he thrust his legs straight out behind him, convulsing on Richard\u2019s lap. Richard\u2019s hand tightened around his waist as he spurted all over his belly and Richard\u2019s thighs. \u201cGood boy,\u201d Richard said, as he slapped his ass one more time. \u201cTell me how that felt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I...\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me it was good then, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis will be better.\u201d He picked Kevin up off his thighs as if he weighed almost nothing and laid him face down on the bed. Trying to breathe again, Richard picked up his head and looked at him over his shoulder. He was stripping off his clothes, his eyes never leaving Kevin. \u201cGet on your knees.\u201d</p><p>Slowly Kevin got in the position Richard told him to, his knees trembling. He couldn\u2019t come again so soon. He would do this because...because Richard told him to. He spread his knees wide and laid his head on the mattress, his ass high in the air.</p><p>He could feel Richard behind him, stroking his hips, his back. Richard leaned over him and his voice rumbled in his ear. \u201cThe first time I saw you in that hotel room, I wanted to spread you out like this, for my pleasure. I wanted to spank you first for that smart mouth, and then lay you down and make you open yourself to me. Would you have liked that, Kevin?\u201d</p><p>His fingers were spreading him at his crease, and he nodded, not knowing if Richard could even see it, but it was hard to form words. He liked the things Richard was saying to him, but it made him feel strangely needy and wanton, embarrassed. He turned to bury his face in the mattress, and Richard chuckled. \u201cSweet boy.\u201d</p><p>He heard Richard fumble at the table beside him and then he jerked in surprise as cool liquid hit him in his most intimate place. He half raised his body up, but Richard\u2019s hand was there, smoothing it in place, making him groan and shiver. The blunt head of Richard\u2019s cock brushed against his hole and he cried out. Richard\u2019s hand soothed him again, rubbing his ass cheeks and murmuring to him. Kevin could feel pre-cum dripping from his cock that had somehow become half-hard again. He\u2019d never started to get hard so soon after an orgasm that strong. What was this man doing to him?</p><p>A finger entered him, strong and sure, sweeping inside and stretching him. It brushed his prostate and he jumped. Another finger slipped in and he heard himself groaning with pleasure. Three of Richard\u2019s fingers were in his ass, twisting and spreading. Then a strong, warm hand went around his shaft. \u201cFuck yourself in my hand, baby. Show me how much you want it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRichard, please...\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what? What is it you need, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I need you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen show me.\u201d</p><p>The fingers in his ass slipped away, replaced by the head of Richard\u2019s cock, huge and blunt. He pushed it inside and Kevin gasped before his body responded, opening to him, letting him in. He pushed all the way in until Kevin could feel something hard, his balls maybe, crowding his ass, and then he stopped, just filling him, but not moving. \u201cYour turn, baby. Show me how much you want this. Fuck yourself on my cock until you come in my hand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, God...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo it. If this is what you want, show me.\u201d</p><p>Slowly he pushed himself forward into Richard\u2019s hand. The pressure on his cock felt so good, he never wanted it to stop, but he needed to move. He pushed himself back on Richard\u2019s cock and felt the tingling on his prostate and he moaned aloud, grinding himself on that cock that felt so good inside him. He heard Richard\u2019s sharp intake of breath and smiled to himself, knowing he wasn\u2019t the only one about to lose control. Suddenly, that became his goal, to make Richard lose control too. To make him cry out Kevin\u2019s name and come so hard he lost himself. He pushed back up into his hand and then slammed back into Richard. He did it over and over again, no longer thinking, just feeling the mindless pleasure, and he heard Richard\u2019s groaning.</p><p>Richard took over then, taking the control away from him, and he was taking him hard, filling him with his big cock and stretching him until he was panting for breath, but he liked it. It satisfied him in a way no one had ever done before. Lust filled his head, and his eyes glazed over, and all he could do was feel as Richard pounded him into the mattress. He gave up his efforts then and just allowed it to happen. He was no longer in control of anything\u2014he was just along for the ride, and he realized that was just the way he\u2019d wanted it all along.</p><p>His orgasm slammed into him like a freight train, knocking him off track, shaking him to his core. He came harder than he\u2019d ever come in his life, the orgasm he\u2019d had as he lay across Richard\u2019s lap felt like foreplay compared to this. He was boneless, destroyed, mindless. He was vaguely aware of Richard\u2019s release and him sagging down on top of him and then rolling them both to the side, but he was too wiped out to even open his eyes. The pleasure came again, like an aftershock, and he shivered and leaned back into the warmth of Richard\u2019s chest. He felt lips brush his ear and smiled in contentment as he drifted gently down into the welcoming darkness. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWake up and get dressed. We\u2019re going on a hike.\u201d</p><p>Kevin opened one eye and peered up at Tucker, who was standing by his bedside, fully dressed and grinning at him. \u201cYou may be,\u201d he grumbled, turning over to get away from him and pulling the covers back over his head.</p><p>Tucker ripped them off, laughing at the startled curses coming from the bed. \u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s a gorgeous day outside. Perfect for a climb up to the waterfalls. A bunch of us are going, and I want you to come too.\u201d</p> <p>Kevin leaned up on his elbows. \u201cTucker, what is wrong with you? You know I don\u2019t hike, or climb or anything resembling that shit. Go ahead and I\u2019ll see you when you get back.\u201d</p><p>Tucker crossed his arms stubbornly and stood by the bed until Kevin huffed out a breath and opened his eyes again. \u201cSeriously? I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to sit around inside all day. Come on and go with us. Richard\u2019s coming.\u201d</p><p>Kevin sat up and shot him an evil glare. \u201cAnd that\u2019s supposed to make me cream in my pants? What are we, in the eighth grade?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019ll be fun. I haven\u2019t spent any real time with you yet, other than fighting over all of this.\u201d He waved his hand again in that languid way of his, an oddly old-fashioned and endearing gesture.</p> <p>Kevin swung his feet over the side of the bed and stretched. \u201cSo who all is \u2018a bunch of us\u2019?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome of the newer mates and their...uh...spouses, and just a few others. It\u2019s so nice out, and it\u2019s a not a work day. Gavin and Richard and some of Gavin\u2019s guard are going along because the falls are near one of the perimeters of the property and they can use it as a jumping off point to patrol, as well as guard the mates on the trip.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGuard you? Why do you need that?\u201d</p><p>Tucker walked over to Kevin\u2019s dresser to take out some of the clothes he\u2019d furnished him with. \u201cYou know I told you about the Hunters and the recent attacks. They\u2019re being careful still, though we don\u2019t know for sure if they\u2019re still in the area. Some innocent people died, including humans.\u201d</p><p>Kevin turned his head and stared. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? What?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said, including humans.\u201d His eyes narrow and suspicious, he asked quietly. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re human anymore, Tucker?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...uh...you must have misunderstood me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, pretty sure I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Tucker\u2019s cheeks were pink, but he hurried back to where Kevin sat and handed him some clothes. \u201cHere, you can put these on.\u201d</p><p>Kevin grabbed his hand. \u201cTalk to me, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said, twisting away. \u201cJust put that on and come downstairs. We\u2019re leaving in an hour, and you\u2019ll need breakfast first.\u201d He held up a hand to stop Kevin from saying more. \u201cNo, just get dressed. Please. I think they\u2019re going to talk to you tonight after the ceremony, and you\u2019ll know everything then. I can\u2019t say more. You wouldn\u2019t believe me anyway.\u201d He turned and hurried out of the room, leaving Kevin staring after him and shaking his head. Whatever they\u2019d said to Tucker, whatever they\u2019d brainwashed him into believing, Kevin himself had to stay lucid and not fall prey to it. If an opportunity arose to get out of here, with or without Tucker, he had to go for it. It was too easy to get caught up in all of this and lose yourself. In the meantime, he\u2019d bide his time and learn all he could.</p><p>He went in to shower and shave and get ready for the day, giving himself a stern talking to about the little butterflies that were dancing around in his chest at the idea of spending most of the day with Richard.</p><p>\u201cCome on in with us, Kevin. Don\u2019t be such a wimp,\u201d Tucker called out, his hands on Gavin\u2019s shoulders.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks cold. I can watch just fine from here.\u201d</p><p>The hike down to the falls was almost worth it for the view, though Kevin refused to admit it, still a little angry with Tucker at his strange reluctance to share anything with him. After breakfast, the group of about twelve people\u2014a mixture of the big ones and the others, who Kevin now knew were their so-called mates, a mixed group of both men and women\u2014set out on the hike through the forest. Richard and Gavin went along too, though they\u2019d kept at the back of the group, talking quietly to each other on the trail down the mountain.</p><p>By the time they finally reached it, they\u2019d been hearing the roar of the falls for some time. Then suddenly they came out into a large clearing and Kevin looked up to see two huge fountains of water splashing down from the rocks above to form a pool below. Tucker told him the pack called them Twin Falls, though they didn\u2019t really have an official name.</p><p>The pool formed below was large and hemmed in by more rocks, before making its way downstream in a fast moving current.</p><p>Some of the group went immediately into the woods to pull off their clothes and put on their swim wear, but Kevin plopped down on the grass to rest. His feet were sore, though Tucker had found Kevin some hiking boots that fit. He wasn\u2019t used to hiking so he was too hot and just wanted to rest. The sun had beat down unmercifully on their shoulders as the group made their way up the trail, and he felt sweaty and sticky. It wasn\u2019t a terribly steep trail, but the black gnats, which seemed to appear out of nowhere, drove him crazy, buzzing around his head. Tucker, walking beside him, noticed and smiled in sympathy. \u201cYou must be wearing some kind of hair product. The gnats love it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, I don\u2019t love them, the little bastards, and I\u2019m not wearing anything. What do I have?\u201d he said, desperately swiping a hand at the little cloud of them over his head.</p><p>\u201cMay just be the shampoo I left in the bathroom for you. When we get there, we\u2019ll go in swimming and you can wash it off. That way, they\u2019ll leave you alone on the walk back down to the lodge. I brought you some trunks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. We\u2019ll see how cold it is. I like my pools heated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re such a city boy,\u201d Tucker said with a laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s cold, but it\u2019ll feel good after this hike.\u201d</p><p>Kevin shrugged and trudged forward, wishing for the hundredth time he hadn\u2019t come. He still felt that way, sitting here watching everyone else having a good time. He\u2019d finally gotten up and put on his swim trunks, just because they were cooler than his jeans, but he had no intentions of freezing his balls off in the frigid water. Maybe he\u2019d stick his feet in later.</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, Kevin. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><p>Kevin looked up at Richard, who was standing over him, his muscular body totally nude. \u201cDamn Richard, exhibitionist much?\u201d Then as he looked at him, he noticed something else he\u2019d never seen before. There was an extra ring of flesh at the base of his shaft, almost like a growth of some kind wrapping all the way around his penis.</p><p>\u201cDoes it bother you?\u201d Richard said, following his gaze down to himself.</p><p>\u201cHuh? Oh, no,\u201d he said, turning his head away and watching the swimmers. \u201cWhy should it? What...uh, what is it anyway?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s something all the men in my pack have. We were born with it. We call it our knot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean like a birth defect that runs in the family or something?\u201d</p><p>Richard\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cOr something. It doesn\u2019t hurt. I never pay attention to it unless I see someone stare at it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo need. But is that the real reason you\u2019re uncomfortable? Or do you not like me showing my body to everyone?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can show the world for all I care,\u201d he said irritably. \u201cIt\u2019s your body. If you want to flaunt it around, go ahead. Except I don\u2019t see why you have to stand there and let everybody get a good look.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJealous, baby?\u201d He bent down and pulled Kevin up into his arms as if he weighed nothing much at all, and strode toward the water with him. Kevin was too shocked to struggle much until he hit the frigid water where Richard tossed him. He landed a few feet away, coming up thrashing and sputtering to the surface. He stood up, shivering and pointed a finger at Richard.</p><p>\u201cDamn you, you\u2019re going down for that!\u201d Richard waded in after him, still laughing. Kevin made a wild leap for him, intending to push him under. Instead, Richard caught him and thrust him under again. When he came back to the surface a second time, he felt strong arms pulling him along with the current and going farther away from the group to the edge of the pool of water. A powerful arm wrapped around his waist, and Richard pulled him against his body.</p><p>Shivering, Kevin clung to his shoulders and wiped the water from his eyes. Pressed up against his body so closely, Kevin could feel the hardness of Richard\u2019s shaft on his thigh and he found himself lost in the dark brown eyes that were far too close. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, baby? Do you want me to treat you with more gentleness? I can do that for you if you\u2019re too delicate,\u201d he purred.</p><p>Angrily, Kevin smacked his fist on Richard\u2019s shoulder. \u201cFuck you! Treat me like a girl and I\u2019ll tear your balls off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou, a girl? Never, baby.\u201d He reached down under the waistband of the trunks and palmed Kevin\u2019s dick. \u201cI like your parts right where they are.\u201d</p><p>Kevin glared at him anyway, as he floated, pulling Kevin with him. He kept his hand right where it was, but only rubbed his thumb gently over the broad head of his shaft and Kevin gradually relaxed into him. The icy water was preventing his erection, but still his touch felt so good, so right. He realized that these last few days he\u2019d felt more alive with Richard than he had maybe for years. Fighting with him, becoming so angry at him that he wanted to scream and then making love to him with such passion was emotion, plain and simple, and something he\u2019d run away from for a long time. For years, he\u2019d been numb to everything, really, especially after Tucker had turned him down, and he believed, at the age of thirty-four, that maybe real love and a strong relationship simply weren\u2019t in the cards for him. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Not that he needed it really. He had a good life at home, and he couldn\u2019t wait to get back to it. He didn\u2019t need this irritating, arrogant man, who tried to dominate him and control him. So why was his nearness so exciting? He was so close and he smelled so damn good, manly and with a slight musk scent that made Kevin\u2019s skin tingle.</p><p>Damn it, he wanted this man, and to hell with all the reasons why it would be a bad idea. Kevin slanted his head up to taste Richard\u2019s lips, the first time he\u2019d initiated such a thing, sweeping his tongue inside Richard\u2019s willing mouth, and sampling every breath he took.</p><p>Groaning, Richard turned Kevin so his back was facing the others, and his tongue slid over Kevin\u2019s. He put his hand on Kevin\u2019s ass, pulling it in toward him, arching against him and gradually heating and hardening the flesh made soft and cold by the water. God, Kevin wanted him. Whether this was true and forever, he didn\u2019t know, but just then he couldn\u2019t imagine ever wanting anyone else.</p> <p>A shout from behind them made Richard turn and laugh as Gavin stood on the bank watching them with raised his eyebrows. \u201cWe have a long way to walk before we get back home this evening. Kevin has a busy, important night ahead of him as well. Don\u2019t wear him out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to,\u201d Richard said lazily, looking back down at Kevin and taking one more slow kiss, despite Kevin\u2019s reddened cheeks and attempts to get away. Richard towed him back to shore and helped him out before ducking into the trees and retrieving his clothes. Kevin sat down on the grassy bank to let the sun dry him off, as Tucker joined him.</p><p>Leaving only two guards, Gavin and Richard took their leave, wanting to make it all the way around the perimeter, they said, before nightfall. It occurred to Kevin that a lot of miles had to be covered by then, if that was the case, but he didn\u2019t even try to apply logic to what the big ones said anymore. He just accepted that it didn\u2019t make sense and went on. It gave him a headache if he thought about it too much, and really, almost none of it made any sense.</p><p>They stayed for about another hour, until they were all sleepy and beginning to get too hot again. They ate the lunch they\u2019d brought with them and afterward headed back up the mountain. Kevin found the climb back up was more exhausting, though the gnats did leave him mostly alone this time, and when they got back to the lodge, he was pretty tired. He let Tucker talk him into some video games and by the time Tucker had annihilated him as usual, it was time for dinner. The others still hadn\u2019t returned, but Kevin decided to go up and take a nap before the ceremony later that night. The unaccustomed fresh air and exercise put him out in no time.</p><p>He awoke maybe a couple of hours later and felt a large, hard body snuggled up against him. He scooted back into Richard\u2019s warmth and closed his eyes again with a sigh. He awoke again, what must have been hours later, feeling disoriented. He was alone in bed this time and felt a little abandoned until he remembered that tonight was the ceremony. Richard must have left him sleeping. He glanced at the clock on his bedside table and saw that it was eleven o\u2019clock. Why hadn\u2019t Tucker come for him? They\u2019d told him they would talk to him, and he would know everything after the ceremony. Was he not allowed to watch the ceremony itself? Fuck that. After what kept happening with Richard and how strong their connection was, Kevin could no longer ignore the fact that he was in this thing deep. He had to know the truth of what he might be facing.</p> <p>He suspected they were all members of some strange cult, not necessarily religious in nature, but that was a possibility too. It might be a Nature-based religion or perhaps some kind of animal worship. They seemed to believe they were in some kind of pack, after all, and Gavin had said he was an alpha, like with wolves. The day before, Richard had even marked him with his scent, for God\u2019s sake. If that was all it was, it may be harmless enough, though crazy as hell. He still wasn\u2019t sure how Tucker had allowed himself to be roped into all this, unless the need for a family, to connect somehow and belong had been stronger in him than Kevin had ever realized.</p><p>It was all this talk of hunters and killing that bothered him, and he couldn\u2019t shake the fear that this group was somehow responsible for the deaths in Florida, no matter how many times Tucker denied it. He had to find out once and for all, before he totally lost himself in Richard, like Tucker had apparently done with Gavin. These men exuded strength and power, and if he wasn\u2019t very careful, he would be as overcome by it as Tucker had been.</p><p>Slipping from bed, he pulled on his clothes without turning on a light. The light streaming in the window from the full moon was bright and lit up the whole chamber with a silver glow. He tried the door to his room and found it locked, of course. He looked around the room for something he could use to slip the lock, and his eyes lit on a framed picture on the dresser. Sometimes, these pictures had stiff cardboard backings. He quickly dismantled it and found that it did, indeed, have a stiff, glossy cardboard backing to help hold the picture in place. He tore it in half, and using it like a credit card, he worked on slipping it down to tumble the lock.</p><p>He\u2019d had a lot of practice at this when he was a teenager. He used to slip out of the house when he was fifteen or so to meet a boy he liked down the block. His mother, who never quite knew what to do with him, figured out that he was sneaking out at night, though she didn\u2019t yet know it was to meet boys. At that point, she was worried he\u2019d get some girl pregnant. She took to locking his door at night, as well as the front and back doors with a key so he couldn\u2019t get out of the house. He\u2019d become quite adept at slipping his debit card into the lock on his bedroom door and then easing out through a window downstairs. He hoped his skills would come back to him.</p><p>The card kept tearing in his hands and frustrated, he prowled around the room, looking for something else he could pick the lock with. Nothing. Frustrated he sat down on the side of the bed and thought. There was no way that Richard and Tucker would have left him completely alone in a locked room in the lodge. It stood to reason that someone had stayed behind, if for no other reason than to raise an alarm should anything happen. He went to the door and began to bang on it, yelling as loud as he could that he needed help.</p><p>After a few minutes of this, he finally heard footsteps moving down the hall toward him. They stopped outside his door and a female voice called out. \u201cIs everything okay?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, no, I\u2019m sick. Please help me. Open the door.\u201d</p><p>Praying it wasn\u2019t one of the big ones, he stood back, waiting for the door to open. A small young woman with blonde hair eased the door open and then jumped quickly back as she saw him standing there. She was rather heavily pregnant, and she put her hands protectively over her stomach.</p><p>Kevin raised both hands in the air to reassure her. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. I won\u2019t even touch you. I\u2019m sorry I had to lie to you, but I need to leave this room, and I can\u2019t have you raising an alarm.\u201d</p><p>She wrung her hands and stared at him with big, blue eyes. \u201cW-what are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing, honest. I\u2019m really sorry about this. I just want to go to the ceremony. Now, if you\u2019d just step inside here, I\u2019ll lock you in and you\u2019ll be safe. I promise. I\u2019ll even tell someone to come and let you out as soon as I get there, okay?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and stepped past him into the room. He tried to smile at her reassuringly, and then closed the door behind him, propping a chair from the hall against the outside. Even though he hadn\u2019t touched her, he still felt a little like a big bully, and he figured that if one of the big ones was her husband, he\u2019d have some serious explaining to do. They all seemed so protective. It was weird.</p><p>He was still quiet as he moved down the stairway, in case guards had been left outside. Tip-toeing to the back door, he opened it quietly and saw no one else around. Far in the distance, he could hear voices and see lights in the forest. He moved toward them, trying to keep to the shadows, in case anyone other than the young woman had stayed behind to guard the outside of the lodge.</p><p>Excitement coursed through him as he walked down the path. The moonlight made it easy to navigate, especially once his eyes adjusted to the darkness. Hearing what sounded like howling coming from the clearing ahead, Kevin felt a trickle of fear down his spine. He was almost at the clearing, and he faded back into the trees. Wanting to avoid detection for as long as he could, he edged closer, not sure what he was about to see, but feeling strangely excited. Perhaps, at long last, some of the mysteries were about to be solved. He found a big pine tree right on the edge of the clearing and moved over behind it, gazing out at the assembled group. There looked to be about sixty or seventy people in the clearing, both young and old. The bigger ones were all standing together in a group by the front, while the others were closer to the edge where he was hiding. He could see Gavin standing on a little outcropping of rock, slightly elevated, and he was talking to the group of men and women clustering around him. Kevin was too far away to hear anything they were saying.</p> <p>Closer to him was a woman with long, gray hair, the oldest person he had seen at the lodge up to now. Despite her age, her body was straight. She had broad shoulders and powerful arms. Around her was a group of small children, and she seemed to be telling them stories. Kevin saw Tucker standing near this group, along with some of the other, smaller ones. He stepped out into the moonlight and went to Tucker\u2019s side.</p><p>\u201cOh God, Kevin, you startled me,\u201d Tucker said, turning to him in surprise. \u201cWhat the heck are you doing here? Richard said you weren\u2019t coming, and he even left someone to watch over you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, about that. She\u2019s locked in my room, Tucker. Better send someone to let her out.\u201d</p><p>Tucker gave him a pissed-off look and spoke to a boy beside him. The young man hurried off back toward the lodge.</p><p>\u201cIf you scared her, Joshua will kill you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is, but I assure you she\u2019s fine. I never even touched her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJoshua\u2019s her mate, Kevin. Like I\u2019m Gavin\u2019s mate. And you have no business being here. Gavin and Richard will be furious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy is that? They told me they wanted me here a couple of days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings have changed. Now Richard wants to be the one who tells you about things. He thinks you\u2019ll be too freaked out if you see it happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSee what happening?\u201d Kevin shook his head. \u201cNo, I\u2019ve waited long enough. I need to be here, Tucker. I need to see for myself what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s time I was let in on this big secret of yours.\u201d</p> <p>Tucker nodded, laying his hand on Kevin\u2019s arm. \u201cI agree, but it\u2019s not my call. Look, stay for a little while, but I think as soon as Richard notices you here, he\u2019ll make you leave. Tonight is kind of special, and I don\u2019t think things will get started right away. Actually, it\u2019s my first time to see this too. It\u2019s the blue moon ceremony.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe what? Blue moon? I thought you were joking about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, Gavin said it really happens about once every three years. The full moon rises twice in the same month, at the beginning and then again, toward the end of the month. It doesn\u2019t change color or anything, of course, but it\u2019s very rare. When it happens, they have this ceremony, to mark the occasion.\u201d He pointed toward an older woman who was telling the children stories, because they were indeed stories of some kind, and the children sat on the ground under the moonlight seeming to hang on her every word.</p><p>\u201cSo...what? You worship the moon?\u201d</p><p>Tucker shook his head. \u201cThey don\u2019t worship it, no. But it\u2019s very important to them. It-it brings on the change, though they can do it at any time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo what? What do you mean by the change?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll find out if Richard doesn\u2019t catch you. For now, listen to what the medicine woman is telling them. These are some of their legends,\u201d Tucker said.</p><p>\u201cMedicine woman? Seriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe clan has an Indian heritage a long way back. Shh...listen.\u201d</p><p>Kevin moved a little closer, with Tucker beside him and they focused on what she was saying.</p><p>\u201cOnce in the old days, long ago, before the humans came, there was a wolf, and this wolf was alone. Oh, there were other wolves in his pack, but each of them ran under the silvery moon together, and he had no mate to run with. He lived high in the hills all alone, and refused to join the others. And this gave rise to the legend of the lone wolf, with his long teeth and his fearsome, fiery eyes.</p> <p>\u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the worst thing. It wasn\u2019t the thing that froze the marrow in the bones of the other wolves late at night, and caused the children to hide their heads under their paws, and the others to cower in their dens. The worst thing was the lone wolf\u2019s howling, in the cold, crackling air and in the light of the silvery moon. He would sit on his high hill and howl the mournful song of a lost soul, tortured and alone.</p><p>\u201cAnd it frightened everyone who heard it\u2014all except one. One young pup, who also lived alone, his parents having moved on and left him. And when the pup heard the wolf\u2019s mournful song, he would stand in the pale, silvery light of the moon, and he would lift his voice to join the wolf, and he would call to him. \u2018Who\u2019s going to stay with me this long, lonesome night?\u2019\u201d</p><p>Kevin had to admit he was a little charmed by the story. It had the feel of a fairy tale, both from the old woman\u2019s soft voice and the children\u2019s rapt attention. When she got to the last line, the long, lonesome night part, she would drag out the vowel sounds, making the words sound almost like a howl. The sound made a little shiver go down his spine and he saw the children shift to sit closer to each other. As the sound died on the chill night air, she continued.</p><p>\u201cBut no one ever came, and no one ever answered, because the pup was a solitary soul. No one understood him or took the time to know him. And he would lie awake in his bed at night wondering why he felt so lost and alone. Sometimes it would make him angry and sometimes it would make him cry. And every night when he heard the wolf, he would stand and sing out, \u2018Who\u2019s going to stay with me this long, lonesome night?\u2019 But no one ever answered and no one ever came.</p><p>\u201cAnd one night there was a strange and rare moon, a blue moon, and this time when the young pup stood and called, \u2018Who\u2019s going to stay with me this long, lonesome night?\u2019 he heard an answering call. It was the lone wolf, singing his sad, lonely song, but closer this time, sounding nearby. It might have been nothing. It might have been his imagination that the song sounded so close, or only a shadow crossing the blue moon, but he thought it might be everything he\u2019d been seeking. It might be a way to belong. He called again, \u2018Who\u2019s going to stay with me this long, lonesome night?\u2019 And from the corner of the eye, he saw the shadows move and become living and breathing flesh. It was the wolf. The pup was frightened, but he knew he had drawn the wolf with his mournful song, and as he peered into the red eyes in front of him, he felt his fear go away.</p><p>\u201cHe knew in that instant that what he had sought for so long had finally come for him. The wolf answered his call. And so with his heart full and his eyes lit up with understanding, the pup faced the wolf and he said again, \u2018Who\u2019s going to stay with me this long, lonesome night?\u2019 And the wolf said, \u2018I will.\u2019</p><p>\u201cSo even today, but only sometimes, on special nights when the moon is full, like tonight, if you strain very hard to hear it, you may hear the cry of the two wolves, their voices mingling together, high on a hill, under the light of the blue moon.\u201d</p><p>Just as she finished speaking, a long chilling howl rose up from the group gathered around Gavin. As Kevin watched in fascination and horror, they threw off their clothing one by one and fell on all fours. Even from thirty yards away, where he stood, he could hear the popping and cracking sounds as their bodies elongated and stretched. His mouth fell open and he grabbed Tucker\u2019s arm in terror, pulling at him as one by one their bodies shifted and shimmered as they changed into huge wolves before his eyes. Black ones, brown ones, silver ones, all huge with red eyes and fearsome fangs hanging from their mouths.</p> <p>Kevin screamed. He couldn\u2019t have held the sound back even if he\u2019d tried.</p><p>He heard Tucker yelling at him, even the woman who\u2019d been telling the stories was suddenly on her feet, looking at him in alarm, but he couldn\u2019t seem to stop. His scream pierced the night and was even louder than the howling of the wolves. He saw several huge heads turn toward him and a few nearest the back of the pack began prowling in his direction. That was all it took.</p><p>He wrenched his arm away from Tucker and took off as fast as he could back down the path he\u2019d come down. His only thought was to put as much distance between himself and the horror behind him as he could. He was aware of Tucker right behind him, yelling and grabbing at his arm. Tucker had always been a fast runner, much faster than he was. Tucker yanked at his arm and shoved him around to face him.</p><p>Vaguely some part of his mind registered feet pounding toward them. Panting for breath he cast a wild eye behind him, trying to wrench away. Whatever was coming for them was headed their way fast. His mind screamed to him that the monstrous creatures were coming for them both, and they had to get away. Kevin threw his body behind Tucker\u2019s, intending to push Tucker ahead of him down the pathway. He felt something huge and powerful slam into his back and knock them both to the ground. He wrenched his body around, half turning over to see a huge black mass hovering over both of them, a gaping maw dripping saliva on their faces. A huge paw slammed into his chest with a stunning, breathtaking pain. His ears were filled with the feral snarls coming from the beast\u2019s throat and his mind refused to register what was about to happen.</p><p>Tucker was screaming at the beast on Kevin\u2019s chest, pounding on it with his fists. The beast turned its head toward him, and Kevin could have sworn it gave a growl almost of satisfaction. It sank its teeth deeply into Tucker\u2019s neck. Without conscious thought, Kevin rolled to his side, squirming out from under the creature while it was busy with Tucker, and he staggered to his feet. The only thought in his head was that this thing was about to kill Tucker, to rip out his throat. Rocks almost the size of his head lined the path leading up towards the circle. Kevin heaved one up without thinking, brought it up as high as he could and crashed it down onto the skull of the monster. It let out one loud sound, half scream, half roar and then slumped down across Tucker\u2019s body.</p><p>Suddenly, he was pushed roughly to the side, and he fell on the path, his legs unable to hold him up any longer. A huge brown wolf was crouching over Tucker\u2019s body, while another large gray one suddenly flung itself over him, knocking him on his back. He put up his hands defensively as bile came flooding into his mouth. Not again\u2014he wouldn\u2019t survive this time. He choked back the vomit, and he closed his eyes, letting his head fall back on the ground and giving up. Bright pain radiated down from his chest and across his side. Broken ribs, he thought absently, a part of his mind still trying to work out what was happening to him.</p><p>After a few moments he was vaguely aware that hands lifted and carried him, as behind him he could still hear what sounded like a battle raging, with other snarls and growls and howling all surrounding the pathway. He opened his eyes and realized Richard carried him, running fast. Too fast, it seemed, to be real. He had to be dreaming. Others were shouting, but his vision was getting dimmer and there was a strange buzzing in his ear. It must be shock. His mind kept repeating the word as a chill swept over him.</p><p>He never lost consciousness, but the buzzing in his ears continued, even as he was taken into the warmth of the lodge and taken upstairs to his room. Someone laid him down on the bed and Richard covered him with a blanket, then said something to the others in the room and ran out again. He\u2019d said something about checking on his son. What? What son? What in the name of God was going on? What had he just seen? The images of the beast that tried to kill both him and Tucker flashed through his mind again and again as he lay shivering on the bed. Richard would come soon. He knew that, and he yearned for him at the same time he dreaded seeing him.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>Richard had never been so frightened in his life. He\u2019d been near the front of the crowd and had just shifted when he heard the loud commotion near the path. Almost unable to believe what he was seeing, he watched as Gavin\u2019s personal guard, the ones he\u2019d last noticed at the back of the pack, ran toward the loud yelling. His keen eyes picked out Tucker right away, and he was stunned to see him struggling with Kevin. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d left Kevin asleep and locked inside his room. How could he be here now? Obviously, he\u2019d witnessed the shifting of the entire pack, and he was badly frightened, maybe fighting Tucker off as he tried to get away. Too stunned to move at first, Richard was aware of Gavin leaping past him. After staring blankly for what felt like an eternity, his body hurled itself toward the scene unfolding by the edge of the woods.</p><p>Kevin had broken and run down the path, with Tucker right behind him. Tucker caught up to him after only a few paces, but to his horror, Richard saw Todd, the guard nearest them, wasn\u2019t stopping his headlong rush toward them. Todd had been right at the back of the pack, only yards away from where the men had been standing before they took off running. He plowed into them now, and took them down, his fierce, savage snarls loud and frightening. As incredible as it seemed, Todd was attacking the men, and seemed to be going for the kill.</p><p>Kevin somehow rolled out of his grasp and made it to his feet, and before anyone else could reach them, picked up one of the big rocks lining the pathway and hurled it down on the back of Todd\u2019s skull. Richard\u2019s mind registered all of this as he saw the others reach them on the path. Gavin shouldered all of them aside and fell on top of his mate, keening and growling as he forced the shift on himself. Kevin still stood beside Tucker, swaying unsteadily and clearly in shock. Richard took him down himself, trying not to hurt him, but feeling fiercely protective. His wolf needed to crouch over him, needed to make sure no one touched him. Filled with impotent rage at the thought that Todd would dare to hurt either his son or his mate, he savagely hoped Todd was dead, or else he\u2019d kill him himself.</p> <p>He had seen Tucker lying still on the pathway, blood streaming from him, and his mind shied away from that image. Tucker couldn\u2019t be dead. It became his mantra, and he repeated it over and over as he tried to gain control. Gavin was over him, and the narrow pathway was alive with the snarls and nervous whining of the pack.</p><p>The gammas who made up Gavin\u2019s private guard huddled around Todd. Richard saw them rolling him over and checking his pulse. One of them looked up at the others and shook his head grimly, while Marissa gasped and turned her face away. As Richard watched, the body shifted back into its human form, and a few of the other guards were forcing the shift as well, shocked and disbelieving. They all must surely realize that what Todd had done was almost unthinkable. To attack the alpha\u2019s pet, along with a guest of the alpha\u2019s in their home was unconscionable and punishable by death. If Kevin hadn\u2019t already killed him, Gavin would have torn him apart, while the entire pack watched.</p><p>All this registered in some part of Richard\u2019s brain, but he was still finding it hard to calm down enough to shift. How on earth had this happened? All of Gavin\u2019s guard had been overzealous, and Richard had warned Gavin about them only a few days before. But why had one of them dared to launch this attack? Had he totally lost his mind?</p><p>Todd certainly couldn\u2019t tell anyone now because he was dead, killed by the rock that Kevin crashed down into the back of his head.</p><p>He managed to force the shift back on himself and tried to quickly assess any damage Kevin had sustained in the attack. No broken skin, thank God, but he was hunched over his side, and drew in short, sharp breaths. Richard suspected broken ribs at the very least.</p> <p>Gavin was already running back toward the lodge with Tucker, so Richard forced all of his attention back on Kevin. He murmured soothingly to him. He was still conscious, but his breathing was erratic and he had his eyes closed. He picked him up carefully and took him back to the lodge, wanting to get him somewhere he could examine him more carefully.</p><p>When they reached Kevin\u2019s room, he put him on the bed and covered his shivering body with a blanket. Irena, the medicine woman, had come in behind him, along with a few other gammas, who were standing nervously by the door. Yelling at them to call for the doctor, he motioned Irena closer.</p><p>\u201cStay with him, please, Irena, while I go check on my son. I think he\u2019s suffering from shock and broken ribs. I\u2019ll only be a moment.\u201d</p><p>Irena nodded and sat beside Kevin, taking his hand in hers.</p><p>When he got to Gavin\u2019s room, he was almost afraid to go in. If he lost Tucker now, after finally finding him again, he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do. It made him sick to think about it. Easing open the door, he saw Tucker lying on his back in bed, his face unnaturally pale against the sheets. Gavin was pressing his wrist to Tucker\u2019s lips, feeding him with his blood.</p><p>\u201cIs he...\u201d he asked, almost afraid of the answer.</p> <p>Gavin turned a flushed, worried face toward him. \u201cHe\u2019ll be okay, I think. His wound is closing already. Another minute or two...\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cThank God.\u201d He crossed over to the bed to stand beside his son, taking and squeezing one of his hands. His knees suddenly felt too weak to hold him and he sank down beside Tucker on the bed.</p><p>\u201cKevin?\u201d Gavin asked.</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cSome bad bruises. I think he has broken ribs, and he\u2019s in shock. I left him with Irena to come check on Tucker.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded, his face set and tight. \u201cWhat the fuck happened tonight, Richard?\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Todd attacked them both, even though he had to know who they were. I still can\u2019t believe it...\u201d</p><p>Gavin made a low growling sound in his throat, but said nothing further, just smoothed Tucker\u2019s hair with his free hand, urging him to take more of his blood.</p><p>Richard put a hand on his arm. \u201cI know how you\u2019re feeling, but don\u2019t make yourself sick. He can only take in so much right now. The doctor will be here soon, and he\u2019ll guide you.\u201d He got back to his feet nervously. \u201cI hate to leave him, but Kevin...\u201d</p> <p>Gavin nodded. \u201cGo ahead.\u201d</p><p>Richard got almost to the door when he heard Gavin speak to him again, his voice full of strong emotion. \u201cKevin saved him tonight, Richard. If it hadn\u2019t been for him...\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded, unable to speak. Kevin could have run away, but he\u2019d stayed to fight a savage creature much bigger than himself with only his bare hands and his courage. Another reason to love Kevin, as if he needed any more. He turned and rushed down the hall toward his mate. When he reached Kevin\u2019s room, he saw that Kevin was awake. Irena was examining his ribs, her fingers skimming lightly over the left side of his body, and Kevin\u2019s struggles to breathe were becoming more obvious. Irena looked up at Richard. \u201cHis breathing is getting worse. You need to help him.\u201d She pulled Kevin\u2019s face back toward her. He was awake and he looked up at her and then past her to Richard. His eyes widened in fear, and it felt like a knife to Richard\u2019s heart.</p><p>Irena shook his chin slightly to make him focus on her. \u201cKevin, listen to me. Richard is going to help you now. You must swallow what he will give you. It will help you and take away some of the pain. Do you understand?\u201d</p><p>He nodded almost imperceptibly and his eyes flew back up to Richard, who had sat down on the other side of the bed. \u201cKevin, it\u2019s me, baby. You know I\u2019d never hurt you, right?\u201d</p><p>Kevin stared blankly back at him, making no sign he\u2019d heard him. Moving slowly, Richard brought his wrist to his mouth and allowed his fangs to drop. Kevin\u2019s sharp intake of breath caused him to wince and groan with pain, and while his mouth was still open, Richard pressed his wrist to his lips.</p><p>There was a brief struggle as he tried to wrench his head away, but Richard held his head steady with his free hand, while Irena held down Kevin\u2019s body. Irena was one of the oldest members of the pack, but she was still a wolf, and her body still powerful.</p><p>Kevin tried to resist, but the blood slipping down his throat would have choked him if he hadn\u2019t swallowed. A look of extreme distaste came over his features, followed by an expression of surprise. He began to allow the blood into his mouth, and then to actually make small sucking motions with his lips. In moments, his eyes had rolled back in his head, but when Richard looked at Irena in alarm, she was smiling.</p><p>\u201cHis mate\u2019s blood is soothing and calming him, taking away his pain. He will continue to drink until you pull him away. Be careful not to lose too much yourself.\u201d She patted his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019ll go up to the alpha now to see if I can help since he\u2019s had a chance to calm himself. He would allow no one near his mate at first. The doctor should be here soon.\u201d</p><p>Richard sat beside his beautiful mate just watching him as he took in the wolf\u2019s blood. He understood now why Gavin had been almost unable to pull his arm away. His wolf was soothed by helping his mate this way, and he had to force himself to pull back when he began to get lightheaded. He wiped the blood away from Kevin\u2019s lips with a corner of the sheet and stroked his hair. He was almost frightened by the intensity of his feelings for him. Something wasn\u2019t right. These feelings were too intense, too powerful. He hadn\u2019t felt anything like this since...since his bloodmate years ago.</p><p>He pushed the thought away, and bent over Kevin to press his lips against his forehead, keeping watch over him until the doctor arrived.</p><p>Dr. Cornsilk stopped in to check Kevin\u2019s vitals and give him an injection for pain. Kevin was fast asleep now, with Richard sitting on the bed beside him.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s so pale,\u201d Richard said anxiously.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s from shock,\u201d Dr. Cornsilk replied. \u201cHe should be fine, though he should be kept quiet, and he\u2019ll need some reassurance when he wakes up. He\u2019s been through a bad emotional trauma.</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cFine. I\u2019ve already given him blood, and it seemed to soothe the pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, the ribs are already healing. Amazing, considering you haven\u2019t even given him a mating bite yet.\u201d The doctor looked at him with an odd expression. \u201cUsually the wolf\u2019s blood won\u2019t help much until after the mating rituals. The bloodmatch with the two of you must be very strong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No,\u201d Richard said, shaking his head. \u201cMy bloodmate died over twenty years ago, Doctor. You know that. She was Tucker\u2019s mother.\u201d</p><p>Dr. Cornsilk shrugged. \u201cNevertheless...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard shook his head emphatically. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. He\u2019s not my bloodmatch. I had that years ago with Tucker\u2019s mother, and she passed away. I\u2019m in love with Kevin, yes, but...\u201d</p><p>The doctor shook his head firmly. \u201cRichard, only the blood of a bloodmate can heal so quickly. You know this. Other wolf blood can certainly help keep someone alive until they can be helped, but only bloodmatch blood heals perfectly and quickly like this. No, Kevin Bryson is your bloodmatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible, Doctor. My wife...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s unheard of, but it may be that your first love was not a bloodmatch.\u201d</p><p>Richard shook his head stubbornly. \u201cNo, impossible. You didn\u2019t know her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, and I don\u2019t mean to offend you. Love matches are often just as strong and long lasting. There are really very few differences in the actual feelings involved. The difference is biochemical. It comes in a couple of ways. First of all, with a bloodmatch, a wolf really can\u2019t live without his mate. The attachment is almost physical, it seems, and wolves often die soon after a mate passes away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my son to think about,\u201d Richard said gruffly. \u201cI tried to survive for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand, of course. Still, others have not had the stamina that you\u2019ve shown, even when children were also involved. I\u2019ve already mentioned the blood connection with healing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy wife died in an isolated area, and there was no chance to save her. Maybe if I would have been with her...\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s interesting to speculate, but we\u2019ll never know for sure, of course. What I can tell you with some assurance is that Kevin most definitely is your bloodmatch. His ribs are almost completely healed. I\u2019ve never heard of a wolf having two bloodmatches before, but I suppose anything is possible, especially when, if she was indeed your bloodmatch, your first mate died so quickly after you\u2019d established the mating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you know all this because of the healing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat, and...tell me, how long have you known him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Richard said. \u201cA week, maybe. No, less than that. This is only the fourth day.\u201d</p><p>The doctor nodded. \u201cYes, an instant attraction? A feeling that was almost overpowering right away? And tell me, have you noticed a fragrance around him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA fragrance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, some overwhelmingly sweet scent that comes from him.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. \u201cYes, all of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd did it not strike you as strange that after some twenty years of not being attracted to anyone, that you meet this man and fall so in love with him in three or four days that you want to spend the rest of your life with him?\u201d</p><p>Kevin\u2019s delicious scent wafted up to him even now, causing him to feel almost dizzy. He\u2019d thought for several days now that he needed to find out what kind of cologne Kevin wore and invest some serious money in the company. He\u2019d never smelled anything like it before, and it was a scent he identified strongly with Kevin. It had been teasing around his nostrils for days now, driving him out of his mind. He looked up at the doctor in shock.</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d he said. The irresistible scent of the mate was well-known in the folklore of the wolves. It was what usually attracted them to their bloodmates in the first place. How could he have been so stupid as not to have realized? It must have been because he hadn\u2019t been expecting it. His bloodmatch had died so long ago.</p><p>\u201cExactly,\u201d the doctor said with a slight upturn at the corners of his mouth. \u201cGet some rest, Richard. Both your mate and your son will be fine. They were extraordinarily lucky. Not many humans survive a wolf attack.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded. It was still hard to believe what had happened. How had Todd dared to attack them the way he had? He could feel the restlessness of the entire pack at what had occurred, but he was too tired and emotionally drained to do anything about it tonight. He kicked off his shoes and lay down beside Kevin, gathering him in his arms.</p> <p>Kevin sighed as he settled into Richard\u2019s side, his head on his shoulder, his arm around his waist. This was where he\u2019d like to keep Kevin the rest of his life, safe in his arms, except he knew Kevin would balk at the idea. He was too independent, too practical and too unwilling to accept anything he couldn\u2019t see and touch with his own hands. He had to find a way to make him surrender that iron will of his just enough to let Richard in. He had to convince him that what they had was real and true and perfect, even though he knew Kevin would fight him every step of the way.</p><p>Kevin woke up to find himself wrapped up in Richard\u2019s arms. At first he was alarmed, but as he tried to move away, pushing gently against him so he wouldn\u2019t wake him up, Richard shifted to his back and his eyes flew open.</p><p>\u201cGood morning. How do you feel?\u201d he murmured, and Kevin felt his heart beating rapidly in his chest. He pushed against him, harder this time, to get some space between them.</p><p>It was like pushing against a wall. He couldn\u2019t budge him, and Richard looked down at him curiously.</p><p>\u201cGoing somewhere, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet me go,\u201d Kevin said, still pushing at him. \u201cI know what you are.\u201d</p><p>Richard shifted his body and rolled over on top of him, holding him down. He stretched Kevin\u2019s arms up over his head and held them there. \u201cAnd what am I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA-a monster, damn it! I saw what happened last night. I saw you all turn into those beasts.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou saw us shift into our wolves. I know. I\u2019m sorry you had to find out like that, sweetheart. I planned to break it to you some other way, though I don\u2019t guess there\u2019s any way for you to be comfortable with the idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComfortable with it? Are you crazy?\u201d He struggled uselessly again for a second and then huffed out a long breath. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. Maybe it\u2019s me that\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p><p>Richard leaned down and captured his mouth, kissing him for a long time until those crazy feelings came over Kevin again, and his treacherous cock thickened between them. What the hell was wrong with him that he was still so attracted despite what he\u2019d seen with his own eyes? A sudden thought made him jump. \u201cTucker? Where\u2019s Tucker? I saw that thing ripping at his throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker\u2019s fine, and Todd is dead. The wolf who attacked you was Todd, one of Gavin\u2019s guards. No one knows why he attacked you like he did, though we\u2019re going to try to find out. I\u2019m so sorry, Kevin. I know how terrified you must have been. If I could have gotten to you sooner...but you saved Tucker, Kevin. The rock killed Todd.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d he said, anger tightening his lips. \u201cThe mother fucker tried to kill us both.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I can\u2019t explain it. One of our oldest and most sacred laws is to always protect our pets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour pets?\u201d he said, his voice filled with contempt. \u201cIs that all we are to you? Pets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a term we use for our mates and for the members of the pack who never shift. Those like Tucker. It doesn\u2019t mean the same thing to us as it does to humans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHumans...God, I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not human, baby. You saw that for yourself. We\u2019re wolf shifters, and we\u2019ve existed for as long as humankind. But we\u2019re not evil. All we want to do is to be left alone to live our lives in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, this is crazy. Let me go!\u201d Kevin started struggling again to get away, trying to pull his wrists away from Richard\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Richard started kissing him again, and though he twisted his head to get away, it did begin to soothe him, especially when his lips traveled all over his face, slowly, almost reverently. They didn\u2019t speak for several minutes, just lay with their bodies touching all over. The room was filled with sunlight, and he wondered what time it was and where the others might be. Richard shifted to take some of his weight off him and released his wrists.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked gently.</p><p>Kevin nodded. \u201cCan I get up? I have to go to the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Richard rolled away and Kevin sat up shakily on the side of the bed. He felt his ribs. Still a little sore, but not bad. Damn, in his delirium the night before he\u2019d been sure they were broken. The pain had been bad, and he couldn\u2019t catch his breath. Now it was like nothing had happened. Had it been real? Was any of this real?</p><p>He pushed up to his feet and staggered a little, but put a hand out to stop Richard when he would have gotten up to help him. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I was just dizzy for a second.\u201d He made it to the end of the bed before he staggered again, and this time Richard was beside him, not taking no for an answer. He put an arm around him to help him to the bathroom and then stood, leaning with his backside against the vanity, patiently waiting while Kevin peed.</p><p>\u201cThis really isn\u2019t necessary,\u201d Kevin said sharply, glancing over at him darkly. Richard shrugged in that maddening way of his, his arms crossed over his chest. Finishing, Kevin stumbled over to the sink to wash his hands and caught sight of himself in the mirror. There were blood stains under his chin and down in the hollow of his throat. The memory of being held down on the bed while Richard forced his blood into his mouth came back with a vengeance and he staggered again. He kept staring into the mirror again and saw a further horror. There was a fine spray of blood on his forehead, and even in his hair, probably from Todd, or even Tucker.</p><p>\u201cThe-the blood. You...\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gave you some of my blood, yes. Only to heal you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh my God,\u201d he whispered and backed up as far as he could in the small bathroom. Richard made a sound of impatience and reached for him, pulling him back into his arms.</p><p>\u201cCalm down. It helped you. It\u2019s not going to turn you into a werewolf, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking. Get all that Hollywood crap out of your head. Todd never bit you, or even raked you with his claws.\u201d</p><p>\u201cY-you mean to say that if he had bitten me...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNo. Not exactly. Well, in a way...\u201d He reached into the shower and turned on the water. \u201cLet\u2019s get you cleaned up and we\u2019ll talk about it, but over breakfast. You need something to eat and so do I.\u201d</p><p>When he had the water adjusted, Richard stepped into the shower and held out a hand. Kevin hesitated for only a second before he stepped over and took his hand. Richard rewarded him with a beautiful smile and pulled him inside under the warm spray. Tenderly, Richard washed away all traces of the blood, and held Kevin close to his body, stroking his back when he began to tremble.</p><p>Both the warmth of the water and Richard\u2019s closeness finally stopped the chills that had been shaking his body, and he was able to get out of the shower and stand still while Richard dried him off.</p> <p>Richard stood up beside him and took him by the shoulders. \u201cBetter?\u201d he asked softly.</p><p>Kevin nodded and they went back to the bedroom for Kevin to get dressed. Richard looked down at himself sheepishly. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to stop by my room for me to dress. I was naked last night at the ceremony.\u201d</p><p>Kevin felt his cheeks get hot, but he nodded and followed him out, hoping no one was in the hall. Richard was casual about his nudity, and now Kevin could see why. The big ones\u2014the wolves, he made himself think\u2014must be naked around each other all the time.</p><p>Richard\u2019s room was just down about three rooms from his. Kevin wondered why he hadn\u2019t realized how close he was. Hesitating at the door, he waited for Richard to wave him inside the room. It was larger than his, and sparsely furnished. It reminded Kevin of a suite in a hotel, with a small kitchen of sorts. It was no more than a microwave on a counter next to a sink and a small refrigerator under the counter.</p><p>A dark brown leather sofa stood in the middle of the room with a matching chair, and over on the side of the large room was a big king-sized bed and some dressers. Everything was Spartan and neat, as Kevin had thought it would be. There was something so organized and controlled about Richard.</p> <p>He pulled on a pair of underwear, well-worn jeans and a T-shirt, slipped into some scuffed loafers and came back over to him. He dropped a quick kiss on Kevin\u2019s lips. \u201cReady, babe?\u201d</p><p>It must have been later than Kevin thought, because almost no one was around downstairs. A different woman came out to take their order, and Kevin wondered where Emily was. Her husband was part of the so-called guard. Was he being questioned? Richard ordered for both of them and then sat back, seeming to read Kevin\u2019s thoughts.</p><p>\u201cEmily must be with Christian this morning. I imagine he\u2019s taking it hard. Todd was his best friend.\u201d Tucker shifted his gaze down at his hands and Richard covered one of them with his. \u201cNo, don\u2019t feel bad about it. If you hadn\u2019t protected both you and Tucker, you\u2019d be dead. I\u2019d have killed him myself if I could have gotten to him before you acted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cStill, it\u2019s hard. I\u2019ve killed someone before in the line of duty once a robbery at a quick stop store I rolled up on when I was still on patrol. The guy pulled a gun on me, and I had no choice, but it messes you up, no matter how justifiable it might have been. This time, it was so much more personal, you know?\u201d He passed a hand over his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess the reaction is finally starting to set in. My hands are shaking.\u201d</p><p>Richard put a hand over his as the woman brought their breakfast. Kevin took a big sip of his coffee, and the bitter brew strengthened him somewhat. They both ate quietly for a few minutes, and Kevin could feel it bringing him strength.</p><p>Gavin showed up beside them, coming in from the side entrance where neither of them had noticed his approach. \u201cHow\u2019s Tucker?\u201d Richard asked, before Kevin got a chance.</p> <p>Gavin smiled. \u201cMuch better. Almost completely recovered, and spitting mad because I made him stay in bed this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait...what?\u201d Kevin broke in, laying down his fork. \u201cHow is that possible? I admit my memory is fuzzy, but I saw that thing ripping his throat open.\u201d</p><p>Gavin and Richard looked at each other and Richard gripped his hand a little tighter, like he was afraid he might bolt again. \u201cGavin gave him his blood, Kevin. Not only mate\u2019s blood, but alpha\u2019s blood. It\u2019s the strongest of all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this healed him somehow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Richard said patiently. \u201cJust like my blood healed your ribs.\u201d</p><p>Kevin moaned and closed his eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve got to be dreaming all this. Or else I\u2019ve totally lost my mind.\u201d</p><p>Gavin spoke up gently. \u201cJust take your time. It took Tucker a while to get used to it too. You see now why he couldn\u2019t tell you. You wouldn\u2019t have believed him. Tucker wanted to put me in a mental hospital up until the time I shifted in front of him.\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded. \u201cI remember he told me. About the hospital, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something else you need to know, Kevin,\u201d Richard said. \u201cTucker and I...we have a close relationship.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Kevin said sharply. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me I was right all along, and you\u2019re in some kind of three-way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Richard said firmly. \u201cDon\u2019t be silly. Tucker is...Tucker is my son.\u201d</p><p>Kevin cocked his head to one side, a smile tilting up the corners of his mouth. \u201cYour what? Come on, Richard, you can\u2019t be much more than five or six years older than Tucker. How is that even possible?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a wolf-shifter, Kevin. We stop aging around thirty and don\u2019t age again until we get really, really old. Some don\u2019t even live that long, though we...we live a very long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cH-how long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAround two hundred years, give or take.\u201d</p><p>Kevin laughed. Out of all the craziness he\u2019d witnessed in the last few hours, he didn\u2019t know why he should even think this was odd at all. \u201cAnd you? How old are you, Richard?\u201d</p><p>A little smile appeared on Richard\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m seventy-four.\u201d</p><p>Kevin opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out. Richard took him by the shoulders and shook him gently. \u201cKevin, take a breath.\u201d</p><p>He inhaled sharply and his sight began to clear a bit, as the little black stars stopped dancing in his peripheral vision. \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why that should surprise me so much, or hit me so hard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve had a lot to take in,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cGive it all some time. In the meantime, Richard, I need to talk to you about what we found when we searched Todd\u2019s room.\u201d He glanced over at Kevin and hesitated, but Kevin sat forward.</p><p>\u201cNo, go ahead. I want to hear this. I think I have a right.\u201d</p><p>Gavin nodded. \u201cFirst, let me tell you two of the other members of my personal guard are missing this morning, Marissa and Benjamin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Richard hissed in a breath sharply. \u201cAnd Christian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cChristian has been cooperating. He seems pretty scared, and rightly so. He knew their plans but he claims he had no part in any of it, and he was too frightened of the others to come to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you believe him?\u201d Richard\u2019s voice had turned hard and grim.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. There\u2019s no excuse for his disloyalty. He\u2019s being held downstairs until I can question him further.\u201d Kevin remembered Tucker telling him the basement held prison cells. He remembered something else Tucker had told him.</p><p>\u201cTucker had a bad feeling about the guard. Especially that one woman, Marissa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d Gavin said, his voice sounding tired. Kevin wondered if he\u2019d been awake all night and figured he had been. \u201cTucker has been right about Marissa all along, it seems. I should have listened to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker has good instincts,\u201d Kevin said. \u201cWhat did you find in Todd\u2019s room?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCrazy ramblings, mostly, in a book he was writing, a kind of manual for what looks like a military style coup.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA coup? Like a takeover?\u201d Richard\u2019s voice was unbelieving. \u201cAre any of them alpha?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and that makes it even more strange. It looks like his father put a lot of this in his head from what I read.\u201d He turned toward Kevin. \u201cTodd\u2019s father was alpha and our previous alpha\u2019s battle commander for many years. He was killed a few years ago fighting the Hunters. Todd\u2019s writings implied that in his opinion, all the natural pets, like Tucker, for example, are defectives, every one of them, both physically and mentally. At puberty, when the change came over the rest of the pack, turning them into wolf shifters, the ones who weren\u2019t able to shift should be, in his opinion, put out of their misery. They should be mercifully destroyed, and not left to suck the life out of the rest of the pack, their useless lives a drain on the pack\u2019s resources...his words, by the way, not mine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the craziest thing I\u2019ve ever heard of,\u201d Richard interrupted, his face furious.</p><p>\u201cApparently, Todd\u2019s grandfather before him had been of similar mind, and you realize, this is going way back, hundreds of years. When one of his father\u2019s own siblings had failed to develop naturally into a shifter, she was simply smothered in her sleep. His grandfather felt it was his duty and his responsibility as her parent. In his opinion, one he had passed on to his family, so-called natural pets had failed to develop normally. Failure to deal with such aberrations was a weakness. In the wild, defective offspring simply didn\u2019t survive. It was the natural way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis is complete drivel! The fucking bastard was insane,\u201d Richard\u2019s face was even darker red by now, and Gavin was nodding.</p><p>\u201cIn Todd\u2019s mind,\u201d he continued, \u201cand that of his brothers and cousins, too much fraternization with the weaker humans and pets was the reason the Hunters had been able to pose such a threat to our race for so long. His grandfather\u2019s teachings had told them that in centuries past, the wolves were the most powerful species on the planet. Humans were for subjugation and existed only to serve the wolves in whatever capacity they were granted. Somewhere along the line, a grievous mistake was made by allowing humans and so-called natural pets to breed with the wolves, thus weakening the wolf blood line. It had become so mixed and so thin over time, in fact, that wolves no longer had the bloodmatch with each other, or at least only rarely. Now routinely wolves had a bloodmatch with a defective pet or a human. Even his own alpha,\u201d Gavin paused with a grim smile. \u201cThat would be me, of course, what he called the strongest wolf in the pack, and I succumbed to one of the abnormal creatures. The other alphas of the Mountain packs had taken humans, all except one, and Todd pinned his hopes on that alpha\u2019s strength and the strength of his blood.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWho? Casey over in North Carolina? The battle commander?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s the one. He mated with another wolf a couple of years ago, if you remember, Rory. From what I hear of him, he\u2019s extremely dominant.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded, and Gavin continued. \u201cThere would be no easy way out of the mess their ancestors had created, Todd decided. They must eradicate all of the defective natural pets by any means possible. It was the doctor in charge of the Hunters who had given him the idea of getting rid of the pets, the one who attacked Tucker after our ceremony. Along with some of the methods he\u2019d used on the two alphas\u2019 mates, Tucker and Nicky.\u201d Gavin turned again to Kevin to explain. \u201cThis so-called doctor injected both of them with powerful drugs to make them do his bidding. This is what Todd and his followers had in mind for the alphas.</p> <p>\u201cOnce they had them enslaved to the drug and ready to be used as breeding stock, then a strong leader, perhaps one who was mated with a wolf, like the alpha Casey, could take over, and change things, perhaps even in their own long lifetime. In the meantime, a new breed of wolves would be born, wolves that came from two wolf parents. Since the alphas were the strongest, they would supply the sperm to create the new breed, and the guard could control the alphas with the drugs. It would take time, of course. The alphas still had many loyal followers, many more than their small group. But he thought they would soon come around to his way of thinking when they witnessed for themselves the beautiful, strong children produced by the matings. They\u2019d keep it quiet, too, about what they were doing to the alphas. They\u2019d put out the story that they were caring for them in their grief over their mates. Because that\u2019s another thing they had planned. The alphas\u2019 pets would all be killed to make way for more suitable mates. Anyone who objected would be exterminated as well.</p><p>\u201cThen it would be time to take care of the natural pets, a painful but necessary process. They\u2019d be rounded up and put into extermination camps. An edict from the new alpha to never again breed humans should take care of the rest of it over time. Human pets could be taken and used as submissive love slaves, to slake the appetite caused by the bloodmatch, but nothing more. No more giving them the status of mates. That\u2019s what his grandfather had done, all those many years ago. He bred his children with a female wolf, using a human woman who was his true mate only to assuage the frenzy of the bloodmatch, and if any of his children failed to develop normally, he dispatched them. Over time, he theorized the bloodmatch would right itself, and go back to the way it was in the beginning, with wolves only mating other wolves. This would be the new order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy God,\u201d Kevin said softly. \u201cIt sounds like something out of Nazi Germany.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich greatly influenced Todd\u2019s father, according to what I can find out about him. All of that was happening when he was a young man, of course. He was an admirer of the German Chancellor, according to what Todd wrote.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me Marissa and the others bought into this bullshit,\u201d Richard said.</p> <p>Gavin nodded. \u201cUnfortunately, it seems they did. Or maybe, like Tucker says, Marissa had her own agenda. But there are others too, all of them in the alphas\u2019 personal guards. In fact, there\u2019s a whole network of them in each of the three packs, though their numbers are small at the present, according to what Christian\u2019s been able to tell us. I was on the phone to the other alphas early this morning to advise them of the traitors in their own packs. We were concerned about Casey at first, but Marco has spoken with him, and he just called to tell me he\u2019s convinced he wasn\u2019t a part of any of it.\u201d</p><p>Richard ran a hand over his face. \u201cI can\u2019t believe any of this. Was Marco able to make any arrests?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, and that\u2019s what\u2019s worrying me. Apparently, Marissa and Benjamin warned them all, during the confusion after Todd\u2019s death, and this morning several guards were missing from each of the packs. They\u2019re hiding somewhere, and we need to find them.\u201d</p><p>Richard rose to his feet. \u201cWhat are we waiting for?\u201d Gavin grinned and for the first time, Kevin saw something in both men\u2019s eyes that wasn\u2019t quite human. He shuddered and Richard bent down to him, pressing a quick kiss to the top of his head. \u201cGo up and sit with Tucker. I\u2019ll put a guard on both of you until we get back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood,\u201d Gavin said. \u201cWe need to track them down, and I won\u2019t rest until they pay for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d</p><p>Chapter Eight</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s no use, Tucker. I can\u2019t go through with some crazy mating with Richard. I won\u2019t do it.\u201d Tucker stared back at Kevin, a disapproving look on his face. They were in Tucker and Gavin\u2019s room, on a leather sofa that looked exactly like Richard\u2019s. Kevin wondered if the pack had gotten a deal on them, or something, though they didn\u2019t seem to be hurting for money. It was more likely they just weren\u2019t all that interested in the d\u00e9cor, or at least Gavin and Richard weren\u2019t.</p><p>It was three days after the attack on the night of the blue moon. Though the pack hadn\u2019t given up, no trace of the missing guard members could be found. Christian had cooperated, but he claimed not to know of any escape plan. He claimed Marissa was in charge of that aspect of their plans, and she had still been working on them when Todd jumped the gun.</p><p>Why he\u2019d attacked Tucker like he had, before any of their plans were solidified was still a mystery. Maybe the madness that was so evident in his writings had overpowered him when he had the alpha\u2019s pet within his grasp. Christian had been at a loss to explain it, saying he knew they were making some plans, but he\u2019d been under the impression they were as yet unformed and certainly not imminent. The jury was still out on what was to be done with Christian. His mate, Emily, had vowed to stay with him if he were to be banished, and her family, powerful within the pack, was lobbying for greater leniency since Christian had cooperated.</p><p>Richard had been so busy searching for them, Kevin had seen very little of him over the past few days. He couldn\u2019t believe how much he missed him, and it was pissing him off. He didn\u2019t want to feel this way. He was still trying to come to terms with what he\u2019d learned about the group. He could almost laugh now to think he believed they were a cult; how he wished it were that simple.</p><p>For the past two days, Tucker had been pressuring Kevin to submit to a mating with his father. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, Kevin. I know you care for him. Dr. Cornsilk said he was your bloodmatch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI might care for him, but I\u2019ve known him for a week. A week, Tucker. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019m going to commit myself to someone I\u2019ve known that long, so you can stop trying to talk me into it. And if you think I\u2019m just going to blithely ignore the fact he\u2019s a shapeshifting wolf, for Christ\u2019s sake, you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, no relationship is perfect,\u201d Tucker said with a grin. At Kevin\u2019s rolled eyes, he laughed out loud. \u201cC\u2019mon, Kevin, you know I struggled against it too, but he\u2019s your match. Admit it. Didn\u2019t you feel an immediate attraction? God, when I first met Gavin, I had sex with him within the first thirty minutes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, but that\u2019s because you\u2019re a slut.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTrue enough.\u201d Tucker laughed and punched his friend. \u201cAsshole.\u201d</p><p>Kevin laughed along with him for a moment and then turned serious, running a hand through his hair. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get out of here, Tucker. I\u2019ve got to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing has changed along those lines, Kevin. They won\u2019t allow you to leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDamn it,\u201d he yelled, jumping to his feet and crossing to the window. \u201cHow did I get myself in this mess?\u201d He turned around and faced Tucker. \u201cAnd don\u2019t apologize again. It was my own stupid fault for coming here. I know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe it was meant to be. Like fate, or something. If you hadn\u2019t come, you never would have met my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh damn, don\u2019t even remind me. You realize I would be...what, your step-father? Shit.\u201d</p><p>Tucker laughed, a happy sound that Kevin had missed. Grudgingly, he smiled back at him. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m scared, Tucker. Not of Richard, I don\u2019t mean that. But of what he\u2019ll want from me. Total commitment, of course, but not only that. He\u2019s going to want me to...\u201d He turned back to the window. \u201cShit, how can I even talk to you about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s awkward, I know.\u201d Tucker shrugged. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like I grew up with him as my dad or anything. He feels more like a brother, in a way, you know? An older, very stern brother...\u201d He laughed again. \u201cThat\u2019s um...that\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? How...uh...controlling he is? I know he\u2019s pretty old school.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a fucking Dom, Tucker, if you people use that word. The way he...the things he makes me...\u201d He blew out a long breath. \u201cDamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, you don\u2019t have to tell me the details. I don\u2019t even need to go there. God, you\u2019ve seen how Gavin bosses me around, and he\u2019s mild compared to most of the wolves, so I know exactly what you\u2019re talking about. You...you don\u2019t respond to it?\u201d</p><p>Kevin sighed and pressed his forehead against the window. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, Tucker. I do respond to it, but I\u2019m just not sure if I want that for the rest of my life. We\u2019ve been having sex since the first night I came here, and he\u2019s been a toppy bastard since the first time. Sometimes I...hell, I don\u2019t know if I can be what he needs, though I want to be. I\u2019m not what he wants, I think.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s only one way you\u2019ll find out,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cTry submitting to him, completely. You\u2019ll know if it\u2019s right for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI-I don\u2019t know if I can do that. I mean, I pretty much have already, but there\u2019s a part of me that\u2019s holding back, and I know he can feel it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let him worry about that? Submission isn\u2019t about weakness, you know. It\u2019s supposed to be an exchange of power. It is with me and Gavin. Or is it that you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll like it too much?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Kevin turned around and glared at his friend. He could feel his face flame with heat. \u201cFuck you, Tucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, fuck you too, Bryson. Face it, you\u2019ve never had a relationship that lasted more than a couple of months, and you\u2019re what? Thirty-four? There\u2019s something going on with you, Bryson, and maybe it\u2019s that no one has really satisfied you before. No one has taken care of what you really need. But Richard has come pretty close, hasn\u2019t he? So close you\u2019re scared to death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo? You started getting interested in me when I told you I thought I liked to dominate. I used to go to the clubs in Fort Walton, but you\u2019d never go with me. What was it you were afraid of?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho said I was afraid of anything?\u201d He fidgeted for a few moments before turning and walking toward the door. \u201cThis is stupid. I\u2019m going back to my room.\u201d</p><p>Tucker laughed. \u201cYou can run, but you can\u2019t hide, Bryson.\u201d Tucker\u2019s laughter followed him down the hallway as he slammed the door behind him and went into his room. He threw himself on the bed, and stared up at the ceiling. How the hell could he even be considering this shit? He turned over on his stomach and closed his eyes, anger radiating off him in waves. He was bored as hell and needed exercise, and the one thing he didn\u2019t need was to be cooped up inside this damn room like a fucking prisoner.</p><p>The door opened behind him and he heard Richard\u2019s low whistle. \u201cNice view, baby. I could get used to being greeted this way every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cVery funny,\u201d Kevin said, not turning over. \u201cDon\u2019t start shit with me today, Richard. I\u2019m not in the mood.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? I never would have noticed.\u201d Kevin heard him walk over to stand beside the bed. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking with Tucker. He told me where to find you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, where else would I be? I don\u2019t exactly have the run of the place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTucker said you were in a pretty foul mood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever...\u201d</p><p>A slap on his ass made him spin around so fast he almost fell off the bed. \u201cCut it out. I don\u2019t want to play this shit, damn it.\u201d</p><p>Richard stared down at him. \u201cWho\u2019s playing? Get up and pack a bag. Take your toothbrush and a change of clothes. I\u2019m heading up to a cabin on the high ridge, and you\u2019re going with me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d He noticed for the first time that Richard had a small backpack slung on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou heard me. I was going to have a couple of gammas check it out, just to make sure none of the guard was up there, hiding out. Instead I think I\u2019ll take the four-wheeler and take you with me. I\u2019ll tell Gavin we might be gone a couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause we need some time to figure out some things between us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know the issues between us, Kevin. I don\u2019t have to spell them out. You\u2019re not the only one with doubts, you know.\u201d</p><p>Kevin sat up, feeling unreasonably irritated. So Richard had doubts, huh? \u201cAll I want to do is go back home and forget all about this. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about me or about your damn doubts.\u201d</p><p>Richard smirked at him. \u201cOh, you don\u2019t like that, do you? The fact I might not be willing to go through with this either.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, who the hell asked you, anyway? It sure as hell wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShut up and get on your feet. We\u2019re leaving.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t press your luck, Kevin, or I\u2019ll throw you over my shoulder and haul you out of here. Up to you.\u201d</p><p>Glaring at him, Kevin got to his feet and stomped into the bathroom, grabbing his toothbrush and toothpaste and razor. He stood in the doorway with the items in his hand. \u201cGuess I\u2019m ready. I don\u2019t exactly have a lot to take with me, you know. You stole my suitcase, so I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m supposed to pack.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmart ass. Put them in my pack and grab some jeans. I know Tucker brought you some.\u201d</p><p>Kevin went to his dresser and got the jeans and another T-shirt, then brought everything over to throw it down on the bed beside Richard. He shot Kevin an exasperated look before scooping them up and stuffing them down in his bag. \u201cOkay, come on. We\u2019re out of here.\u201d</p><p>Kevin may have been following Richard down the stairs and outside to the shed to find the atv, but he was anything but cooperative. The sullen expression on Kevin\u2019s face told Richard he wasn\u2019t prepared to do much of what he told him to do\u2014at least not without a fight.</p><p>Hell, Richard had always liked a challenge. And it was time to do what he\u2019d wanted to do for a long time. It was time to finally break through Kevin\u2019s barriers for good.</p><p>It took about thirty minutes to travel up the dirt road at the back of the lodge that led up to the small cabin on the ridge. They had traveled up the deeply rutted road that was little more than a wide trail through the woods, really, through the dense woods that surrounded the lodge. All along the way, they were treated to beautiful mountain vistas as they climbed the ridge and came out on spots where the trees weren\u2019t quite as thick. By the time they finally reached the small clearing where the cabin was located, Richard figured Kevin was probably tired of bouncing around on the back of the four-wheeler.</p><p>Richard pulled around to the front of the cabin and turned off the engine, allowing Kevin to climb off the back and take a look around. The log cabin was tiny, only one room, and situated near a small stream, about fifteen yards away. He could hear it babbling over the rocks.</p><p>\u201cStay here,\u201d Richard warned, as he climbed the rock steps. \u201cI don\u2019t see any signs of anyone being here, but let me make sure.\u201d He disappeared inside to take a quick look around. No sign that anyone had been there recently, and no fresh scents. He returned in a minute or two to beckon Kevin inside.</p><p>He watched as Kevin looked slowly around. The interior was even more rustic than the outside, with the log walls, pinewood floors, and a rock fireplace along one wall. It had a musty, unused odor, and no kitchen or bathroom, just an old wooden table and chairs, a couple more chairs by the fireplace and a double bed along the opposite wall.</p><p>Tucker had told Richard before they left that Kevin had never been one for roughing it. He frowned now and crossed his arms. \u201cNot exactly the Taj Mahal, I see. And where the fuck are you going to sleep? That bed is only big enough for me.\u201d</p><p>Richard ignored him, stepping around him to throw his backpack on the bed and then moving around the room, opening windows to air the place out. He went over to a chest by the foot of the bed and pulled out some clean sheets for the bed and threw them at Kevin, who barely got his arms up in time.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to check the perimeter for any signs they might have been here. Put the sheets on the bed and build a fire while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWait a minute. You\u2019re taking the four-wheeler? When are you coming back?\u201d Richard heard a tone of whininess in Kevin\u2019s voice that made him smile. He hid it before he turned back to him. It would do Kevin good to feel a little off kilter and out of his element, and make him rely on Richard just that much more. He wanted him to let down that rigid guard of his.</p><p>Richard grinned at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have no intention of leaving you here alone, though it might do you some good. Make you realize how nice things are at the lodge you\u2019re always complaining about. I\u2019ll be back in probably twenty or thirty minutes. Now make the bed and start a fire, like I told you.\u201d He turned and left just in time to miss the sheets that hit the door behind him, along with what sounded like a chunk of wood from the fireplace. He chuckled as he went down the steps.</p><p>He drove back down the trail about a quarter of a mile before parking the vehicle on the side of the road and checking the perimeter of the cabin on foot. Looking for any signs the missing guard could have been there, it didn\u2019t take too long to discover no one had been in the area recently. He hadn\u2019t thought they would come here, or he\u2019d never have brought Kevin along with him. The hunting cabin was too well known and was used far too frequently for them to use it, but he needed to be sure. Also, he wanted to spend some time with Kevin. Tucker told him of Kevin\u2019s unsettled mood. It was time for Richard to claim his mate.</p><p>As the light waned, a breeze began to pick up and the evening turned cool. Knowing his boy would be getting nervous, he drove back along the trail and saw Kevin sitting on the rock steps out front. He crossed his ankles and leaned against the railing as Richard drove into the clearing, probably trying to appear casual and unconcerned. Richard got off the atv and came toward him, stopping when he reached the bottom of the steps. His gaze roamed over Kevin\u2019s body before he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t see any smoke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you actually expect me to start a fire? Who do you think I am, Paul Bunyan?\u201d</p><p>Richard stood regarding him for a few moments. The evening was quiet around them, the only sound was the water splashing over the rocks by the stream. He could tell it was getting late, though it stayed light until late in the evening this time of year. Kevin shifted nervously and spoke again to fill the silence.</p><p>\u201cWhat is there about me that would give you the idea I could start a fire without matches? Or at all, for that matter. I\u2019m a Florida boy. We don\u2019t have a lot of fireplaces or any need for them.\u201d</p><p>Richard didn\u2019t reply, just walked past him into the cabin. Kevin followed him inside and stood behind him at the fireplace, watching him as he carefully stacked his wood. He put some smaller pieces underneath the stack and then stood up and opened a drawer in the small table by the fireplace, extracting a box of matches, which he held up and shook mockingly. He lit one, touched it to the kindling and carefully poked at it for a few seconds until it caught up. He stood up and faced Kevin. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to learn how any younger, you know. It isn\u2019t brain surgery.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, who says I want to learn anyway?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard crossed the room and sank down on the side of the bed. \u201cWhy are you acting like this, Kevin? Trying to prove something to me or to yourself? Or are you asking me to do something about it?\u201d</p><p>Kevin clenched his fists. \u201cYou go to hell.\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled. \u201cGet down on your hands and knees. Your ass toward me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? So you can bully me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour choice, baby\u2014the easy way or the hard way?\u201d</p><p>Kevin hesitated for a long moment while Richard held his breath. It was a total bluff, not because he couldn\u2019t easily handle the smaller man, but because he didn\u2019t want an unwilling partner. He believed Kevin needed this, and had been asking for it all day, but he had to make sure. Then with only a trace of hesitation, Kevin turned his back and dropped to his knees between the bed and the table.</p><p>Just because he\u2019d obeyed didn\u2019t mean he was happy about it. Every muscle in Kevin\u2019s body was tense and resistant, and he glanced back over his shoulder at Richard and literally snarled at him.</p><p>Richard smiled, liking the challenge. He sat on the bed for a few more seconds, deciding how to proceed until Kevin growled again. \u201cDamn it, do something. Do you expect me to stay here all night?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOnly if I tell you to,\u201d he replied. He gave him a hard smack on his ass. \u201cNow shut up like a good boy.\u201d</p><p>Richard stood up and opened his backpack, pulling out a pair of leather cuffs. He walked around to stand in front of Kevin. The second he caught sight of them, he immediately balked, as Richard thought he would. \u201cHell no, Richard.\u201d</p><p>Richard had already decided he wasn\u2019t about to give him a choice. Kevin needed someone to take his choices away. \u201cGive me your wrists,\u201d Richard said softly.</p><p>\u201cNot going to happen.\u201d</p><p>Richard leaned over and slapped his ass again, hard enough to make him jump. \u201cAre you done? Because we can do this all night if you want to.\u201d Kevin pressed his lips together and looked up at him through a fringe of hair, and the sight of Kevin on his knees in front of him, that sultry, sullen look on his face lit a fire in Richard\u2019s groin. When he lowered his eyes again, Richard knew they were almost there.</p><p>Richard pulled Kevin\u2019s wrists up and over toward the table leg. He wrapped the cuffs around the table leg and then attached them to his wrists. Kevin could move up and down the leg, but he wasn\u2019t going anywhere else. The table was old, but heavy, made of solid chunks of wood. He watched while Kevin struggled with the idea for a moment, even trying to lever the table up with his shoulder. He could move it, but couldn\u2019t get it off the floor far enough. When he realized he was securely shackled there until Richard decided to let him go, he pulled hard at the cuffs, getting angry. \u201cLet me go, Richard.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Breathing hard, he turned to look at him. \u201cPlease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBegging won\u2019t help, baby. You have some apologies to make and a few lessons to learn first.\u201d</p><p>He came around behind Kevin and jerked him effortlessly to his knees with one hand while the other pushed his shorts down past his knees. He pulled them off all the way, then, leaving him naked below the waist. He took some lube from his back pack and laid it on the floor beside Kevin while he stripped off his own clothes. Still on his knees, Kevin turned to watch him uneasily. \u201cI don\u2019t want this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me to stop. One word and it\u2019s over. Is that what you want, baby?\u201d</p><p>Kevin turned his head back around, biting on his lower lip. Richard grabbed his chin and turned his face around. \u201cWant me to stop?\u201d</p><p>Kevin blew out a long breath. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me how sorry you are for being such a smartass all day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbled.</p><p>\u201cAnd for throwing things at me and not even trying to start a fire?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m sorry, all right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow tell me why you did it.\u201d</p><p>He raised his head, a look of confusion on his face. \u201cWhat? I don\u2019t know...I just...\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was mad, all right?\u201d The sullen, belligerent look was back on his face.</p><p>\u201cBecause you thought I wasn\u2019t giving you enough of my time? Because you wanted my attention, but you didn\u2019t know how to ask me for it?\u201d He splashed some lube over himself. Putting more on both his hands, he wrapped one hand around Kevin\u2019s dick, slowly stroking it from the base to the head, while the other hand went to his crease.</p><p>Kevin cried out with the overload of sensations, and another look of confusion swept over his face. \u201cI...I don\u2019t know. Please. Please, Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease what, baby? That\u2019s it, isn\u2019t it? Because you can\u2019t ask me, can you? That would be admitting you like what I do to you. You like the idea of being under my control. Despite everything, you like it all. Being dominated. Feeling like you have no choice. Feeling like I was neglecting you if I didn\u2019t have you under me. You want me to pay attention to you. You want me to fuck you and take all your choices away, kind of like now, don\u2019t you? That way you\u2019re not to blame for any of it. You\u2019re not staying with me because you want to, but because I\u2019m making you, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d His hand was moving faster, up and down his rigid shaft. Richard bent over and bit him gently on his shoulder, at the same time inhaling that perfect scent. Pleasure and pain, that\u2019s what Kevin wanted, and that\u2019s what he\u2019d give him.</p><p>Richard was dragging an orgasm out of him, and Kevin threw his head back against his shoulder, groaning and breathing fast. \u201cThen you can go back to your life in Florida and play it safe. You can pretend you like to top all the time, and pretend you\u2019re independent and don\u2019t need anybody. Don\u2019t need me, more than you need to breathe.\u201d He\u2019d been jacking Kevin hard and now he gave a final twist while sticking a finger up his ass and finding his prostate. Kevin screamed and came so hard he was left shaking and trembling in Richard\u2019s grasp.</p><p>Before he had time to recover, Richard bent him back over on his knees, pushing him down on his elbows, so his ass was right where he wanted it. He entered in one thrust, making Kevin cry out again as he buried himself up to his knot. He put his hand under Kevin\u2019s body and found his softened cock and wrapped his hand around it again, moving the skin up and down, probably painfully now since Kevin had just come. He whimpered, but Richard ignored him. \u201cYou almost admitted it to me once,\u201d he said, whispering in Kevin\u2019s ear. \u201cYou told me you liked it rough. Is this rough enough for you, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, please, Richard.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAdmit it to me first. Admit you like this. For once and for all, tell the damn truth.\u201d</p><p>Kevin groaned and started to sob, and Richard knew he was close to finally admitting it, finally asking for what he needed without shame or guilt. \u201cYes,\u201d he whimpered. And then louder, \u201cYes, I need this. I need you. Please.\u201d</p><p>Richard thrust hard into him then, over and over until they both came. Afterward, while the aftershocks still shook them both, he lay on top of Kevin and stroked his back, trying to catch his breath. He reached up and released the cuffs and pulled him into his arms. He came willingly, wrapping his arms around Richard\u2019s waist, and hooking a leg over his, pressing his whole body close.</p><p>When he could talk again, Richard murmured in his ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to mate with you now, Kevin. Are you ready to give yourself to me?\u201d</p><p>Kevin nodded, burrowing his face into his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cYou know what this means? It\u2019s forever, and I\u2019ll never let you go. You\u2019ll live as long as I do, and you\u2019ll drink my blood from time to time to stay healthy, but that means you can never leave me. We\u2019ll always be together from this point on. You understand?\u201d He pulled Kevin\u2019s face away from his shoulder and stared down at him. His face was smooth and relaxed, and he looked more at peace than Richard had ever seen him.</p><p>\u201cI understand,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>\u201cThank you for giving yourself to me, Kevin. I look on it as a precious gift, and I\u2019ll try never to betray your trust.\u201d He kissed him tenderly and held him close for a while. But he was unable to wait much longer. He\u2019d waited so long already for this time to come.</p><p>Richard stood up and carried him to the bed. Knowing Kevin was already stretched from their lovemaking, he still lubed him well, and then, turning him over on his side, he sank his teeth deeply into Kevin\u2019s neck, causing him to cry out again. He entered him before his cries died out, easing his way in at first, and then as he met resistance to the knot, pushing harder, maneuvering his hips until he felt it slip in. Kevin gave a hoarse shout and began to have another orgasm immediately, due to the chemicals secreted by the knot and the stimulation to his prostate. Holding and petting him through it, Richard settled himself for a long night.</p><p>The knot would tie them together for at least an hour or more while Kevin had multiple orgasms. He\u2019d be in heat even after it was over, and he\u2019d have to be patient with him and love him through it. Richard would only be able to hold him close and soothe him. He kissed the back of Kevin\u2019s neck again and held him tightly in his arms, shuddering a little at the realization of how much he meant to him. Kevin held more power over him than he could ever dream of.</p><p>Richard would care for him always, just like he would tonight. Because he\u2019d finally found his home again, and from this time on, neither of them would ever be alone.</p><p>Epilogue</p><p>Sitting on the edge of the little stream, Kevin laughed as he saw Richard\u2019s gaze shift toward him and held up both hands. \u201cNo, please, don\u2019t even think of pulling me in. It\u2019s too cold!\u201d</p><p>Richard smiled at him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I have no intention of scaring away the fish.\u201d He held up a string of trout. \u201cAlthough, I probably do have enough for dinner tonight.\u201d He waggled his eyebrows up and down and came toward him, but Kevin jumped up and ran up the bank.</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d he pleaded, his back against a big tree. \u201cThese are the only dry clothes I have left.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Richard came up and put his arms around Kevin\u2019s waist, burying his face against his neck. \u201cMmm, but who said anything about you wearing clothes? I think they\u2019re highly overrated in your case.\u201d</p><p>Kevin distracted him by catching his chin and bringing his face around for a soulful kiss. \u201cIf you don\u2019t throw me in, there might be a blow job in your future.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh yeah?\u201d He swung him up in his arms and started for the stream. \u201cCan we firm that offer up a little bit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, yes, okay! Definitely a blow job!\u201d</p><p>Richard laughed again and sat down with him in his lap. He pulled him around to straddle him. \u201cStill sore, baby?\u201d</p><p>Kevin dropped his gaze. \u201cOnly a little.\u201d It had been two days since their mating, and for most of the day before, he\u2019d been a little out of his head as the chemicals from the bite and the knot worked their way through his body. He remembered only snatches of the time, but what he did remember made him blush. He remembered begging to be fucked, begging to suck Richard\u2019s cock, and feeling absolutely insatiable. This morning when he\u2019d awakened, he was feeling almost back to normal, though his ass ached abominably and Richard had heated up water from the stream and made him sit in it and soak for a while before putting a soothing cream on him. He\u2019d been embarrassed beyond belief, but felt cared for and cherished at the same time.</p><p>\u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d he asked quietly, running his fingers down Richard\u2019s jawline.</p><p>\u201cWell, if you agree, we\u2019ll go back to your home long enough for you to resign and decide what to do about your condo. You\u2019ll need to decide what you want to bring with you, and we can get you moved into my quarters in the lodge. We\u2019ll decide about your car too, and then if you want to sell them, we can open you an account at the bank in Sylva. I think that\u2019s what Tucker\u2019s going to do. He still likes the idea of having his own money, though he doesn\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like the idea too, at least for now. I might need it one day to open a business with Tucker, or even take care of my parents later on.\u201d</p><p>Richard nodded, and started kissing up the side of his neck. Since that was bound to get out of hand pretty quickly, and Kevin still had things to talk about, he pulled away and put his hands on Richard\u2019s shoulders. \u201cAnd a commitment ceremony like Tucker\u2019s? Will we have one of those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly like Tucker\u2019s ceremony\u2014not nearly so formal. That\u2019s for the alphas really. We\u2019ll definitely have one, only not so elaborate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. I like that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u201d He leaned in for another kiss, but Kevin stopped him again.</p><p>\u201cWhat about the guards? Will you have to go away and search for them?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot me personally. The three packs are forming a search party to look for them. Normally, we\u2019d only banish them for wrongdoing, but this is more serious. They seem to have a grudge not only against our pets but against humans. We can\u2019t let that slide. We\u2019ll have to hunt them down and exterminate them.\u201d</p><p>Kevin shivered briefly, and Richard wrapped his arms more tightly around him. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing for you to worry about now, baby. I\u2019ll always take care of you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, I can take care of myself, and you too, if you give me back my gun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDuly noted. I\u2019ll see you get it back right away. It would be good for Tucker to carry his too, until we can get this under control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd just one more little item to clear up...\u201d</p><p>Richard rolled his eyes. \u201cAre you always going to be this much of a pain in the ass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProbably, yes. But don\u2019t change the subject. I want to know what you meant before we came up to the cabin about not being so sure you wanted to go through with our mating either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you remember that, huh? It\u2019s the bloodmatch thing, baby.\u201d Stroking Kevin\u2019s arm, Richard got a distant look in his eyes. \u201cI lost my first mate, and I don\u2019t think I could survive it again. The pain was like nothing I\u2019ve ever felt before or since. If anything ever happened to you...I couldn\u2019t go through it again, and that scares the hell out of me.\u201d He looked so sad that Kevin squeezed him a little to remind him he wasn\u2019t alone anymore and that Kevin was right there with him. He nuzzled his face in Richard\u2019s neck.</p> <p>\u201cIt scares the hell out of me, too, but what\u2019s the alternative? To go through life never having what we really need because we\u2019re afraid to take a chance? That\u2019s what I was doing, and I wouldn\u2019t ever go back to that again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou deserve to be happy, baby,\u201d Richard said, kissing him gently on his forehead.</p><p>Kevin grinned at him, and put his hands on Richard\u2019s zipper, slowly unzipping his jeans. \u201cYou know what? I think we both do.\u201d</p><p>The shadows lengthened by the little stream, but Kevin couldn\u2019t be bothered to notice much. His only thought was that, just like in the story the old woman had told the night of the blue moon, neither of them would ever have to spend the night alone again. And that was the last rational thought he had for a long, long time.</p><p>*THE END* </p> </body></html>"]
