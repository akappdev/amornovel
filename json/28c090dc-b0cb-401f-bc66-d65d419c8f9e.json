Gracie Landon, is that you?\u201d</p><p>Trapped, standing in the middle of her mother\u2019s front lawn, a newspaper in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other, Gracie Landon glanced longingly toward the escape that was the front door.</p><p>In theory, she could bolt for freedom, but that would mean being rude to Eunice Baxter, neighbor and octogenarian. And Gracie had been raised better than that.</p> <p>She pushed her sleep-smashed hair out of her face and shuffled in her younger sister\u2019s Tweetie Bird slippers over to the low wood fence that separated the Landon property from Eunice Baxter\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cMorning, Mrs. Baxter,\u201d she said, hoping she sounded cheerful instead of trapped. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy stars, so it is. I haven\u2019t seen you in forever, but I swear, I would have recognized you anywhere. How long has it been?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFourteen years.\u201d Half her life. She\u2019d been so hopeful that people would forget her.</p><p>\u201cWell, I\u2019ll be. You sure look pretty. When you left, and I mean this in the kindest way possible, you were a dreadfully ugly child. Even your poor mother used to worry that you wouldn\u2019t grow into your looks, but you did. You\u2019re as bright and shiny as a magazine cover model.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie didn\u2019t exactly want to reminisce about her homely period\u2014the one that had lasted for nearly six years. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, inching toward the porch.</p><p>Eunice poofed her shellacked helmet of curls, then tapped her chin. \u201cYou know, I was just talking about you to my friend Wilma. We were saying that young folks today don\u2019t know how to fall in love. Not like they used to in the movies, or like you did with Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. Not Riley. Anything but that. After all this time, couldn\u2019t her reputation as a young, crazed teenaged stalker be put to rest?</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t exactly love him,\u201d Gracie said, wondering why she\u2019d agreed to come home after all this time. Oh, yeah, right. Her baby sister\u2019s wedding.</p><p>\u201cYou were a testament to true love,\u201d Eunice told her. \u201cYou should be proud. You loved that boy with all your heart and you weren\u2019t afraid to show it. That takes a special kind of courage.\u201d</p><p>Or insanity, she thought as she smiled weakly. Poor Riley. She\u2019d made his life a living hell.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that reporter fellow wrote about you in the town newspaper so everyone knew your story,\u201d Eunice added. \u201cYou were famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore like infamous,\u201d Gracie muttered, remembering the humiliation of reading about her crush on Riley over breakfast.</p><p>\u201cWilma\u2019s favorite is the time you nailed his girlfriend\u2019s doors and windows shut so she couldn\u2019t get out for their date. That\u2019s a good one, but my favorite is the time you laid down right in front of his car right there.\u201d Eunice pointed to the bit of road in front of her house.</p><p>\u201cI saw the whole thing. You told him you loved him too much to let him marry Pam and if he was going to go ahead with the engagement, he should just run you over and put you out of your misery.\u201d</p><p>Gracie held in a groan. \u201cYeah, that was a good one.\u201d</p><p>Why was the rest of the world allowed to live down their childhood humiliations but everyone wanted to talk about hers?</p><p>\u201cI guess I sort of owe Riley an apology.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s back in town,\u201d Eunice said brightly. \u201cDid you know?\u201d</p> <p>As pretty much everyone she\u2019d run into in the past couple of days had made it a point to tell her, yes. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>The old woman winked. \u201cHe\u2019s single again. What about you, Gracie? Anyone special in your life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I\u2019m very busy with my work right now and...\u201d</p><p>Eunice nodded knowingly. \u201cIt\u2019s fate. That\u2019s what it is. You two have been brought together to be given a second chance.\u201d</p><p>Gracie knew she would rather be staked out naked on a fire ant hill than ever have anything to do with Riley Whitefield again. She didn\u2019t need any more humiliation where he was concerned. And who knew what tortures he would be willing to endure to avoid the likes of her?</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s really nice, but I don\u2019t think I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cCould be he\u2019s still sweet on you,\u201d Eunice said.</p><p>Gracie laughed. \u201cMrs. Baxter, he was terrified of me. If he saw me now, he\u2019d run screaming in the opposite direction.\u201d Honestly, who could blame him?</p><p>\u201cSometimes a man needs a little push.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes a man needs to be left alone.\u201d</p><p>Which was exactly what she intended to do. No more running after Riley. In fact, she planned to avoid any functions where he might be. And if they did happen to bump into each other, she would be cool, polite and distant. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t even recognize him. Whatever feelings she\u2019d once had for Riley were gone. Dead and buried. She was way over him.</p><p>Besides, she was a different woman now. Gracious. Mature. No more stalker girl for her.</p><p>\u201cWHO WAS THAT?\u201d Vivian asked when Gracie walked into the Landon family kitchen. \u201cDid Mrs. Baxter trap you into talking to her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d Gracie put the paper on the counter and took a long drink of coffee. \u201cI swear, it\u2019s as if I just left town last week instead of fourteen years ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime is different for old people,\u201d Vivian said as she shook back her cascade of strawberry-blond curls and yawned. \u201cFor one thing, they get up too early. Mom was out of here before seven this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe said something about a special Saturday sale at the store.\u201d Gracie slid onto a stool in front of the counter and set down her mug. \u201cWhich you\u2019re supposed to be helping with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Vivian stretched. \u201cIt\u2019s my own fault for picking out a three-thousand-dollar wedding dress. My choices were to either blow the budget on that and have nothing for the guests to eat, or chip in.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAt least I\u2019m getting a fabulous wedding cake for free.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky you.\u201d</p><p>As a sister of the bride, Gracie had volunteered one of her masterpieces for the reception. She eyed the calendar tacked up on the wall. The wedding was exactly five weeks from today. A smarter woman would have hidden out until the last minute, then shown up with the cake, enjoyed the celebration and left. But frantic phone calls from their mother, Vivian and Alexis, their other sister, had churned up enough guilt in Gracie\u2019s acid-prone stomach that she\u2019d agreed to come home to help with the planning.</p><p>Her reward was baking all the cakes she had on order in a strange oven she wasn\u2019t sure she trusted and being tortured by old ladies who insisted on talking about Gracie\u2019s questionable past love life.</p><p>\u201cNot my idea of a good time,\u201d she mumbled into her coffee.</p><p>Vivian grinned. \u201cDid Mrs. Baxter mention that Riley Whitefield is back in town?\u201d</p><p>Gracie glared at her. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to be somewhere?\u201d</p><p>Vivian laughed as she raced toward the stairs.</p><p>Gracie watched her go, then opened the newspaper and prepared for a quiet morning. That afternoon she would be moving into the house she\u2019d rented for the six weeks she would be in town, but until then, there was nothing to occupy her time except\u2014</p><p>The back door burst open.</p><p>\u201cOh, good. You\u2019re up.\u201d Alexis, Gracie\u2019s older sister by three years, glanced around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Vivian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGetting ready to go to the hardware store.\u201d</p><p>Alexis frowned. \u201cI thought she\u2019d be gone already. Doesn\u2019t the sidewalk sale start at eight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue,\u201d Gracie admitted.</p><p>She\u2019d been home all of two days and was still finding her bearings. While Alexis and Vivian had grown up in this house, Gracie had left the summer she turned fourteen and had never been back.</p><p>Alexis poured herself a cup of coffee and took the stool next to Gracie\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk,\u201d her older sister said in a low voice that shook slightly. \u201cBut you can\u2019t tell Vivian. Or Mom. I don\u2019t want them to worry. Not when they already have the wedding to deal with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Gracie said slowly, knowing there was no point in asking if everything was all right. If things were all right, Alexis wouldn\u2019t be here demanding promises of confidentiality or looking panicked.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Zeke,\u201d Alexis said, then pressed her lips together. \u201cDammit, I told myself I wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><p>Gracie tensed. Zeke and Alexis had been married for five years\u2014happily from all accounts.</p><p>Alexis sucked in a breath, then let it out. \u201cI think he\u2019s having an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? That\u2019s not possible. He\u2019s crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought so, too.\u201d Alexis brushed her free hand across her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just....\u201d She paused as they heard thumping noises from overhead. \u201cHe disappears every night and doesn\u2019t get back until three or four in the morning. When I ask him to tell me what\u2019s going on, he says he\u2019s working late on the campaign. But I don\u2019t believe him.\u201d</p><p>Gracie carefully closed the newspaper. \u201cWhat campaign? Doesn\u2019t Zeke sell insurance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, but he\u2019s running Riley Whitefield\u2019s campaign for mayor. I thought you knew.\u201d</p><p>Gracie was more out of the loop than she\u2019d realized. \u201cWhen did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few months ago. He hired Zeke because\u2014\u201d</p><p>Footsteps thundered on the stairs. Seconds later Vivian burst into the kitchen.</p><p>\u201cHey, Alexis,\u201d she said as she fastened her long hair into a braid. \u201cWant to take my place at the store today?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>Vivian grinned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. I\u2019m off to do slave labor to pay for my wedding dress. Don\u2019t have too much fun while I\u2019m gone.\u201d</p><p>The back door slammed shut behind her. A minute later, a car engine started, sputtered, then caught.</p><p>Alexis walked to the window over the sink and stared out toward the street. \u201cOkay, she\u2019s gone. Where were we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were telling me that your husband now works for Riley Whitefield. How did that happen?\u201d</p><p>\u201cZeke spent two years after college working for a senator from Arizona.\u201d Her worry faded a little as she faced Gracie and smiled. \u201cI was at Arizona State and he...\u201d Alexis shook her head. \u201cGod, that was a lifetime ago. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019d do this to me. I love him so much and I th-thought....\u201d Her voice cracked. \u201cWhat am I going to do?\u201d</p><p>Gracie had the uneasy sensation of being trapped in the middle of a fun house. Nothing was as it seemed and she didn\u2019t know her way out.</p><p>Sure, Alexis and Vivian were her sisters. Her family. They looked enough alike that no one could mistake the genetic connection. Long blond hair\u2014pale for Alexis, strawberry for Vivian and gold for herself\u2014big blue eyes and the same average body build. But she\u2019d been doing this sister thing long distance for half her life. She didn\u2019t know how to slide back into confidences and advice mode without a little warm-up.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know for sure Zeke is doing anything,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cMaybe it is the campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I intend to find out.\u201d She took a step forward.</p><p>Gracie got a bad feeling in her already queasy stomach. \u201cI\u2019m going to hate myself for asking, but how?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy spying on him. He\u2019s supposed to have a meeting with Riley tonight and I\u2019m going to be there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot the best idea in the world,\u201d Gracie said as she reached for her coffee. \u201cTrust me. I speak from experience. Riley experience.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to do it,\u201d Alexis said, her eyes filling with tears, \u201cand I need your help.\u201d</p><p>Gracie set down her coffee cup. \u201cNo. No. Alexis, I can\u2019t. You can\u2019t. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Tears trickled down her sister\u2019s cheeks. Pain darkened her blue eyes. Alexis personified agony and Gracie didn\u2019t know how to fight that. But she tried.</p><p>\u201cIt will only lead to disaster,\u201d she said firmly. \u201cI won\u2019t be a part of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI u-understand,\u201d Alexis said as her mouth quivered.</p> <p>\u201cGood. Because I\u2019m not going with you.\u201d</p><p>LATE THAT NIGHT, Gracie found herself following her sister along a trimmed hedge just east of a massive old house. Not just any house, either. The Whitefield family mansion, home to umpteen generations of wealthy Whitefields and now Riley\u2019s main residence.</p><p>\u201cThis is insane,\u201d Gracie whispered to her sister as they paused to crouch a few feet from a back window. \u201cI stopped spying on Riley when I was fourteen. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not spying on Riley, you\u2019re spying on Zeke. There\u2019s a big difference.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt Riley will see that, if we\u2019re caught.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen we won\u2019t be caught. Did you bring your camera?\u201d</p><p>Gracie grabbed her trusty Polaroid from under her arm and held it out. Light from the streetlamp glinted off the narrow lens.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cThe library window is around the corner. You should be able to get a really good picture from there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting the picture?\u201d Gracie asked as dread made her legs feel as heavy as bronze.</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to stay here and see if any floozy bitch runs out the back way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf Zeke were having an affair, wouldn\u2019t he just go to a motel?\u201d Gracie asked.</p> <p>\u201cHe can\u2019t. I pay the bills. Besides, when we were dating, he let some guy use his apartment for a lunchtime rendezvous. I\u2019m telling you, Riley\u2019s doing the same for Zeke. Who holds campaign meetings until two in the morning?\u201d</p><p>It sounded logical in a twisted psychotic way, Gracie thought as she inched toward the side of the house. Especially if one ignored the reality of sneaking onto private property to snap pictures through an open window.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re in the library,\u201d Gracie said in a low voice.</p><p>\u201cZeke says they always meet there. If he\u2019s really at a campaign meeting, that\u2019s where it should take place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I just look through the window and tell you what I see?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cI want proof.\u201d</p><p>What Gracie wanted was to be far, far from here. But she recognized Alexis\u2019s stubborn expression and her own guilt. Even if she wanted to turn her back on her sister, she couldn\u2019t. Better to simply take the pictures and get out than stay crouched and arguing.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Gracie said as she once again moved toward the house.</p> <p>The bushes under the building were thicker than they first appeared. They scratched her bare arms and tugged at her khakis. Worse, the library window was higher than her, which meant she had to hold the camera above her head, point down into the room and take a picture without being sure what, or who, was in there.</p><p>It would just be her luck to focus the camera just as someone looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cHere goes nothing,\u201d she muttered as she stretched up on tiptoes and pushed the red button.</p><p>Hot, bright light exploded in the night. Gracie instantly dropped to her knees as she swore under her breath. The flash! How could she have forgotten about the flash?</p><p>\u201cBecause I use the camera to take pictures of wedding cakes, not to spy on people,\u201d she muttered as she scrambled back to her feet and started running toward the car.</p><p>There was no sign of Alexis, nor did Gracie know if she\u2019d actually gotten a picture of anything. Not that it mattered. She just wanted to get out of here before\u2014</p><p>\u201cFreeze!\u201d</p><p>As the forceful command was accompanied by something hard and very gunlike being jabbed between her shoulder blades, Gracie did as instructed. She froze.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell are you up to? If you\u2019re a thief, you\u2019re a piss-poor one. Or do you always announce yourself with a flashbulb?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot if I can help it,\u201d Gracie said as she sucked in a breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I startled you. I can explain.\u201d</p><p>As she spoke, she turned, and as she turned she saw the man holding the shotgun and he saw her.</p><p>Both of them jumped back. While Gracie wished the ground would open up and swallow her, he looked as if he\u2019d seen a ghost.</p><p>\u201cSweet Jesus,\u201d Riley Whitefield breathed. \u201cGracie Landon, is that you?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>AS THE GROUND-SWALLOWING was taking too long, Gracie began to wish for a large, people-eating dinosaur to rise from the grave and devour her whole. Or aliens. She would accept aliens swooping her up into their visiting craft if she didn\u2019t have to stand here and stare at Riley\u2019s gorgeous face. She would even endure the medical experiments without complaining.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t seen him since the summer she\u2019d turned fourteen. He\u2019d been all of eighteen, caught in that half-boy, half-man stage that was both appealing and awkward. He\u2019d grown up, filled out and gotten sexier and more dangerous looking. But the disbelief in his eyes made her want to die right there on the spot.</p><p>\u201cI can explain,\u201d she said, then wondered if she really could. Were there any words that would convince him she wasn\u2019t still crazed stalker girl recently released from a mental institution?</p><p>\u201cGracie Landon?\u201d he repeated.</p><p>She noticed he\u2019d lowered the shotgun so it wasn\u2019t pointing directly at her. That was something.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what you think,\u201d she said and took a step back. Maybe it would be better for both of them if she just disappeared into the night. And where was her sister? How just like Alexis to fade away when the going got tough. She\u2019d always let Gracie take the fall for things.</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t lurking outside my house, taking pictures?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cOkay, yes, I was doing that, but it wasn\u2019t about you. Not technically.\u201d</p><p>His eyes were the color of stormy midnight. At least that\u2019s how she\u2019d described them when she was a teenager. She\u2019d written really bad haiku about his eyes and his mouth. She\u2019d imagined how he would kiss her when he finally came to his senses and realized they belonged together. She\u2019d even written poems to his various girlfriends\u2014after he\u2019d dumped them\u2014commiserating with their pain.</p><p>Yes, my dear Jenny, I alone can understand, the magic of the moment, when he takes your hand.</p><p>Gracie placed her palm on her stomach where she could feel the acid churning. Most days she couldn\u2019t remember where she\u2019d left her car keys, but she could recall lines of horrible poetry written a lifetime ago?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something seriously wrong with me,\u201d she muttered.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll second that,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>She narrowed her gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re not helping the situation. You know that? I know this looks bad, but here\u2019s a news flash. I\u2019m not here for you. My brother-in-law, Zeke, is supposed to be helping you with your campaign for mayor tonight. That\u2019s what this is all about.\u201d She waved the camera in his face.</p><p>He frowned. \u201cYou have a thing for your brother-in-law?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she yelped. \u201cNo. Yuck. Of course not. My sister, Alexis, asked me to\u2014\u201d She pressed her lips together and turned away and started for the car\u2014assuming Alexis hadn\u2019t driven off in it after slinking away. \u201cJust forget it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d Riley said as he grabbed her arm. \u201cYou can\u2019t show up like this, take pictures, then walk away. How do I know you haven\u2019t put a bomb in my car?\u201d</p><p>Gracie jerked free of his grip, then squared her shoulders before turning around to face him. \u201cI never tried to hurt you,\u201d she said as calmly as she could when what she wanted to do was run screaming into the night. This was so not fair. \u201cWhen I had a crush on you, I tried to keep you from seeing your girlfriend, but I never actually hurt anyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou threw yourself in front of my car and begged me to run over you.\u201d</p><p>Heat exploded in her cheeks. Why couldn\u2019t everyone just leave the past where it belonged? Why did every humiliating detail of her life have to be dissected in public?</p><p>\u201cThat was about my pain, not doing injury to you.\u201d She drew in a deep breath. Peaceful thoughts, she reminded herself. And a couple of antacids. That\u2019s all she needed. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to have bothered you. I\u2019m sorry I let my sister talk me into coming here. I knew it was a bad idea. It won\u2019t happen again. Whatever her problems with Zeke, I\u2019m not getting involved. Ever.\u201d</p><p>His gaze narrowed. \u201cWhat problems with Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s personal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, lady, the second you started taking pictures in my windows, it became my business.\u201d</p><p>He had a point. Not a very big one, but still...\u201cZeke has been acting funny\u2014staying out late, not talking about things. He says he\u2019s busy with your campaign all the time but Alexis thinks he\u2019s having an affair.\u201d</p><p>Riley swore and grabbed her arm again. \u201cAll right. Come on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet go of me.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t and he started walking, dragging her along with him.</p><p>\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cInside. We have to talk. If my campaign manager is cheating on his wife, I want to know about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think he is. He just doesn\u2019t seem the type. What time did your meeting with him end tonight?\u201d</p><p>Riley stopped on the front porch. Light from the big fixture by the front door illuminated his perfect features\u2014dark eyes, high cheekbones and the kind of mouth that made normally reasonable women want to run out and do something really, really sinful. He still wore an earring, but a diamond stud had replaced the gold hoop she remembered so well.</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have a meeting,\u201d he said flatly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Zeke in three days.\u201d</p><p>The churning got worse. Gracie pulled free of Riley\u2019s grip and rubbed her stomach. \u201cThat can\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy thoughts exactly. So come inside. I want you to start from the beginning and tell me everything you know about Zeke and his affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor one thing, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s even having one. Alexis could be overreacting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDoes she usually?\u201d he asked as he held open the front door and motioned for her to step inside.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Maybe. I live in L.A. I don\u2019t actually spend all that much time with her.\u201d</p><p>She walked into the house and came to a complete stop in the foyer. The place was huge. Old, but beautiful with high ceilings, carved moldings and enough furniture, knickknacks and artwork to monopolize an entire month of Antiques Roadshow.</p><p>\u201cWow. This is pretty cool,\u201d she said as she turned in a slow circle. \u201cI think my entire house would fit in the foyer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s big. The library\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>Once again he grabbed her arm and dragged her along. She caught a glimpse of a formal dining room and a parlor or living room before he pulled her into the library. He released her and walked to a liquor tray set up by the window. After setting the gun on the desk, he poured what looked like Scotch into two glasses. She set down her Polaroid.</p><p>\u201cLet me say for the record\u2014ouch,\u201d she said as she rubbed her arm again. \u201cI don\u2019t remember you manhandling women before.\u201d</p><p>He glared at her, then handed her a drink. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt was fourteen years ago, Riley. You really need to let go of the past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was happy to until you showed up again. You tortured me for two years. They wrote about it in the newspaper. The \u2018Gracie Chronicles.\u2019\u201d</p><p>Embarrassment made her want to squirm. \u201cYes, well, that part wasn\u2019t my fault. Can we talk about something more relevant? Like Zeke.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWhy does Alexis think he\u2019s having an affair?\u201d</p><p>Gracie shrugged. \u201cHe\u2019s coming home late and not saying where he\u2019s been.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow long has this been going on?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbout six weeks. At first she figured he really was working on the campaign, but the nights got later and later and when he wouldn\u2019t talk about what was going on....\u201d She stopped and glanced at him. \u201cWhy are you running for mayor? You don\u2019t strike me as the political type.\u201d</p><p>Riley ignored the question and pointed to her drink. \u201cDo you want something different?\u201d</p><p>Gracie sniffed the glass, then put it on the desk. \u201cNo, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s just stress makes my stomach unhappy.\u201d She pulled a roll of what looked like antacids from her pocket and popped a couple in her mouth. \u201cTerrific room.\u201d</p><p>Riley followed her gaze as she glanced at the twelve-foot-high bookcases filled to overflowing. He didn\u2019t bother telling her that the library was one of the few places he felt comfortable in the oversized house.</p><p>\u201cTell me about Zeke,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cYou tell me.\u201d She walked to the leather sofa across from the ornate fireplace and flopped down. \u201cHe\u2019s your campaign manager. Is he having an affair?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell if I know.\u201d Riley paced to the desk and leaned against it. \u201cHe talks about Alexis all the time. I would say he adores her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your meetings don\u2019t run until three in the morning.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m running for mayor, not president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I thought, too. Well, I guess I have to tell Alexis that he wasn\u2019t here. She\u2019s not going to like that.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t much like it, either. The election was only five weeks away and he couldn\u2019t afford a scandal. Not when he was finally making progress with the good citizens of Los Lobos.</p> <p>He set down his drink and tugged at the picture still hanging from the camera. After peeling off the protective layer, he stared at the Polaroid photo.</p><p>It showed the ceiling of the library and a few shelves, but nothing else.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very good at this,\u201d he told Gracie.</p><p>She rolled her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be. Despite what you think of me, I didn\u2019t grow up to be a spy or a professional stalker. I bake wedding cakes for a living.\u201d</p><p>She was annoyed and indignant, but also embarrassed. Color stained her cheeks and her bottom lip trembled slightly. She\u2019d grown up, filled out, but the basics were still the same. Big blue eyes, long gold-blond hair and an air of determination that had scared the bejesus out of him back then.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cFor this and for all that. You know. Before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre we talking about the itching powder in my boxer shorts?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I guess. I just....\u201d She leaned forward and traced a pattern on the coffee table in front of the sofa. \u201cLooking back, I can\u2019t believe what I did to you. It was horrible.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFolks around here are still talking about it.\u201d</p><p>She sat up and looked at him. \u201cTell me about it. Everyone else gets to leave their past behind, but not me. Noooo. I become a legend. I have to say, it seriously sucks.\u201d</p><p>He thought about the laxative she\u2019d managed to sneak into his soup the afternoon before the homecoming dance. \u201cYou were creative.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was a menace. I just wanted...\u201d Color flared again. \u201cWell, we both know what I wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDate much now?\u201d</p><p>She tossed her head. \u201cSome. I\u2019m careful not to bring them here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want them hearing about the time you lured a skunk into my car, then locked it inside for a couple of hours?\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI paid for the cleaning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy car was never the same. I had to sell it. At auction.\u201d He raised his glass to her. \u201cYou were hell-bent on breaking up me and Pam.\u201d Based on what had happened, maybe he should have listened.</p><p>Gracie\u2019s knowing expression had him thinking she would agree with his assessment. But instead of commenting on that she said, \u201cSo what happens next?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI find out what Zeke\u2019s up to. I don\u2019t need any trouble right now. Can you get your sister to back off until I have some concrete information?\u201d</p><p>When Gracie hesitated, he stared at her. \u201cYou owe me,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>She shivered. \u201cI know. Okay\u2014I\u2019ll do what I can with Alexis. But I can\u2019t promise more than a couple of days. She\u2019s a woman on a mission.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we all know what happens when you Landon women set your mind to something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She stood and looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Riley. I know the apology is about fourteen years too late, but I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I never meant to make your life hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want me to leave my cell number so you can get in touch with me about Zeke or do you want to call Alexis directly?\u201d</p><p>Riley decided on the devil he knew. \u201cYour number is fine.\u201d</p><p>He handed her a pad of paper. She quickly wrote on it and passed it back.</p><p>\u201cMy camera,\u201d she said.</p><p>He gave it to her.</p><p>\u201cHow long are you in town for?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cA few weeks. My younger sister, Vivian, is getting married. I\u2019m here to help out with all the details and to make the wedding cake. I rented a house at the edge of town. I need a kitchen to complete my other orders.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then turned the camera over in her hands as if she wanted to say something else. He waited, but she only shrugged, then walked toward the hallway.</p><p>He followed her to the front door. She stepped out into the night, then glanced back at him.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t wrong about Pam,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI should have listened.\u201d</p><p>Her lips curved up in a smile. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Even a blind squirrel finds an acorn sometimes, Gracie. Good night.\u201d</p><p>He closed the door, but didn\u2019t step away. Sure enough he heard a thud, as if she\u2019d just kicked the door.</p><p>\u201cThat was a low blow, Riley,\u201d she yelled. \u201cA real low blow.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything that had happened and everything he had yet to do, he found himself grinning as he returned to the library.</p><p>GRACIE FUMED as she stalked away from Riley\u2019s house. \u201cA blind squirrel,\u201d she muttered. \u201cMy opinion on Pam wasn\u2019t based on dumb luck. Talk about ungrateful. If he\u2019d listened to me, he wouldn\u2019t have married her in the first place. But no.\u201d</p><p>She stomped her foot once for good measure, then stopped on the sidewalk. No sign of Alexis or the car. While Los Lobos wasn\u2019t huge, the distance from the Whitefield manor side of town to her mother\u2019s more middle-class neighborhood would definitely qualify as a serious workout.</p><p>She turned left and started walking. The night was pleasantly cool with a hint of brine in the air. Even though she\u2019d been gone forever, the town felt familiar. She liked the closeness of the ocean and the quiet residential streets. She might live in a suburb back in Los Angeles, but it was a whole lot louder than this.</p><p>At the corner, she glanced back at Riley\u2019s house. He might have grown up poor, but he fit in there now. As she walked across the street, she smiled. Man oh man, had he looked good. She supposed she could take comfort in the fact that even at thirteen she\u2019d had fabulous taste in men. Riley had only gotten better with age. He had the brooding, dark, good looks of a fallen angel. An angel with a diamond stud earring.</p><p>Despite her shock and embarrassment at seeing him again, she\u2019d felt something. Sparks. Attraction. No doubt as completely one-sided as it had ever been, which meant she had to make sure she didn\u2019t even pretend to act on it. No way was she willing to be stalker girl again.</p><p>A car pulled up beside her. Gracie glanced over and saw Alexis\u2019s Camry. Her sister rolled down the window.</p><p>\u201cYou got away,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019m glad. Get in.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean I got away?\u201d Gracie asked as she opened the door and slid onto the passenger seat. \u201cWere you seriously concerned Riley would take me prisoner and torture me for information?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know what would happen. I can\u2019t believe your flash is that bright and loud.\u201d</p><p>Gracie glanced at her aging camera. \u201cMe, either. Guess it\u2019s really not what I should use for my undercover work.\u201d She returned her attention to her sister. \u201cYou left me back there. What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>Alexis hunched over the steering wheel. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I couldn\u2019t risk being caught.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, and I could? Do you have any idea what Riley thought when he found me lurking outside his windows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing he hasn\u2019t thought a million times before.\u201d</p><p>That hurt, Gracie thought. \u201cI would like everyone to remember I\u2019ve grown up since then.\u201d She sighed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I have the information you wanted.\u201d</p><p>Her sister looked at her. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI asked Riley about Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No!\u201d</p><p>Alexis slammed on the brakes, making Gracie grateful she\u2019d fastened her seat belt securely.</p><p>Gracie braced her hands against the dashboard. \u201cI talked to him about the problem. He has answers. Why is this a big deal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s private,\u201d Alexis shrieked. \u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone to know. It\u2019s family stuff and supposed to be a secret. Not that I would expect you to understand that.\u201d</p><p>Gracie flinched. She didn\u2019t know if her sister meant the family part or the secret part, and she wasn\u2019t sure it mattered.</p><p>\u201cYou dragged me into this,\u201d she reminded her sister. \u201cI went along to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just...\u201d Alexis sighed. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat to the best of his knowledge, Zeke loves and adores you. But he wasn\u2019t working on the campaign tonight.\u201d She thought about mentioning that Riley was going to talk to Zeke about his extracurricular activities but wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to hear the screeching again.</p><p>\u201cAnything else?\u201d</p><p>Gracie hesitated.</p><p>Alexis pulled up in front of the Landon family home and turned off the engine. \u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded.</p><p>\u201cRiley is going to talk to Zeke about where he goes.\u201d</p><p>Alexis dropped her head to the steering wheel and moaned. \u201cTell me you\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not, but it\u2019s not such a bad idea. You\u2019re not willing to talk to your husband about it and someone has to get the truth. Once you know he\u2019s not running around, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d Gracie touched her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cIf you\u2019d just talk to him yourself,\u201d she began.</p><p>Alexis opened the driver\u2019s door. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s not that simple. I\u2019m not sure I want to know what he\u2019s doing. If he is fooling around...\u201d She swallowed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to leave him, but I will.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t want to be having this conversation or any other, at the moment. She had only been home a couple of days and already a week of root canals seemed so much more pleasant.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait and find out the truth?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cGood point. I will. Are you coming in?\u201d Alexis jerked her head toward the house.</p><p>At this point Gracie was more than ready to escape to her rental, but she nodded and stepped out of the car. She would duck inside, yell out a greeting and leave. She could rationalize the decision by saying she had to unpack, but the truth was she wanted to be gone because she needed some distance. Too much family stuff too quickly, she thought. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They walked toward the house. As Alexis pulled open the front door, Gracie realized she could hear shouting inside.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cSounds like Vivian.\u201d Alexis shook her head. \u201cI hope the wedding isn\u2019t off again.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? Off?\u201d But before Gracie could press for details, her sister had stepped into the house. Gracie trailed after her.</p><p>Vivian stood in the center of the room, her face streaked with tears and bleeding mascara, her hands on her hips, her mouth petulant. Their mother sat on the sofa, several brides magazines open on the coffee table.</p><p>When she saw Gracie and Alexis, their baby sister sniffed. \u201cI hate Tom,\u201d she said defiantly. \u201cHe\u2019s selfish and mean and I\u2019m not going to marry him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you are,\u201d Alexis said soothingly. \u201cYou just had a fight. Now tell me what you were arguing about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe bachelor p-party,\u201d Vivian said over a sob. \u201cHe said I couldn\u2019t come. But if I\u2019m not there, how will I know what he\u2019s doing? I don\u2019t care about movies and drinking and stuff, but I don\u2019t want him to have s-strip-pers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDoes he want to?\u201d Alexis asked.</p><p>Vivian hiccupped. \u201cHe s-said it wasn\u2019t up to me. He s-said until we were married, he didn\u2019t have to do what I said.\u201d</p><p>Gracie wanted to be anywhere but here. She didn\u2019t know if she should simply excuse herself and make a quick dash for her car or pretend an urgent need to use the bathroom. Then she stunned herself by opening her mouth and talking.</p><p>\u201cDid you explain that your being at the bachelor party isn\u2019t so much about you telling him what to do as it is about making sure you can begin your marriage in a state of love and trust? I\u2019ve never understood the need for men, or women for that matter, to have a big party where plenty could go wrong that could potentially destroy the relationship they\u2019re trying to celebrate with a wedding.\u201d</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at her. Alexis shook her head, as if trying to discourage a not-very-bright child, her mother rose and walked over to Vivian who had started a fresh storm of sobbing.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no,\u201d Gracie murmured, feeling more out of place by the second.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be fine,\u201d her mother said as she pulled Vivian close. \u201cYou and Tom will talk in the morning and things will be better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI g-guess,\u201d Vivian mumbled against her mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI j-just want him to love me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course you do. It\u2019s all right. Everything will be all right.\u201d</p><p>Gracie waved toward the door. \u201cI should leave you to deal with this. I\u2019ll just be going.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood idea,\u201d her mother mouthed.</p><p>Gracie did her best not to feel as if she\u2019d made a difficult situation worse and headed back out into the night. She drove across town to her rental house and gratefully walked into the dark quiet.</p><p>A few clicks of light switches took care of the gloom and a glance around the kitchen restored her spirits.</p><p>She\u2019d already put away her special cooking pans, slipping the ones that wouldn\u2019t fit anywhere else into some open shelves meant for cookbooks. Her cooking schedule was magneted to the refrigerator and she\u2019d used poster tape to tack up her two-page spread from People magazine. The one with the headline What\u2019s Gracie\u2019s Secret?</p> <p>She crossed to it now and traced the picture of the popular sitcom star from Olive\u2019s Attic as she fed a piece of luscious Gracie-made wedding cake to her husband at the wedding. The second page showed several of Gracie\u2019s cakes, along with a picture of her carefully decorating one of them.</p><p>That was her world, she reminded herself. Her house in Torrance, her orders, her perfect kitchen with three full-sized ovens, built-in cooling racks and southern exposure. It was a world she understood\u2014where she was just Gracie. Not anyone\u2019s sister or daughter. She didn\u2019t mess up there. She didn\u2019t feel as if she didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>Had it been a mistake to try to come home? The decision had been made and there was no unmaking it.</p><p>\u201cJust a few weeks,\u201d she reminded herself. Then she could walk away from all of this and never look back.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>GRACIE WALKED into Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill promptly at noon only to find her friend Jill already seated and waving her in.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always early,\u201d Gracie said as she approached.</p><p>Jill stood and hugged her. \u201cI know. It\u2019s a disease. I\u2019m thinking I need a twelve-step program.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stepped back from her friend and looked her over. \u201cVery fabulous,\u201d she said. \u201cWould I recognize the designer?\u201d</p><p>Jill wiggled her hips as she turned in a slow circle, modeling her tailored shirt and trim pinstripe slacks before she took her seat.</p><p>\u201cArmani. I\u2019m still working through my big-city lawyer clothes. Tina, my assistant, keeps ragging on me about dressing too fancy for Los Lobos, but if I don\u2019t wear them to work, where will I?\u201d</p><p>Gracie sat next to Jill and fingered the sleeve of her silk blouse. \u201cI\u2019m guessing not for cleaning the bathroom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Jill leaned forward and grinned. \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you. It\u2019s been ages. What? Five months?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust about. We were last together at your wedding up in Carmel, where I have to say you were far more interested in the groom than in me. This despite the fact that I made you a pretty fabulous cake. What is up with that? I\u2019m your oldest and dearest friend. He\u2019s just some guy.\u201d</p><p>Jill laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s some guy. Some great, amazing, hunky\u2014\u201d</p><p>She broke off when the waitress approached to take their drink orders. Gracie asked for diet soda while Jill chose iced tea.</p><p>Her friend had changed, Gracie thought. In the past few years Jill had been on the legal fast track at a huge law firm in San Francisco. She\u2019d worn stiff suits, worked impossible hours and had tamed her fabulous curly hair into a sleek, painful bun at the nape of her neck. Now she looked...Gracie smiled. Soft. All feminine and comfortable in her skin. Long cascades of curls tumbled down Jill\u2019s back. The shadows were gone from under her eyes and she seemed to glow.</p><p>\u201cYou like married life,\u201d Gracie said.</p><p>\u201cI love it. Mac is amazing. I was a little nervous about being a stepmother, but Emily is wonderful and very patient with my mistakes. My only regret is that we have to share her with her real mom. I wouldn\u2019t mind having her around all the time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. That\u2019s so cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just how I feel. I adore them both.\u201d</p><p>Gracie grabbed Jill\u2019s left hand and studied the diamond ring guards surrounding an impressive solitaire.</p><p>\u201cI like a man who isn\u2019t intimidated by a good-sized rock,\u201d Gracie said with a grin.</p><p>\u201cMac knows how to do it right,\u201d Jill admitted. \u201cIn many ways.\u201d</p><p>Gracie held up both hands. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk about sex, I\u2019m not listening. I can be blissfully happy for your newly married self, your great husband and perfect stepchild. I won\u2019t even begrudge you a dog, but I draw the line at sex.\u201d</p><p>Jill patted her hand. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not getting any?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. David and I broke up three months ago and I haven\u2019t been inspired to start the whole dating nightmare again.\u201d</p><p>The waitress returned with their drinks and chips and salsa, then asked if they were ready to order.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s good?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cThey make a delicious taco salad,\u201d Jill said.</p><p>\u201cWorks for me.\u201d She had her antacids in her purse for the inevitable attack later.</p><p>\u201cMake it two,\u201d Jill told the waitress. \u201cThanks.\u201d She turned back to her friend. \u201cI thought you really liked David. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Nothing. Everything. He was great, but...\u201d She sighed. \u201cI want sparks. Is that so horrible? Not an actual fire event but a few singes would be nice. I want to be excited when I know I\u2019m going to see the guy I\u2019m with. I want to use words like amazing and heart-stopping, not nice or very pleasant. David was very pleasant. We got along. We never fought. We never...anything. How can I get serious about a guy when I barely notice if he\u2019s there or not?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDespite your earlier attachment to a man we will not name, you\u2019re not a drama queen,\u201d Jill said.</p><p>\u201cMaybe that\u2019s the problem. Maybe I\u2019m so concerned about reverting to stalker girl that I\u2019m not letting myself care about anyone.\u201d She picked up her drink. \u201cI could be a drama queen if I wanted.\u201d</p><p>Jill smiled. \u201cSure you could.\u201d</p><p>The idea had appeal, except Gracie knew that she actually preferred order in her world. Surprises were all good for presents, but in the rest of her life, she liked predictability. Which might explain a long series of really dull guys.</p><p>Besides...\u201cI think Vivian got all the drama queen genes in our family. She and Tom had a huge fight yesterday over the bachelor party and she was threatening to call off the wedding.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDo you think she will?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. But if she does, I\u2019m going to be very cranky about coming up here and renting a house for six weeks. I have orders lining up like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you would have stayed with your mom,\u201d Jill said. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you use her oven?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just the oven. It\u2019s the refrigerator and freezer, not to mention an entire dining room table for decorating and most of the cupboards for my supplies. Plus I like to stay up late and work. The cake part is easy\u2014it\u2019s the individual decorations that take forever.\u201d</p><p>What she didn\u2019t mention was how uncomfortable she felt in her mother\u2019s house. She hadn\u2019t lived there in so long, it had ceased to be home. She was trying to fit in and not doing a very good job of it so far.</p><p>\u201cIs it weird to be back?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>\u201cYes and no. I feel different, but no one sees me that way. I\u2019m still Gracie Landon\u2014in love with Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>Jill picked up her iced tea. \u201cYou know he\u2019s in town.\u201d</p><p>Gracie narrowed her gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t you start in on me. I\u2019ve already heard that from my mother\u2019s neighbor, my landlord, the clerk at the grocery store and some woman on the street whom I don\u2019t remember at all. It\u2019s more than scary\u2014it\u2019s a Twilight Zone moment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the articles in the newspaper,\u201d Jill said. \u201cEven people who\u2019d never met you felt they were a part of the romance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen him?\u201d</p><p>Gracie hesitated. She didn\u2019t know how to say she had without spilling Alexis\u2019s private business.</p><p>\u201cYou have!\u201d Jill leaned forward. \u201cI want to know everything. Start at the beginning and talk slowly.\u201d</p><p>Gracie sighed and picked up a chip. She turned it over then bit into it. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything,\u201d she told her friend when she\u2019d chewed and swallowed. \u201cI was checking out something for Alexis and no, I can\u2019t tell you what.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you ran into him at the store or something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly. I was sort of lurking around his house.\u201d</p><p>Jill\u2019s brown eyes widened. \u201cYou have to be kidding. You were spying on him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was spying on someone else. But he caught me and it was horrible and awkward and I think he\u2019s going to be getting a restraining order against me.\u201d</p><p>Jill grabbed a chip. \u201cWhat did you think? Isn\u2019t he still amazing looking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. Dark, brooding, dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSexy,\u201d Jill added. \u201cI love the earring. I tried to talk Mac into getting one, but he\u2019s pretty much ignoring me on that.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll admit the earring is appealing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd his butt. The man has a fabulous butt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t get a chance to check it out, but I\u2019ll put it on my to-do list.\u201d</p> <p>Jill threw the chip across the table. \u201cOh, please. Don\u2019t get all superior with me. We\u2019re talking about Riley. I refuse to believe you can stand in the same room as him and not feel something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI felt humiliation and a burning desire to be somewhere else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I mean. Come on, Gracie. There had to be some attraction between you.\u201d</p><p>No way she would admit to that, Gracie thought. Too dangerous with the potential to make her look far too foolish. Plus it would be all one-sided. \u201cHe\u2019s firmly in my past where he will stay. Do you think I\u2019m proud of what I did to him? I hate that everyone remembers it and talks about it. The last thing I\u2019m willing to do is fuel the fire. What\u2019s he doing here, anyway? And running for mayor? What\u2019s up with that?\u201d</p><p>Jill straightened. \u201cI can only discuss things that are public knowledge.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie stared at her friend. She was careful to keep her lips pressed together so her mouth didn\u2019t hang open, but she was pretty sure her eyes had bugged out.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re his lawyer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m handling some things for him.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cHow long will he be in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat depends.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not being the least bit helpful.\u201d Gracie took a sip of her drink. \u201cDo you know why he\u2019s running for mayor?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you going to tell me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not very much fun, you know that?\u201d</p><p>Jill grabbed a chip. \u201cI know. I just can\u2019t.\u201d Her expression turned wicked. \u201cBut if you see him the next time you\u2019re spying at his house, you could ask him yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for money. I don\u2019t want to have anything to do with Riley ever again. The humiliation would be too great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. As long as you\u2019re sure he\u2019s not the one.\u201d</p><p>Gracie looked at her and laughed. \u201cIf he\u2019s the one, I\u2019m converting to Catholicism and taking my vows.\u201d</p> <p>FRANKLIN YARDLEY liked watches. He had an impressive collection he stored in a custom-made drawer in his dresser. Every morning after picking out a suit and tie, he carefully chose the watch he would wear for the day. Omegas were his favorite, but he had three Rolexes because everyone expected a man in his position to wear one.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about perception,\u201d he reminded himself as he glanced down at the Omega partially concealed by the cuff of his monogrammed cotton shirt.</p><p>Still, he wasn\u2019t interested in a watch for himself today. He turned the page of the jewelry store catalogue and paused when he saw the display of ladies\u2019 watches. No, he was shopping for a very special someone.</p><p>A simple but elegant Movado caught his eye.</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>It was fancy enough to impress the lady in question, but not so flashy as to call attention to itself.</p><p>He made a note of the jewelry store and then checked his calendar. He would need a day or so to get the twelve hundred dollars he would need to buy the watch. It wasn\u2019t as if he could put it on his credit card. Sandra, his wife, might never have worked a day in her life, but she kept track of every single penny. Somehow he\u2019d assumed the daughter of a self-made millionaire wouldn\u2019t care about things like budgets and spending, but Sandra did. She believed that since the wealth in their marriage came from her, she had the only say on how it was spent.</p><p>Still, after twenty-eight years of marriage, Frank had made his peace with her tight purse strings and had figured out more than one way around them.</p><p>She often commented on his nice things, the ones she hadn\u2019t bought for him, but he never explained, not even when she told him to his face she didn\u2019t trust him. He didn\u2019t particularly care what she thought\u2014she would never leave and she looked good at parties. It was more than enough.</p><p>Frank slipped the catalogue into his leather Tumi briefcase, then unlocked the desk\u2019s bottom drawer. Under the city seal and several other important documents was the checkbook for the account especially set aside for the mayor\u2019s discretionary funds. Frank liked to think of it as his private play money. He tucked the checkbook next to the catalogue and pushed the buzzer that would summon his assistant.</p><p>The door to his private office opened and Holly walked in. Tall, blond, raised in San Diego and all of twenty-four, she had the perfect pretty looks of a third-generation surfing family. But behind those big blue eyes and high cheekbones was a brain of extraordinary sharpness.</p><p>\u201cI have the figures you requested,\u201d she said as she put a folder on his desk.</p><p>Hers was the figure that interested him the most. He imagined how pleased she would be when he gave her the watch later this week.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d she added. \u201cRiley Whitefield is gaining in the polls. People are starting to listen to his message.\u201d She frowned slightly, drawing her perfect eyebrows together. \u201cThey\u2019re saying we should discuss the issues more. I think you should give a few more speeches.\u201d</p><p>He adored everything about her. The way she talked, the way she worried, the way she said \u201cwe\u201d as if they were a team.</p><p>\u201cWhat issues do you consider most relevant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Delight widened her eyes. \u201cYou really want my opinion?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. You\u2019re my connection with the good citizens of Los Lobos. They\u2019ll tell you things they would never tell me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hadn\u2019t thought of that. I guess being the mayor sort of separates you from everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you close the door and we\u2019ll brainstorm some topics,\u201d he suggested.</p><p>She did as he requested, then took the seat across from his. \u201cTaxes are always an issue,\u201d she said. \u201cBut there aren\u2019t any bond measures on the ballot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s Whitefield discussing?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cZoning, more money for schools, ways to bring tourists to town in the winter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure I want more tourists around,\u201d Frank said.</p><p>Holly nodded. \u201cThey\u2019re a pain, but they dump lots of money into the economy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like we have our work cut out for us.\u201d Frank paused as if considering something, even though he\u2019d long since made up his mind. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose...\u201d he began.</p><p>Holly leaned forward, her expression eager, her firm, young breasts swaying gently under her blouse.</p><p>\u201cI was thinking you\u2019d like to draft a couple of speeches for me.\u201d</p><p>She sprang to her feet and stared at him. \u201cAre you serious? You\u2019d let me do that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019d do a terrific job. You\u2019re bright, talented, ambitious. Are you interested?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cAbsolutely. I could have two drafts to you by the end of the week. Is that soon enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Even better, he had a feeling her \u201cdrafts\u201d would be word perfect. He rose. \u201cThank you, Holly. This means a lot to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really excited by the opportunity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s excited. I\u2019m taking advantage of you. You\u2019re the kind of woman who makes a man go far.\u201d</p><p>Her smile turned knowing as she walked toward him. When she was only a few inches away, she reached for the waistband of her skirt.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the kind of man who makes a woman want to do almost anything.\u201d</p><p>Her skirt dropped to the floor. Unable to tear his gaze away, he gave silent thanks.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t wearing any panties.</p><p>GRACIE TURNED the cake onto the cooling rack and expertly tapped the bottom with just enough force to let everyone know who was in charge. A challenge, considering the moody, temperamental oven she had to work with. One of the joys of renting. She counted to five, tapped again, then lifted in one clean motion that left no room for second chances.</p><p>The pan slid off perfectly, leaving the golden cake resting on the rack.</p><p>\u201cI love it when a plan comes together,\u201d she said with a grin as she studied the multiple cooling layers that would make up a simple but elegant bridal shower cake.</p><p>Her exposure in People magazine, not to mention a couple of raves in the wedding issue of In Style had turned her small cake business into a growing concern. For reasons not clear to her, celebrities now considered her a \u201cmust have\u201d for their weddings and sometimes their showers. Sort of like wearing a Vera Wang original.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not about to complain,\u201d she said happily as she crossed to the refrigerator where she\u2019d carefully stacked all the fleurs-de-lis she\u2019d made in advance of decorating the cake. All three hundred and fifty. She would actually need about three hundred and thirty\u2014the rest were for breakage.</p><p>The design\u2014an elegant creation in white and gold\u2014was a replica of a cake featured in a renaissance painting. The bride-to-be, a popular actress with a career of movies on Masterpiece Theater, loved all things old. Gracie loved the challenge of something other than flowers, doves and hearts.</p><p>She walked to the counter, prepared to make yet more decorations in advance of assembling the cake, when her cell phone rang. For a second her heart fluttered, as if anticipating some wondrous event. The problem was, no one that exciting would be calling.</p><p>Oh. Yeah. Riley.</p><p>A quick glance at the display of her cell phone told her the caller was her mother, or at least someone at the hardware store.</p><p>Heartbeat quickly slowing to normal, she pushed the talk button.</p><p>\u201cThis is Gracie,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHi. It\u2019s your mother. I\u2019m confirming the meeting about the wedding. You\u2019ll be there, right? There\u2019s so much work to do to get things ready for Vivian\u2019s special day. I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll have some great ideas, what with all your wedding experience.\u201d</p><p>Gracie still felt the aftereffects of the previous evening when she\u2019d been reprimanded by Alexis and left feeling more like an outsider than ever.</p><p>\u201cIs the wedding still on?\u201d she asked. \u201cVivian seemed pretty upset.\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cOh, this happens about once a week. She\u2019s flighty and impulsive, which isn\u2019t a good combination. But marriage will settle her down.\u201d</p><p>Gracie was of the opinion one should be settled before getting married, but that was just her.</p><p>\u201cSure. I\u2019ll be there. Should I bring anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust your patience. You\u2019re going to need it.\u201d Her mother named the time and place, then excused herself to get back to customers at the store.</p><p>Gracie hung up and set the phone back on the counter. She\u2019d been worried about coming home for a lot of reasons she hadn\u2019t been able to articulate. Now that she was here, she could easily list them, explain them, even file them by category.</p><p>There was Riley\u2014not just that the town hadn\u2019t forgotten, which it hadn\u2019t, but also her reaction to him. One would think that half a lifetime away from him would reduce his appeal, but one would be wrong. Second, her relationship with her family. She remembered a lot of screaming and fighting with her sisters, but also a lot of good times. Now Alexis and Vivian were strangers to her, but close to each other. She felt like the odd man out and she didn\u2019t like it. Finally, there was her mother. She felt an awkwardness, a strain just under the surface, but she couldn\u2019t explain why it had happened. Was it because she\u2019d been gone for so long? Or was there something else she didn\u2019t see?</p><p>She turned back to her cooling cake and wrinkled her nose. This was one of the few times she wished she did something else for a living. Something that didn\u2019t give her too much time to think. What she needed was a distraction...a really big one. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>RILEY SAT in a leather chair that had been custom-made for his uncle. Donovan Whitefield had taken over the family bank on his thirty-fifth birthday and hadn\u2019t missed a day until he\u2019d died forty-two years later. He\u2019d been stern and difficult, a man who didn\u2019t take vacations, forgive mistakes or appreciate the foibles of others.</p><p>Or so he\u2019d been told. Riley had never met his uncle. For nearly five years they\u2019d lived in the same small town, but their paths had never crossed.</p><p>Riley turned in the chair and looked at the large portrait on the tall wall opposite the door. The office was stately and elegant, befitting a bank president, and the painting reflected all of that. Donovan Whitefield had been immortalized standing behind this very desk, staring out into the distance, as if the future beckoned.</p> <p>Riley thought it was all a pile of shit. If he had his way, he would take the portrait down and burn it. But he couldn\u2019t\u2014not until he won the damn election and all this was his. Until then, he played the game, and that meant sharing office space with an old and crabby ghost.</p><p>There was a quick knock on his door, then the heavy carved wood swung open.</p><p>\u201cGood morning, Mr. Whitefield,\u201d his assistant said.</p><p>Riley shook his head. \u201cI\u2019ve told you it\u2019s not necessary to knock. You are never going to find me doing anything secret or suspicious.\u201d</p><p>Diane Evans, a sixty-something woman who had worked all her life, barely blinked.</p> <p>\u201cOf course, sir,\u201d she said in a voice that told him she would continue to knock until the last minute of the last day of her employment.</p><p>Riley knew he wasn\u2019t in a position to complain.</p><p>Diane was efficient, quiet and knew everything about running the bank. If it hadn\u2019t been for her counsel, he would have floundered more than once. He might be able to sniff out oil in the middle of a typhoon in the South China Sea, but the world of financial institutions was new to him.</p><p>Diane had guided him through the past seven months without mussing a single strand of her short, graying hair.</p><p>\u201cThere was a call about the children\u2019s wing of the hospital again,\u201d she said evenly. Not by a flicker of a lash did she let on they\u2019d had this conversation at least three times before and each time he\u2019d not only refused to donate, but he\u2019d instructed her not to mention it to him again.</p><p>He motioned for her to come in and take a seat on the far side of the desk. She moved quietly on her sensible shoes, then perched on the edge of the leather and wood chair, her back perfectly straight, her shoulders squared, her tweed suit covering her like an ugly coat of armor.</p> <p>\u201cYou did promise to think about it, sir,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cFunny. My recollection is that I told you hell would freeze over before I gave them a penny to build the Donovan Whitefield memorial children\u2019s wing.\u201d</p><p>A pad of paper materialized in her hand, along with a pen. \u201cPerhaps if I explained the needs of community again,\u201d she began.</p><p>\u201cPerhaps if you got off me about this,\u201d he said.</p><p>She looked at him. Nothing about her serene expression changed. No eyebrow raised, no corner of her mouth turned down. Still he felt her disapproval all the way to his bones.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for children, Mr. Whitefield,\u201d she said. \u201cLocal children who shouldn\u2019t have to go into Los Angeles to get the care they need.\u201d</p><p>He figured he owed her. She\u2019d stayed late every time he\u2019d asked, she\u2019d saved his ass over and over and she\u2019d never once thrown the memory of his grandfather in his face.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cOn the condition you stop knocking and stop calling me Mr. Whitefield.\u201d</p> <p>Diane rose to her feet. \u201cVery well...\u201d She hesitated, then pressed her lips together before saying, \u201cRiley. I\u2019ll let the committee know you\u2019re considering a donation. In the meantime I have those reports your requested and Mr. Bridges is here to see you.\u201d</p><p>Despite the fact that the donation would cost him about fifteen million dollars if he did it, Riley still felt a measure of victory. Who knew he had it in him to negotiate with his secretary and win?</p><p>Zeke Bridges strolled in three minutes later. Tall, personable, with an air of trustworthiness about him that made you want to buy insurance from him, he\u2019d been Riley\u2019s first choice to run his campaign for mayor. Zeke wasn\u2019t just well liked by most folks in the town, he had experience.</p><p>\u201cThe numbers are up,\u201d Zeke said as he slumped into the chair Diane had vacated. \u201cWay up. We\u2019re gaining on Yardley every day. Those newspaper ads really made a difference. The old guy has to be running scared, which means we\u2019re going to have to watch for some kind of counterplay, but I\u2019ll keep on the polls so we\u2019ll know if he starts to creep back up in the numbers.\u201d</p><p>Riley grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re polling people? Zeke, it\u2019s Los Lobos and I\u2019m running for mayor, not president.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Make fun of me. But the truth is campaigning is all about the right information. We have to get it and use it to our advantage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you say so. You\u2019re the expert and that\u2019s why I pay you the big bucks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust remember that. We\u2019re only a few weeks away from the election. Every event is crucial. Sure we\u2019re ahead, but it wouldn\u2019t take much to derail the whole campaign. Yardley\u2019s a popular incumbent and people usually don\u2019t like change.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise to remain cooperative,\u201d Riley said. He had to win this election, and for ninety-seven million reasons Zeke knew nothing about.</p><p>Zeke took him over the schedule for the next couple of weeks. There would be a few public appearances and some ads on local cable. When Riley had approved everything, he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s just one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. What?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you do on your own time is your own business, right up until it impacts my campaign.\u201d</p><p>Zeke frowned. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour secret life. You\u2019re disappearing at all hours and not telling your wife where you are, which is your business, but she came looking at my place because that\u2019s where you told her you were going to be, which makes it my business.\u201d</p><p>Zeke swallowed hard. \u201cLook, Riley, I\u2019m sorry but I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Riley cut him off with a quick shake of his head. \u201cThere\u2019s no sorry. There\u2019s only the campaign. I\u2019m only going to ask you this once. Are you doing anything that could have a negative impact on my bid for mayor? Before you answer, let me remind you that Los Lobos is a small town and people finding out that the head of my campaign is screwing around on his wife would be a big negative.\u201d</p><p>Zeke pushed to his feet. \u201cI\u2019m not cheating on Alexis. I would never do that. I love her.\u201d He turned away. \u201cIt\u2019s not that. It\u2019s not anything that matters to you or the campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen what is it?\u201d</p><p>Zeke turned back to him. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if the information is a requirement of your continued employment with me?\u201d</p><p>The other man looked him square in the eye. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to fire me because I\u2019m not going to tell you what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s not about you and it\u2019s not about Alexis. That\u2019s as much as I can say. Is it enough?\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t want to be dealing with this right now, not with the election only a few weeks away. While he could replace Zeke, he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going to tell me, you should at least tell your wife,\u201d Riley said. \u201cShe\u2019s worried. Making her think you\u2019re running around isn\u2019t the best way to prove you love her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. I\u2019ll explain things to her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBy telling her what you\u2019re doing?\u201d</p><p>Zeke shook his head. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. Not yet. But it\u2019s not bad. You have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>Riley had learned a long time ago not to trust anyone. As much as he liked Zeke, he wasn\u2019t going to change his rule for him.</p><p>\u201cIf whatever it is you\u2019re doing spills over into the campaign, I won\u2019t just fire you, I\u2019ll do what I can to ruin you,\u201d Riley said. \u201cDo we understand each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d Zeke jerked his head toward the portrait on the far wall. \u201cI know you never met your uncle, but I did. You probably don\u2019t want to hear this, but you\u2019re a lot like him.\u201d</p><p>No, Riley didn\u2019t want to know. \u201cThanks for sharing,\u201d he said dryly. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you soon.\u201d</p><p>When Zeke had collected his papers and left, Riley stared at the door for a long time. He wanted to believe the problem was solved, but the tension in his gut told him otherwise. Zeke was up to something and Riley wanted to know what.</p><p>He picked up the phone and pulled a piece of paper from his shirt pocket.</p><p>\u201cHi, this is Gracie,\u201d a female voice said after two rings.</p><p>Riley grinned. Whoever would have thought he would one day be calling Gracie Landon on purpose?</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Riley. I talked to Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd?\u201d</p><p>He outlined their conversation.</p><p>\u201cAlexis isn\u2019t going to be satisfied with that,\u201d Gracie said.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not either. I\u2019m going to follow him tonight. See where he goes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to come with you.\u201d</p><p>His first instinct was to say no, but then he remembered who he was dealing with. The Gracie he knew would simply follow him, which meant they would be a very conspicuous parade.</p><p>\u201cFine. I\u2019ll pick you up at six-thirty. Are you back at the old house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m renting a place.\u201d She gave him the address. \u201cThis is pretty cool,\u201d she said when he\u2019d written it down. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on a stakeout before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. This is the perfect opportunity to round out your stalker past.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>GRACIE WASN\u2019T SURE of the correct fashion choice for a stakeout. In the movies everyone wore dark colors and drank cold coffee. She couldn\u2019t possibly drink coffee this late\u2014not if she wanted to sleep or even keep her belly from going up in flames. She was nervous enough. Caffeine would simply cause an overflow of acid and the resulting pain would lay her low for hours.</p><p>\u201cClothes first, refreshments later,\u201d she told herself as she stood in front of the closet.</p><p>She hadn\u2019t brought all that much up with her for her stay in Los Lobos. Most of the space in her Subaru had been crammed with baking supplies and decorating tools, not to mention her nifty cooling racks. She\u2019d limited her clothing choices to two small suitcases. Of course when she\u2019d made that decision she hadn\u2019t planned on playing Bond girl sidekick to Riley\u2019s yummy 007.</p><p>\u201cBlack,\u201d she murmured as she sorted through jeans and other slacks. A pair of black Dockers caught her attention. Somewhere she had a black T-shirt. That should do.</p><p>She found the T-shirt in a drawer. Unfortunately it was decorated with a white silhouette of a bride and groom and proclaimed itself to be from the 2004 Bride on the Beach show she\u2019d attended the previous summer.</p><p>Gracie ignored the unfortunate pattern and pulled it on. She studied herself in the mirror and realized her blond hair would act as a beacon. Another quick search unearthed a battered Dodgers baseball cap. The blue didn\u2019t match the black but hey, this was a stakeout, not a fashion show. Besides, Riley was unlikely to notice what she was wearing.</p><p>Riley. Just his name made her body tense and her heart rate quadruple. She was going to have to figure out a way to counter her reaction to him. They were only together to figure out what Zeke was up to. She had a feeling that given the choice, Riley would rather spend the evening with a known mass murderer than her. Any attraction on her part was a really bad idea.</p><p>She stuffed her feet into sandals and headed for the front of the house. The light patter on the roof told her the rain promised by the local news had arrived. She picked up a windbreaker and then searched out her purse and keys. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Seconds later lights swept across the front window. He was here.</p><p>She didn\u2019t know if she should run for cover or boldly step into the night. She settled on waiting for him to knock on her front door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said as she pulled it open, then was grateful she\u2019d done the speaking thing before seeing him.</p> <p>God, he looked good. Like her, he\u2019d dressed all in black, but his T-shirt didn\u2019t advertise anything beyond the chiseled muscles of his chest and the narrowness of his waist. Raindrops winked from his slicked back hair as if bragging about their close proximity to the man himself.</p><p>\u201cReady?\u201d he asked as he brushed off his bare arms. \u201cYou have a coat. Good. It\u2019s really raining.\u201d</p><p>She found herself more than tongue-tied. She felt frozen in place, as if her feet had somehow become completely stuck to the foyer tile. She might never move again. Centuries from now archeologists would unearth her and put her still upright body in some natural history museum with a little notice beside her on the wall saying they couldn\u2019t explain what she was doing, either.</p><p>She forced herself to breathe and then to speak. \u201cAre we, um, taking your car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d rather.\u201d</p> <p>It was fine with her. She didn\u2019t feel up to driving. She doubted she was capable of much more than involuntary bodily functions at this moment. She wasn\u2019t just overwhelmed by her attraction to Riley, but also by the unfairness of the situation. She\u2019d been gone for so long and had gotten on with her life. Was it too much to ask that she be able to come home for a few weeks and not make a complete fool out of herself?</p><p>No answer crashed through the heavens, so she grabbed her purse and her keys, turned out the living room light and stepped into the cool, damp, night air.</p><p>Riley led his way to his car\u2014a sleek, silver Mercedes that still smelled of new car and high-end leather. She slid onto the passenger seat and tried not to think about the fact they were going to spend the next who-knew-how-long together. Confined.</p><p>In some circles this could be considered a date. Of course in some circles she would be considered a menace to society and in desperate need of counseling.</p><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you staying at your mom\u2019s house?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI thought about it, but I need the space for my work. I tend to be a night owl and a lot of people don\u2019t appreciate noise from the kitchen at 3:00 a.m.\u201d</p> <p>He backed out of the driveway, then glanced at her. \u201cDo I remember something about cakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWedding cakes. They\u2019re very fancy. I also do cakes for showers sometimes, but most people aren\u2019t willing to pay that kind of money except for the actual wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow much are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m working on a shower cake right now. It\u2019s fairly ornate and will serve fifty. I\u2019m charging a thousand.\u201d</p><p>The car swerved slightly. \u201cDollars?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve found it really helpful to keep my prices in U.S. currency. It saves confusion.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor a cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA really good cake.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut still.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. A lot of people reacted the way he did. Those who wanted something incredibly special and totally handmade were willing to pay the price.</p><p>\u201cHow many cakes do you make a year?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cLess than a hundred. Of course wedding cakes are more expensive, but they take longer. I do okay, but I\u2019m not getting rich. I won\u2019t until I decide to expand, which I\u2019m not sure I want to do. I like having total control.\u201d</p><p>As she talked he drove through Los Lobos. \u201cYou know where Zeke lives?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been there a couple of times.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have his license plate,\u201d she said, digging in her purse for the information Alexis had given her.</p><p>Riley nodded at the windshield. \u201cIf this rain gets worse, we won\u2019t be able to read it from any kind of distance.\u201d</p><p>He pulled onto a side street and slowed. Gracie had only been by her sister\u2019s house once since returning to town, so she had to check out numbers to figure out which one it was.</p><p>Riley turned off his lights and cruised to a stop across the street. He pointed. \u201cThat\u2019s Zeke\u2019s SUV.\u201d</p><p>She peered through the windshield. \u201cIs it black?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDark blue, but in this weather, anything dark is going to look black.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d She leaned back in her seat. \u201cNow what?\u201d</p><p>Riley glanced at her. \u201cWe wait.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d known that, of course. That\u2019s what stakeouts were all about. Waiting. But thinking about it and actually doing it were two different things. Not only did Riley make her nervous, she found it really difficult to sit still. He sat there, immobilized, watching the house, while she shifted in her seat, stretched out her legs, fussed with her jacket, then tugged on her Dodger cap.</p><p>\u201cYou going to settle down anytime soon?\u201d he asked, never taking his attention from the house.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m settled. I just can\u2019t get comfortable.\u201d She sat up straighter in the seat. \u201cI\u2019ve been accused of fidgeting, but I don\u2019t understand how people can sit there like lumps. It\u2019s not natural. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d Riley said, cutting her off and pointing.</p><p>Sure enough Zeke hurried out of the house toward his SUV. Gracie instinctively sank down in her seat and shielded her face.</p><p>\u201cI doubt he can see you through the rain,\u201d Riley said dryly.</p><p>\u201cI want to be sure,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d</p><p>Riley grinned. \u201cYou\u2019re taking this too seriously.\u201d He started his engine and waited until Zeke pulled out before shifting into gear and following him.</p><p>Riley might think they were safe, but Gracie stayed slumped in her seat until it became obvious Zeke was heading directly to the freeway and not trying to lose anyone.</p><p>\u201cWhere do you think he\u2019s going?\u201d she asked as she shifted into a more comfortable position. \u201cAnd what\u2019s he up to? If he\u2019s not seeing another woman, the possibilities are endless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t list them,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne never knows with you.\u201d</p><p>She bristled. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said, turning toward him as much as her seat belt would allow. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me at all. Your impressions and assumptions come from my actions when I was barely fourteen years old and whatever you picked up reading that stupid series of articles. Until yesterday you\u2019d never had a conversation with me or spent any time in my presence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe talked when you threw yourself in front of my car and begged me to kill you if I was going to marry Pam.\u201d</p><p>She felt heat flare on her cheeks and was grateful for the darkness. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a conversation. I talked, you got in your car and drove in the other direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. So you\u2019re saying I should give you a chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m saying you shouldn\u2019t judge me or assume anything until you\u2019ve gotten to know me better.\u201d Then, suddenly aware he may not want to get to know her better, she pointed. \u201cHe\u2019s getting on the freeway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>Riley accelerated smoothly, keeping up with Zeke\u2019s car. When they were on the freeway, he backed off a little. Unfortunately another SUV moved right in front of them, blocking Zeke\u2019s vehicle from view.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s so many of them,\u201d she said as she looked out the side window.</p><p>Sure enough, they were surrounded by SUVs. Sort of like a weaker force being taken by a bigger enemy.</p><p>\u201cKeep his license plate number handy,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need it if we get separated for very long.\u201d</p><p>She waved the piece of paper she held. \u201cI have it right here.\u201d Another SUV cut them off. \u201cMaybe we should have bought one of those homing devices. We could mount the little display thingie and then just follow the red dot to wherever he\u2019s going.\u201d</p><p>She felt Riley\u2019s gaze on her.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d she demanded. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it in the movies. It\u2019s not as if I own one and use it on unsuspecting prey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be sure with you.\u201d</p><p>She leaned back and deliberately turned away from him. \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant about not judging me. I made a reasonable suggestion and you jumped on it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou thinking putting an illegal tracking device on someone\u2019s car is reasonable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou really think it\u2019s illegal?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t raining so hard and I didn\u2019t have to watch the road, I swear I\u2019d be banging my head against the steering wheel.\u201d</p><p>Genuinely baffled, she blinked at him. \u201cWhy? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>He made a whimpering sound she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever heard before.</p><p>\u201cAre you married?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo I have to worry about some burly guy showing up and trying to beat the crap out of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not married, although I\u2019d like to point out that anyone I did marry would completely understand my need to help my sister.\u201d She liked the faint touch of indignation in her voice, then nearly passed out as a thought occurred to her. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. Pam cured me of wanting anything long-term. Since her, I\u2019ve kept my relationships strictly superficial.\u201d</p><p>Gracie wanted to ask more questions, but she spotted something. \u201cIs that his car? Look. That dark SUV is exiting the freeway.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around for a sign and saw they were coming into Santa Barbara.</p><p>\u201cWhat could he be doing here?\u201d she wondered aloud.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know that it\u2019s him. I can\u2019t read the license plate, can you?\u201d</p><p>She squinted. \u201cNo. You\u2019ll have to get closer.\u201d</p><p>Riley tried, but they missed the signal at the bottom of the off-ramp and had to hurry to catch up with the other vehicle. They shot through the intersection only to see it turn left up ahead.</p><p>\u201cGo, go, go!\u201d she yelled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going.\u201d</p><p>They followed the other car through a residential neighborhood and watched it pull up in front of a two-story house.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. What was Zeke doing here?</p><p>The front door opened and a young child dashed out into the rain. \u201cOh, my God. He\u2019s not just having an affair. He has a whole other family. It\u2019s just like those Lifetime movies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Riley said as he pointed.</p><p>The driver had stepped out of the SUV and walked around front. Gracie relaxed as she saw a small, curvy woman reach down and pull the child into her arms.</p><p>\u201cOh. I guess we lost him,\u201d she said, feeling both foolish and relieved.</p><p>\u201cYou think?\u201d Riley turned around in the narrow street and headed back the way they\u2019d come. \u201cI should have let you drive. You\u2019re the professional.\u201d</p><p>She raised her eyebrows and looked at him.</p><p>He had the nerve to grin. \u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d he told her. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll back off. It\u2019s nearly seven-thirty and I haven\u2019t had dinner. Want to grab something before we head back?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t have been more surprised if he\u2019d morphed into a leopard man. Okay, that would have surprised her more, but not by much.</p><p>\u201cYou mean dinner?\u201d she asked, trying not to sound too stunned by the invitation.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the generally accepted meal for this time of day, but if you\u2019d prefer something else, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\u201d</p><p>Her stomach clenched and for once it had nothing to do with acid. Her big eating plan had been her usual tuna salad that she generally had five nights out of seven.</p><p>\u201cI, um, yeah. That would be great,\u201d she said calmly.</p><p>She wanted to open the window and scream out into the night, but instead she contented herself with a little inside shimmy and a very big smile. Dinner with Riley. Talk about a great ending to a good day. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>RILEY CHOSE a restaurant on the water and, despite the rain, Gracie found it far too romantic. If only she\u2019d worn something different. Something sexy and flirty and...Oops. As they were shown to a booth by the window she had to keep reminding herself that this wasn\u2019t a date and that Riley wasn\u2019t interested in her in that way.</p><p>They were, um, friends, maybe. Former acquaintances brought together by a common goal\u2014to find out what Zeke was doing when he stole away at all hours.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d think she\u2019d just ask him,\u201d she said as she was seated.</p> <p>Riley settled in his chair and raised his eyebrows. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh, sorry. Thinking out loud. Just my sister and the problem she\u2019s having with Zeke. Why doesn\u2019t she just ask him? She says it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to know, but isn\u2019t knowing better than not knowing? I\u2019d want to know. At least then you have something you can handle. But this nothingness is just too much like being left in the dark. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cI lost the thread somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d She picked up her menu but instead of looking at it, she stared out into the storm.</p><p>Rain pounded against the windows. Below she could see the angry surf smacking into the shore. Lights from the restaurant offered a feeble glow that quickly bled into the darkness.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a fabulous night,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised both eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I love storms. Hey, I live in Los Angeles where we get all of nine inches of rain a year. So when there\u2019s some exciting weather going on, I like to enjoy it.\u201d</p><p>He glanced out the window. \u201cThis is nothing. I\u2019ve been on an oil rig in a typhoon. That\u2019s weather.\u201d</p><p>His statement made her instantly want to ask a thousand questions. Was that where he\u2019d been? How on earth had he gotten there when he\u2019d started out in Los Lobos? But she settled on, \u201cI thought they evacuated rigs during bad storms.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, we\u2019re supposed to go, but who\u2019s going to enforce the rules? I worked for a small private company. Everyone on board was a little crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIncluding you?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cEspecially me.\u201d</p><p>The waiter appeared and told them about the specials.</p><p>\u201cHow about some wine?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. You order.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you going to have?\u201d</p><p>She scanned the menu and picked a grilled salmon dish with a house salad. Riley chose a surf and turf, then surprised her by ordering an Australian Shiraz.</p><p>\u201cI thought you would have gone fancy and French with the wine,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI like Australian wines. Spanish as well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are some great local vineyards around here. The whole Santa Ynez valley is covered with grapes.\u201d She started to say they could go on a tasting trip sometime, but stopped herself before the words formed.</p><p>This was Riley, she reminded herself. This wasn\u2019t a casual dinner with a guy she liked. This was...dangerous.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said, leaning back in his chair. \u201cHow did you get into wedding cakes?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cThe basic need for transportation. I was sixteen and I wanted a car. My aunt and uncle insisted that I contribute to the gas and insurance part of the equation, so I had to get a job. There was a local bakery a couple of streets over and I applied there. When they hired me, it was late May and wedding cake season was in full swing. I received a baptism by fire. But it turns out I had a real talent for making and designing cakes. Instead of college, I apprenticed with a master baker, then went out on my own.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cI tried to be a little well-rounded. I\u2019ve taken some night courses on running a small business. I\u2019ve been playing with the numbers as far as expanding. I\u2019m at that awkward place where I\u2019m having trouble getting everything done, so I\u2019m turning away business, but I\u2019m not sure I would have enough to support a whole other person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe you could get by with just half of one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a thought.\u201d</p><p>They were practically alone in the restaurant. The only other couples were seated on the other side of the dining area. With the storm still raging outside, there was a sense of isolation. Between the lashing rain and the flickering candles, it was pretty darned romantic.</p><p>Gracie found herself wanting to rest her chin on her hands and stare dreamily at Riley while he talked, just like in those really old silly teen movies she\u2019d loved as a kid. The dim light suited him, bringing out the shadows in his face and emphasizing the strength of his jaw and lines of his cheekbones. But it was more than that.</p><p>All those years ago she\u2019d loved him from afar, but she\u2019d never really known him. They hadn\u2019t had a single conversation. Her affections had been based on her own rather twisted feelings and fantasies, not the man he was. After all this time, it felt good to know that so far, she liked the person inside.</p><p>The waiter brought the wine and a basket of bread.</p><p>\u201cWhy do they do that?\u201d she asked when he opened the bottle and poured them each a glass.</p><p>\u201cOpen the wine?\u201d Riley asked. \u201cSomeone has to pull the cork out. I\u2019ve tried simply breaking off the top of the bottle, but then there\u2019s the whole shards of glass issue. Not very inviting.\u201d</p><p>Gracie rolled her eyes. In the soft lighting the color changed from medium blue to the color of a warm, shallow bay in summer.</p><p>While the image was accurate, it made Riley want to give himself a good beating, then go watch sports. A shallow bay in summer? Where the hell had that come from? This was Gracie, the terrorizing stalker. Not a woman he found attractive. And even if he did think she looked pretty hot in her tight T-shirt, she wasn\u2019t for him. The list of reasons was endless, but the three F\u2019s were the most important. Gracie didn\u2019t qualify.</p><p>\u201cNot the wine,\u201d she said, ignoring her glass and staring longingly at the basket of bread. \u201cThat. Death.\u201d</p><p>He frowned. \u201cBread is death?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot technically, but do you know what a couple of slices can do to a woman\u2019s hips and thighs? That\u2019s where the bread goes. There\u2019s a route directly from the stomach to the fat pockets where hungry little cells scarf up bread and grow round and full.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, now you\u2019re scaring me.\u201d</p><p>She licked her lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a guy. You wouldn\u2019t understand about deep burning hunger for something so incredibly bad for you. Your metabolism allows you to eat the contents of an entire grocery store without gaining an ounce.\u201d</p><p>He might be a guy, but he knew all about hunger. If she licked her lips like that again, he was going to have to forget his rules in favor of simply taking advantage of the situation. The three F\u2019s be damned.</p><p>\u201cOh, forget it,\u201d she said and reached for a piece of bread.</p><p>He watched her smooth on the tiniest wedge of butter, then bite into the slice. Her eyes fluttered closed, her body relaxed and he would swear she actually moaned. Was it just him or had it gotten hot in here?</p><p>When she swallowed, she opened her eyes and smiled. \u201cExcellent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat else don\u2019t you eat?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBread\u2019s my thing. Okay, and chocolate. I can take or leave most junk food. Jill and I had lunch today at a Mexican place and while I ate a few chips, I could go months without them. But bread....\u201d</p><p>She started to take another bite. He had to look away because watching her eat it was too erotic. Bread. What was it with women and food?</p><p>\u201cWhat about your cakes?\u201d he asked, careful to keep his attention on the windows.</p><p>\u201cNever touch \u2019em,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to sample all the time. There was an ugly ten pounds. But once I perfected my secret recipe, I didn\u2019t bother anymore. Sometimes the fillings give me a little trouble, but I do my best to be strong. What about you?\u201d</p><p>He returned his attention to her and was pleased to see she\u2019d finished her slice of bread. \u201cI don\u2019t bake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you the comedian? I meant what about your life? How did you get from your oil rig to here? And why are you running for mayor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJill didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean my closest and oldest friend for years? Spill a client secret? You have to be kidding.\u201d</p><p>He reached for his wine. \u201cDid you ask?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know you dated a lot in high school. I was there. Gee, Riley, didn\u2019t you learn anything about women back then? Of course I asked.\u201d</p><p>Her complete honesty and good humor intrigued him. All those years ago, he\u2019d never given much thought to Gracie, except to wish her far, far away from him. It wouldn\u2019t have occurred to him he could like her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m running for mayor to meet the terms of my uncle\u2019s will.\u201d</p><p>She tossed her long blond hair over her shoulder and reached for her wine. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense. His dying request was for you to be mayor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething like that. He\u2019s left everything to me, the bank, the house, his estate, on the condition I prove that I\u2019ve become respectable by running for mayor and winning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I thought my family was twisted. But it\u2019s a lot of money, right? I mean that\u2019s why you\u2019re doing it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcluding the bank, the estate is worth about ninety-seven million dollars.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d nearly finished swallowing her wine when he spoke. Even so, she gasped, then started to choke and cough.</p><p>\u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, half rising from his seat.</p><p>She waved him back. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said in a low croak. She coughed again, then reached for her water and took a sip.</p><p>\u201cDid you say ninety-seven million dollars?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cYes. U.S. dollars. I use them, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s an incredible amount of money. I love my uncle more than I could say but all he left me was a small three-bedroom house in Torrance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith no strings.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but for that amount of money, I\u2019d jump rope with the strings if necessary. So, wow. You\u2019ll be the richest mayor in Los Lobos history. I guess you\u2019ll only want to serve the one term. Then what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d</p><p>In truth, he wasn\u2019t planning to stay past the election. The will had stated he had to win, but had said nothing about serving out his term.</p><p>The waiter came with their salads. When he\u2019d left, Gracie said, \u201cYou\u2019re running the bank, too, right? Is that weird?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s my first desk job. While I was gone, I did a lot of studying in my spare time. I earned a bachelor\u2019s in finance, which helps. Still, I\u2019m constantly on the verge of screwing up. My secretary, Diane, is a big help.\u201d</p><p>Gracie\u2019s expression turned knowing. \u201cDiane, huh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s a treasure. In her sixties, still wears tweed suits. Bosses me around like crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would never have thought you were the kind of man who enjoyed being dominated by women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane is very special.\u201d</p><p>The light turned Gracie\u2019s hair to the color of gold. He liked how easily she laughed and how she seemed to take very little seriously. Her body moved in such a way that he could easily imagine her naked and wet. Just thinking about it...</p><p>But he couldn\u2019t think about it or do anything about it, he reminded himself. Under other circumstances, with him clearly explaining the rules, maybe. But not here. Not in Los Lobos where everyone knew everyone else\u2019s business and he had an election to win. She might be sexy and pretty and completely charming but there were ninety-seven million dollars on the line. For that price, he could keep his horny thoughts to himself.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone all serious.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThat we could never do this in Los Lobos.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around the restaurant. \u201cAgreed. People would talk about nothing else for weeks. My life, our lives, would be a living hell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting the better deal, though.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p> <p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m the one dining with a legend. The infamous Gracie Landon who knows how to love with her whole heart.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed as her hand shot forward. She grabbed a roll and threw it at him. Riley laughed as it bounced off his chest and tumbled to the floor.</p><p>\u201cIf they could see you now,\u201d he teased.</p><p>She picked up her fork and stabbed a piece of lettuce. \u201cYou\u2019d better watch yourself. You have a very nice car and I still know where that skunk lives.\u201d</p><p>AS THEY PULLED into Gracie\u2019s driveway, she leaned toward the window and stared out at the dark night.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s still raining,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect night to bake.\u201d</p><p>Riley stopped the car and turned off the engine. \u201cYou\u2019ll do that now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I like the quiet. I can concentrate. Plus there are some really cool infomercials on TV. You\u2019d be amazed at the stuff you can buy. Not that I ever phone in, but I like to see them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. Sure. I\u2019ll bet you have a whole secret stash of Veg-O-Matics in that house.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. The soft sound brushed against his skin in a way that reminded him he was a man who hadn\u2019t been with a woman in too damn long.</p><p>\u201cNo vegomatics, but if you\u2019re very, very good, I might bake you something. To thank you for helping me with all this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cZeke is my campaign manager. Now that you know how much I have on the line you can see why I want to make sure whatever he\u2019s up to isn\u2019t going to screw with my plans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I\u2019ll call Alexis in the morning and tell her we don\u2019t know anymore than we did before. I\u2019ll also try to get her to talk to him. It\u2019s the most sensible plan.\u201d</p><p>He would bet money she didn\u2019t wear perfume, but her sweet scent seemed to fill the car. Tension crackled between them. Who would have thought after all this time, he would find Gracie appealing?</p><p>He reminded himself of his mission, his rules and how much could be lost by a single night of pleasure. Then he leaned toward her and watched as her eyes widened and her pupils dilated.</p><p>\u201cHave a good rest of the night,\u201d he said as he carefully undid the lock and pushed the door open. A blast of cold air swept into the car.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cWhat? Oh. Sure. Thanks again.\u201d She gave him a quick smile and hurried up the walk toward the house.</p><p>He waited until she was inside before starting the car. But it was a long time before he drove away and that night, thoughts of her kept him hard and awake well past midnight.</p><p>THE SHARP SOUND made Gracie want to yell at somebody. She hadn\u2019t gotten to bed until almost four and it was far too early for her to be getting up. She knew she hadn\u2019t set the alarm, so what....</p> <p>Sleep receded. She gazed around blurrily until she realized it wasn\u2019t the clock radio making the noise but the phone. She grabbed the cell.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Hello?\u201d</p><p>A deep sob filled her ear.</p><p>\u201cHello? Who is this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me. Alexis.\u201d Another sob. \u201cOh, Gracie, I just went over to his office and I saw him. With her!\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Who? What her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cP-Pam. Zeke is having an affair with Pam Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p><p>BECCA JOHNSON\u2019S hand shook as she signed the final loan documents. \u201cI\u2019m scared,\u201d she admitted with a smile.</p><p>\u201cThis is the point of no return,\u201d Riley told her. \u201cYou want the chance to change your mind?\u201d</p><p>Becca looked at him in surprise. \u201cAre you kidding? Thanks to you, I\u2019m getting the chance to open a business in my home. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Since the divorce, I\u2019ve barely been hanging on, financially.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cWas I supposed to tell you that?\u201d</p><p>He did his best to look reassuring. \u201cMy loan committee did a thorough check on your credit and income. I doubt you have any financial secrets from us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. I mean I\u2019m good for the money.\u201d She signed the last paper and passed it over to him. \u201cI really appreciate this.\u201d</p><p>Becca Johnson was a thirty-something divorced mother of two interested in opening a day-care facility in her home. She\u2019d come to the bank for a loan to cover some remodeling expenses and start-up costs. The committee had been on the fence, so the final decision had been Riley\u2019s. He\u2019d given the woman the loan.</p><p>\u201cI figured with so little equity in the house and all....\u201d She stopped talking and shook her head. \u201cI should probably keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want you to change your mind at this late date.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo late for that.\u201d He tapped the signed papers on his desk. \u201cWe have a binding contract. Good luck with your new business.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d</p><p>She rose and walked to the door of his office. \u201cYou\u2019ve been wonderful, Mr. Whitefield. All the other banks in town told me no. I couldn\u2019t have done this without you.\u201d</p><p>The praise made Riley uncomfortable. He shrugged off the compliment. \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of person who pays her bills on time and that\u2019s what we want.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then stepped out into the hallway. Riley turned his attention to his computer. The door closed, but he knew he wasn\u2019t alone. Even the air stood at attention when Diane entered a room. He glanced at his assistant.</p><p>She wore yet another of her infamous tweed suits. A green one this time, with a fussy yellow blouse underneath. Her shoes were dark and sensible\u2014the kind that frightened small children.</p><p>\u201cHere are Becca Johnson\u2019s loan documents,\u201d he said, handing her the file. \u201cPlease see that they\u2019re processed today and that the money is deposited in her account first thing in the morning.\u201d</p><p>His assistant took the papers, but didn\u2019t leave.</p><p>\u201cYou have something else on your mind?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She stood there glaring at him. \u201cI do. Your quarterly projections aren\u2019t very detailed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a criticism?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a statement of fact.\u201d She glanced down at the file in her hand. \u201cFunny how Ms. Johnson thinks she\u2019s just been offered the chance to make her heart\u2019s desire come true. If only she knew she\u2019d made a deal with the devil.\u201d</p><p>Riley leaned back in his chair. \u201cAnd here I thought we\u2019d agreed you would call me by my first name.\u201d</p><p>Diane\u2019s disapproving expression didn\u2019t change. \u201cHow long does she have until her world comes crashing in on her? A month? Are you closing the bank the day after the election or will you wait until the results are certified?\u201d</p><p>So, she\u2019d figured it out. Riley wondered if the woman would find any satisfaction in knowing she was right.</p><p>\u201cAll the loans will be called,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single one. Do you know how many houses that is? How many businesses? You could destroy the town.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t respond. Her gaze sharpened.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you care?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot one damn bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d</p><p>She turned on her heel and left.</p><p>Riley stared at the closed door. He refused to feel guilty about what he was going to do. If he won, the bank was history. If he didn\u2019t, life would go on as before. Someone else would be brought in to run things.</p><p>Diane could destroy his chances, but she wouldn\u2019t. She was from the old school\u2014what happened within the sanctity of the workplace stayed there.</p><p>He closed the current program on his computer and accessed the databank. After typing in Diane\u2019s name, he checked for any outstanding loans. There was one on a house. Per the balance, she only owed a few thousand dollars. Even if the bank closed, she would be fine. So what did she have to get so upset about?</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he was halfway through the weekly loan reports when someone banged on his door. Riley looked up and frowned. Diane would never bang, even if she was furious with him, which she probably was.</p><p>\u201cCome in,\u201d he called.</p><p>The door opened and Gracie peeked around it, into the room. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have good news and bad news. Which do you want first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come into the office and tell me both?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the room and closed the door behind her. After making her way to his desk, she placed a small pink box in the center and smiled.</p><p>\u201cI made you a cake.\u201d</p><p>She spoke with a combination of pride and embarrassment that made her cheeks flush. Or maybe they were flushed for another reason\u2014he couldn\u2019t be sure.</p><p>Her long blond hair hung down loose and sexy. She wore a short, summery kind of dress that emphasized curves. He was as human as the next man and certainly didn\u2019t mind when an attractive woman wanted to spend a bit of her day with him. Even if that woman was an ex-crazed stalker. But that wasn\u2019t what held him motionless in his seat.</p><p>Instead, it was the cake.</p><p>\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep last night and after I\u2019d worked on my decorations for what felt like forty-seven days I decided to do some baking. It\u2019s white cake with a chocolate cream filling. The frosting\u2019s\u2014\u201d</p><p>She kept on talking about the frosting and how she\u2019d been unsure of the design, but he wasn\u2019t paying attention. Not really.</p><p>His mother had made him cakes for his birthday, of course, but that had been the extent of her baking. She hadn\u2019t been into it and he hadn\u2019t cared. Since then, well, he wasn\u2019t the kind of man women made cakes for.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to open it and look?\u201d she asked impatiently.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He flipped up the top and stared down at the white round cake decorated with a grinning skunk.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Guys don\u2019t do the flower thing and I don\u2019t know what your hobbies are or anything. I thought the skunk would be funny. Want a taste?\u201d</p><p>As she asked, she sank into the leather chair on the visitor side of his desk and dug into her oversized straw bag. She pulled out a wicked looking knife and paper plates in a big Baggie.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cYou travel with a knife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She withdrew it from the protective cardboard covering. \u201cYou never know when you have to cut into a cake and take a taste. At least I don\u2019t.\u201d She handed him the knife, then dug around some more. \u201cI seem to be out of forks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll make do. Want some?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll take a taste if you\u2019re worried about me poisoning you or something, but otherwise, no. There was that whole bread thing last night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only had one piece.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t seen my thighs.\u201d</p><p>He had the sudden thought that he would like to. Very much. And maybe the rest of her.</p><p>Dangerous, dangerous territory. Better to cut into the cake.</p><p>He cut himself a piece and slid it onto a paper plate. She watched anxiously as he took a big bite.</p><p>The cake was soft and moist, with just the right texture and a delicate flavor he couldn\u2019t place. The chocolate cream filling tasted like a mousse, but not completely.</p><p>\u201cExcellent,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cThe best cake I\u2019ve ever tasted.\u201d</p><p>She visibly relaxed. \u201cGood. I worked hard on perfecting my secret recipe, but every now and then, I like to test it out on an unbiased person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019d tell you the truth if I didn\u2019t like your cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would you care about hurting my feelings? I mean with our past?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He ate another bite of cake, then set the plate on his desk. \u201cIf the cake was the good news, what\u2019s the bad?\u201d</p><p>Gracie slumped in the seat and hung her head back. \u201cAlexis. She called me in what felt like the predawn hours but was really only about ten to tell me that Zeke had forgotten his briefcase at home so she\u2019d gone by his office to drop it off. In the process of performing her good deed, she walked in on Zeke having what looked like a very personal relationship with...\u201d She paused, straightened and looked right at him. \u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m braced.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPam.\u201d</p><p>It took him a second. \u201cPam, my ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOne and the same.\u201d Gracie leaned forward and put her hands on his desk. \u201cSo, have you seen her since you\u2019ve been back in town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeen her as in caught a glimpse of her in town? Yes. Seen her as in spent time with her? No.\u201d He held in a smile. \u201cWorried?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all. I\u2019m fourteen years over my crush. You can see anyone you\u2019d like. Doesn\u2019t bother me at all.\u201d She made an X on her chest. \u201cScout\u2019s honor.\u201d</p> <p>He doubted she had any active interest in his personal life, but last night in the car, they\u2019d both been interested in him kissing her.</p><p>\u201cZeke sleeping with Pam won\u2019t be good for anyone,\u201d Riley said. \u201cEspecially not Zeke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re on stakeout detail again?\u201d she asked cheerfully.</p><p>\u201cYes, but this time we\u2019ll follow Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least it won\u2019t be raining.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasier for us to follow her and easier for her to spot us.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLife is a trade-off. Six-thirty again?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cAs we have no idea of her plans, it\u2019s as good a time as any.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be ready.\u201d She stood. \u201cI\u2019ll even bring my camera.\u201d</p><p>He winced. \u201cNot a good idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe need proof.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you get something small and digital?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not into technology.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the knife and cleaned it with a napkin she\u2019d dug out of her purse. After putting the knife away and dropping the napkin in the trash, she headed for the door.</p> <p>\u201cSee you then.\u201d</p><p>With a wave of her fingers, she was gone, leaving Riley with the sense of having been visited by a larger-than-life force.</p><p>There was another knock, this one soft and respectful. He guessed it would have been full of rage if she\u2019d known how to transmit that emotion as well.</p><p>\u201cYes, Diane?\u201d</p><p>His secretary stepped into his office. \u201cYour one o\u2019clock meeting is ready, sir.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the cake box toward her. \u201cThis is delicious. You should try some.\u201d</p><p>She raised her chin slightly. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie made it for me. Gracie likes me.\u201d</p><p>Diane\u2019s expression flashed with the anger that had been missing from her knock. \u201cThat\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t know you, sir.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHERE ARE too many details,\u201d Gracie\u2019s mother said as she spread out the stack of folders onto the coffee table. \u201cVivian, honey, we\u2019re going to have to decide about a few things. We have to finalize the menu by the end of the week.\u201d</p><p>Gracie sat in a corner of the sofa. She picked up the folder marked \u201cGuest list\u201d and flipped through the pages of names. \u201cWhere are you having it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe country club,\u201d Vivian said with a grin. \u201cI\u2019m having a big outdoor wedding with lots of flowers and guests and dancing.\u201d</p><p>Gracie did a quick calculation, multiplying the number of guests by a per-head-cost for a meal, then swallowed hard. \u201cGee, things must be really great at the hardware store,\u201d she murmured more to herself than anyone else.</p><p>But her mother heard her and shot her a look. Gracie didn\u2019t know if it meant they weren\u2019t supposed to talk about such things or if her mother appreciated her concern.</p><p>\u201cWhat time is the wedding?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cFour,\u201d Alexis said as she walked into the family room carrying a tray filled with drinks and cookies. She set it down on the ottoman and passed out cans of diet soda.</p><p>Gracie took hers, then popped it open. \u201cI worked on a wedding once where instead of a sit-down meal, they had tons of appetizers. Not only were waiters circulating with trays, but there were various stations with fun things like melted chocolate for dipping and a mini sandwich bar. The savings for the bride\u2019s family were enormous.\u201d</p><p>Her mother picked up a folder marked menus and opened it. \u201cAren\u2019t appetizers pretty expensive?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey can be, but they\u2019re still cheaper than a meal. Plus, people are circulating more, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities for conversation, which the guests really like. They\u2019re not stuck with the same six people at the table all night. On the savings side, you don\u2019t have to have such fancy table settings or decorations. At a cocktail party, no one expects the chairs to be covered. You can even serve a signature drink that matches the wedding colors, plus beer and wine.\u201d</p><p>Vivian narrowed her blue eyes. \u201cThanks for making my wedding into an experience on the same level as going to the outlet mall, Gracie. You know, another way we could save money is have everyone pack a lunch. Wouldn\u2019t that be too, too stunning for words?\u201d</p><p>Gracie stiffened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, don\u2019t. The wedding is in less than five weeks and I\u2019m not changing anything. I want a big sit-down dinner. I want a band and I want lots of dancing. The signature drink idea is a good one, though. I\u2019ll talk to Tom about that.\u201d</p><p>Alexis smiled sympathetically at Gracie. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t hurt to save a little money,\u201d she told Vivian.</p><p>\u201cWhy should I? You and Zeke eloped. Oh, and Gracie\u2019s never getting married, so why shouldn\u2019t all the money be spent on me?\u201d</p><p>Alexis shrugged. \u201cAlways the baby of the family. You\u2019re spoiled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever.\u201d Vivian grabbed a cookie. \u201cLook, I\u2019m paying for my own wedding dress. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI appreciate you helping out. Let\u2019s talk about the dresses. Yours is ready, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in, and I have my first fitting next week.\u201d She turned to Gracie. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful. Strapless, with lace and a drop waist. The bridesmaid dresses are a similar style, but really simple and elegant. They\u2019re black, edged with white. I can\u2019t wait for you to see them.\u201d</p><p>Vivian seemed to have forgotten her explosion from fourteen seconds before, but Gracie hadn\u2019t. The sharp words still stung. Maybe the problem was she didn\u2019t know her role here. Despite all her experience with weddings, she was the odd sister out. If her presence was simply a courtesy, then she should remember to keep her mouth shut.</p><p>Still, she wanted to protest that it was unfair of Vivian to assume Gracie wouldn\u2019t get married. She was only twenty-eight and the last time she checked, that didn\u2019t mean love was out of her life forever. Sure there wasn\u2019t anyone special right now, but that could change.</p><p>\u201cAlexis\u2019s dress has a matching little shrug that\u2019s so cute.\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s previous outburst had been a painful twinge. This revelation was a full-on stab.</p><p>Gracie took a swallow of her soda. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have the maid of honor stand out a little.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d Vivian beamed.</p><p>Alexis said something about flowers, their mom pulled out yet another folder and Gracie did her best to act normal.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t that she minded Vivian asking Alexis to stand up with her. They\u2019d grown up together, they were close. It was that when Vivian had first told her about the wedding, she\u2019d made it clear she was going to ask her friends to be in her wedding, and not her sisters. Apparently she\u2019d only meant not Gracie.</p><p>Gracie understood intellectually that while she might technically be a member of this family, she wasn\u2019t in any other way. She\u2019d been gone for the past fourteen years. Things had happened, people had changed. She\u2019d changed. This wasn\u2019t her world. Oh, but it still hurt to be excluded.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to have everything under control,\u201d she said when they\u2019d finalized the flowers for the bouquets and the tables. \u201cI\u2019m going to head out. I have some baking to do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen are you going to make me some sketches for my wedding cake?\u201d Vivian asked. \u201cI want it huge. I mean really, really big and spectacular. Every inch decorated.\u201d</p><p>Which described a cake that would not only go for several thousand dollars, but would take weeks to finish. Not that Vivian would care about that.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll put something together in the next couple of days,\u201d Gracie promised. She rose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll walk you out,\u201d Alexis said and followed her to the front door.</p><p>\u201cWell?\u201d she asked when they were alone. \u201cAre you going to find out what\u2019s going on with Zeke and Pam Whitefield?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Riley and I are going to follow her tonight and see what happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t lose her like you lost Zeke,\u201d Alexis said.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the tip. I wouldn\u2019t have thought of it on my own.\u201d</p><p>She left the house and walked to her car. She felt uncomfortable, as if she had a bad taste in her mouth. The house where she\u2019d lived for so long looked exactly as she remembered, but everything else was different, and those changes made her sad.</p><p>RILEY PULLED into Gracie\u2019s driveway and found her waiting just outside the front door. The storm had moved on, leaving the sky clear, which would be both a help and a hindrance to their evening plans. It was already twilight, but there were plenty of stars and a good-sized moon to provide light.</p><p>Gracie waved when she saw him and walked toward the car. He watched her, noting something was different. Something he couldn\u2019t figure out.</p><p>Not her clothes. She\u2019d dressed casually, in dark pants and a long-sleeved T-shirt. Her blond hair had been fastened back in one of those fancy braids women seemed to love. She even had her damn camera with her.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asked when she opened the door and slid onto the passenger seat.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said with a smile that seemed more forced than genuine.</p><p>He left the car in park. \u201cI was asking a question, not offering an urban greeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Oh. You mean what\u2019s up with me?\u201d She shrugged. \u201cNothing. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Fine had been the bright, cheerful, glowing woman who had delivered the cake to his office earlier that day. This was not fine.</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d he probed, then could have kicked himself. Did he really want to know what could be up in Gracie\u2019s life?</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d She let the smile fade. \u201cCan you be okay with that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>He backed out of her driveway.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll swing by Pam\u2019s house and see if she\u2019s there. If she is, we\u2019ll wait and see if she goes out.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cSound like a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s great. When I saw Alexis, she reminded me not to lose Pam this time. Good advice, huh?\u201d</p><p>There was something in her voice. Something sharp, but also broken. He gripped the steering wheel and told himself to think about sports.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, he slowed as they turned onto Pam\u2019s street. Her house was on the far corner\u2014a modest single-story structure with a big garden and bay windows.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s here,\u201d he said, pointing to the lights on in the house and the car\u2014a white Lexus GS300\u2014in the driveway.</p><p>\u201cDo you know why she\u2019s here?\u201d Gracie asked, speaking for the first time since they\u2019d left her house. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cShe lives here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I mean why is she in Los Lobos? I would have thought she would head out for the big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Nor did he care. Pam was firmly in his past and he was happy to keep her there. She\u2019d lied her way into their marriage and as soon as he\u2019d learned the truth, he\u2019d been gone.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just I don\u2019t know why they even asked me to be at the meeting,\u201d Gracie said as she stared out the side window toward the house. \u201cObviously my opinions weren\u2019t welcome. I don\u2019t get it. I just don\u2019t get it. Mom can\u2019t be making that much at the hardware store. I\u2019m sure she owns the house outright, but still.</p><p>\u201cVivian\u2019s acting as if money is no object. A sit-down dinner at the country club? That\u2019s insane.\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t want to ask. He held in the question as long as he could, but it finally escaped. \u201cWhat are we talking about?\u201d</p><p>Gracie sighed. \u201cNothing. My sister. My younger sister. She\u2019s getting married in a few weeks. That\u2019s why I\u2019m back here. They said they wanted my help. But they don\u2019t. Oh, Vivian wants a wedding cake, though. A big, heavily decorated one. Sure, I\u2019m happy to give her that, but it\u2019s as if she has no idea what she\u2019s asking. We\u2019re talking hundreds of hours. Plus, there\u2019s the whole wedding party. I\u2019m okay with it, but I don\u2019t know why she lied. All she had to do was tell me the truth. So she wants Alexis in the wedding and not me. What do I care?\u201d</p><p>Her pain was a tangible creature in the car. Riley wished he was wearing a tie so he could loosen it. Instead he touched her arm.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said, feeling like a complete idiot as he spoke the words. How the hell did he know if it was okay or not?</p><p>She turned to him and he saw a hint of tears in her eye. In the glow from the streetlight, she seemed more frail, somehow.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m telling myself I\u2019ll be fine, but so far I know I\u2019m lying. I\u2019m not even a part of this family anymore. She and Alexis are close. That\u2019s okay. I have to accept it. It\u2019s just...\u201d She swallowed hard, then drew in a deep breath and released it. \u201cNone of this is my fault. If I\u2019m not a part of things, it\u2019s because my mother sent me away. I never wanted to go.\u201d</p><p>He felt both uncomfortable and awkward. Gracie being upset made him want to fix things, which was unfamiliar. But all these feelings\u2014he didn\u2019t like them at all.</p><p>\u201cGo where?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cAfter that summer.\u201d She looked at him. \u201cWhen you found out Pam wasn\u2019t pregnant, you took off. But you weren\u2019t the only one leaving town. I was sent away, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. I remember. To some relatives. Iowa, was it?\u201d</p><p>The corners of her mouth turned up in an almost smile. For a second he wanted to move in and kiss one of those corners, which was insane. He leaned back against the door.</p><p>\u201cMy grandmother\u2019s. I was sent away so I wouldn\u2019t ruin your wedding. But after that, I didn\u2019t come home.\u201d She looked out the front window. \u201cMy mother said I had some issues, probably because my dad died when I turned twelve and that\u2019s an impressionable age and you moved in next door and I fixated on you. She said I couldn\u2019t stay in Los Lobos, even after you were gone. That people wouldn\u2019t let me forget what had happened and I deserved a fresh start and maybe some help. So she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle in Torrance.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her lips together and blinked several times. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go. I felt like I was being permanently punished. I know what I did to you was wrong and twisted. I saw somebody, a counselor, for a while. She really helped me put things in perspective. But even after that, my mom said I couldn\u2019t come home. So then I decided to stop wanting to. And now they\u2019ve asked me to come back, and I thought it was because they missed me, but it\u2019s just to do work on the wedding and it\u2019s like losing my family all over again.\u201d</p><p>It took him a second to realize she was crying. The tears fell silently down her cheeks. Riley felt a combination of compassion and anger. He knew all about being forced to do something he didn\u2019t want to do. The only reason he\u2019d married Pam fourteen years ago was because his mother had guilted him into it. But he knew that even if he\u2019d refused, she wouldn\u2019t have turned her back on him. At least not for long.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, feeling stupid for the useless words.</p><p>She nodded, as if she couldn\u2019t speak right then.</p><p>Riley reached out a hand toward her, then let it fall on the console. He swore silently, cursed himself for getting into this position in the first place, then leaned forward and pulled Gracie against him.</p> <p>She resisted at first, then she sagged against him. He\u2019d always thought of her as larger than life, but as he held her he realized she was kind of on the small side.</p><p>Her body felt warm against his. Her hands clutched at his shirt and her forehead pressed against his shoulder. He could smell the sweet scent of her body, along with a hint of maybe vanilla from her baking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered as she trembled. \u201cI\u2019m actually more together than this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you.\u201d</p><p>And he did. She\u2019d grown her business from nothing, which meant plenty of hard work and talent on her part.</p><p>He rubbed her back and felt the smooth length of her hair brushing against his hand. She shifted and wrapped her arms around his waist. Then she was looking at him with tears in her eyes and her mouth was swollen and the need to kiss her got so big that he\u2014</p><p>\u201cPam,\u201d he said as some movement caught his attention.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam. She just got in her car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Oh!\u201d Gracie straightened, brushed her checks, then turned to look out the window. \u201cWe have to follow her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlready on that.\u201d</p><p>He waited until Pam had pulled out and driven down the block before going after her. He nearly caught up with her at the stop sign, then drove more slowly as she headed into town.</p><p>\u201cShe could be going anywhere,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI hope she doesn\u2019t get on the freeway. It\u2019s already dark and I don\u2019t think I could take losing her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t lose her. Pam never paid much attention when she was driving. I doubt that has changed. I\u2019m going to stay close enough to keep her in view.\u201d</p><p>They drove through Los Lobos, coming out on the ocean side. When Pam pulled into the parking lot of a small motel, Riley pulled up on the street in front of the low, one-story building.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she come here?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>Riley just looked at her. Her eyes widened and her mouth dropped open.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she moaned. \u201cDon\u2019t even think that she\u2019s meeting Zeke here. A motel? It\u2019s tacky. Plus, why couldn\u2019t he just go to her house?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHis car would be recognized.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because no one will notice it here?\u201d</p><p>Gracie had a point. Still, there had to be a reason Pam had gone inside.</p><p>\u201cWe need to check it out,\u201d he said.</p><p>Gracie nodded. They stepped out of the car and moved toward the long, skinny building. He noticed Gracie had her damn camera with her, but he knew better than to suggest she leave it behind.</p><p>They moved slowly, cautiously, staying in the shadows and stopping to listen before stepping through the carport to the main office. Pam\u2019s car sat at the far end of the parking lot, but she couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone into one of the rooms,\u201d Gracie whispered. \u201cWe have to find out which one.\u201d</p><p>Riley debated going to the manager\u2019s office and bribing the guy into giving them the information. But with him running for mayor, he wasn\u2019t sure that was a good idea.</p><p>\u201cWe could go look in all the windows,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cA lot of them have open curtains.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing Pam\u2019s in one where the curtains are closed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good point.\u201d</p><p>Before they could make a decision, there was a loud pop and all the lights went out. Darkness descended with a suddenness that disoriented.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t move,\u201d Riley said, instinctively reaching for Gracie\u2019s hand. \u201cWe need to get back to the car. Stay close.\u201d</p><p>His fingers closed around hers. He felt her other hand on his back.</p><p>\u201cLead on,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ll be...\u201d Her hand tugged his and he heard a thunk. \u201cI\u2019ll just be tripping behind you.\u201d</p><p>Despite their pressing need to get out of here, Riley wanted to turn around, pull Gracie close and kiss her until she went boneless. If he hadn\u2019t had a bad feeling about the sudden blackout, he would have given in to the urge. Instead he walked in the general direction of the car.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s through here,\u201d he said and rounded a corner.</p><p>Just then the night exploded with a brilliant flash of light. Riley instinctively raised his arm to ward off the attack, only to realize whoever had been there was gone. He heard the sound of someone running, then a car door slammed. All the lights in the complex came on just as the car raced out of the parking lot.</p><p>\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cSomeone took our picture. What I want to know is who would do it and why.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>\u201cIT WASN\u2019T ME,\u201d Gracie said quickly, waving her Polaroid.</p><p>\u201cI know that,\u201d Riley said with a tone of impatience that made her wonder how much she really bugged him. \u201cThe flash came from in front of us.\u201d</p><p>He frowned, as if considering possibilities, then led the way to the car.</p><p>She wondered if he noticed they were still holding hands. She liked the way his fingers laced with hers and how warm and strong he felt. If she was interested in him, this could be a significant development and more than a little thrilling. Except she wasn\u2019t intrigued or thrilled. She was mildly interested in how nice he was to her and occasionally thought of him as good-looking, but that was it.</p><p>They drove back to her place. Riley followed her inside without being asked, which could have been another mark in the thrilling column, but, of course, wasn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI want to know what that was,\u201d he said as they moved into her kitchen and she put on a pot of coffee. \u201cWere we set up? Was it some jerk out for a good time by turning off the lights and taking pictures?\u201d</p><p>She pulled out a small cake very much like the one she\u2019d taken to Riley earlier that day only this wasn\u2019t decorated. \u201cBoth sound really crazy. How could we be set up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe Pam led us to the motel for a reason. It\u2019s the picture. It has to be. But so what?\u201d</p><p>He paced the length of her kitchen and came to a stop in front of the schedule she\u2019d taped up on the wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, then read aloud. \u201cThree hundred and sixty point-two dots. Seventy gum paste roses, seventeen small, twenty-three medium, thirty large.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat I have to do for a cake I\u2019m making this week.\u201d She walked into the dining room and came back with a large portfolio, then pulled out a sketch of the cake. \u201cIt\u2019s really simple. Just three tiers with these little dots scattered and a wreath of roses at the base of each tier. I make all the decorations in advance, even the dots.\u201d She smiled. \u201cTo be honest, making the cake is the least of it. All the time is in the decorating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSpeaking of your cake,\u201d he said with a smile as he moved toward the one she\u2019d left on the counter. \u201cAre you saving that for a special occasion?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cKnives are in that drawer.\u201d She pointed. \u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>She grabbed a couple of plates and two coffee mugs, then pulled out two forks.</p><p>\u201cYou seem calm,\u201d he said when they both had dessert and coffee and were seated at the small table in the corner.</p><p>\u201cAbout what happened?\u201d she shrugged. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything to get upset about. The Pam thing is weird, though. Why would she go to a motel in town? I still think she could meet the guy at her house. It was dark. If he pulled into her garage and they shut the door, who would have known he was there?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe this had nothing to do with Zeke. Pam talking to him earlier could have meant she needed insurance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTry telling that to Alexis,\u201d Gracie said with a sigh.</p><p>He took a bite, chewed, then swallowed. \u201cWant to tell me the secret to your success?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted cake this good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSorry, no. Besides, you don\u2019t strike me as the baking type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He pointed at the article from People. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were famous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not yet, but I\u2019m becoming better known. That\u2019s nice. More work, but I can handle it.\u201d She glanced over at her schedule. \u201cAt least for now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you thought any more about expanding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had time. I think it would be exciting to be a big company doing wedding cakes all over the world. Then I remember how much I enjoy talking to my customers, figuring out the perfect cake for them and then making it myself. Do I want to give that up? Plus are couples really interested in a cake from a big company?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere are a lot of options between doing everything yourself and being multinational.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d</p><p>He finished his cake and reached for his mug of coffee. Gracie took a moment to mentally pinch herself. Riley Whitefield was in her kitchen, visiting. Just talking and smiling. After all the years she\u2019d had a crush on him, and then even more years of completely not thinking about him, it was strange to be here now, with him. What would her mother\u2019s octogenarian neighbor have to say about it?</p><p>She winced. \u201cMaybe we should have pulled your car into the garage,\u201d she said.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cWorried about your reputation?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much. This is Los Lobos and I\u2019m who I am and you\u2019re, well, you know who you are.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have for a long time now.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGood point. I\u2019m just saying that if people knew you were here....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019d talk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. And you don\u2019t want that any more than I do. For me, it\u2019s just a matter of everyone questioning my mental capacity, but you have an election to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you kicking me out?\u201d</p><p>He looked good sitting in her kitchen. Handsome, masculine. She got a little shiver in her belly every time she looked at him. Which meant if she was actually attracted to him, she would be in big trouble. But she wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Still, when he stood and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you walk me out?\u201d she couldn\u2019t help the flicker of anticipation that rippled through her, and as she trailed after him, she took a moment to appreciate the great butt Jill had mentioned on their lunch date.</p><p>He stopped by the front door and faced her. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any answers. Not about Zeke or Pam or who took the picture.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere were always rumors of alien landings up on the bluff. Maybe they\u2019re responsible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s it.\u201d</p><p>As he spoke, he stared deeply into her eyes. There was an intensity to his gaze that made her swallow hard. She felt unable to look away\u2014like a small creature trapped by a predator. Only she had a feeling her fate was going to be a lot more thrilling than any field mouse.</p><p>\u201cWere you always this pretty?\u201d he asked as he reached out and cupped her cheek and jaw. \u201cWeren\u2019t you skinny back then, with braces?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. I had quite the ugly duckling phase. It lasted six long, painful years.\u201d</p><p>His fingers were warm and gentle against her skin. Her heart rate had increased to a beat per second far more normal for a hummingbird than a twenty-eight-year-old woman who knew better.</p><p>\u201cYou used to watch me,\u201d he said, moving a little closer. \u201cI remember those big, blue eyes following my every move. You scared the hell out of me back then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApology accepted,\u201d he murmured right before he bent down and kissed her.</p><p>A part of Gracie\u2019s brain refused to comprehend this was happening. There was no way Riley was in her house, kissing her. The cosmos simply didn\u2019t work that way. Yet she felt the tender brush of his lips against hers, along with the accompanying tingles as her body responded. She felt his hand leave her cheek as he wrapped both arms around her and drew her close.</p><p>She went because she wanted to and found herself pressing against him.</p><p>They\u2019d hugged before. In the car when she\u2019d lost it and he\u2019d been so kind. But this was different. This was body against body, her arms around his neck, breasts flattening, thighs brushing and her tilting her head to make the kiss go on forever.</p><p>He read her mind\u2014or maybe he wanted it, too\u2014because he settled his mouth on hers as if he had no intention of moving. Heat blossomed inside of her and seeped into every cell. She breathed in the scent of him, felt the smooth texture of his shirt beneath her fingers and the thick, strong muscles that tightened.</p><p>When he teased her bottom lip with his tongue, she had the sudden thought that this was destiny. As she parted for him, she told herself it was closer to insanity. But when he swept inside to claim her, she couldn\u2019t think at all.</p><p>He moved with the confidence of a man used to pleasing a woman. He tasted of coffee and sugary frosting and something else even more delicious. As he explored her mouth, he rubbed his hands up and down her back, drawing her closer, making her want to arch against him and purr.</p><p>One hand slipped down to her butt and cupped the curve. When his fingers squeezed, she suddenly wanted more than just a kiss. Need swept through her, making her swell, making her weep, making her want him. And just like a man, he decided that was the moment to stop kissing her.</p><p>He pulled back a little and looked into her eyes. \u201cThat was something,\u201d he said.</p><p>She liked that he sounded a little breathless, as if he\u2019d been caught off guard by the passion as well.</p><p>He brushed a loose strand of hair off her forehead, then kissed her lightly. \u201cYou\u2019re not in my plan,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cYou have a plan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me what it is?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to tell me the secret ingredient to your cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. No. So how do I get in the way?\u201d</p><p>He cupped her face in both hands and pressed his mouth against hers. Instantly liquid desire made her want to melt.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s how,\u201d he said as he withdrew. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this, Gracie. I have rules and one of them says the woman in question is easily forgotten. We both know you\u2019re not that.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hands flat against his chest. \u201cAre you referring to my stalker girl past? Haven\u2019t we talked about you letting that go?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with your past. Good night.\u201d</p><p>He opened the door and walked away. She stood there for a good three minutes as she replayed their conversation, and the kiss. Then she shut the door and twirled through the small living room.</p><p>In the words of Sally Fields (sort of) at the Academy Awards\u2014He liked her. He really liked her.</p><p>DOING HER BEST not to think about the kiss interspersed with castigating herself for thinking about it had kept Gracie up most of the night. The good news was she completed all the dots and roses she needed for the wedding cake. The better news was the kiss had been about a million times more fabulous than what she\u2019d imagined all those years ago, and she sure had done her share of imagining. The bad news was she was dead on her feet by the time dawn arrived and she heard the thunk of the local paper being tossed onto her porch.</p><p>She tightened the belt on her robe and opened the front door. After pushing her hair out of her face, she shuffled to the edge of the porch and picked up the paper. She was back inside before she\u2019d pulled it out of its protective plastic wrap and flipped it open.</p><p>Her shriek was involuntary, as was her anger and sense of disbelief. This could not be happening! It was impossible. It was grossly unfair. It was there in black and white.</p><p>The front page of the Los Lobos Daily News showed a somewhat grainy but very viewable picture of Riley and herself standing in the middle of the motel parking lot and holding hands. They both looked incredibly startled\u2014which was about the flash, not getting caught, but no one looking at the picture would know that.</p><p>Just as bad as the picture, was the headline. \u201cMayoral Candidate Caught in Love Nest.\u201d Even worse was the note that a reprinting of the fourteen-year-old \u201cGracie Chronicles\u201d could be found starting on page nineteen.</p><p>Gracie rolled up the paper and pounded it against the wall. \u201cWhy? Why? Why? What is going on?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t have any answers, which only made her more frustrated. She paced the house, then, with sleep impossible, showered and dressed for the day.</p><p>A quick glance at the clock told her it was barely after seven. What time did Riley get up? She didn\u2019t know his number so she was going to have to head over to his house. She wanted to catch him before he left for the bank. But she wasn\u2019t excited about the thought of her car being parked in his driveway. Not now. Not when\u2014</p><p>Her cell phone rang. Wary about who could be calling at this hour, she let it ring twice more before answering with a cautious, \u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Riley. Did I wake you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I haven\u2019t been to sleep yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDid you see the paper?\u201d</p><p>They spoke at the same time. Gracie sank onto a kitchen chair.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she moaned. \u201cThis is horrible. What\u2019s going on and who\u2019s behind it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have a whole list of suspects,\u201d he said, sounding grim. \u201cEveryone from the mayor to Pam.\u201d</p><p>She processed that information. \u201cI agree Pam could have something to do with it, having lured us to that motel in the first place, but why would she bother?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t a clue. Maybe she\u2019s secretly hated me all these years. Yardley has to be annoyed I\u2019m up in the polls. Of course after this morning, that may change.\u201d</p><p>The mayor? Gracie didn\u2019t know anything about him. \u201cAre you saying the mayor could have convinced Pam to drive to that motel, then turned the lights out and while putting a photographer in place, all the while hoping we would follow her, get out of the car, walk around and be in exactly the right place for an incriminating photo?\u201d</p><p>There was a moment of silence followed by a chuckle. \u201cYou\u2019ve cut right to the heart of the matter. That sounds pretty improbable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course that doesn\u2019t leave us with many theories.\u201d She grabbed the paper and smoothed it out on the table. \u201cI can\u2019t believe this happened. I\u2019m involved in a sex scandal. Do you know what my mother is going to have to say about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomehow I doubt that\u2019s the worst of your problems. Did you read the description of me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She quickly scanned the short article. \u201cRiley Whitefield, a man who wears an earring. Are you kidding? There\u2019s no mention of you running the bank or anything nice. I\u2019m guessing the newspaper editor isn\u2019t a fan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cApparently not. Plus the \u2018Gracie Chronicles\u2019 dig up the past. Anyone who didn\u2019t know the story does now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be good.\u201d She propped her elbows on the table and rested her forehead on her free hand. \u201cDo you have any idea of how people are going to run with this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis town.\u201d She felt her stomach start to churn and looked around for her bottle of Tums. \u201cEveryone is going to think we\u2019re getting together after all these years. Don\u2019t forget, I\u2019m a legend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich makes me what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe object of my affections. Oh, God, this is so humiliating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>FRANKLIN YARDLEY enjoyed his mornings. The quiet, the perfect cup of coffee and the fact that his wife, Sandra, rarely came downstairs before ten.</p><p>This morning, however, had been particularly invigorating. The picture on the front page of the paper had put a bounce in his step.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d Holly said as he entered the reception area outside of his office.</p> <p>She rose, took his coat and briefcase, then followed him into his office where a fresh pot of coffee awaited.</p><p>\u201cDid you see the paper?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. What was Whitefield up to? I read the whole article,\u201d she said. \u201cGracie Landon was one scary teenager.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Franklin rubbed his hands together. \u201cAn odd girl. But she very well may turn out to be an unexpected asset. With the \u2018Gracie Chronicles\u2019 reprinted, everyone will want to take her side in whatever happens with Riley.\u201d</p><p>Holly frowned. \u201cShe sounds mentally unstable.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s recently returned to town, she and Riley have become an item. I\u2019m going to have to think how to use this to my advantage.\u201d</p><p>He settled into his custom-made leather chair. Holly perched on the desk, the skirt of her navy suit sliding up to the top of her thigh. He allowed himself a moment of distraction as he rubbed his hand against her smooth, young, warm skin.</p><p>\u201cLunch?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d</p><p>So would he. Not that either of them would be having a meal.</p><p>She picked up the paper. \u201cIf this Gracie person had a thing for him and she\u2019s a legend, does that mean people won\u2019t like him if he isn\u2019t interested in her?\u201d</p> <p>Franklin leaned back in his chair and let the moment of contentment wash over him. Of course. It could be just that simple.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re even more intelligent than you are beautiful,\u201d he said sincerely. \u201cI\u2019m a lucky man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can use that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I can challenge Riley Whitefield to a debate and insist we discuss the family values that are so important to the good citizens of this town.\u201d</p><p>GRACIE SLID the cake into the oven and set the timer. She\u2019d barely begun collecting her dirty utensils when she heard someone knocking on the front door.</p><p>Her hormones immediately sent up a \u201cyes\u201d vote for it to be Riley. Most of her body agreed. But the sensible part of Gracie\u2019s brain knew that seeing him again so quickly after last night would be nothing but a mistake. She needed time to come to terms with what had happened. She needed to put it behind her, to focus on her future and not on a dark, handsome, former bad-boy who made her toes curl.</p><p>Fortunately, when she opened the door, she realized that worrying about Riley wasn\u2019t going to be a problem. Unfortunately, the visitor was her mother.</p><p>Lily Landon stood on the wrong side of fifty, but she had great genes and a fabulous hairdresser who kept the gray at bay. She worked hard and worried, which showed around her eyes, but the rest of her could easily pass for a much younger woman. Gracie thought about mentioning how great her mother looked in her trim jeans and brightly colored T-shirt, but the other woman\u2019s forbidding expression told her to keep her compliments to herself.</p> <p>\u201cGrace Amelia Louise Landon, how could you?\u201d her mother asked as she stomped into the house. \u201cI\u2019m speechless. I\u2019ve had the entire morning to figure out what I was going to say to you and I still can\u2019t think of a single thing.\u201d</p><p>Gracie hated the disappointment in her mother\u2019s voice more than the actual words themselves. She was still feeling frail about the whole not-being-asked-to-be-in-the-wedding thing and she didn\u2019t need this.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what it looks like,\u201d she said, knowing it sounded totally feeble.</p><p>\u201cI see. You weren\u2019t sneaking around at some motel last night with Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>Gracie closed the front door and led the way to the kitchen. \u201cWe were, but it was because of Alexis. Have you talked to her? She\u2019s convinced Zeke is having an affair with Pam and asked me to help find out if it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with anything? Alexis has been crazy about what Zeke does with his time since they got married. So don\u2019t use that as an excuse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I...She didn\u2019t...\u201d Gracie felt like a fish gasping on a dock. \u201cAre you saying Alexis made it up?\u201d</p><p>Her mother dismissed the question with an impatient shrug. \u201cI don\u2019t know. She\u2019s always been overly concerned. Zeke adores her, although sometimes I question how he can stand her, what with her dramatic proclamations.\u201d</p><p>Gracie sank into the nearest chair and tried to take it all in. This couldn\u2019t be true, could it? \u201cI\u2019ve been running around like a crazy person in a misguided attempt to help my sister and you\u2019re informing me that she\u2019s making the whole thing up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat isn\u2019t my point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe not, but it\u2019s mine. The picture in the paper, trying to follow Zeke....\u201d If this was her new life, she wanted a chance to exchange it for someone else\u2019s. She clutched her suddenly churning stomach. \u201cRiley\u2019s going to kill me when he finds this out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019d better find it out from someone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Her mother glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s been fourteen years. I had hoped with all the time away and some therapy that you\u2019d get over him. Obviously that hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d</p><p>The unfairness of the accusation cut Gracie like a knife. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I\u2019m not chasing around after Riley.\u201d</p><p>Her mother pointed at the newspaper on the counter. \u201cAll evidence to the contrary. You never had any sense where he was concerned. It was bad enough we had to send you away so he and Pam could have a normal wedding without anyone worrying that you would somehow destroy it. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. You were all anyone talked about for weeks. You were a joke. That\u2019s why I sent you away. The newspaper isn\u2019t helping by reprinting those old stories. Do you want to have to go through that again? Haven\u2019t you learned anything?\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt small and broken. She wanted to curl up and disappear. Instead she stood and reached for her bottle of Tums.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed,\u201d she said quietly. \u201cIf you\u2019d spent any time with me in the past fourteen years, you would know that. Of course if I\u2019d grown up here, I would have known that Alexis is a drama queen and not fallen in with her plans.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s gaze narrowed. \u201cI see. Now it\u2019s my fault. That\u2019s just so typical. When in doubt, blame the mother. I did what I did for you. Not that I expect any gratitude. That would be too much, I know. But maybe, just maybe you can have a little compassion for my position in town here. Do you know what it\u2019s like to go to the store day after day and listen to my customers making fun of my daughter? It\u2019s humiliating.\u201d</p><p>Lily turned and walked toward the front door. \u201cI mean it, Gracie. Stay away from Riley. Give the poor man a chance to live his life without you always getting in the way. It was sad enough when you were fourteen, but now it\u2019s just pathetic.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>GRACIE WENT TO BED. It seemed the safest place. So for two days she didn\u2019t get dressed, shower or even answer her phone. Aside from the occasional scoop of tuna salad and using the bathroom, the only time she got up was to pack up the wedding cake she\u2019d just finished for the delivery guy late Thursday.</p><p>But on Friday morning, she couldn\u2019t stand herself anymore. Self-pity had never been all that interesting and she\u2019d just put in her limit for the decade. So she cleaned up, ate a good breakfast and headed out to the brightly painted offices of Dr. Rhonda Fleming, DDS.</p><p>Dr. Fleming specialized in pediatric dentistry, so the waiting room was filled with several anxious children and their reassuring moms. Gracie ignored them, the underwater mural and the shiny copies of Sports Illustrated for Kids. She walked to the reception desk and asked to speak to her sister.</p><p>Two minutes later she\u2019d been shown back into Alexis\u2019s tiny office where she spent her days battling with insurance companies and assuring coproviders that little Johnny did indeed need braces.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Alexis asked.</p><p>Gracie studied her sister\u2019s face looking for similarities and differences. At one time she and Alexis had been the close sisters. Vivian had seemed young and not very bright, so the two older girls had always played. But after Gracie left, that had changed. Somewhere along the way, she\u2019d become the odd one out.</p><p>\u201cI spoke with Mom a couple of days ago,\u201d Gracie said, doing her best not to remember how horrible and humiliated she\u2019d felt after that visit.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s really fried about that newspaper picture,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cHonestly, Gracie, it was really stupid of you to get caught.\u201d</p><p>Gracie held on to her temper with all her will and did her best not to lose track of her purpose for being here.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that right now. What interests me is that Mom told me you\u2019ve always been high-strung where Zeke is concerned. That you\u2019ve been worried about him having an affair for years when, in fact, he adores you.\u201d</p><p>She watched emotions skitter across her sister\u2019s face, as if Alexis couldn\u2019t decide what to say.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cSo far my visit back here makes me wish I was an orphan. Just tell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>Alexis pressed her lips together. \u201cThere are some charges on e-Bay, and I did see him with Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut....\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere could be another woman. He\u2019s always gone and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gracie grabbed her sister\u2019s arm. \u201cDammit, Alexis, be straight with me. Were you just off having a tantrum?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><p>Gracie waited.</p><p>Her sister tugged free and folded her arms over her chest. \u201cOkay. Maybe sometimes I sort of overreact, but not this time.\u201d</p><p>Gracie groaned. \u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI mean it. I really think there\u2019s somebody else.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stood. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m not going to help you anymore. Don\u2019t ask me, don\u2019t even hint at it. If you have a problem with your husband, take it up with him and leave me out of it.\u201d</p><p>Alexis sniffed. \u201cYou\u2019re my sister. I would think you\u2019d be more understanding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019d be wrong.\u201d</p><p>ONE OF THE BEST parts of being the boss was that nobody screwed with him. Riley knew he could walk through the bank without hearing a whisper directed at him. He figured all his employees were having a field day with the newspaper picture behind his back, but he didn\u2019t care about that. As long as they didn\u2019t say anything to his face, he was fine.</p><p>The one person who might have the balls to confront him hadn\u2019t said a word in the past two days. But when Diane appeared in his office late that morning, he wondered if his good fortune had run out.</p><p>\u201cGood news or bad news?\u201d he asked, pointing at the folder in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to claim either,\u201d she said. \u201cZeke Bridges sent this over. Mayor Yardley is challenging you to a debate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? Could be fun.\u201d Riley took the folder and flipped through the contents. He scanned the mayor\u2019s press release.</p><p>\u201cMayor Yardley thinks we should discuss the issues, along with the morals so near and dear to the hearts of our citizens.\u201d</p><p>Respectability. Why was that always at the center of everything?</p><p>He looked at his secretary, taking in her stern expression and unyielding posture.</p><p>\u201cThink I have a chance?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cPeople around here would like you more if you\u2019d donate the money for the new children\u2019s wing for the hospital.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cYou don\u2019t give up, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot when it\u2019s this important.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He held up a hand before she could get on a roll. \u201cSpare me the lecture on the needy children and how they could all be saved.\u201d</p><p>Her response was a disapproving sniff. Chances were he had not won the heart or vote of the fair Diane.</p><p>\u201cThanks for bringing me this,\u201d he said and set the folder on the desk.</p> <p>She turned to leave, but he called her back before she could.</p><p>\u201cI have a question,\u201d he told her. \u201cI would like you to be honest with me.\u201d</p><p>She nodded regally. \u201cI always am.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Did you enjoy working for my uncle?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was a fair employer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you like him?\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cLiking or not liking isn\u2019t part of my job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed, but you still have feelings and opinions. What did you think of him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re more like him than you think.\u201d</p><p>It was the second time someone had said that to him in the past week, and Riley didn\u2019t like hearing it this time any more than he had before.</p><p>GRACIE RETURNED to her rental house to find her cell phone on the table, where she\u2019d accidentally left it. There was one message, which she listened to.</p> <p>\u201cHi, Gracie. It\u2019s Melissa Morgan from the Los Lobos Heritage Society. I\u2019d really like to talk to you. Give me a call.\u201d</p><p>The woman left her number, which Gracie reluctantly wrote down, before calling her back. Melissa Morgan had sounded far too chipper in her message and Gracie didn\u2019t trust that for a second.</p><p>The woman picked up on the first ring and Gracie identified herself.</p><p>\u201cOh, you\u2019re a doll for calling me back,\u201d Melissa said in one of those high-pitched voices that could easily crack glass. \u201cHere\u2019s the thing. We all know your mom and have heard about your little cake-baking business and we were thinking it would just be so incredibly sweet if you made our cake for us. She suggested it, actually. We\u2019re having a fund-raiser for the Historical Society. The old Strathern place has been completely redone, back to its original elegance. You know the Stratherns, don\u2019t you. The judge and his daughter Jill. Of course she\u2019s Jill Kendrick now that she\u2019s married the sheriff and all. What a beautiful wedding they had. Anyway, about the cake. We were thinking something simple to serve about three hundred. How many sheet cakes would that be?\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt her chest tighten in sympathy. The woman had barely stopped for breath. Then the reality of what she\u2019d said sunk in. No, no, no. She didn\u2019t want to do this. Yuck.</p><p>\u201cYou want sheet cakes?\u201d she asked, hoping she didn\u2019t sound as horrified as she felt. \u201cYou know I make wedding cakes, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. That\u2019s what your mom said. But a little round cake wouldn\u2019t serve very many, would it?\u201d</p><p>A little round cake? Gracie thought about pounding her head against the wall until she caused enough brain damage to create amnesia. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if she forgot this entire town existed? Because saying no wasn\u2019t an option.</p> <p>\u201cI can do something a little nicer than a sheet cake and still serve three hundred,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me work up some sketches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Melissa said. \u201cJust something simple and yummy.\u201d There was a slight pause. \u201cDid you want us to pay you for this? Your mom said you wouldn\u2019t and we don\u2019t want to be rude or anything, but our budget is kind of tight.\u201d</p><p>Of course it was, Gracie thought, eyeing the wall. Her mother might be disappointed by her Gracie\u2019s behavior, but she thought nothing of volunteering her daughter\u2019s time and energy. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It will be my contribution.\u201d</p><p>She would keep detailed records of her supplies and more importantly, her time, then submit it as a charitable deduction on her taxes.</p><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you just the sweetest thing. The event is Sunday, June 5th. Oh, that\u2019s only a couple of days before the election.\u201d Melissa laughed. \u201cI know this was ages ago and your mom really doesn\u2019t like anyone talking about it, but I have to tell you that I was in Riley\u2019s grade in high school. We all got a real kick out of some of the things you did. You sure knew how to get your man.\u201d</p><p>Gracie was grateful not to have to fake a smile. She thought about pointing out that she\u2019d never in fact gotten her man and that she\u2019d probably emotionally scarred him for life.</p><p>Instead she made a few polite noises and quickly got off the phone.</p><p>\u201cI have to kill myself now,\u201d she murmured when she\u2019d dropped her cell into her purse.</p><p>Instead of reaching for a sharp knife, she crossed to her baking schedule and figured out how, exactly, she was going to squeeze in a cake for three hundred right in the middle of wedding season. Despite Melissa\u2019s desire for a sheet cake, Gracie simply couldn\u2019t do that. She would have to come up with a simple, yet elegant design that would....</p><p>Someone knocked on her front door. Gracie glanced over her shoulder and thought about not answering it, but with her luck, the person in question wouldn\u2019t go away.</p><p>She braced herself for another attack from a family member or an adorable child asking her to bake something for the local orphanage and pulled open the door.</p><p>It was worse than she\u2019d imagined.</p><p>Fourteen years ago Gracie\u2019s one goal in her small, teenaged life had been to get Riley to notice her. She hadn\u2019t liked it when he\u2019d dated all kinds of girls, but she consoled herself with the fact that no one had ever caught his attention. Until Pam. Once he\u2019d started going out with that beautiful, blond cheerleader, he\u2019d stopped dating the masses. Gracie had been crushed and had launched her campaign to keep the young lovers apart.</p><p>Obviously their getting married had proved how unsuccessful that campaign had been. Their divorce a few months later had been too little, too late.</p><p>Since then she\u2019d done all that she could to put her past behind her. So coming face-to-face with it now didn\u2019t make her want to hula for joy.</p><p>\u201cWow! Gracie. Hi!\u201d Pam Whitefield grinned like a Cheshire cat. \u201cYou look great. Welcome back to Los Lobos. How are you?\u201d</p><p>Pam\u2019s obvious delight and bright, cheery voice made Gracie want to turn around and see who stood behind her, because there was no way Pam could have all this enthusiasm for her.</p><p>\u201cUh, Pam. Hi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Pam asked, breezing past her and walking into the small living room. \u201cHow have you been? Oh, I saw that article in People magazine and I was just thrilled for you. You\u2019re famous. Isn\u2019t that fabulous?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was excited.\u201d</p><p>Gracie spent her life in the kitchen and she dressed casually\u2014khakis, polo shirts, comfortable shoes. Pam was four years older, but didn\u2019t look it. Her elegant tailored slacks fit her in such a way that she seemed to be about as big around as a pencil. A silk sweater clung to a narrow waist and slightly oversized breasts.</p><p>Gracie fit right in with the California clich\u00e9 of a blue-eyed blonde, but compared with Pam\u2019s gleaming hair and perfectly made-up face, she was positively dull. Pam\u2019s short blond hair moved with the easy elegance of a movie star\u2019s. There wasn\u2019t a wrinkle anywhere\u2014not on her face or her outfit\u2014and her shoes screamed designer. If Pam was the ideal, then Gracie fell right in line to be the cautionary tale.</p><p>As Gracie had spent enough of the past two days feeling badly about herself, she decided the best way to break the mood was to get Pam the hell out of here.</p><p>\u201cSo you stopped by why?\u201d she asked with a smile, trying not to think that there was a very small chance this woman was having an affair with her brother-in-law. Gracie still didn\u2019t completely believe Alexis, but she couldn\u2019t dismiss the fact that Zeke had lied about where he was and had disappeared for long periods of time with no explanation.</p><p>\u201cI have a proposition for you. I know you probably have dozens and dozens of cakes to bake. I know you\u2019re just back for a few weeks and I thought....\u201d Pam squeezed her Coach bag and shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>It was the cue to invite her to sit down and serve refreshments. Gracie resisted as long as she could before motioning to the sofa and excusing herself so she could dash into the kitchen and rustle up a slice of cake and some diet soda.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to be opening a bed-and-breakfast in a few weeks,\u201d Pam said. \u201cI had to do a lot of remodeling, which is nearing completion. I started with the kitchen and it\u2019s finished now. Not that I have any use for it. So I was thinking, if you want to come out and take a look at it, that would be great.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stared at her. \u201cWhy would I be interested in your kitchen?\u201d</p><p>Pam, who had only moved crumbs around on her plate and had yet to take a bite, laughed. \u201cOh, silly me. I didn\u2019t get to the proposition part. I want you to rent my kitchen. I have two industrial ovens and plenty of counter space. With all the cakes you have to bake, I thought you might be interested. I won\u2019t be opening until after your sister\u2019s wedding, so you could have the run of the place at all hours.\u201d</p><p>Gracie\u2019s first thought was to ask how Pam knew about Vivian\u2019s on-again, off-again wedding. Then she remembered this was Los Lobos, where everybody knew every little thing about everyone else.</p><p>Her second thought was complete oven-envy at the thought of new large appliances that didn\u2019t cook hot and never quite got the left side of the cake exactly right without her turning the pan every ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cHow much do you want?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come take a look and if you\u2019re interested, we can negotiate terms.\u201d</p><p>Pam smiled with just the right amount of casualness, as if willing Gracie to trust her. Gracie didn\u2019t trust anyone who wouldn\u2019t even take a bite of her cake. Okay, yes, there were calories, but a taste wouldn\u2019t hurt. Still, new ovens and a chance to keep a close eye on Pam really tempted her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to take a look,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time is good for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019M SURE there\u2019s an explanation,\u201d Jill said as she slid into the booth at Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill.</p><p>\u201cFor almost everything except those magic twenty numbers they\u2019re always talking about in string theory, and why socks can escape from the dryer,\u201d Gracie told her.</p><p>\u201cI was actually talking about this.\u201d</p><p>Her friend put a copy of the newspaper on the table.</p><p>\u201cOh, that,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI wondered why I didn\u2019t hear from you when it came out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you might be flooded with well-wishers.\u201d Jill raised her eyebrows. \u201cPlease tell me you weren\u2019t in a motel with Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe weren\u2019t technically in anything except their parking lot. You can see from the photo that we\u2019re clearly outside.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Just like her life.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have any appointments until three,\u201d Jill said, leaning back in the booth. \u201cI had Tina clear my calendar.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me.\u201d</p><p>Gracie quickly filled Jill in on the ill-fated attempt to follow Pam.</p><p>\u201cSo you followed Pam and the guy with the camera followed you,\u201d Jill said after they\u2019d placed their order. \u201cWho sent him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea. I want to say Pam because I never liked her, but why would she care? The mayor, of course. If he\u2019s trying to discredit Riley in the election by stirring up the past. But how would the mayor know where we were going to be or that we\u2019d be doing something photo-worthy? It\u2019s so confusing. To complicate the situation, Pam came to see me.\u201d</p><p>Jill paused in the act of picking up a chip. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope. She wants to rent me her kitchen in the new bed-and-breakfast she\u2019s building or refurbishing. I can\u2019t remember which. I\u2019m supposed to go see her this afternoon. She says she has professional-grade appliances and I can rent from her while I\u2019m here.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDo you want to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave anything to do with her? No. Have access to her kitchen? You bet. I can barely fit my largest pan in the oven I have now. The heat isn\u2019t even, it runs hot. Sure, I\u2019m tempted, but this is Pam. I don\u2019t like her and I don\u2019t trust her. Is she setting me up? Did she set Riley up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what they say\u2014keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood point. I\u2019m not sure I can work around her, though. She creeps me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could overfeed her and make her fat. That would be fun.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. She sat in my house with a slice of cake in front of her and didn\u2019t take a bite. That\u2019s just not natural.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgreed. What are you going to do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook at the kitchen and see if I can be bought. I suspect I can be.\u201d</p> <p>Jill watched her. \u201cThere\u2019s something else. What aren\u2019t you telling me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I...\u201d Gracie shook her head. \u201cExcept for seeing you, I\u2019m really sorry I came back. There\u2019s so much family stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI feel weird, like I don\u2019t fit in.\u201d She reached for her diet soda. \u201cMakes sense, I know. I\u2019ve been gone forever and Vivian and Alexis grew up without me. We\u2019ve had different life experiences, different memories. Technically, I\u2019m still their sister, but emotionally I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a real member of the family.\u201d</p><p>Jill looked distressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. They care about you and you care about them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue. Although I\u2019m rapidly losing patience with both of them. Sometime while my back was turned, Alexis turned into a drama queen and Vivian seems to be following in her footsteps.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie told her about the on-again, off-again wedding. \u201cVivian\u2019s fighting with Tom every fifteen seconds, apparently Alexis has been crazy, and not in a good way, about what Zeke does with his time since they got married. My mother seems borderline normal, but she came over and read me the riot act after she saw the newspaper picture.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t go into detail about what her mother had said\u2014she was still dealing with that herself.</p><p>\u201cMy life has become complicated.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like.\u201d Jill leaned forward. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already doing it. Having you to talk to is great. And I\u2019m now officially bored with me being the topic of conversation. What\u2019s going on in your world?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEmily is counting the days until school is out. I think there are officially thirty-four, but I would have to check the calendar in the kitchen to be sure. We\u2019re making all kinds of plans for summer, including a trip to Florida to visit my dad. He and Em get along great. I\u2019m not sure which is more exciting to her\u2014a visit with her favorite, and only, grandfather, or a chance to go to Disney World.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, tough choice.\u201d</p><p>Jill picked up her iced tea, then set it down. She traced a pattern on the brightly colored paper placemat.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gracie asked with a smile. \u201cYou have a secret you\u2019re dying to spill. I can tell. Come on. You can trust me.\u201d</p><p>Jill nodded. \u201cI know. It\u2019s not that, it\u2019s just...\u201d She bit her lower lip, then blushed. \u201cMac and I are thinking we\u2019ll start trying for a baby.\u201d</p><p>Gracie laughed. \u201cReally! That\u2019s so cool. Is there a timetable?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to start this month. I\u2019m excited, but a little nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll be a great mom. You\u2019re terrific with Emily.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI adore her,\u201d Jill admitted. \u201cBut by the time I met her, she had all the basics down. I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019ll handle a baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPretty much like every other new mother. With a lot of love, patience and fear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Mac\u2019s hoping for a boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTypical.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could go with either. So I\u2019m excited and scared, which is an interesting combination.\u201d</p><p>Gracie held up her glass. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but you will be. Yeah. I finally get to be an aunt.\u201d</p><p>LUNCH WITH Jill had gone a long way to brighten Gracie\u2019s spirits. Even a visit to Pam\u2019s bed-and-breakfast and a fast-paced negotiating session hadn\u2019t upset her mood. She thought about driving directly back to the rental house, but she still had one thing she needed to do, even if she would rather have a root canal.</p><p>But it couldn\u2019t be put off much longer, so she drove to the center of town and parked her car on a side street. After locking it, she walked down First Avenue, past the bank building. She eyed the well-kept building, noted the entrance and carefully ignored it.</p><p>Over the next five minutes, she paced in front of the bank three times more, trying to gather the courage to actually go inside. She\u2019d been here once before, but this was different. Just when she\u2019d convinced herself to deliver the information by phone, a well-dressed woman in a tweed suit walked out of the bank and directly up to her.</p><p>\u201cGracie Landon?\u201d</p><p>Gracie froze in midstep. Oh, please, oh, please let it not be someone wanting to talk about her, or her past or the newspaper picture.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Mr. Whitefield\u2019s secretary. He asked me to come out and escort you into his office.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced as she glanced up at the square three-story building. \u201cLet me guess\u2014his office faces this way and he saw me loitering.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. Wasn\u2019t that just her life?</p><p>She followed Riley\u2019s secretary through the bank and up the elevator to the top floor, where she was shown into a large office dominated by a massive painting of an older gentleman in an uncomfortable-looking suit.</p><p>Gracie figured it was safer to keep her attention on the portrait, rather than the man sitting behind the desk in front of her. She pointed.</p><p>\u201cYour uncle?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m told I\u2019m a lot like him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good.\u201d She gave up on her mini art-appreciation course and looked at Riley. \u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t stalking or doing anything like that. I was nervous about coming to see you so I was trying to make up my mind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat did you decide?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat it would be better if I phoned.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sank into the leather chair in front of his desk and set her purse on her lap. She dug around inside until she found her travel bottle of antacids, then popped two in her mouth and chewed.</p><p>He looked good, she thought mournfully. She didn\u2019t know if it was the elegant suit, the contrast between his dark hair and his white shirt, or the power tie, but he was definitely the man in charge.</p><p>\u201cYou take a lot of those,\u201d he said, pointing at the small bottle in her hand.</p><p>\u201cI have a sensitive stomach. It reacts to stress.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you seen a doctor about the problem?\u201d</p><p>She dropped the bottle back into her purse. \u201cAre you kidding? Any doctor would want to do all kinds of really gross tests. Plus, what if there\u2019s something wrong? I don\u2019t want to know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut then you could get it fixed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could find out I have some horrible, disfiguring disease.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could this be disfiguring?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue, but if it\u2019s possible, it will happen to me.\u201d She set her purse on the floor. \u201cLook, this isn\u2019t why I stopped by. Can I talk about that?\u201d</p><p>He leaned back in his chair. \u201cBe my guest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d Although now that she had his attention, she wasn\u2019t sure what to do with it. \u201cI just...\u201d She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI thought....\u201d</p><p>He pushed a pad of paper in her direction. \u201cWould it help to write it down?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Okay. I have a couple of things. First, about my sister. I found out that she tends to exaggerate things. Especially where Zeke is concerned. I\u2019m not sure anything is going on with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course there is.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d expected Riley to be annoyed or accuse her of making the whole thing up, not that he would disagree. \u201cHow do you figure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe told me. When I confronted him about what he was doing, he admitted being up to something but swore it had nothing to do with his marriage and that it wasn\u2019t illegal. He said there wasn\u2019t another woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right.\u201d She\u2019d forgotten that. \u201cBut the no-affair thing means we don\u2019t have to follow him anymore, right? Or if you want to, that\u2019s fine. I just don\u2019t want to. I hope he\u2019s not sleeping with Pam. That would be too...Yuck. And speaking of Pam, she came to visit me today and offered to rent me her new industrial kitchen in the bed-and-breakfast and even though I really don\u2019t want to be involved in any of this anymore, I figured I could use the kitchen and maybe keep an eye on her. From a distance. Sort of.\u201d</p><p>Riley stood and walked around his desk. He might not have understood half of what Gracie said, but he recognized a bruised spirit when he saw one. Someone, somewhere, had done a number on her.</p><p>He perched on the edge of the desk close to her chair. \u201cTell me about Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knows I bake cakes and she offered me her ovens. For a price. I went over and saw the layout. It\u2019s pretty fabulous. So we agreed on rent and I\u2019ll be baking there. I can sort of keep an eye on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Sounds like a plan. Who rained on your parade?\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. Pain tightened the lines around her mouth and darkened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cNo one. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie, don\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter. Something happened.\u201d</p><p>She swallowed. \u201cI just...\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy mom came to see me a couple of days ago. She wasn\u2019t happy about the picture in the paper or the article rehashing our past. She said it was going to start up talk again and that me chasing after you when I\u2019d been a teenager had been bad enough, but now it was just pathetic.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her chin and stared at the ground. \u201cI was thinking it would better if we didn\u2019t try any more investigating together. You know. So people won\u2019t talk. I can handle a lot of things, but pathetic isn\u2019t one of them. Between being back here and my cake orders and my sisters and everything....\u201d</p><p>She wound down like an old-fashioned music box. Riley did his best to avoid emotions\u2014especially those belonging to Gracie, but he could no more ignore what she was going through now than he could have run her over when she\u2019d thrown herself in front of his car fourteen years ago.</p><p>He leaned down and grabbed her hands, then pulled her to her feet. Before she could speak, he drew her close and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cFamilies will screw you every time,\u201d he murmured into her hair. \u201cLook at what my uncle\u2019s doing to me.\u201d</p><p>She shuddered, then rested her forehead on his shoulder. \u201cI never thought that before, and I don\u2019t want to think it now, but maybe you\u2019re right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course I\u2019m right.\u201d</p><p>That made her chuckle.</p><p>As much as he liked holding her close, he let her go and reached up to cup her face in both his hands.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not pathetic,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one thinks you are. If your mom is telling you that, she\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t know what bug got up her ass, but it\u2019s not your problem. Understand?\u201d</p><p>She nodded without speaking. He had a really bad feeling she was seconds from bursting into tears. He tried to be strong, but like every other guy in the universe, he would do just about anything to keep a woman from crying. So he did the only thing he could think of to distract her. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He kissed her.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>THIS WAS SO not a good idea, Gracie thought, even as she wrapped her arms around Riley. She was supposed to be pulling back, staying away from him, being strong and....</p> <p>Screw it, she thought as she closed her eyes so she could give herself over to his kiss. He smelled good, he felt good and he tasted good. What kind of idiot walked away from that?</p><p>His fingers caressed her face even as he tilted his head and deepened the kiss. She parted for him, wanting him inside, claiming her in such a way that she could forget the rest of her world. His tongue brushed against hers, sending shivers shooting down her spine.</p><p>The warmth of his body made her want to crawl inside of him and never be cold again. He felt strong, she thought hazily as she rubbed her hands up and down his back. Strong and solid.</p><p>Desire ignited\u2014little flames of need that consumed her common sense and left her thinking about possibilities. The desk was big and she would bet there was a lock on the door. No doubt an hour or two in Riley\u2019s arms would cure most of her ills.</p><p>She moved closer, rubbing herself against him, wanting them to touch everywhere. Her breasts ached. She wanted him to feel her there, and between her thighs where the need was most intense.</p> <p>He swore against her mouth, then dropped his hands to her hips where he pulled her against him. He was hard. The realization excited her. She closed her lips around his tongue and sucked gently.</p><p>He stiffened, then surged against her. When she released him, he pulled back enough to kiss her jaw, then down her neck. Her skin erupted in goose bumps, her legs began to tremble. If she hadn\u2019t been hanging on to him the overwhelming need would have caused her to collapse.</p><p>It was then she felt them\u2014the one thing that had been missing from all her other relationships for as long as she could remember. Sparks.</p><p>They erupted like renegade fireworks, arcing through her brain, blinding her and making her want to run for safety. Sparks? With Riley?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure if she pulled back or he let go, but suddenly there were a good two feet between them.</p><p>Her mind raced in a thousand different directions. She felt disoriented, as if she\u2019d been drugged, or had slept too long during the day and couldn\u2019t quite wake up.</p> <p>\u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she said. She turned in a circle, frantically searching for her purse. She spied it under the chair.</p><p>\u201cThis was a bad idea,\u201d she said as she crouched down to grab it. \u201cReally, really bad. Super bad. Bad, bad, bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m getting that,\u201d he said as she straightened. \u201cYou seem a little upset.\u201d</p><p>She gave him what she hoped was a bright, happy, I\u2019m-fine smile. \u201cI\u2019m fabulous. Great. Gotta go. You have a good day.\u201d</p><p>She practically ran from his office, all the while not wanting to acknowledge the truth.</p><p>Sparks. Bright, shiny, glow-in-the-dark sparks.</p><p>Not with Riley, she told herself as she hurried to her car and practically threw herself inside. Anyone but Riley. It wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t even reasonable, and it certainly wasn\u2019t nice.</p> <p>She tried to put the key in the ignition, but her hands shook too much. Instead she simply leaned her head against her steering wheel and let the irony of the situation wash over her.</p><p>After years of less than interesting romantic relationships she\u2019d finally felt the one thing she\u2019d always wanted to feel. Unfortunately, it was with the only single man on the planet she absolutely couldn\u2019t, under any circumstances, ever, ever be with.</p><p>Why was she surprised?</p><p>RILEY LOOKED through the weekly numbers, but his mind wasn\u2019t on the task. Not with thoughts of Gracie filling his mind and blood filling other parts of his body. She\u2019d gotten to him. Somehow, when he wasn\u2019t looking, she\u2019d managed to squeeze past his defenses and make him curious about her. He wanted to know what she thought, what she liked. He also wanted to see her naked and make love with her, but oddly enough, that was almost less interesting than the rest of it. Which scared the crap out of him.</p><p>He couldn\u2019t forget his rules, not to mention his goals. He was passing through this town, biding his time until he could claim his ninety-seven million. No woman was worth forgetting that, not even one as intriguing as Gracie. He didn\u2019t do relationships. Ever. And she was a happily ever after kind of woman.</p><p>One who sure knew how to kiss. And she felt damn good in his arms. He smiled as he remembered how she\u2019d rubbed against him. If they\u2019d been anywhere but his office....</p><p>\u201cStop right there,\u201d he told himself. He and Gracie weren\u2019t an option. She was the kind of trouble he didn\u2019t need.</p><p>He turned his attention back to the reports and forced himself to concentrate. Thirty minutes later, he finished with his notes. His phone buzzed.</p><p>\u201cSheriff Kendrick here to see you,\u201d Diane said. \u201cShall I send him in?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Riley rose and walked around his desk. He hadn\u2019t seen much of Mac since he, Riley, had moved back to Los Lobos. His one-time friend had dropped by to warn him not to make trouble, but since then they hadn\u2019t crossed paths more than a couple of times.</p><p>Mac Kendrick walked into the office. He stood a couple of inches taller, wore a sheriff\u2019s uniform and a gun. He was married, happily, Riley had heard. But in his mind, Mac would always be his best friend, the guy he\u2019d gotten in trouble with, had chased girls with and had generally had a hell of a good time with until the night Mac had stolen the judge\u2019s Caddy and taken it on a joyride, only to get caught and hauled into jail.</p><p>Mac had never talked about what had happened, but he\u2019d changed then. He\u2019d stopped messing around and had gone into the military. Riley had not only lost his best friend, he\u2019d lost the other half of his family.</p><p>\u201cIs this an official visit?\u201d Riley asked as Mac closed the door behind him.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Mac glanced around the office. \u201cNice. Never thought I\u2019d see you working behind a desk.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. But it\u2019s not so bad.\u201d He motioned to the two sofas in the corner of the room. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d</p><p>Riley waited until Mac had settled before sitting in the wing chair opposite. \u201cWhat brings you here? Do you need a donation for the sheriff\u2019s retirement fund?\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say no to that, but it\u2019s not why I came to see you.\u201d His steady gaze settled on Riley. \u201cI hear the election is going well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy campaign manager tells me we\u2019re up in the polls.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWilma, the woman who pretty much runs my department, says you\u2019re going to win. She knows that sort of thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the tip and I hope Wilma won\u2019t be insulted if I keep on polling.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI won\u2019t tell her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re interested in running for mayor.\u201d</p><p>Riley made a mental note to thank Jill Strathern-Kendrick, his attorney, the next time he saw her. Not only had she kept the terms of the will secret from Gracie, her best friend, she kept them from her husband\u2014Sheriff Mac Kendrick.</p><p>\u201cI never did like Yardley,\u201d Riley said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not alone in that. Maybe change would be a good thing.\u201d Mac glanced around the office. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be moving on for sure, but you\u2019re making your life here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrying.\u201d Riley didn\u2019t mention that as soon as the election was over, he would be gone.</p><p>Mac turned his attention back to him. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d he said. \u201cI always felt bad about how things ended.\u201d</p><p>Riley touched the faint scar on his upper lip. The one Mac had given him when they\u2019d fought about Mac suddenly wanting to walk the straight and narrow.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Riley shrugged. \u201cIt was a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. You want to get a beer sometime?\u201d</p><p>The question surprised Riley. He hesitated. Mac wasn\u2019t going to like his plans for the town. But until then...\u201cSure. You know where I live.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cI cruise by on a regular basis to make sure you\u2019re not making trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know I\u2019m being protected by Los Lobos\u2019s finest.\u201d Riley looked at his friend. \u201cI\u2019m glad you came by.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too. Let\u2019s set up something soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOME WITH ME,\u201d Alexis said, her voice low.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Gracie grabbed her headset and clicked it into her cell phone so she could keep working on her gum paste leaves. She quickly drew in the veins and point on the tiny leaf, then draped it over a cornstarch-dusted former to dry in a curved shape.</p><p>\u201cPlease. Just go with me. That\u2019s all I\u2019m asking. Do you want me to beg?\u201d</p><p>Gracie heard the tears in her sister\u2019s voice and tried to stay strong, but it was tough. She wasn\u2019t cut out to say no to people, especially not to someone who was family. Even if the relationship seemed to only run one way.</p><p>\u201cI want you to leave me out of this,\u201d Gracie said, although she could feel herself weakening.</p><p>\u201cI swear there\u2019s something going on. I know I\u2019ve been crazy before, accusing Zeke of things and I\u2019m running low on credits with you. I\u2019m the boy who cried wolf, but I swear there\u2019s a wolf in my house now.\u201d</p><p>Gracie couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cIf I remember my preschool reading, I believe the wolf was in with the sheep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever. You know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>She did. Her humor faded. \u201cAlexis, you put me in a really bad position. Mom is convinced I\u2019m turning back into stalker girl. My picture\u2019s on the front page of the newspaper and the legend of the \u2018Gracie Chronicles\u2019 is alive and well.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I\u2019m so, so sorry. Please. Just come with me. You don\u2019t have to say anything. Just hover in the background and give me moral support. If he\u2019s really not there, I\u2019ll need your emotional support.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shook her head and stabbed the leaf she\u2019d been forming. She knew she was going to regret this, but she couldn\u2019t seem to say the N word again. \u201cFine. What time do you want me to pick you up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTHE NUMBERS aren\u2019t just good,\u201d Zeke said with a grin. \u201cThey\u2019re amazing. If the election were held tomorrow, I doubt Yardley\u2019s own mother would vote for him.\u201d</p><p>Riley reached for his beer. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNear as I can tell...Gracie. Your numbers shot up after that picture of the two of you in the paper. Along with the old articles about her crush and what she did to get her man.\u201d</p><p>Riley shook his head. The world was a twisted place. \u201cSo they love me now because of Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey love you because Gracie loves you. Or she did. Everyone enjoys a good romance. Los Lobos wants yours with Gracie to work out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no romance.\u201d</p><p>Zeke raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou might want to get to work on that.\u201d</p><p>Riley looked at his campaign manager. \u201cLet\u2019s make this really clear. I\u2019m not faking a relationship with Gracie for the sake of votes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut....\u201d</p><p>Riley kept his gaze steady. Eventually Zeke turned away.</p><p>\u201cBut if you were seen together, around town, that would be okay.\u201d</p><p>Riley swallowed the rest of his beer. Talk about a strange situation. He\u2019d gone slowly, doing his best to win over the good citizens of Los Lobos. He\u2019d let them get used to him being around. He\u2019d bought candy for Little League, sponsored the new jerseys, supported the local high school football team and the girl\u2019s basketball team. He\u2019d sent the church band to some damn parade in Italy, and he\u2019d done it all with a smile. Now they wanted him to have a relationship with Gracie to prove himself.</p><p>Why did the idea bother him? Spending time with her wasn\u2019t a hardship. He liked her and he wanted her in his bed. He should be grateful his plan was coming together and he would soon be in possession of his uncle\u2019s bank and the ninety-seven million dollars. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to start prepping for the debate soon,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cHow\u2019s next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. Have we decided on a format?\u201d</p><p>Zeke snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t think the evening is going to be that formal, but I\u2019ll ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAre you sure helping me won\u2019t interfere with your secret life?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI told you. I\u2019m not having an affair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs long as Alexis believes that,\u201d Riley said, just as the doorbell rang.</p><p>He placed his beer on the coffee table in front of his chair, then stood and walked into the foyer. Zeke followed. When he opened the front door, he stared at the two women standing there. One made him want to grin. The other made him want to reach for one of Gracie\u2019s antacids.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d he told Zeke.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019M SORRY,\u201d Gracie said for possibly the forty-seventh time in less than two minutes.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Riley told her and meant it.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not fine. It\u2019s terrible. I need to leave you in peace.\u201d</p><p>He and Gracie stood together at the far end of the foyer while Zeke and Alexis had a heated, although whispered, conversation.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to come,\u201d she told him. \u201cBasically she guilted me into it. I\u2019m a complete wiener dog who can be guilted into anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d He could imagine her giving in to a request from a friend or a family member, even when it wasn\u2019t in her best interest.</p> <p>\u201cHe said he was going to be here tonight and she wanted to be sure.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stared at the black-and-white tiles. \u201cDid I say I was sorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did and you can stop now. None of this is your fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I still feel bad. I was really trying to stay out of your way. If you\u2019ll notice, you haven\u2019t seen me in two days. I figured that would be best for both of us.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d noticed. What he wouldn\u2019t admit to anyone and barely wanted to believe himself was that he\u2019d missed her.</p><p>\u201cYou still getting flack about the newspaper picture?\u201d he asked as he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She looked at him, then away. \u201cNo. I\u2019ve been avoiding all contact with my family. Pretty much with everyone. I thought this would be a good time to lay low. Then Alexis came looking for me.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go.\u201d</p><p>Riley turned and saw Zeke with his arm around Alexis.</p><p>\u201cMaybe we can finish this up tomorrow,\u201d Zeke added.</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Alexis looked at her sister. \u201cGracie, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow, okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Fine. Night.\u201d</p><p>The front door closed behind them. Gracie sighed.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t decide if they\u2019re going home to have makeup sex or fight some more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to think about either.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t interested in anyone\u2019s sex life except possibly Gracie\u2019s and his own. Memories of the last kiss they\u2019d shared still lingered and while he knew it would be a damn stupid idea to pursue the matter, his brain wasn\u2019t necessarily in charge.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re being really nice about this,\u201d she said as she gazed at him.</p><p>He liked looking at her. He liked her blue eyes and the way the curve of her mouth, or lack of curve, gave away her feelings. He liked how she stared at his earring with equal parts fascination and fear. He liked that she made cakes, loved storms and could be bought for the price of a restaurant-grade oven.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped by,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d She blinked. \u201cOh, yeah. Right. Me stopping by. With Alexis.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks turned pink and she dropped her attention back to the floor.</p><p>\u201cWell, Alexis is gone and I should probably head out, too.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to go. Even though they weren\u2019t going to have sex\u2014despite how much he wanted her\u2014he wasn\u2019t ready to be alone.</p><p>He frowned. No, that wasn\u2019t true. He was fine with being alone. He wasn\u2019t ready to be without Gracie. Not yet.</p><p>\u201cWant a tour of the old place?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Gracie had expected Riley to say a lot of things, from \u201cGet out of my house,\u201d to \u201cCome upstairs with me and let\u2019s get naked.\u201d She hadn\u2019t expected him to want to play tour guide.</p><p>While she knew the most sensible course of action would be to leave, she smiled her acceptance.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d love it.\u201d</p><p>He put his hand on her shoulder, then slid it under her hair so he cupped the back of her neck.</p><p>\u201cThis is the foyer,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI figured that. The tiles are a giveaway. It\u2019s big.\u201d She glanced up at the elegant, crystal chandelier hanging down from the two-story ceiling. \u201cHow do you dust that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>His fingers moved against her skin, making her even more aware of him. The touching made it difficult to think or speak or do anything but purr and rub against him.</p><p>\u201cLiving room,\u201d he said pointing to the left with his free hand.</p><p>She walked in that direction. He kept pace with her, although he dropped his hand to the small of her back.</p><p>Carved double doors led to a large room with hardwood floors and old, but beautiful, Oriental rugs. Old-fashioned furniture filled the space. Heavy velvet draperies covered the windows.</p><p>\u201cHow dark is this room during the day?\u201d she asked. \u201cThose drapes wouldn\u2019t let in a speck of light.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo idea,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get in here much.\u201d</p><p>Beyond the living room was some kind of parlor, then a bedroom suite with a sitting room and bath.</p><p>\u201cFor the maid,\u201d Gracie said.</p><p>\u201cI have a cleaner who comes in twice a week.\u201d</p><p>The massive kitchen hadn\u2019t been remodeled since the 1950s but was big enough to host banquets. Rows and rows of cabinets stretched to the ceiling\u2014some of them fronted by the original leaded glass. There seemed to be about fifty acres of counter space. It was old, chipped tile, but if replaced with granite it would be beautiful. Double sinks stood on both sides of the kitchen and there was a walk-in pantry that would comfortably house a family of four. Talk about heaven.</p><p>\u201cThis needs some serious fixing up,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me know if you need suggestions. I have been known to spend a whole afternoon drooling over appliance catalogues.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m more into take-out or heating up something in the microwave.\u201d</p><p>She supposed that made sense, what with him being a guy and all, but the possibilities made her envious.</p><p>\u201cI can ignore the however-many bedrooms this house has, and the library and the antiques, but the kitchen is tough to walk away from.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake me an offer,\u201d he said.</p><p>She leaned against the counter. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have enough in my checkbook.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding, are you? You\u2019d sell this place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. It\u2019s not my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere is home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever rig I\u2019m on at the moment.\u201d He pulled up a bar stool by the large island and offered it to her. He took the second stool for himself. \u201cI\u2019m used to sleeping in cramped quarters with six other guys working rotating shifts. An oil rig is a twenty-four-hour-a-day operation.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t imagine such a place. \u201cYou said something about the South China Sea. How did you get there from here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I took off, I headed north and ended up in Alaska working on a sports fishing boat. I met a couple of guys in a bar. They were looking to hire a crew for a rig they\u2019d just bought from an oil company. The big guys said there wasn\u2019t any more oil. These two didn\u2019t agree.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou went with them just like that?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cFor a piece of the action. Lucky for me, they were right. The work is damn hard, but it\u2019s worth it. I learned all I could and took over the second rig they bought for a bigger share. Ten years later I was a partner and we were a company to be reckoned with.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBad boy makes good. You must be proud.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s how I make my living.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re running the bank now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. The bank.\u201d</p><p>She glanced around at the large kitchen. \u201cThis isn\u2019t anything like you\u2019re used to, is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more square feet. I don\u2019t know. The old house is pretty empty. There are dozens of rooms I\u2019ve never seen.\u201d He rubbed his fingers across the island countertop. \u201cMy mom would have liked it, though. She grew up here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally? I didn\u2019t know that. Why didn\u2019t....\u201d</p><p>Gracie pressed her lips together. Not her business, she reminded herself.</p><p>Riley looked at her. \u201cYou can ask. The reason she and I didn\u2019t come here when we moved back to Los Lobos is that her brother, my uncle, never forgave her for marrying my father. Her parents had passed away when she was pretty young and her brother, Donovan, had raised her. She ran off with my father when she was maybe seventeen. Donovan told her to come back or she would be cut off without a cent. She chose love over money.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to say that sounded so romantic, but there was something in Riley\u2019s voice. Something that made her hold back.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cShe got pregnant and lived in a run-down house in some dusty town in Arizona for ten years. The love of her life never bothered to marry her and one day, when I was nine, he disappeared. We came back here. I think she wanted to reconcile with her brother, but good old Donovan wouldn\u2019t have any part of it.\u201d</p><p>His expression tightened and his mouth thinned.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t forgive that,\u201d Gracie said softly.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s one item in a long list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt all happened a long time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut still.\u201d She slipped off the chair and moved close enough that she could rest her hand on his forearm. \u201cI wish I could make it better.\u201d</p><p>In a matter of seconds, everything changed. Gone was the wounded guy and in his place was a predator. His eyes darkened, his body tensed and she would swear that the temperature in the room climbed about twelve degrees.</p><p>Riley stepped down and reached for her, but instead of pulling her close, he coiled his hand around her hair.</p><p>\u201cNot a good idea,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She had to swallow before she could speak.</p><p>\u201cUm, what\u2019s not a good idea?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaking me feel better. You\u2019re not my type.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t pulling her hair, but he wasn\u2019t letting her go, either. She felt completely in his control, which was kind of thrilling.</p><p>\u201cSo what is your type?\u201d</p><p>He raised his eyebrows. \u201cVolunteering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCurious.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure you are. Okay\u2014I like women who are easy. What I call the three F\u2019s.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThree F\u2019s?\u201d What? \u201cI can probably figure out one of them,\u201d she said, assuming it had to be the F word. \u201cWhat are the other two?\u201d</p><p>His dark eyes seemed to invite her closer. She felt compelled to move toward him until they were almost touching. Almost, but not quite. Funny how Riley had been so nice to her that she\u2019d forgotten he could also be dangerous.</p><p>He leaned into her until he could whisper in her ear. \u201cAre you sure you want to know?\u201d he asked, his breath tickling her.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cFind her, fuck her, forget her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d She didn\u2019t know what to say or even what to think.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not someone I could forget,\u201d he murmured. \u201cYou\u2019re the kind of woman men buy flowers for, and rings. You\u2019re the kind of woman a man wants to make love with. That\u2019s not my game, Gracie. Never has been.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He straightened and released her hair. \u201cYou should probably go now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Go? Leave? She shook her head and stepped back. \u201cRight. Good idea. Excellent idea.\u201d</p><p>She felt like a small bird being charmed by a swaying snake. The side of her brain in charge of personal preservation told her to run. But the rest of her wanted to find out how it would feel to be seduced by the likes of Riley Whitefield.</p> <p>She stared into his eyes. He was so gorgeous, and a great kisser. Maybe he could just kiss her one more time. Maybe...</p><p>\u201cIf I start, I\u2019m not going to stop,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>She jumped with the realization that he could read her mind, then turned and dashed out of the kitchen.</p><p>The trip home happened in record time. She longed for some quiet and a cup of tea as she sorted through what had just happened. But when she pulled into the driveway of her rental, she saw it was not to be. Vivian stood on her front porch.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p> <p>\u201cANOTHER FIGHT with Tom?\u201d Gracie asked as she got out of her car and walked toward the front door.</p><p>Vivian actually looked shocked. \u201cHow did you guess?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, I don\u2019t know. I guess I took a stab in the dark.\u201d</p><p>She figured her comment was sarcastic enough, although what she really wanted to say was \u201cI knew something was wrong because the only time you ever bother with me is when you want something.\u201d</p><p>Gracie opened the front door and led the way inside. While her rental was light and bright and more than served her needs, she couldn\u2019t help remembering Riley\u2019s amazing house. Ah, well. One day, if she was ever rich and willing to live in Los Lobos again. Of course she figured the odds of the latter happening were even more slim than winning the lottery.</p><p>\u201cSo,\u201d she said as she filled the kettle with water, then set it on the stove. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p> <p>Vivian sat at the kitchen table where she immediately poked at several decorative flowers drying there.</p><p>She picked up a rose and promptly crumbled it in her fingers.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she said, and set the bigger pieces back on the table. She rubbed her fingers on her jeans. \u201cIt\u2019s Tom, like you said. He\u2019s graduating with his MBA and we\u2019re getting married.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think I knew that,\u201d Gracie said as she pulled out a plastic container filled with loose tea and set it next to two mugs.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s interviewed for a few jobs in L.A. and I thought he was going to take one, but I just found out he\u2019s thinking about accepting a position at the bank.\u201d</p><p>There were several banks in town\u2014branches of large multinational conglomerates, but when a local referred to \u201cthe bank\u201d there was only one. Riley\u2019s.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s interesting,\u201d Gracie said, wondering if Riley knew. She doubted he worried about entry-level hiring, even in management, so he might not know about Tom.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not interesting, it\u2019s horrible,\u201d Vivian wailed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to stay here for the rest of my life. I want to leave and see other places. You got to go. Why can\u2019t I? I can\u2019t believe he would consider the job after all we\u2019ve talked about.\u201d</p> <p>Vivian began to cry. Her sharp, high-pitched sobs competed with the whistle on the kettle and won.</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t bother pointing out that she hadn\u2019t exactly wanted to leave Los Lobos, that instead she\u2019d been sent away in disgrace. After all, Vivian wasn\u2019t looking for logic.</p><p>Gracie scooped tea into two steeping spoons and dropped one in each mug. She carried them to the table and sat across from her sister.</p><p>\u201cSo call off the wedding,\u201d she said, not all that interested in the outcome of the conversation.</p><p>Vivian dropped her hands to her side and stared at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCall off the wedding. If you\u2019re so unhappy, don\u2019t marry Tom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I have to marry him. We\u2019re engaged. We\u2019ve ordered invitations. Do you know how much this is costing?\u201d</p><p>Gracie had a good idea. \u201cYou\u2019re still at the deposit stage. Most of it is refundable.\u201d</p><p>Vivian looked at her as if she were a complete idiot. \u201cI\u2019m not canceling the wedding.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you need to talk to Tom about his plans. His job is about more than just him if it affects where you live.\u201d</p><p>Her sister shrugged, then touched one of the roses. \u201cWill you make flowers like this for my cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like. I haven\u2019t decided. I\u2019ll sketch up something in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re really beautiful. You must be super talented.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI work hard.\u201d</p><p>Vivian sipped her tea. \u201cTom says I don\u2019t work hard enough. He says we both have to be saving to buy a house, but right now I\u2019m saving to pay for my wedding dress. Teaching just doesn\u2019t pay that much, which is why I\u2019m working part-time in the hardware store.\u201d She sighed as if life were too much for her.</p><p>\u201cWould you teach if you moved to L.A.?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019d have to. But if Tom got a good enough job, I could just stay home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to start a family right away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. What does that have to do with anything?\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t have an answer for that. In her world, husband and wife were partners, pulling equally toward a mutual goal. Obviously that wasn\u2019t Vivian\u2019s idea of a good time.</p><p>Maybe Gracie was old-fashioned and outdated. Maybe that was why Vivian and Alexis had men in their lives and she didn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not the right person to come to for advice,\u201d Gracie said.</p><p>\u201cI guess I need to talk to one of my friends, then,\u201d Vivian said. \u201cMom is completely crazed about the wedding and Alexis is so self-absorbed she can\u2019t see anyone else but herself.\u201d Her baby sister leaned close. \u201cYou\u2019re not like that, Gracie. You think about other people.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t know what to say. \u201cGee, thanks. I\u2019m so glad you think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d Vivian patted her arm, then stood. \u201cI gotta run. I still don\u2019t have the shoes to go with my dress and I\u2019m going into Santa Barbara to check out that new bridal shop. Don\u2019t forget the family meeting tomorrow. We have a lot to discuss. Have a good one.\u201d</p><p>She practically bounced out of the room.</p><p>Gracie collected the mugs and carried them to the sink.</p><p>What had just happened? How could Vivian go from fighting with Tom to shopping for their wedding in less than five minutes? Gracie might not be an expert on the subject, but she was willing to go out on a limb and say the girl wasn\u2019t grown-up enough to be marrying anyone.</p><p>Not that it was her decision.</p><p>She returned to the table and carefully moved the flowers, then pulled out her sketch pad. She might as well get the cake design done. Even if the constant on-again, off-again wedding ended up being officially off, she could always put the design in her portfolio.</p><p>THE NEXT AFTERNOON Gracie drove to her mother\u2019s house. She had sketches for several wedding cakes, along with some ideas about pretty but inexpensive centerpieces. As she pulled up in front of the house, she wondered if she was trying too hard. Should she continue to participate, even when it was clear she was only free labor, or should she walk away? Riley had said that family would screw her every time, but she didn\u2019t want to believe it. With her aunt and uncle gone, her mom and her sisters were all the family she had. If she didn\u2019t belong with them, she would be well and truly on her own.</p><p>She collected her portfolio and stepped out of the car. She\u2019d barely started up the walkway when she heard someone call her name.</p><p>\u201cGracie! Oh, Gracie!\u201d Eunice Baxter walked off her porch with a speed that belied her eighty-plus years. \u201cI saw the picture in the paper the other day.\u201d</p><p>Gracie\u2019s shoulders slumped. Of course she had. \u201cHi, Mrs. Baxter.\u201d</p><p>The old woman beamed. \u201cYou looked so pretty. And Riley, my oh my, he\u2019s a fine male specimen. That earring.\u201d The beam turned into a giggle. \u201cVery sexy.\u201d</p><p>Gracie blinked. Mrs. Baxter thought Riley was sexy? Gracie didn\u2019t know if she should be impressed or completely grossed out. She figured she could decide later, and maybe use the information for ammunition.</p><p>\u201cAre you going to listen to him talk?\u201d Mrs. Baxter asked. \u201cI\u2019m thinking I will. Maybe go early and sit in the front row.\u201d She winked. \u201cThat way I can look all I want.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s speaking somewhere?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the high school later this afternoon. Something about civic responsibility, not that I care about what he\u2019s saying. I generally vote for whoever is most attractive, and I have to say that Riley beats Franklin Yardley hands down.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t want to think about Eunice Baxter participating in their democratic system of government by voting based on looks, but there it was. The founding fathers would be so proud.</p><p>\u201cYou should stop by,\u201d the older woman told her, then winked.</p><p>Gracie was tempted, although the reality of her showing up in the same place as Riley wasn\u2019t something she wanted to consider. Talk about trouble.</p><p>\u201cThanks for the information,\u201d she said and turned back to the house. \u201cI need to get these designs for the cake to my sister.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat girl,\u201d Mrs. Baxter said with a dismissive wave of her hand. \u201cShe and her boyfriend go at it like cats and dogs. I don\u2019t give them a year. Alexis isn\u2019t much better. Mark my words, Gracie, you\u2019re the best of the lot.\u201d</p><p>The compliment brightened Gracie\u2019s morning. \u201cI appreciate that, Mrs. Baxter.\u201d Even if right now she didn\u2019t feel all that special. She waved and hurried into the house.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later she was sorry she\u2019d bothered. Vivian dismissed all her centerpiece ideas, saying they were too unimpressive and not one of the three cake designs had been approved.</p><p>\u201cI like them,\u201d Tom said. \u201cThey\u2019re all beautiful.\u201d</p><p>Obviously the bride and groom had made up, Gracie thought, liking Tom even more for liking her designs.</p><p>Vivian looked at him and rolled her eyes. \u201cHoney, this is girl stuff. I know you want to be involved in the wedding, but I\u2019ve been planning this since I was six.\u201d</p><p>Gracie looked at Tom. He met her gaze and shrugged, as if to say, \u201cI tried.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt more than a little sympathy for the man. If he really wanted to marry Vivian, he was going to have his hands full.</p><p>\u201cThe cakes are just so...I don\u2019t know. Small, I guess,\u201d Vivian said with a sigh as she touched the pages spread across the dining room table.</p><p>\u201cThese aren\u2019t to scale,\u201d Gracie told her, speaking between clenched teeth. \u201cThey\u2019ll serve three hundred.\u201d</p><p>Vivian pointed to a simple, but elegant design, with a cascade of orchids trailing down one side. \u201cWhat if it was more like this, but all covered with flowers. Like a giant bouquet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not very defined. You want your guests to know there\u2019s a cake buried under there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo they have to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the one that looks like a present,\u201d Alexis said, bending over the sketches. \u201cWhat if there were flowers instead of bows?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could do that,\u201d Gracie said, reaching for her bottle of antacids.</p><p>She walked into the kitchen for a glass of water. Her mother followed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure Vivian will pick something,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad Tom wants to help.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded and turned on the tap.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice of you to do this for free. I read that article in People. I know your cakes are really expensive.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt some of her bad mood drain way. She smiled at her mother. \u201cShe\u2019s my sister. I\u2019m happy to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019re both running our own businesses. Who would have thought.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gracie wasn\u2019t sure where her mother was going with this conversation. She wanted to believe that it was a slightly awkward peace offering, but she wasn\u2019t sure.</p><p>\u201cI think yours is more complicated than mine,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cYou have employees and inventory, while I just have myself to worry about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill, you\u2019ve made something of yourself. I\u2019m not sure I understand how you can be so smart about everything else and so dumb about Riley.\u201d</p> <p>The arrow sailed straight and true, landing right in Gracie\u2019s heart. She almost wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if we don\u2019t talk about him. We\u2019re going to have to agree to disagree.\u201d</p><p>Her mother moved closer. \u201cYou\u2019re not even trying. That\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make any sense. Your sister said you were over there last night.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt her mouth drop open. \u201cDid Alexis mention she begged me to go with her so she could check on what Zeke was up to?\u201d</p><p>Her mother ignored that. \u201cGracie, I only want what\u2019s best for you. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always wanted. I wish I could make you see what you\u2019re doing. The whole town is laughing at you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what, Mom? I think you\u2019re wrong. I think the whole town is so busy with their own lives that they don\u2019t have time for me. It\u2019s been fourteen years and everyone needs to get over it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who can\u2019t let go. You\u2019ve never had any sense when it came to that boy.\u201d</p><p>Gracie put down the water and crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cNumber one, he\u2019s not a boy anymore. He\u2019s a very successful man who\u2019s made something of himself. I didn\u2019t know him before, but I know him now. He\u2019s great. He\u2019s better than great. He\u2019s amazing. He\u2019s smart and sexy and fun to be with.\u201d</p><p>Her mother flinched. \u201cOh, God. It\u2019s worse than I thought.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not anything,\u201d Gracie told her flatly. \u201cThat\u2019s my point. You\u2019re upset about nothing. I\u2019m not obsessed with Riley. I\u2019m a completely different person. I\u2019ve grown up, gotten a life. I\u2019ve dated, had boyfriends and lovers and two years ago, I nearly got engaged. If anyone is lost in the past in this room, it\u2019s you, not me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t see what\u2019s happening,\u201d her mother said, obviously distressed. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to help you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere\u2019s a newsflash. I don\u2019t need your help. Maybe I did, say fourteen years ago, but you weren\u2019t interested. You sent me away. You were never there for me, even when I begged you to let me come home. You never cared about what I wanted, what I needed. I was desperate to be allowed to return to my family and you turned your back on me. So I got over it. I grew up, no thanks to you. So guess what? I don\u2019t really care what you think about me or Riley or anyone else. The three of you asked me to come back for Vivian\u2019s wedding. I said I would help and I will, but when this is all over, I\u2019m leaving and I\u2019m not coming back.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie walked out of the kitchen and back into the dining room.</p><p>\u201cI think I know what I want,\u201d Vivian said.</p><p>\u201cDraw me a picture,\u201d Gracie said as she grabbed her purse.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you going? Wait. I need to talk to you. I\u2019ll tell you what I want and you can draw it. Gracie! Wait!\u201d</p><p>But Gracie didn\u2019t look back. She walked to her car, started it and drove away. Her heart pounded so hard she was afraid it would break. She felt shaky and sore, as if she\u2019d just been run over.</p><p>Ever since she\u2019d moved in with her aunt and uncle, she\u2019d fantasized about what it would be like to come home. She\u2019d waited and waited for her mother to call and say it had all been a mistake\u2014that of course she was welcome to return. But the call had never come and eventually Gracie had stopped expecting it.</p><p>In time she\u2019d told herself she\u2019d stopped caring. She\u2019d never come home for the holidays, instead meeting her family in L.A. or somewhere else. It had become a tradition.</p><p>Now Gracie wondered if the real reason she\u2019d avoided Los Lobos, was the possibility of disappointment. If she came back, she would have to face what had happened. There wouldn\u2019t be any room to hide.</p> <p>Now that she was in the thick of it, she knew that staying away had been a fine idea.</p><p>She stopped at the red light and considered what to do next. There were several possibilities, including packing up her stuff and returning to L.A.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to run away,\u201d she told herself, trying to sound fierce rather than broken.</p><p>She thought about going back to her rental house, but she didn\u2019t want to be there, either. In the end, she found herself parking at the high school and walking into the auditorium to hear what Riley Whitefield had to say about civic responsibility and maybe join Eunice Baxter in ogling his earring.</p><p>INSTEAD OF HEADING for the front row, Gracie slipped in a side entrance and headed for a back corner. While she might want to convince her mother that no one in the town really cared what she did with her life or with Riley, she wasn\u2019t willing to put that theory to the test.</p><p>She sat low in her seat and did her best to avoid eye contact. The strategy seemed to work and she didn\u2019t even get a second look.</p><p>Thirty minutes later she found herself actually hanging on Riley\u2019s every word. He spoke about the town and how each citizen was responsible for the direction it would go. How everyone could be an example, by supporting local businesses instead of chain stores, and throwing away trash instead of leaving it on the beach. He talked about how the tourists provided necessary income, but that they could not be allowed to define what the town would be.</p><p>Gracie found herself caught up in his words and actually wanting to get involved. She sat up straighter and applauded with her neighbors...right up until she heard someone whisper, \u201cIs that Gracie Landon? The girl from the newspaper?\u201d</p><p>She glanced around and saw several people looking in her direction. Wives nudged their husbands. Older people leaned in to neighbors, then turned back to her.</p><p>Gracie felt trapped and in the spotlight. Should she run out of the auditorium? Pretend she didn\u2019t notice? Smile and wave?</p><p>Riley wrapped up his speech before she could decide and everyone stood to applaud. As the meeting broke up, Gracie tried to duck out a side door, but the crowd carried her down to the stage where she found herself in line to shake hands with the man himself. They were face-to-face before she could slip away.</p><p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come,\u201d she said when he turned to her and raised his eyebrows. \u201cI didn\u2019t think anyone would notice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, as long as you promise to vote for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not registered in this county.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could change that.\u201d</p><p>She was aware of several interested listeners moving close enough to overhear every word. She knew people would talk and report back to her mother. Maybe some of them were even silently laughing. But in her heart, at that second, she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cI liked what you had to say,\u201d she told him honestly. \u201cYou\u2019re right about the local citizens defining what Los Lobos will be rather than letting the tourists do it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She tried to figure out what he was thinking, but she couldn\u2019t. Not with so many people trying to get his attention. She excused herself and stepped away, only to run into Zeke.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cListening to your candidate.\u201d</p><p>Her brother-in-law was a good-looking guy with an easy smile. He seemed nice and funny and she understood why Alexis had married him.</p><p>Zeke glanced around. \u201cYou\u2019re making a bit of a splash. We should probably get you out of the way, so folks will concentrate on Riley and the campaign rather than your legendary past.\u201d</p><p>She allowed him to lead her out a side door and into the parking lot. Gracie told herself none of this was her business, but she couldn\u2019t help grabbing his arm before he went back inside.</p><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell Alexis what you\u2019re up to? She\u2019s making everyone crazy with her concerns, and I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re getting the worst of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not doing anything wrong.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are doing something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy is this your business?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Gracie stared at him. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding, right? Your wife has had me following you around town, sneaking around, taking pictures and showing up where I\u2019m not wanted, just to find out what you\u2019re up to.\u201d</p><p>Zeke shuffled his feet. \u201cOkay. Fair point. The thing is\u2014\u201d He shrugged, then turned away. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything bad. I\u2019m not cheating on her or trying to leave, or spending money or any of that. I just need a little more time. I swear I\u2019ll tell her soon.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t good enough, but it would have to do. \u201cI can\u2019t make you tell me,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI wish I could.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sister is a little high-strung. I\u2019m not saying I haven\u2019t been acting weird in the past few weeks, but before that if I took an extra five minutes at the grocery store, she was convinced I\u2019d run off with a checker.\u201d</p><p>Not exactly Gracie\u2019s idea of perfect happiness. \u201cDoes that worry come from her or from you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. Honestly, I love your sister more than anything. She\u2019s crazy, but she\u2019s also sweet and caring and never boring. You know.\u201d</p><p>His warm smile made Gracie feel better about the situation, even if his words made her uncomfortable. She didn\u2019t know what Alexis was like. Not really.</p><p>\u201cI gotta run and take care of my candidate,\u201d Zeke said. He bent down and kissed her cheek. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what he was thanking her for. She stared after him as she thought about all he\u2019d said about her sister.</p><p>The sense of having lost her family was still there, but for the first time she considered that while she\u2019d been sent away against her will, she had chosen to stay away. She could have come back, if she\u2019d wanted to. Yes, she\u2019d felt rejected by her family, but it wasn\u2019t as if she\u2019d bothered to reach out overly much.</p><p>Something to consider.</p><p>THE NEXT MORNING Gracie collected her various ingredients, baking pans and other supplies, loaded up her car and drove up to the bed-and-breakfast on the bluff.</p><p>She remembered this old place from when she\u2019d been a kid. Rumors of an alien landing some time in the 1950s had made the location both irresistible and terrifying. Some of the high school kids used the place as a make-out point, while the younger ones tested their bravery by being willing to run up to the front door and knock.</p><p>In her youth, Gracie had made it all the way to the porch, which had been pretty darned impressive. Now she parked in back with the expectation of actually stepping inside and working. Aliens be damned, she had cakes to bake.</p><p>She knocked once as a courtesy, then used the key Pam had given her to let herself in.</p><p>As it had when she\u2019d first seen the kitchen, her heart fluttered with all the foolishness of young love. This time, however, it wasn\u2019t a man who got her blood to racing. Instead it was gleaming stainless steel appliances, yards and yards of counter space and big windows that let the morning light spill in.</p><p>Gracie mixed up her first cake batch and carefully poured everything into the pans. She added the heating core to the larger pans and slid them into the waiting oven.</p><p>As she set the timer, she heard another car pull up next to hers and looked out in time to see Pam stepping out of her Lexus.</p><p>Unable to escape due to cake-bakeage, she plastered a smile on her face and hoped for the best.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said cheerfully as Pam entered. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d Pam dropped several books of wallpaper samples onto the counter. \u201cI\u2019m down to the details with the rooms, which is fun.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Gracie had sort of dressed for her day. She wore a cotton blouse over black pants, but felt frumpy next to Pam\u2019s Ultrasuede pants and matching jacket, with a little camisole underneath.</p><p>\u201cI drove by the high school,\u201d Pam said. \u201cThere was a crowd there for Riley\u2019s speech.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Gracie pretended she hadn\u2019t been there. \u201cIs his campaign going well?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so,\u201d Pam told her.</p><p>Gracie tried not to react, but the surprise must have shown because Pam grinned.</p><p>\u201cI mean it,\u201d she said. \u201cHey, it\u2019s been years and years. I was young and foolish and I sure don\u2019t hold a grudge against Riley. Besides, Franklin Yardley gives me the creeps. He\u2019d just been elected mayor when I was a senior and he was at graduation handing out some award. I swear he patted my butt when he gave it to me.\u201d</p><p>Gracie pressed both her hands on the counter. She remembered Jill telling her a similar story. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding! He did the same thing to a friend of mine. She was totally grossed out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you blame her? He was old and it was just too disgusting. I wanted to say something, but I didn\u2019t think anyone would believe me. So Riley gets my vote.\u201d</p> <p>She sounded sincere and Gracie sort of wanted to believe her, but she couldn\u2019t. Not completely.</p><p>\u201cYou never remarried.\u201d</p><p>Pam leaned against the counter. \u201cI know. I thought about it, but I really prefer being single. I\u2019m seeing someone now. He lives in Santa Barbara, which is pretty perfect. We\u2019re close enough to get together on a regular basis, but he\u2019s not in my face all the time. I like that. I\u2019ve been on my own for so long, I don\u2019t think I could get used to living with a man. What about you?\u201d</p><p>Gracie was more than willing to get used to living with a man, but the only one who made her feel sparks wasn\u2019t interested in her. Besides, he was the last guy on the planet she should be with. It made no sense. And they wanted really different things. He might find her attractive and kiss like a dream, but she knew he wasn\u2019t the settling-down type.</p><p>She shook her head and realized Pam was staring at her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. What did you ask me?\u201d</p><p>Pam laughed. \u201cNever mind. I can see you\u2019re distracted. I\u2019ll just grab my light reading and get out of your way.\u201d</p> <p>Pam picked up the wallpaper sample books and left the kitchen. Gracie stared after her and wondered if maybe she\u2019d been wrong to judge Pam so harshly all those years ago.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>RILEY STOOD outside in the late afternoon. He\u2019d canceled his last two meetings with the intent of going for a drive. But instead of heading up the coast or even south to L.A., he\u2019d traveled a short distance across town to find himself parked outside of Gracie\u2019s rental.</p><p>He knew she was home\u2014her Subaru Forrester sat in the driveway and he could hear music. As he stood beside his car, he stared at the front door and wondered when he\u2019d left the world of normal behind.</p><p>There were a thousand other places he could be and a handful he should be, and Gracie\u2019s house didn\u2019t fall into either category. She was nothing but trouble\u2014not the way she used to be by stalking him and making his life hell. No, this trouble was worse. He liked her.</p><p>He enjoyed her company, her humor, her craziness and right now he wanted to be with her in every sense of the word.</p><p>He told himself he was only here to talk, that she wasn\u2019t his type and he was a man who was cautious about where he laid his head. He\u2019d always been careful to pick women who were content to be part of the three F\u2019s. Gracie wasn\u2019t like that.</p><p>If he had a brain in his head, he would walk back to his car and drive away. Instead he stepped forward and pressed the doorbell.</p> <p>\u201cJust a sec,\u201d she yelled from somewhere inside the house.</p><p>He heard something slam, some mild cursing, then running footsteps and the front door flew open.</p><p>She stood in front of him with a smudge on her cheek and a dish towel in one hand. She\u2019d pulled her hair back in a ponytail. Her T-shirt fit snugly, emphasizing curves that haunted him, while her slightly loose khakis hung low on her hips. She was barefoot, not wearing a speck of makeup and he wanted her with a hungry desperation that made it impossible to speak.</p><p>She grinned. \u201cThank God you\u2019re not my mother or one of my sisters. I\u2019m all familied out right now. I can\u2019t even tell you the forty-seven ways they\u2019re making me crazy.\u201d</p><p>She stepped back. \u201cCome on. I have a cake in the oven and I have to turn it every ten minutes to keep it baking evenly. I know, I know, I could have gone back over to Pam\u2019s but I was there before and she was actually nice and it kind of freaked me out.\u201d</p><p>She shut the door behind him and led the way into the kitchen. \u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d</p><p>The sway of her hips called him. He wanted to grab her, pull her close and take her right there in the hallway. He wanted to tug the rubber band from her hair, pull off her clothes and have her on top, wet, ready and panting his name as she demanded he give her more.</p><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t in the mood to work,\u201d he said instead. \u201cThought I\u2019d stop by.\u201d</p><p>They reached the kitchen. She bent over the oven, pulled it open and used the dishcloth to protect her fingers as she gave the large cake pan a quarter turn.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the company. Oddly enough, you\u2019re the most normal person I know these days. Who would have thought?\u201d</p><p>She straightened and walked to the refrigerator. \u201cDo you want anything to drink? I have soda and milk and some sparkling water.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cLet me guess\u2014macho guys don\u2019t drink sparkling water.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot unless we open it with our teeth first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigures.\u201d She held up a can of soda. \u201cThis okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He glanced around at the small kitchen. Even though she was a short-term tenant, she\u2019d still made the space her own. There were cake pans and racks covering the space. She\u2019d tacked up sketches of cakes, a calendar and the article from People magazine. The small table held all kinds of delicate-looking tools he couldn\u2019t identify.</p><p>The room felt lived in, comfortable. No ghosts here.</p><p>He settled on a bar stool by the counter and took the drink she offered.</p><p>\u201cWhat terribly important meetings are you missing out on?\u201d she asked as she set the timer for ten minutes.</p><p>\u201cOne about the direction the Federal Reserve will probably take. A recap on our lending ratios. Banking stuff.\u201d</p><p>She leaned against the counter across from him. \u201cAre you enjoying being a banker? It has to be different from living on the oil rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShorter hours, and everyone smells better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat has to be nice. But do you find it interesting or boring?\u201d</p><p>He frowned as he popped open his soda and took a drink. \u201cI never thought about the banking job as more than something I had to do to inherit.\u201d When he\u2019d either satisfied the terms of the will or failed, he was walking away.</p><p>\u201cWould you consider it as a career?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMaybe. There are aspects I like.\u201d He loosened his tie, then unfastened the top button on his dress shirt. \u201cThe clothes can be a pain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know what you mean. I like baking days when I don\u2019t have to get all fancy for my meetings.\u201d She glanced down at her T-shirt and brushed a smudge of flour. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the kitchen I make sure everything is washable. I seem to be the kind of baker who has a lot of accidents with ingredients.\u201d</p><p>He could smell her. Something soft and feminine that had nothing to do with the sweet scent of baking cake. Need nearly drove him to his feet, but he pushed it down and did his best to ignore it. After all this time, Gracie had turned out to be an unexpected pleasure in his life. They were friends, and he wasn\u2019t about to screw that up with sex.</p><p>\u201cMy secretary keeps pressuring me to give money for the new children\u2019s wing of the local hospital. She suggests it be in my uncle\u2019s name, which I\u2019m not willing to do.\u201d</p><p>Gracie tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and glanced at the timer. \u201cGive the money at all or give it in your uncle\u2019s name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want anything named for him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen give it someone else\u2019s name. Or no one\u2019s. Why do wings always have to have names?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. I may do it just to get Diane off my back. The woman defines stubborn.\u201d He picked up his soda and grinned. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason to give to charity.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI doubt the hospital board will really care what drives you to donate. I think they\u2019ll just be happy to cash the check.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cWhere exactly does the money come from? You don\u2019t have the inheritance yet, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThinking of asking me for a loan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I remember correctly, it was ninety-seven million dollars. If you had that kind of money, I\u2019d be more on the lookout for a grant rather than a loan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFair enough. This money comes from the bank. A certain percentage of profits are earmarked for charity.\u201d Riley couldn\u2019t escape the irony of his uncle being willing to give millions to charity, but leaving his own sister to die.</p><p>\u201cAnd you get to pick where they go? That\u2019s kind of cool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDiane does most of that. I sign the checks.\u201d He smiled. \u201cI have to admit, she\u2019s someone I wouldn\u2019t mind taking back to my other business with me. Talk about efficient.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe other business being your partnerships in the oil business.\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cWe have over fifty rigs now.\u201d</p><p>She straightened just as the timer dinged, then walked to the oven and rotated the cake. \u201cAmazing how you left here with nothing and did so well. That\u2019s pretty cool. Your mom would be really proud of you. Did she know you were a success before she passed away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSome. I sent her money when I could.\u201d Not that it had been enough. If only, he thought grimly. If only he hadn\u2019t still been angry at her for making him marry Pam. If only she\u2019d told him the truth. If only he\u2019d come back.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re already rich,\u201d Gracie teased as she closed the oven and turned back to him. \u201cThat kind of makes you really attractive.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re not into guys with money. If they have it you won\u2019t say no, but otherwise you don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but we\u2019ve never talked about it. You barely know me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know enough. Besides, I married someone who wanted my money. I learned to recognize the signs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMakes sense,\u201d she told him. \u201cSo now you keep your wealth a secret?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never get close enough for them to know. As far as the women in my life are concerned, I\u2019m just a guy who works on an oil rig.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWomen?\u201d She raised her eyebrows. \u201cLike a herd?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy own personal harem. But I\u2019m always open to new applicants.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs intriguing as that sounds, I\u2019m not very good in a crowd.\u201d</p><p>He agreed. She was a woman who wanted a conventional life. \u201cSo why aren\u2019t you married with three kids?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI really only want two. Maybe a dog. I don\u2019t know. I never met the right one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDog or guy?\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cGuy. I\u2019ve dated, I almost got engaged. Most of them were really nice men. Smart, good jobs, dependable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s dumb and ridiculous.\u201d She stacked several dirty bowls together then carried them over to the sink. \u201cI want...sparks. You know? That wild, chemical attraction. I want my stomach to clench when the man in my life touches me. I want to hold my breath when the phone rings in case it\u2019s him.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cPassion.\u201d</p><p>She wiped her hands on a towel. \u201cExactly. I haven\u2019t felt that before. Plus, it\u2019s slightly possible that I might have some trust issues, given my whole family situation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour mom sending you away.\u201d He stood and walked around the counter. \u201cMy dad walked out on me when I was a kid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you know what I mean.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in front of her. \u201cWe could be on Oprah,\u201d he said, staring into her blue eyes and wondering how it was possible for them to be such a beautiful color.</p><p>\u201cOr Dr. Phil. I\u2019m sort of addicted to him.\u201d</p><p>They were close enough that she was all he could think about. Her mouth beckoned and tempted, her body seemed to sway toward him. The kitchen crackled with electricity. When her eyes dilated, he knew she felt it too.</p><p>\u201cOh,\u201d she breathed. \u201cBut this was supposed to be a bad idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt still is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s why you came over.\u201d</p><p>Was it? He hadn\u2019t consciously thought about it, but she could be right. \u201cTell me no and I\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like that?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>She looked at him for a long time, then reached up and rubbed her thumb against his lower lip.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is it about good women and bad boys?\u201d she asked softly. \u201cYou\u2019re a kind of a temptation I\u2019ve never had to resist before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to resist?\u201d</p><p>Did she? Gracie wasn\u2019t sure she had an answer. Of course not being able to think was part of the problem. With Riley standing so close, staring at her as if he wanted her more desperately than he\u2019d ever wanted any other woman ever, she found herself melting inside.</p><p>Her body ached. Every inch of skin longed to be touched by him. She wanted to feel him against her, in her. She wanted to lose control and take him with her. She wanted them both aroused, desperate, helpless in the face of their desire, then she wanted to be with him afterwards, when they touched and kissed in the wonderment of what they\u2019d just done.</p><p>Of course this was Riley whose philosophy with women didn\u2019t exactly lend itself to tenderness. Was she prepared for him not sticking around? Was she prepared to be part of the three F\u2019s?</p><p>He lightly stroked her cheek. The soft brush of his fingers shouldn\u2019t have been all that exciting, but she felt her body respond to the flash of what could only be described as sparks.</p><p>And then she knew it didn\u2019t matter about after or what the neighbors would say or her past or his. Because the Riley she\u2019d wanted fourteen years ago had been little more than a cardboard cutout. She hadn\u2019t known enough to make him real. While the man in front of her was pretty spectacular.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself with all that thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, Gracie, if you have to talk yourself into it, I\u2019m not interested in\u2014\u201d</p> <p>She raised herself on tiptoes and pressed her mouth to his, effectively cutting him off in midsentence. The hand by her cheek dropped to rest on her shoulder, but otherwise he didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Ah, so he was going to make her prove to him she wanted this. That was fine\u2014she was more than up to the challenge.</p><p>As she moved her lips against his, she grabbed his shirt and pulled it free of his slacks. Even as she stroked her tongue against his bottom lip, she slipped her hands under the shirt and rubbed them across his belly then up his chest.</p><p>She was prepared to do more\u2014a lot more\u2014to convince him, but it turned out to be unnecessary. His mouth parted and he claimed her in a kiss so deep, she thought she could get lost in it forever, even as his arms came around her and hauled her hard against him.</p><p>Her hands were trapped between them, but that didn\u2019t matter. Not when his tongue stroked hers, circled, danced and caused the sparks to explode into a whole fireworks show. He was warm and strong and when she shifted her hips, she found out he was already hard.</p><p>Instantly her stomach clenched, as did her thighs. Between her legs she felt both heat and dampness. Wanting exploded.</p><p>She pulled her arms free and moved her hands around to his back. She was still under the shirt so she could feel his bare skin. Muscles bunched as she moved over them. She slipped lower to his hips then his butt where she gently squeezed the tight, high curve.</p><p>Oh, yeah, this was good, she thought hazily as he surged against her. She rotated her pelvis, bringing herself more firmly in contact with his erection. Desire flowed hotter and faster.</p><p>He pulled back a little and lowered his head so he could kiss her neck. He lingered at the sensitive spot below her ear, nibbling and licking until her entire body tingled. He reached for the hem of her T-shirt and tugged at it. She released him long enough to let him pull it over her head.</p><p>When he\u2019d tossed the garment aside, he stared into her eyes. She looked back at all the passion swirling in his and felt herself surrendering more.</p><p>\u201cI want you,\u201d he breathed as he set his hands on her waist and began to move them higher.</p><p>Anticipation swelled within her. Her breasts ached, her nipples tightened. Touch me, she screamed silently, but what she said was, \u201cI want you, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p><p>As he asked the question, he brushed his thumbs across her nipples. Sparks moved past fireworks and became an entire electrical storm. She arched her head back and silently begged him to do more, to never stop, to keep\u2014</p><p>He bent down and took her nipple in his mouth. Even through the fabric of her bra, she felt the heat and moisture, the light grating of his teeth. She clutched at him, as much to keep her balance as to hold him in place. He couldn\u2019t stop. Not ever. It felt too good.</p><p>He reached for the two hooks on the back of her bra. When it slid down her arms, she released him long enough to shove it away. Then he was back, his mouth on her bare flesh and it was all she could do not to scream.</p><p>\u201cOh, yes!\u201d she moaned, eyes closed, breathing shallow.</p><p>He circled her nipple, then sucked on it. He caressed the other breast with his fingers. It was incredible. No better. It was need and heat and wanting all merging and growing until she could only gasp with the pleasure.</p><p>She ran her fingers through his hair, then over his shoulders. Suddenly she wanted him naked. She wanted to touch him.</p><p>\u201cRiley,\u201d she whispered as she reached for the button on her khakis. \u201cTake your clothes off.\u201d</p><p>She liked that she didn\u2019t have to ask twice. He straightened and immediately went to work on his shirt. After unfastening the cuffs, he simply pulled it over his head, tie and all. He kicked off his shoes, pulled off socks, then dropped his trousers and boxers in one easy movement.</p><p>She\u2019d managed to shed the rest of her clothes and enjoy the view for all of three seconds before he moved in and claimed her with a kiss that stirred her down to her soul. They clung to each other, holding, rubbing, reaching, grasping.</p><p>He started nudging her backward. She couldn\u2019t stop kissing him to figure out where they were going. Then his hand was on her breast and it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>She reached between them to caress his arousal just as she felt herself bump into the table.</p><p>Riley leaned around her and swept the surface clean. Pans and racks went flying to the floor. The crash of metal on tile reverberated in the room, but she didn\u2019t care. Not when he lifted her up onto the smooth wood of the table and positioned himself between her legs.</p><p>She opened herself wide for him, expecting him to claim her that minute. Instead he slid one hand behind her head and the other into the swollen wetness of her desire. His fingers found that one spot she liked best and began to circle it.</p><p>\u201cLook at me,\u201d he said when she would have closed her eyes. \u201cI want to see if you like it.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI like it a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah? What about when I do this?\u201d</p><p>He gently squeezed his thumb and index finger around the sensitive flesh, moving up and down in a quick motion that took her breath away.</p><p>Speech became impossible as she lost herself in sensation. Her body tensed as liquid pleasure poured through her. She couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t do anything but stay impossibly still and silently beg him to never stop.</p><p>He didn\u2019t. He kept on touching her until her release became as inevitable as the tide. She slowly closed her eyes, then held on to his shoulders as she got closer and closer until\u2014</p><p>He stopped. She opened her mouth to protest. She\u2019d been seconds from\u2014</p><p>He kissed her. At the same moment he claimed her mouth, he pushed deep into her, replacing his fingers with something far larger and more impressive. She groaned, then wrapped her legs around his hips to hold him in place.</p><p>Even as their tongues mated, he moved in and out of her. She felt his thickness rubbing her, pushing her already aroused body past any reasonable limit to that place where pleasure is the only possibility. She clung to him, wanting, needing, straining until at last she lost herself in the wildness of her climax. Muscles contracted, released, then contracted again. She gasped as it went on and on. He continued to fill her, getting harder and thicker until at last, when she\u2019d nearly finished, he shuddered and pushed into her one last time.</p><p>Gracie would swear she\u2019d actually lost consciousness for a second or two. When her brain resurfaced she found herself leaning against him, breathing heavily. His arms held her tightly against him as if he would never let go. His heart thundered in her ear.</p><p>She raised her head and smiled at him. \u201cNot bad.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled, then cupped her face in his hands and lightly kissed her. \u201cI was going to say that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ve had worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter?\u201d</p><p>He kissed her again. \u201cNot possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>She felt relaxed and comfortable and just a little squishy inside. Why was there never a box of tissues around when you needed them? Usually she did this sort of thing in her bedroom where there were supplies, like tissues and condoms and\u2014</p><p>Oh...my...God. She pushed him away and slid down until she stood on the floor and faced him.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you get a leg cramp?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t use any protection.\u201d</p><p>Good humor faded as if it had never been. \u201cYou\u2019re not on the Pill?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Several things happened all at once. The smell of burning cake suddenly filled the kitchen just as she noticed the smoke pouring out of the oven. Riley took several steps back, as if to put physical distance between himself and what they\u2019d done, and someone started pounding on her front door.</p><p>Gracie shrieked and reached for her clothes. \u201cI\u2019ll accept anyone but my mother,\u201d she said as she pulled on her panties. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you give me that look. I didn\u2019t do this on purpose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot every woman in America is on the Pill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you have no right to be mad at me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m mad at myself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think that was any better. The pounding continued, along with a faint cry of \u201cGracie? Gracie? Are you home?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think it\u2019s the woman who lives next door,\u201d Gracie said.</p><p>She fastened her bra, then stepped into her pants. Riley had already pulled on his slacks.</p><p>\u201cCould you get the oven?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want the smoke detector coming on.\u201d</p><p>He did as she requested. She grabbed her shirt and shot out of the kitchen. After tugging the T-shirt in place, she smoothed her hair, then pulled open the door.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said, smiling brightly and hoping her neighbor, whose name she couldn\u2019t remember, wouldn\u2019t notice anything was wrong.</p><p>\u201cOh, Gracie. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s Muffin. She fell in the pool and I can\u2019t get her out. She won\u2019t come to the steps. She\u2019s just swimming around and it\u2019s been so long. Please. Please come help me!\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>The woman, late sixties with the wrinkled appearance of someone who had lived hard and was now tired, actually wrung her hands together. It was already dark and there was a cool breeze off the ocean. The last thing Gracie wanted to do was jump into a cold swimming pool, but she forced herself to nod.</p><p>\u201cLet me grab my shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>She turned back to find Riley in the hallway. He finished tucking in his shirt.</p> <p>\u201cThe neighbor\u2019s dog fell in the pool,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI heard. I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d</p><p>She blinked at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s cold out there. I\u2019d appreciate a towel or two, though.\u201d</p><p>He walked past her before she could say anything. Her neighbor\u2014Gracie still couldn\u2019t remember her name\u2014clutched his arm.</p> <p>\u201cOh, thank you so much. I don\u2019t know what I was going to do. Little Muffin seems to be losing strength. Plus the water is so cold and she\u2019s so small.\u201d The women gave a sob.</p><p>Gracie was about to head after them when she remembered the towels. She dashed into her bathroom, pulled out three, then hurried to the front of the house and over to her neighbor\u2019s.</p><p>By the time she got there, Riley had already pulled off his shirt and shoes and waded into the pool. Muffin, a very small and wet Yorkie, paddled furiously, but not in the direction of her rescuer. As Riley approached the dog growled and paddled toward the deep end.</p><p>\u201cMuffin, no!\u201d the older woman cried. \u201cThe nice man is trying to help you. Go to him, honey. Go on. Mommy says it will be fine.\u201d</p><p>Gracie crouched by the edge of the pool. Riley shot her an unamused glanced.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou volunteered.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNext time stop me.\u201d He muttered something under his breath that sounded fairly unrepeatable in mixed company, then he moved out toward Muffin.</p><p>The Yorkie might be tiny but she was a fine swimmer who zipped across the pool like a missile. Every time Riley moved within grabbing distance, she darted away.</p><p>In the lights from around the pool Gracie saw Riley shiver in the freezing water. She stuck her fingers into the pool, then quickly pulled them back. Okay, maybe it wasn\u2019t a good idea for both of them to get chilled to the bone.</p><p>Riley finally cornered the small dog by the ladder in the deep end. As he treaded water, he reached out for Muffin. The dog moved left. Riley grabbed her and pulled her close. Man and dog instantly yelped, but he didn\u2019t let go.</p><p>Still cursing under his breath, he swam the foot or two to the side of the pool and tossed Muffin to safety, then started climbing the ladder. Gracie hurried around to hand him a towel. It was only then that she saw the little dog had scratched up his chest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt hurts as much as if she did.\u201d</p><p>The neighbor wrapped her dog in a fluffy white towel and cooed. \u201cThere\u2019s a good girl. There\u2019s a pretty girl. You need to stay away from the big, bad pool.\u201d The woman looked up. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Riley said. He started to the gate that would take him out of her yard. \u201cGood night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, wait. I could pay you something.\u201d</p><p>Riley waved and kept walking. Gracie hurried after him.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get you cleaned up,\u201d she said. \u201cThose scratches look\u2014\u201d</p><p>She never got to finish her sentence. As Riley stepped out onto the driveway there was a huge flash of light. Seconds later Gracie heard the sound of running feet, then a car door slammed, an engine started and the vehicle sped away.</p><p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>\u201cTHIS IS NOT HAPPENING,\u201d Gracie said in a voice that was uncomfortably close to a shriek.</p><p>Rather than respond, Riley grabbed her hand and pulled her back inside her house. When the door was firmly closed and locked, he glanced down at the oozing scratches on his chest and swore.</p><p>\u201cDamn dog.\u201d</p><p>Gracie spun toward him. \u201cYes, the dog was really bad, but did you see that? Did you see the guy with the camera? What\u2019s going on? Who\u2019s doing this? And why? I\u2019m totally creeped out. Some man was lurking outside my house. He was obviously following one of us and\u2014\u201d She looked at his chest and winced. \u201cBathroom. Now.\u201d</p><p>He followed her down the short hallway into an old-fashioned bathroom decorated in various and unappealing shades of green.</p><p>Gracie dug around in the cabinet, then straightened and held out a tube of something. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will hurt too much, but we\u2019ve got to get something on those scratches. Should we wash them first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI think the pool took care of that. It was cold as hell, but I could smell the chlorine.\u201d</p><p>She glanced down at his soaked and dripping trousers. \u201cSo those will be ruined.\u201d</p><p>He figured his clothes were the least of his concern. He didn\u2019t much care about the marks on his chest either\u2014what had his full attention was the man taking pictures. Gracie\u2019s life hardly supported the idea of her having a lot of angry enemies trying to ruin her, which left only one alternative. Someone was setting him up.</p><p>But for what reason? Was someone unhappy about him running the bank? He figured that was possible, but not likely. Which left Franklin Yardley, mayor of Los Lobos\u2014a man determined not to lose his election.</p><p>\u201cDeep breath,\u201d Gracie said as she opened the tube of ointment.</p><p>\u201cI promise not to scream like a woman,\u201d he said dryly.</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d</p><p>As she smoothed on the medication, he considered possibilities. The only way the asshole photographer could have been there at the right moment was if he\u2019d been hanging around, watching. So he was following Riley. Or someone had tipped him off.</p><p>He looked at Gracie as she worked. Of everyone in town, she knew the most about his comings and goings. She\u2019d hesitated before coming to the door. Could she have made a phone call?</p><p>Even as he considered the question, he wanted to dismiss it. There was no way Gracie would set him up.</p><p>His refusal to seriously consider her as a suspect told him two things\u2014first, that he was in more trouble where she was concerned than he\u2019d first realized. And second, that she was probably guilty as hell.</p><p>GRACIE STOOD in the center of her driveway and told herself to keep breathing. It had been one of those nights, where the churning in her stomach had kept her up past midnight and her whirling thoughts had taken care of the rest of the hours. She felt sluggish and crabby and completely and totally furious.</p><p>There was a huge \u201cabove the fold\u201d picture of Riley on the front page of the local paper. He had a towel over his head, as if trying to hide from the camera, when she knew darned well he\u2019d just been drying off his hair. Worse, there were scratches on his chest. In the picture, they didn\u2019t look as fresh and angry as they had in person. Instead they looked as if they could have been caused by a night of wild sex.</p><p>The headline didn\u2019t help: Mayoral Candidate\u2019s Secret Life.</p><p>Gracie wanted to stomp her foot and scream. She did neither, mostly because it was very early and she was barefoot.</p><p>So now what? Where could she go to complain? A letter to the editor? A banner across Main Street? Could she just find Mayor Yardley and smack him upside the head?</p><p>She squinted at the picture again, then groaned. She was there. In the background, but still clearly visible, looking shocked and more than a little disheveled.</p><p>Gracie crumpled the paper in her hands and slowly made her way back to the rental. She did not need this in her life. She had cakes to bake and a meeting at lunchtime at her mother\u2019s to discuss a wedding that may or may not still be on and...\u201cI need a vacation,\u201d she mumbled as she stepped back into the house and slammed the door behind her.</p><p>GRACIE HOVERED on the front porch of her mother\u2019s house. She didn\u2019t want to be here. After what had happened just a few days ago, she never wanted to walk inside again.</p><p>To be honest, she wasn\u2019t sure how she\u2019d found herself agreeing to yet another planning meeting. Alexis had called and insisted and somehow Gracie had said yes.</p><p>\u201cTalk about stupid,\u201d she muttered, then stepped up to the front door and knocked.</p><p>The door opened instantly. Alexis smiled. \u201cGood. You made it. Come in.\u201d</p><p>Gracie followed her inside. Her sister moved into the living room where Vivian sat by the window.</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Mom?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not coming,\u201d Alexis said, turning toward her and folding her arms across her chest. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know about this.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cWant to explain yourself?\u201d</p><p>Vivian stood and smoothed the front of her flower print dress. \u201cYou really hurt her feelings the last time you were here. She wouldn\u2019t tell us what you two fought about, but she\u2019s still upset. You can\u2019t do this, Gracie. You can\u2019t make everything about yourself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Gracie said, unable to believe they\u2019d set her up to attack her. \u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s mouth dropped open. \u201cThat is so not true. Alexis, can you believe she said that? Make her apologize.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Alexis grabbed her arm. \u201cGracie, wait. We have to talk about this. Please. We\u2019re worried about you.\u201d</p><p>Which sounded great, Gracie through grimly, but she\u2019d learned enough about her sisters in the past couple of weeks to be wary of just about everything her family had to say.</p><p>Gracie pulled free of Alexis and walked to the sofa where she perched on the edge of a cushion. She had a bad feeling she knew what was coming. Vivian sat across from her, while Alexis took the other end of the sofa.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re worried about you and Riley,\u201d Alexis said.</p><p>\u201cI knew it.\u201d Gracie wanted to spring to her feet and run screaming from the room. \u201cI knew that was exactly what you were going to want to talk about.\u201d She glared at her sister. \u201cI\u2019ll accept it from my mother, because of who she is, but there is no way I\u2019m going to take it from you. Need I remind you that you are the reason I had to deal with him in the first place. You\u2019re the one who had me sneaking around his house and taking pictures.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI understand that I had some small part in it,\u201d Alexis said primly.</p><p>\u201cSome small part?\u201d Gracie had the sense of being in an alternate universe where logic no longer existed. She turned her attention to Vivian. \u201cAre you here to lecture me about Riley, too, or do you have something else?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s Riley.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Then let\u2019s get one thing straight. I don\u2019t care what you think or say. I\u2019m going to do what I want. But for the record, we are not involved. There is absolutely nothing between us. We\u2019re\u2014\u201d</p><p>Sleeping together. Oh, yeah. In her outrage, she\u2019d forgotten that one simple fact.</p><p>\u201cThen explain this,\u201d Alexis said, pulling the newspaper out from under the coffee table and slapping it on the surface. \u201cWhat exactly were you two doing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy neighbor\u2019s dog fell in the pool. She came over in a complete panic. Riley went in after her dog, despite the fact that the water was freezing cold. Unfortunately Muffin didn\u2019t understand the whole rescue concept and scratched him. I can get you her phone number if you\u2019d like. She\u2019ll confirm everything.\u201d</p><p>Alexis didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWhy was he at your house in the first place?\u201d</p><p>Interesting question, Gracie thought. She realized she had no clue what had made him stop by.</p><p>\u201cWhy does that matter? You don\u2019t get to tell me who my friends are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you friends?\u201d Vivian asked. \u201cOr is it just the illusion of friendship?\u201d She leaned forward and lowered her voice. \u201cGracie, honey, we\u2019re so worried. You\u2019re in a really fragile state right now.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI\u2019m fragile?\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cI feel your pain. Despite the fact that we should really be talking about me and my wedding, I have enough compassion to know what you\u2019re going through. I\u2019m sorry you never fit in.\u201d</p><p>Gracie narrowed her gaze. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn high school. I know you were unpopular and a misfit. You\u2019ve never had any friends. No one liked you and now you\u2019re back here, reliving your youthful crush on Riley.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stood. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. I\u2019m tired of being used and insulted.\u201d</p><p>Vivian rose. \u201cI\u2019m trying to help.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so, but if this is your idea of help, I don\u2019t want it or need it. You don\u2019t know anything about my life. How dare you make judgments? For your information, I did fine in high school. I got good grades, I had friends, I was a cheerleader and gosh, I was elected to the Homecoming court. Oh, my boyfriend even expected me to sleep with him after prom. Sounds pretty traditional to me, but then I didn\u2019t grow up here. I don\u2019t know what your expectations are.\u201d</p><p>Alexis sighed. \u201cVivian, you\u2019re not helping. Sit down and shut up.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat do you mean I\u2019m not helping? I\u2019m trying to make her understand.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want me to understand?\u201d Gracie asked. \u201cWhat exactly is your point?\u201d</p><p>Vivian\u2019s eyes filled with tears. \u201cThis is all about you and Riley. What about me? What about my wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs the wedding back on this week? Wow. Color me surprised.\u201d</p><p>Vivian glared at her. \u201cSo you\u2019re not just pathetic, you\u2019re also a bitch.\u201d</p><p>Gracie looked at the two women. \u201cFine. You guys win. Think what you want. If your opinion of me is that I\u2019m a bitch obsessed with the man from my youth, I can live with that.\u201d</p> <p>She turned to leave.</p><p>Alexis jumped to her feet. \u201cGracie, don\u2019t. We have to work this out. We\u2019re family.\u201d</p><p>Were they? She thought about her aunt and uncle. She\u2019d barely known them when she\u2019d moved in with them, but they\u2019d loved her and cared about her. They\u2019d always been supportive and loving. When they\u2019d been killed in that car accident, she thought she would never recover.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother,\u201d Vivian said as she wiped her face. \u201cShe\u2019s just mad because I didn\u2019t ask her to be in the wedding. And I\u2019m glad, Gracie. You hear me? I\u2019m really, really glad.\u201d</p><p>Gracie walked to the door, then glanced back. \u201cMe, too,\u201d she said softly and left.</p><p>GRACIE CLIMBED into her car and pulled out her cell. The little message envelope flashed, but she couldn\u2019t think of a single person she wanted to talk to right now. She shoved the phone back in her purse and considered her next destination. She didn\u2019t really want to go back to the rental. Too many memories.</p><p>She started the car, then made a U-turn and headed across town. As she pulled into the parking lot of the bed-and-breakfast, she noted Pam\u2019s car.</p><p>Still, the potential to get lost in her baking seemed more enticing than her worry that she would run into the other woman, so she parked and went inside.</p> <p>Twenty minutes later she had a preheated oven, plenty of batter in large bowls and the measurable lifting of her spirits. She\u2019d just started to pour when Pam walked in.</p><p>The slender blonde looked stunning, as usual. She smiled as she leaned against the counter and set down several fabric samples.</p><p>\u201cCan I lick the bowls when you\u2019re done?\u201d she asked with a grin.</p><p>\u201cRaw eggs. I doubt you want to risk it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmm, good point. Still, I love the way your cakes smell. If I could find a way to bottle the scent, I could make a fortune. Instead I\u2019m knee-deep in fabric samples.\u201d She held up two dark prints covered with flowers. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re both really nice.\u201d</p><p>Pam laughed. \u201cLet me guess. Decorating isn\u2019t your thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI enjoy it. I think the B&amp;B is going to be a lot of fun.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI would be happier if there really had been an alien landing like we all thought in high school.\u201d</p><p>Gracie finished pouring and carried the pans to the oven. \u201cI can\u2019t see extraterrestrials flying all the way to earth only to land in Los Lobos. Don\u2019t you think they\u2019d want somewhere with better shopping and more restaurant choices?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point. Although I can think of a few people I\u2019d like taken away by aliens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, me, too,\u201d Gracie said as she straightened. \u201cWe could start a list.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I go first?\u201d Pam grinned.</p><p>Gracie carried the bowls over to the sink. \u201cDo you have a grand opening date yet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m thinking the Fourth of July weekend. Plenty of tourists looking for a place to stay. I\u2019ve put out the word and I\u2019m already getting reservations. Of course that puts the pressure on for me to finish, but hey, I can manage. Sleep is highly overrated.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded as she ran water in the bowls. This all felt so weird. She was standing here having a perfectly normal conversation with Pam Whitefield, whom she had always hated. But Pam seemed to be completely nice while Gracie\u2019s own sisters were acting mean enough to be candidates for demonic possession. What was going on?</p><p>\u201cAre you getting a lot of flak about the picture in the paper?\u201d Pam asked. \u201cI confess I saw it this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a surprise,\u201d Gracie told her. \u201cIt was on the front page. Hard to miss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s a real drag for you. But Riley looked good. He always did have an impressive body.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was helping my neighbor. Her dog fell in the pool.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo that explains the scratches.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. Little Muffin wasn\u2019t as grateful as she could have been.\u201d She finished with the bowls, wiped her hands, then turned back to Pam. \u201cThen some guy takes the picture and suddenly Riley\u2019s in the middle of a scandal. Poor guy.\u201d</p><p>Pam\u2019s kind expression didn\u2019t change, although Gracie thought she might have seen a little sharpening around the eyes. Or was that just her looking for trouble?</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re not...\u201d Pam shrugged delicately.</p><p>Not sure if she was being set up or no, Gracie sighed. \u201cI swear, there was a pool, a trapped Yorkie and a frantic neighbor.\u201d Yes, there had also been sex, but she wasn\u2019t about to spill that.</p><p>\u201cJust as well,\u201d Pam said. \u201cRiley looked great, but he never really grasped the whole \u2018pleasing a woman\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>Gracie had to bite her tongue to keep from defending him. \u201cBummer,\u201d she said instead.</p><p>Pam tilted her head. \u201cIt would be kind of sweet if you two got together after all this time.\u201d</p><p>That made Gracie choke. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding. Aside from the fact that you\u2019re about the last person who should want that, I can\u2019t imagine any universe in which it would be considered normal.\u201d</p><p>Pam looked away. \u201cSometimes you can\u2019t fight fate.\u201d</p><p>GRACIE RETURNED to her rental late that afternoon feeling as if she\u2019d run a marathon, or at least a half one. She was weary to the bone, slightly beat-up and more than a little out of sorts.</p><p>She couldn\u2019t make sense of her world, which was unlike her. In the past few years, she\u2019d prided herself on living smack in the middle of normal. Coming back to Los Lobos had changed all that. Okay\u2014coming back to Los Lobos and getting involved with Riley had changed all that.</p><p>While she didn\u2019t mind the Riley part of her life, the rest of it wasn\u2019t so easy to deal with. She didn\u2019t like fighting with her family. She\u2019d had the fantasy of a warm and loving reunion in mind, but the reality was about as far from that as it was possible to get. She hated the lectures, the assumptions, the judging, the rejection. Worse, without them, she was truly alone.</p><p>Gracie tried to tell herself that she\u2019d been alone since the death of her aunt and uncle. The only difference was now she knew it whereas before she\u2019d hoped she had more. Only the news didn\u2019t make her feel any better.</p><p>Fighting a headache, she pulled into the driveway of her rental only to see a familiar car parked next to her spot. The gleaming Mercedes made her heart beat a little faster, but that was nothing compared with the rapid tap dance it took up when Riley stepped out and nodded at her.</p><p>Man, oh man, did he look good. She liked the way the sunlight caught the earring he wore. How many bank presidents claimed that slightly sexy, slightly dangerous look? She liked that he was strong and determined and someone she could count on. She liked how he made her feel inside. Okay, she liked how he made her feel on the outside, too. She wanted\u2014</p><p>Gracie stopped her car and turned off the engine. In the second it took her to drop her keys into her purse and open the door to step out, she reminded herself that not only was she in town for a few weeks, but that she couldn\u2019t seriously think about getting involved with Riley.</p><p>No, no, no, no, no. Not him. Remember? Anyone but him. He was her past, her scary obsession. He was a man going in one direction and she...she was going somewhere else.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d she said as she got out and slammed her door shut.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been waiting long?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cAbout fifteen minutes. I was about to call your cell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was at Pam\u2019s. Baking. So what\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have to talk.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cRiley, that\u2019s the girl\u2019s line. I thought guys took an oath to never say it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis time it\u2019s true. We have to talk about last night. We didn\u2019t use a condom. If you\u2019re not on the Pill, we have to discuss what could happen.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWELVE</p><p>RILEY WATCHED closely as Gracie reacted to his statement. Her eyes widened slightly, her mouth twisted and her shoulders slumped. Obviously this was not the topic she\u2019d hoped they would discuss. But did that mean she was guilty of setting him up in more ways than one?</p><p>He couldn\u2019t decide, and he hadn\u2019t been able to come to a decision all day. He wanted to say he knew Gracie, but did he? She was funny and smart and led with her heart and her chin, but he\u2019d been used by women before. Was she any different or was she just better at it?</p><p>\u201cCome on in,\u201d she said, and led the way into the house.</p><p>He followed her into the kitchen where she put down her purse and turned toward him. She folded her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cIt was just one time,\u201d she said, sounding more defensive than angry. \u201cThe odds of anything happening are really, really slim.\u201d</p><p>What he didn\u2019t understand was how it had happened at all. Ever since he\u2019d been a kid and thought he\u2019d gotten Pam pregnant, he\u2019d been obsessively careful. But last night....</p><p>\u201cI agree it\u2019s unlikely,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to know.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and walked to the large calendar on the wall. Stickers of cakes had been placed on various dates with the names and locations next to them in black felt pen. She counted out the days twice, then sighed.</p><p>\u201cMy period is due in twelve days.\u201d</p><p>Riley figured he knew as much or as little about the inner workings of the female reproductive system as the next guy. He prided himself on being good in bed, but the baby-making stuff was more of a mystery. Information reluctantly learned in high school sex-ed drifted through his brain. If he remembered correctly, midcycle was the most dangerous time. Well, shit.</p><p>\u201cHow long after that can you find out if you\u2019re pregnant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She winced. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A couple of days. I\u2019ve never used a pregnancy test myself, but I\u2019ve heard they\u2019re fast and you don\u2019t need to be very late.\u201d</p><p>She turned to face him. Her eyes were wide and troubled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a tiny bit premature to be having this conversation? Can\u2019t we just wait and see what happens?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He had the information he needed now. He would bide his time until she either got her period or he had proof she was pregnant. While he didn\u2019t want a repeat of Pam\u2019s performance, he also wasn\u2019t willing to walk away from his responsibilities. His father had walked out twenty-one years ago, but Riley still remembered everything about the day. He wouldn\u2019t do that to any kid of his.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just the odds are so against me being...you know.\u201d She swallowed. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t take on one more thing. I\u2019ve got wedding cakes, my family, you, whoever is following one of us, the newspaper pictures. I just can\u2019t deal with any more.\u201d</p> <p>As she spoke, she reached for her purse, then dug out her bottle of antacids. After popping two and chewing them, she sighed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m such a rock, huh?\u201d she asked softly.</p><p>\u201cYou do okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not so sure. I thought coming back here would be easy, but it\u2019s not. Who was that guy last night? Is he after me or you? I\u2019m guessing you, because of the election. Plus you have the debate in a couple of days. But it\u2019s creepy. And I hate the newspaper thing. The picture. I feel so bad about it, but it wasn\u2019t my fault. Still....\u201d</p><p>She pulled up a bar stool and sat down. She rested her elbows on the counter and her head in her hands.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m being a lousy hostess,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s cake in the cupboard and stuff to drink in the refrigerator. Help yourself.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t look like someone planning his demise, he thought. If he had to put money on it right now, he would say Gracie wasn\u2019t involved. But was that his gut talking or his dick? Because even now he wanted her. Slumped shoulders and pouty expression, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have any real food?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She turned her head so she could stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always offering me cake. What about a sandwich or meat loaf?\u201d</p><p>She straightened. \u201cI don\u2019t keep bread in the house. What kind of insanity would that be?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you have cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make cakes. It\u2019s tough not to have them in the house when I actually bake them. But I don\u2019t really cook, so you\u2019re not going to find meat loaf ever. I think I have a few cans of soup. And my tuna salad. That\u2019s a staple in my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you eat anything other than cake and tuna?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Salads. Fruit. I have some soy-based granola in the cupboard.\u201d</p><p>He grimaced and claimed the stool next to hers. \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re really lying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little.\u201d She turned so she faced him. \u201cYou still mad at me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was never mad.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYeah, you were. When I first got here. Are you thinking....\u201d She shrugged. \u201cI guess I don\u2019t know what you were thinking, but it can\u2019t have been good. I didn\u2019t.... I\u2019m not the one doing all this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said, because he wanted to believe her. \u201cI hired a private detective from L.A. He\u2019s coming up in the morning and he\u2019ll find the photographer. Once we know who\u2019s taking the pictures, we\u2019ll find the person behind it.\u201d</p><p>He watched her as he spoke, looking for hints of panic or concern. Instead she held his gaze and when he\u2019d finished said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait to get to the bottom of this. We\u2019ll both feel better with some answers.\u201d</p><p>Which meant what? That she wasn\u2019t the one setting him up? He wanted Gracie to be innocent, which bugged the hell out of him. He didn\u2019t get involved\u2014not ever. He\u2019d yet to see the purpose of anything longer than a night with a woman. Keeping his distance meant he didn\u2019t get betrayed. So why was he still here?</p><p>\u201cMy sisters had an intervention today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was pretty horrible. Alexis thinks I\u2019m obsessing about you. She seems to have completely forgotten that I only got involved because of her. Vivian is convinced I had a completely horrible time in high school, that I was a social misfit with no friends and no boyfriend. Where do they get that? I was normal. I was a cheerleader.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I can see that shallow perkiness in you.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze narrowed. \u201cI\u2019m not shallow and I\u2019m not especially perky.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a little offbeat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can accept that. My world view is slightly skewed, but I like that about me.\u201d Her shoulders slumped again. \u201cPam is confusing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam? My ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat would be her. I\u2019ve been using her kitchen at the bed-and-breakfast, which means I run into her. She\u2019s been really...nice.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d expected a lot of words, but that wasn\u2019t one of them. \u201cAre we talking about the same Pam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Tall, skinny, blond. Great clothes.\u201d Gracie leaned back on the bar stool. \u201cIt\u2019s annoying, let me tell you. But the thing is, she\u2019s been really sweet. Saying nice stuff about you, even.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat a humanitarian.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of creepy. I almost want to like her, but I can\u2019t. Still, I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s acting this way. Jill told me she was still really bitchy, but she hasn\u2019t been to me. You think she\u2019s up to something?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want to take her at face value?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI should, huh? I mean it\u2019s totally horrible of me to judge her, but I can\u2019t help it. I want to like her but every time I try a little voice in my head starts screaming. Which means either she\u2019s faking me out or I\u2019m a really bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a bad person.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me well enough to decide.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure I do.\u201d</p><p>He stood and reached for her hand, then pulled her to her feet and drew her into his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay not to like Pam,\u201d he said, his lips pressing against her forehead. \u201cI won\u2019t tell.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d She snuggled closer, pressing her body against his.</p><p>She felt good, he thought. Warm. Soft.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be doing this,\u201d she told him. \u201cWhat about the three F\u2019s?\u201d</p><p>He stared into her blue eyes. At that moment he would swear he could see down to her soul. There weren\u2019t any secrets, any dark places. Which meant one of two things\u2014either he was a complete sap and she was a great actress, or he was messing where he didn\u2019t belong.</p><p>\u201cI already told you, I can\u2019t forget you,\u201d he said.</p><p>Her gaze held his. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do the other F either. You know that, right? We made love last night.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t something he liked to think about, but he nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, Gracie, we made love.\u201d</p><p>The words came from a place deep inside. He wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d ever said them before and he knew he\u2019d never meant them. Until Gracie.</p><p>What the hell was he doing?</p><p>He released her and stepped back. \u201cI gotta run,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Thanks for stopping by.\u201d</p><p>He waved, then turned on his heel and stalked out of the room.</p><p>Priorities, he told himself. He had them and he couldn\u2019t forget them. He didn\u2019t get involved, he didn\u2019t care, he didn\u2019t stick around. Nothing was going to change that. Not this town and certainly not Gracie.</p><p>RILEY SPENT the morning of the debate in his office at the bank. The loan department had just sent up its weekly report, which Diane handed to him.</p><p>\u201cBusiness is up,\u201d she said as he flipped through the file. \u201cA lot of home loan refinancing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can see that,\u201d he said, aware she was making a point that he was just as determined to ignore.</p><p>\u201cThose people\u2014the customers\u2014are going to expect to have the thirty years to repay. What\u2019s going to happen to them?\u201d</p><p>Riley didn\u2019t answer. They both knew what would happen. If he closed the bank, the loans would be recalled. Every single customer would have less than three months to secure new financing. If they couldn\u2019t, they would lose their house.</p><p>\u201cI know you think your uncle was a bastard, Riley, but are you sure you\u2019re making the right person pay for that?\u201d</p><p>The soft words couldn\u2019t have been more shocking if Diane had written them in blood. He stared at his secretary, wondering which was more surprising\u2014that she\u2019d called him by his first name or that she\u2019d used foul language.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re walking a thin line,\u201d he told her.</p><p>She smiled. \u201cAre you going to fire me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I fail to see the danger.\u201d Her smile faded. \u201cYou could do some good here,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou\u2019ve taken to the work. You like it. This is much bigger than your grandfather. This is about the community.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWant to know that I don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him for a long time. \u201cThen expecting more from you was my mistake.\u201d</p><p>She left without saying anything else. When he was alone again, Riley turned in his chair and stared at the portrait of his uncle.</p><p>\u201cSorry, big guy,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in saving your town. You thought you\u2019d won this round\u2014that I would do what you said to get the money. But things aren\u2019t going to turn out the way you expected. I\u2019m going to win\u2014my only regret is that you\u2019re not alive to watch me screw you.\u201d</p><p>GRACIE ARRIVED at the community center just before three. She had a lot of memories of the old building\u2014many school events had been held there, along with her Girl Scout meetings. There were smaller classroom-size spaces on the second floor and a larger open area on the first. She knew the debate would be held in the largest space, but she didn\u2019t head in that direction. Instead she circled around back and came in a rear entrance, so as not to cause a stir. She found Jill hovering by the heavy door. Her friend waved her in.</p><p>\u201cI saved us a couple of seats,\u201d Jill said in a low voice. \u201cHurry. They\u2019re about to start.\u201d</p><p>Gracie followed her inside. The lights over the audience had dimmed a little, leaving the two candidates in bright light up on stage. People were still settling and talking.</p><p>Jill led her to two seats on the far right side, three rows from the back. Gracie let Jill go in first, so she could be on the end and duck out quickly if she had to.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a big crowd,\u201d Jill said quietly as she glanced around. \u201cI doubt anyone will notice you\u2019re here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the plan,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this many people.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. They\u2019re broadcasting the debate live on the radio.\u201d</p><p>Gracie slumped down in her seat and tried not to make eye contact with anyone. \u201cI probably should have stayed home and listened to it there.\u201d</p><p>It would have been the sensible decision, but in truth, she\u2019d really wanted to see Riley. Being around him seemed to set her world back on its axis. She supposed she should be upset about them making love, but she wasn\u2019t. It had felt too right to be in his arms. And last night...when he\u2019d held her...she couldn\u2019t help wanting him to never let go.</p><p>She did her best to ignore the red flashing Danger signs in her head. Yeah, yeah, she knew the drill. Getting involved with Riley was a mistake on too many levels to count. Even if she was willing to ignore the humiliation of falling for a guy she\u2019d once stalked, there was the whole two different lives thing. His idea of a long-term relationship was one that lasted two nights. She wanted forever. Until recently he\u2019d lived on an oil rig and traveled the world and she rarely left her neighborhood. They had nothing in common and....</p><p>She frowned. Except for his seeming inability to commit to a woman for more than twenty-four hours, what was the problem? He was a great guy, she liked him, they had fun together. Was she overanalyzing this? Was there\u2014 </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019s going on with you?\u201d Jill asked, keeping her voice low. \u201cHow\u2019s the cake business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Busy. It\u2019s that time of year. The Pam thing is difficult.\u201d</p><p>Jill grinned. \u201cAre the cakes taking one look at her and falling?\u201d</p> <p>Gracie chuckled. \u201cActually not. It\u2019s more creepy than that. She\u2019s...nice.\u201d</p><p>Jill raised her eyebrows. \u201cNot possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. That\u2019s my feeling, too. But it\u2019s true\u2014she\u2019s pleasant and friendly and accommodating. She even said nice stuff about Riley. I can\u2019t decide if I should just accept her at face value or continue to be wary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou know what my vote would be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. To keep my distance and carry a cross at all times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly. Everything else okay?\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded. As much as she would like to talk about her family, this wasn\u2019t the place. Nor could she tell Jill what had happened with Riley. Eventually she would come clean, but not in a crowd.</p><p>Maybe she should regret what had happened, she thought. But she couldn\u2019t. The pregnancy thing was a little troubling. She pressed a hand to her stomach and told herself it wasn\u2019t possible. Statistically, the odds were seriously against it. Although she had to respect the irony of the situation if she was pregnant, what with Pam faking her pregnancy all those years ago so Riley would marry her.</p><p>Gracie had a feeling that even if she turned up pregnant, he wouldn\u2019t be making an honest woman of her. She wasn\u2019t sure how she felt about that. While she\u2019d never planned to be a single mother, she wouldn\u2019t turn her back on her baby. If Riley wasn\u2019t willing to participate, that was okay. But it made her sad to think he would walk way from his own child. Still, getting married just because of a pregnancy seemed like a recipe for disaster. She didn\u2019t want a relationship based on \u201chave to.\u201d She wanted heart-stopping, bone-melting, forever and till death do us part love.</p><p>\u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Jill asked. \u201cYou have the strangest look on your face.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know Mac was the one?\u201d</p> <p>Jill sighed. \u201cI just did. At first we were just friends.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOkay, he was just friends and I was crazy about him. He\u2019s so sexy. Anyway, we spent time together and it was always great. The more I got to know him, the more I wanted to know him. One thing led to another and then I was in love with him. Why do you ask?\u201d Her gaze narrowed. \u201cAre you\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood evening, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d the moderator said. \u201cWelcome to our first and only mayoral debate between our current mayor, Franklin Yardley, and his opponent, Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019m going to forget what we were talking about,\u201d Jill murmured in her ear as she turned her attention to the front of the room.</p><p>Gracie figured she would simply appreciate the interruption and deal with her friend later. She listened to the introduction of both candidates. Franklin Yardley looked as slick and polished as ever, but he was much older than his rival. Riley had the advantage of youth, size and mystery. There was something very appealing about the dark-haired stranger sitting on the mayor\u2019s left. Gracie had a feeling she wasn\u2019t the only woman in the audience who felt the pull.</p><p>The moderator explained the format. Each candidate would make an opening statement, then they would answer questions from the panel of newspaper reporters and professors from U.C. Santa Barbara. Finally, there would be a four-minute closing statement. Before the debate, the two men had drawn straws and Riley would be going first in the opening and closing statements.</p><p>He stood as he was introduced. Gracie found herself leaning forward, as if anticipating what he was going to say. He looked good, she thought. The dark suit flattered his strong, hard body. He wore his hair relatively short and brushed away from his face. His diamond stud glittered in the harsh overhead lighting.</p><p>Would the good citizens elect a man with an earring? Gracie wondered.</p><p>\u201cMayor Yardley has served our community for sixteen years,\u201d Riley began with a smile. \u201cThat\u2019s half my life. He\u2019s seen Los Lobos through good times and bad, strong tourist seasons and weak ones. He\u2019s learned the ins and outs of the job. I would guess after this many years, there aren\u2019t any surprises. He\u2019s a professional and a man of many talents.\u201d</p> <p>He looked around the room. For a second, Gracie would have sworn their eyes met, but she was pretty sure she was sitting too far back for him to see her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the last fourteen years traveling around the world,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut in the end, there was only one place I could call home. While the sentimental side of me appreciates that Los Lobos has barely changed in all that time, the businessman inside of me wonders if that\u2019s really for the best. If we want our children to have a superior education that allows them to have a better standard of living, we need money to pay for schools. If we want a community that can stand on its own and not always be at the mercy of the tourist dollar, we have to come up with a thoughtful, innovative plan that will take us forward without forcing us to lose touch with the very values and philosophies that make us what we are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good,\u201d Jill whispered. \u201cI\u2019m impressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>Riley might have started his bid for mayor because it was a condition of his uncle\u2019s will, but he\u2019d obviously embraced the idea and made it his own.</p><p>Riley finished his opening statement to the sound of loud applause. Mayor Yardley spoke, outlining his accomplishments in office. Next to Riley, he looked uncomfortable and out of place\u2014as if he\u2019d overstayed his welcome at a party.</p><p>The trend continued through the questions. Riley seemed to have a fresh take on every issue, while Yardley reiterated what he\u2019d done before. Even from the back of the room, Gracie could see the older man starting to sweat.</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s going to win this,\u201d Jill murmured. \u201cHe\u2019s really going to pull it off.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt a fierce flush of pride, as if she had something to do with Riley\u2019s success. When he finished his closing statement, everyone in the room rose and cheered. It took several minutes for the crowd to settle down enough for Franklin Yardley to speak.</p><p>\u201cYou seem taken with my opponent,\u201d the mayor said slowly. \u201cI can see why. He\u2019s new and shiny. Lots of big ideas. But it takes more than ideas to keep a city running smoothly. It takes practice and experience. And it takes character. You all know me. You\u2019re my neighbors, my friends. You\u2019ve served on committees with my wife, gone to school with my children, played golf with me.\u201d</p><p>Yardley stared out at the crowd and smiled. \u201cYou know my secrets\u2014the good and the bad about me.\u201d</p><p>A few people chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re lousy at poker, Franklin,\u201d someone yelled.</p><p>The mayor nodded. \u201cThat I am. I\u2019ve never had a good face for it. I can\u2019t tell a lie to save my soul. Things matter to me. My family. This town. I\u2019ve been here all my life. Four generations of Yardleys have served in Los Lobos.\u201d</p><p>He paused and drew in a deep breath. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s time for a change. Maybe I\u2019ve done all I can do. But is Riley Whitefield really the man you want? He\u2019s young. Inexperienced. He\u2019s been traipsing all over the world when he had business right here in town. Most of you know he took off to make his fortune while his own mother lay dying of cancer. Never even came back to see her. Not the example I want set for my children.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stiffened. \u201cThat\u2019s not what happened,\u201d she whispered to Jill as people began to stir in their seats. \u201cHe didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think Yardley cares about that?\u201d Jill asked.</p><p>Gracie stared at the stage, looking for some reaction from Riley. He remained seated, his expression calm.</p><p>But the mayor wasn\u2019t finished. He leaned forward at the podium. \u201cRiley was just a boy then. Barely eighteen. He\u2019d had a difficult time, getting a local girl pregnant, marrying her, then divorcing her. But people grow up. The boy becomes a man. They change. Well, some do. I\u2019m not so sure about Riley.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt her stomach start to churn. She had a feeling this was going to be very, very bad.</p><p>Mayor Yardley glanced at Riley, then at the crowd. \u201cWho do you want as the leader of your community? A man you know and trust? A man who has never lied or misled you? Or Riley Whitefield who is a stranger to us all? Not only did he walk out on his dying mother, he\u2019s returned to take advantage of our own Gracie Landon. She has loved him faithfully for years and he has repaid her with betrayal and scorn. Not only is she pregnant right this minute, but Riley is refusing to make an honest woman of her.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</p><p>GRACIE FELT the room tilt. For a second she thought she might faint for the first time in her life. A rushing sound filled her ears, her body felt both too heavy and too light and she couldn\u2019t seem to focus on anything. Then her vision cleared and she watched Riley spring to his feet and stare at her in fury and shock.</p><p>\u201cGracie?\u201d Jill asked. \u201cDid you\u2014\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t wait for Jill to finish her sentence. She could feel people looking at her, pointing, staring, talking. But none of that mattered. She didn\u2019t care about anything but Riley and what he must be thinking.</p><p>\u201cI have to go,\u201d she said as she stood and ran to the door. She heard someone calling her name, but she didn\u2019t stop, didn\u2019t turn around.</p><p>\u201cIs it true?\u201d someone yelled. \u201cDid Riley knock you up?\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt burning in her stomach, but this pain had nothing to do with her usual acid issues. Instead this ache came from the realization she had gotten very close to something special and it had all just been ripped away from her.</p><p>RILEY CONSIDERED returning to the bank. It was just after five so he could easily head home, but for some reason he didn\u2019t want to be alone.</p><p>The debate had been a disaster. Yardley had been so damn cheerful at the outset that Riley had begun to suspect he was up to something. But he never would have guessed what. Yardley had struck hard and in exactly the right place. The good citizens of Los Lobos might be willing to overlook a lot of flaws but no one would forgive him messing with a town legend.</p><p>How had Yardley known? Had he taken a few facts and put them together? Or had someone told him what had happened? He hadn\u2019t said a word to anyone and he doubted Gracie had been spreading rumors. Which meant the information could only have come from her.</p><p>He parked in his designated spot behind the bank, then climbed out of his car. There were still a few people heading inside to conduct their business before closing. He saw a woman pushing a stroller along the sidewalk. The air was warm, the sky clear. Everything was completely normal. Yet he felt as if he\u2019d been beaten up and left on the edge of the road.</p><p>How could she have done that to him? Why? He would have bet a considerable portion of his soon-to-be-lost inheritance that Gracie didn\u2019t like Mayor Yardley. So why would she help him? Bitterness over the past? Was this all an elaborate plan of revenge?</p><p>As he walked into the building, he told himself it might not be her. That whoever had followed them and taken the pictures could have seen enough to know what had happened. Until he had the report back from the private detective, he couldn\u2019t be sure of anything.</p><p>Except he didn\u2019t want it to be Gracie. Fourteen years ago, he would have sold his soul, or even his car, to get her out of his life. Now...Now he didn\u2019t know what he wanted.</p><p>He rounded the corner and headed for the elevator. Several employees stood together, talking quietly. As he approached, one of them nudged another. They all turned to look at him.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Whitefield,\u201d a young woman said. She didn\u2019t quite meet his gaze.</p><p>He nodded and stepped onto the elevator. They were talking again before the doors closed and all he heard was \u201cDo you think it\u2019s true that he really\u2014\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Word travels fast, he thought as he walked onto the second floor. He would guess the live radio broadcast was responsible. Zeke was going to be screaming tonight. They were going to have to come up with a great recovery plan and he didn\u2019t have a clue as to what it would be. Beating up Yardley might make him feel better, but wouldn\u2019t help the election. Same with suing the old bastard.</p><p>Riley moved into his office and closed the door behind him. He stared at the portrait of his uncle.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not winning,\u201d he told the long-dead figure. \u201cNot now, not ever. I\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p> <p>He would do what he\u2019d always done when the odds were against him. He would put his head down and work harder than everyone else around him. He wouldn\u2019t let anything get in his way. Not the town, not the past, not the damn mayor and not even Gracie.</p><p>He heard a knock on his door.</p><p>\u201cGo away,\u201d he called.</p><p>\u201cMr. Whitefield, you have someone here to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot interested.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThis is important.\u201d</p><p>Riley knew he\u2019d cleared his schedule for the day of the debate, so she wasn\u2019t talking about a meeting. Had Yardley come by to gloat?</p><p>He figured that wasn\u2019t the mayor\u2019s style. Curious, and more than a little interested in a distraction, he crossed to the door and pulled it open.</p><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d he asked, even as he found himself hoping Gracie had stopped by to explain herself.</p><p>Rather than answer, Diane stepped back. Riley looked behind her, expecting to see a familiar, curvy blonde with a quirky disposition and a ready smile. Instead he saw a man in his mid-to-late fifties, dressed in a worn suit and a stained white shirt. The hair was grayer, the lines in his face deeper. Somehow he seemed a whole lot smaller than Riley recalled.</p><p>It might have been over twenty years, but Riley remembered everything about the man who had abandoned his mother and himself.</p> <p>The old man gave him a twisted smile. \u201cHello, son. How have you been?\u201d</p><p>GRACIE DROVE halfway to Los Angeles before pulling off the freeway in Ventura and turning around to head back to Los Lobos. She gave herself the \u201cI am a grown-up\u201d lecture and reminded herself she couldn\u2019t run away from all her problems, even if it seemed like a good idea at the time.</p><p>She even believed herself\u2014sort of. But if someone had offered her a one-way ticket to help colonize one of the moons of Jupiter, she probably would have signed right up.</p><p>There were too many emotions swirling inside of her for her to know what she was feeling. Sick, mostly. Sick and sad and angry at whomever had betrayed her. Except she hadn\u2019t told anyone what was going on, so where had the mayor gotten his information?</p><p>Her cell phone rang again. She grabbed it and glanced at the display screen, then tossed it back on the seat. So far she\u2019d had three calls from Jill, two each from her sisters and about six from her mother. She wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk to any of them, and she hadn\u2019t heard from the one person she wanted to. Riley.</p><p>What was he thinking? Did he know she hadn\u2019t been the one to spill his secrets or was he right that second making a little doll that looked like her with plans to stick pins in it? Worse, did he hate her? Because she could stand him being angry, but not him turning away from her without giving her a chance to prove her innocence. Not that she had any kind of plan on how she was supposed to do that.</p><p>What she didn\u2019t understand was how this had happened in the first place. Who had set them up? And how? She had a hard time believing her neighbor had spied on her until she\u2019d seen Riley come over, then waited until she was pretty sure they were having sex, only to throw her precious dog into a cold pool and then go pound on Gracie\u2019s door and beg for help.</p><p>Which meant it was someone else. Which left her back where she\u2019d started, wondering who and why and how and all the other question words.</p> <p>An hour later she saw the sign for Los Lobos and turned off the freeway. At the bottom of the off-ramp, she hesitated, then turned right instead of left and drove to the chichi side of town. She drove past Riley\u2019s house and carefully parked around the corner so as not to fuel the gossip mill, then walked back to his front door and braced herself. She might have to stand there pounding for a really long time before she convinced him she wasn\u2019t going away and that he had to talk to her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to make him listen,\u201d she told herself as she raised her hand to knock.</p><p>The door swung open.</p><p>The movement was so unexpected, she actually stumbled forward and nearly tripped over the threshold. Riley raised his eyebrows.</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d let me in. I was prepared to keep pounding until you did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>He looked good. No, he looked great. Jeans, a plain white shirt and Nikes. Faint stubble darkened his jaw.</p><p>She wanted to step into his embrace and have him pull her close. She wanted to tell him that she hadn\u2019t been the one, that he could trust her, that she cared about him and would never betray him. She wanted to offer proof or at least a plan to get proof. She wanted him to say it was going to be all right.</p><p>Instead she opened her mouth, closed it, then grabbed the front of his shirt with both hands and did her best to shake him.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she said as he stood there as immobile as a rock. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell anyone what we did and I certainly didn\u2019t say I thought I might be pregnant. I don\u2019t know where he got the idea. It wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><p>She still held on to his shirt. He raised his hands to cover hers. His dark eyes watched her.</p><p>\u201cI know,\u201d he said simply.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cReally? You believe me?\u201d</p><p>He nodded.</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cCan\u2019t you just accept it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. Not really. If I were you I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d believe me. Why do you?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged, which wasn\u2019t a very satisfying answer, but it seemed to be all she was going to get.</p><p>He loosened her hands from his shirt and stepped back. \u201cI\u2019m going for a walk on the beach. Want to come?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>IT WAS CLOSE to sunset when they arrived. Riley parked his Mercedes in one of the public lots, then took Gracie\u2019s hand as they crossed to the sand. She\u2019d kicked off her shoes. Without the heels, she barely came up to his shoulder. Her hair hung loose, her shirt was untucked. She should have been a mess, but he found her sexy as hell.</p><p>Was that why he\u2019d told her he believed her? Because he wanted to sleep with her? He supposed it was as good a reason as any, because there wasn\u2019t any logic in the entire situation.</p><p>He didn\u2019t want her to be the guilty party. It was as simple as that. If it turned out he was a fool to trust her, it could cost him ninety-seven million dollars and the revenge he\u2019d been after.</p><p>Later he would listen to his head, he told himself. Later he would come up with plans that would help him recover from what had happened at the debate. Later he would tell Gracie to get lost and forget her. But not right now.</p><p>\u201cI used to come here a lot when I was a kid,\u201d Riley said. \u201cAs soon as I got my driver\u2019s license, it became one of my favorite places. I would walk along the beach and try to make sense of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think that was possible for a teenager.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least you made the effort. My way to try to make sense was to write really bad poetry. I mean seriously bad. Trees should come after me seeking revenge for their death so that I could have the paper to write my bad poetry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrees aren\u2019t much into organizing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cColor me happy.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him as she spoke. A hint of a smile caused her blue eyes to crinkle at the corners. He nearly pulled her close and kissed her, but the smile faded and she sighed.</p><p>\u201cHow did he know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe mayor?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>\u201cHe had us followed. Or maybe just me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that what your detective told you?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s been on the job all of a day. I doubt he knows anything yet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Good point.\u201d She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. \u201cThe guy the mayor or whoever hired did a much better job following us than we did following Zeke. Maybe we should have hired him.\u201d</p><p>Despite everything, he chuckled. \u201cI like your logic.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo the guy was just there to take pictures, but somehow he figures out what we\u2019re up to and tells the mayor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr Yardley takes a wild stab in the dark and gets lucky.\u201d</p><p>She squeezed his hand, then stepped in front of him.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do it, Riley. I swear.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie, you don\u2019t have to keep telling me that. I believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hope so. It\u2019s just it looks so bad. I\u2019m the only one who knows we made love and I\u2019m the only one who knows that we didn\u2019t use anything and that there\u2019s a teeny, tiny chance I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not the only one,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. Because you\u2019re the one telling the mayor.\u201d She squeezed his hand tighter. \u201cI mean it. I need you to believe me. It\u2019s desperately important. I don\u2019t lie. I can be a little anal about getting my cakes exactly right and I don\u2019t have as much patience with my family as I probably should and I never get my checkbook to balance to the penny. I figure, hey if it\u2019s within five dollars, fine. But I don\u2019t lie and I would never set you up. I\u2019m not afraid of the truth. Remember? I\u2019m the girl who put a skunk in your car. I tend to do things out in the open so the world can see.\u201d</p><p>The sun had slipped below the horizon. As the light faded, her skin took on a luminescence, as if she glowed from within. At that moment, staring into her beautiful face, he would have believed anything. Not so much because he wanted her\u2014although he did\u2014but because she was there.</p><p>For the first time in as long as he could remember, someone was there for him. Someone who was interested in him, his day, his opinions, his feelings. Guy friends were never that involved and he didn\u2019t let women get close.</p><p>He believed Gracie because he didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>He reached for her free hand and laced his fingers with hers, then he pulled her close, so they touched from shoulder to thigh.</p><p>\u201cHow did we get here?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cThe highway and then Beach Drive.\u201d</p><p>He grinned, then he chuckled, then he started to laugh. She wiggled her shoulders.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve always had an excellent sense of humor,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cYes, you do.\u201d</p><p>He bent down and kissed her nose. Her mouth beckoned, but as much as he wanted to be in her bed, he wasn\u2019t willing to give this up. Not yet.</p><p>He released her left hand and tugged her along so they were walking again.</p><p>\u201cAny other directional questions I can answer?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cNot right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou could get a GPS system.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I could.\u201d</p><p>She drew in a deep breath. \u201cI love the smell of the ocean. Where my aunt and uncle lived in Torrance, we were about five miles from the beach, so we could go there a lot. I\u2019ve always lived close to the water. I\u2019m not sure I could live anywhere else. How do people survive in the mountains or the desert?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s what they know. I didn\u2019t see the ocean until we moved here when I was nearly sixteen.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him. \u201cWhere did you grow up?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTempe, then finally here.\u201d He remembered the trailer he and his mom had lived in. \u201cI never asked her why we stayed so long after my dad left. Maybe she was waiting for him to come back.\u201d His mother had always been a dreamer. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cSix years is a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cToo long. Then we moved here. She told me things would be better because her brother was here. Until then I hadn\u2019t known I\u2019d had an uncle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat happened when you met him?\u201d Gracie asked.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t. She left me at the motel and went to see him herself. When she came back, I knew that she\u2019d been crying, but she wouldn\u2019t admit it. She wouldn\u2019t say anything except she was going to find us a nice little house where we could be happy.\u201d</p><p>He led Gracie toward a cluster of rocks and sat down next to them. She settled beside him. He reached for her hand again.</p><p>\u201cI put the pieces together over time,\u201d he said, not wanting to remember, but lost in the past all the same. \u201cHer brother told her that she\u2019d turned her back on the family when she\u2019d run off to be with my father. As far as he was concerned, she didn\u2019t exist. Neither did I.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shifted closer so she could snuggle up against him. \u201cI\u2019m sorry your uncle was just a big old poop head.\u201d</p><p>Despite the ghosts and the ache of the past, Riley smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been calling him a heartless bastard all these years, but I kind of like poop head.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s true. How could he ignore his own family?\u201d</p><p>Riley leaned back against the rocks and put his free arm around her. \u201cEasily enough. I never did meet him. When I got in trouble around town, he\u2019d send me a letter, reprimanding me for whatever I\u2019d done.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were never that bad.\u201d</p><p>He glanced down at her. \u201cI was wild.\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cI know. It was one of your best qualities. Your bad-boy ways made my little teenage heart beat so fast. You were dangerous and sexy.\u201d She gave him a teasing grin. \u201cDid you know I had a crush on you?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cGee, really? You were so subtle about it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d She sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Subtle gal. Did he come to the wedding?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. My mom probably sent him an invitation, but I didn\u2019t care if he showed up or not. I\u2019m sure Pam was hoping for a great gift, but he didn\u2019t bother with that, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know Pam\u2019s being really nice and all,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard for me to feel sorry for her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, either. I didn\u2019t want to marry her. Did you know that?\u201d</p><p>She stared at him, her eyes wide. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. I thought you were wildly in love with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLust,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference. At eighteen, I liked having her as a steady girlfriend, because she put out. When she told me she was pregnant, I was furious. She\u2019d sworn she was on the Pill and I believed her.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shifted on the sand. \u201cI never said I was.\u201d</p><p>He brushed his mouth against her hair. \u201cNot the same thing. I told you, I don\u2019t blame you for that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand free and pressed it against her mouth. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut\u2014\u201d He pressed a little harder. \u201cWhat aren\u2019t you getting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>He appreciated her worrying, but as far as he was concerned, the fault was his. He\u2019d been the one so damned intent on having her, he\u2019d forgotten to make sure they were both protected. He hadn\u2019t gotten successful by being stupid.</p><p>\u201cWhat were we talking about?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cYou not wanting to marry Pam because you were secretly in love with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to marry Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take that if it\u2019s all I can get,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd remind you\u2014again\u2014that I warned you about her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, you did, but I didn\u2019t listen. Not that it would have mattered. My mother insisted. She said I had a responsibility.\u201d He grimaced as he remembered the fights he\u2019d had with her. \u201cShe wanted me to be respectable and do the right thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just wanted out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. I\u2019m not saying my mom was wrong. But at eighteen, I didn\u2019t see it. I married Pam, stayed around long enough to find out she wasn\u2019t pregnant, then took off. But first I told my mom she\u2019d ruined my life and I would never forgive her.\u201d</p><p>He stared out at the dark ocean. The moon hadn\u2019t risen and he could barely see the white foam swirling along the beach.</p><p>\u201cIt was the last time we ever spoke,\u201d he said slowly.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gracie pushed away and stared at him. \u201cYou mean because you left?\u201d</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI was angry. I took off and headed north. Eventually I ended up on those oil rigs in the South China Sea. I grew up a little and got some perspective. So I sent her a letter and a check. She wrote me back, asked me to come see her sometime. I said I would. But I never made the time.\u201d</p><p>He hadn\u2019t thought it was important and he\u2019d still been angry.</p><p>\u201cFinally she wrote me and told me she was sick. Cancer. So I made arrangements to come back. But she didn\u2019t say it was urgent and I didn\u2019t drop everything. A week before I was supposed to leave, I got a call from a nurse in the county hospital telling me my mother had less than forty-eight hours to live. It took me fifty hours to get back. She was already dead.\u201d</p><p>Gracie tightened her hold on him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. It\u2019s long over. Technically Yardley was right today. I never did come back to see my mother while she lay dying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that a good excuse?\u201d he asked, still staring at the ocean. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. She was alone. That\u2019s the worst of it. She died in the county hospital by herself. Her selfish son couldn\u2019t be bothered to get his ass back in a timely fashion. And her own brother, who lived right in town, didn\u2019t bother going to see her.\u201d</p><p>Gracie rose to her knees and stared at him. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDonovan Whitefield kept his word. He never forgave his sister.\u201d Riley looked at Gracie. \u201cI found her letters later. The ones he\u2019d returned without ever opening them. She begged him for money to pay for treatment. What I sent her wasn\u2019t nearly enough and she knew that back then I couldn\u2019t have afforded medical treatments. So she asked him, and he didn\u2019t even bother to read them.\u201d</p><p>She made a noise low in her throat then threw herself at him.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, pressing against him and shaking.</p><p>He stiffened, not sure what to do with her sympathy, then he wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d She raised her head and looked at him. He thought he saw tears on her cheeks, but he wasn\u2019t sure. \u201cNone of it is okay. You\u2019re carrying around all this guilt, but it\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t make your mother sick and you didn\u2019t know you had to come back.\u201d</p><p>So Gracie wanted to make it all right for him. Didn\u2019t she know that wasn\u2019t possible?</p><p>\u201cI did after she told me,\u201d he said flatly.</p><p>\u201cBut she could have made it more clear. You\u2019re not psychic. Okay, yes, you\u2019re guilty of not hurrying, but that\u2019s all. The rest of it.... How could your uncle have done that? How could he have turned his back on her? I might not like Alexis and Vivian very much right now, but I would never turn them away. Especially with something like that.\u201d</p><p>Riley doubted Gracie would turn away a rabid dog if it needed help.</p><p>\u201cYou need to understand I\u2019m long past saving,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with the past.\u201d Although \u201cpeace\u201d might be the wrong word. He\u2019d accepted what had happened and decided how he was going to make it right.</p><p>She cupped his face in her hands. \u201cYou haven\u2019t found peace. You\u2019re still angry.\u201d</p><p>He liked that she could read him so well. \u201cI\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>Gracie wasn\u2019t sure that was possible. How was Riley supposed to accept all that had happened and move on? She could feel the pain inside of him. It radiated from him and made her ache inside. She wanted to surround him and hold him until he began to heal.</p><p>She wanted to return to the past and prevent it all from happening.</p><p>He was good and strong and decent. He didn\u2019t deserve all this.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered, still cupping his face. \u201cI hate that Mayor Yardley took a very personal, painful piece of your past and used it to make himself look better. It\u2019s slimy and horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs he a big old poop head, too?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s on the poop head management team.\u201d She wiped her tears. \u201cHow could he do that? It\u2019s so horrible. And now people are going to think badly of you. It\u2019s not right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll survive,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat you need is to win the election. Can I do anything to help?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let you know if we come up with a plan that includes you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t mind knocking on doors and telling people I\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>One corner of his mouth turned up. \u201cThat would get their attention. Why don\u2019t we wait until we\u2019re sure you\u2019re not pregnant before heading in that direction.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. Right. Good point.\u201d She slumped down next to him. She didn\u2019t want to think about a baby right now. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle one more thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean between your sister who\u2019s getting married, the one freaking out about her husband, the cakes you have to bake, Pam, the mayor telling everyone we\u2019ve had sex and the fact that you might be pregnant?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She groaned. \u201cGee, when you put it like that, I barely have anything going on anymore. Is your list better or worse?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s different. My father showed up today.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t think there was anything else that could shock her, but she was wrong.</p><p>\u201cYour father? Here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt the bank,\u201d he said as he slid his hand into her hair and finger combed it to the ends. \u201cIt\u2019s been twenty-two years and I still recognized him. I guess that says something.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t know what to think. \u201cHe wanted to see you?\u201d</p><p>Riley gave a laugh that had nothing to do with humor. \u201cNo. He wanted money. There was no \u2018Hey, son, how\u2019s it going.\u2019 He just asked me to write him a check because he\u2019s running a little short this month.\u201d</p><p>She felt as if someone had drop-kicked her heart. Riley spoke as if it didn\u2019t matter, but she knew the pain of being abandoned by a parent. Maybe her situation was a little different, but the loss was very similar.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cIt happened. I threw him out but he\u2019ll be back. Hell, I\u2019ll probably give him the money just to get rid of him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she repeated and wrapped her arms around him. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make this all better.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I still want to fix it. Make things better.\u201d She reached up and touched his face. \u201cCome home with me.\u201d</p><p>Nothing about his expression changed. \u201cThat\u2019s a short-term solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the best I have right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not complaining.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</p><p>GRACIE WONDERED if she would fight second thoughts on the drive back to his house. The night was dark, the car silent. Their only communication came from his hand holding hers, his thumb brushing against the back of her hand.</p><p>Her body was an odd combination of tension and relaxation. While the thought of them making love again had her quivering from the inside out, she also felt completely calm. As if this decision had been made a millennia ago and she was simply fulfilling her destiny. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cWant to stay at my place?\u201d he asked quietly as they got close to the large mansion. \u201cYou could pull your car into the garage.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds good,\u201d she said.</p><p>He drove into the driveway and hit the remote control button. As the large double garage door opened, she slid out and walked around the corner to her car.</p> <p>Five minutes later, she\u2019d parked next to him and followed him into the massive kitchen. As it had before, the sight of the large, open space made her cake-baker heart beat faster.</p><p>\u201cKitchen envy,\u201d she said with a sigh. \u201cI need a twelve-step program to recover.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan we take care of that later?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>He crossed to the refrigerator. \u201cHungry?\u201d</p> <p>She followed him and tried to peer over his shoulder. \u201cYou have food?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have take-out leftovers.\u201d He grabbed a chilling bottle of champagne, then stepped back. \u201cSee anything you like?\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t seem to take her eyes off the champagne long enough to make a menu selection.</p><p>\u201cDid you just happen to have that chilling in anticipation of the three F\u2019s or....\u201d</p><p>He coiled his free hand in her hair, tugged her head back, then pressed his lips against hers. The kiss was hot, quick and full of promise.</p><p>\u201cI bought it yesterday.\u201d</p> <p>Passion flooded her brain, making it difficult to concentrate. \u201cYou mean after we....\u201d</p><p>His dark gaze locked with hers. \u201cAfter we made love. Yes. This isn\u2019t generic, I-hope-I-get-lucky champagne. I bought it for you, Gracie.\u201d</p><p>Her bare toes curled. She didn\u2019t remember a man buying champagne for her before. Certainly not\u2014she glanced at the label\u2014Dom Perignon.</p><p>She closed the refrigerator door with a bump of her hip. \u201cI\u2019m not very hungry. For food.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He walked to a cabinet and removed two champagne glasses, then jerked his head toward the hallway.</p><p>\u201cShall we?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p> <p>She followed him to the wide, curving staircase. On her last visit to his house, the tour hadn\u2019t gotten this far. She noted several portraits on the walls. Previous generations of Whitefields, she wondered. But she didn\u2019t want to spoil the mood by asking.</p><p>The staircase continued up to a third floor, but Riley stopped on the second and made a left turn. They passed four or five other rooms before he pushed open the door of one and stepped inside.</p><p>Gracie wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. She didn\u2019t know if Riley wanted to sleep in his grandfather\u2019s bed to prove that he could or if he would choose another space. As she glanced around she saw that he\u2019d apparently picked a more neutral space\u2014what looked like a simply furnished guest room with a large bed, two nightstands and a dresser. The light from the hall spilled onto a pale carpet. The walls looked either blue or green\u2014she couldn\u2019t tell.</p><p>Riley set the champagne on the dresser and unwrapped the foil. Seconds later, he popped the cork and poured them each a glass.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never had champagne this fancy,\u201d she said as she took the slender flute he offered and then sipped.</p><p>The bubbles bounced off her tongue\u2014the flavor was light, delicious, almost sweet and addictive.</p><p>\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked when she\u2019d swallowed.</p><p>\u201cVery much. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not going to fit in my budget.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSave it for special occasions,\u201d he said as he took a sip, then set his glass on the dresser and moved close.</p><p>She started to say there was no point\u2014that for the rest of her life whenever she saw the distinctive shape of a bottle of Dom Perignon, she would always think of him. Instead she moved over so she could put her glass on the nightstand, then watched as he stepped close and took her in his arms.</p><p>The first time they\u2019d made love, there had been a frantic quality about the joining. She\u2019d wanted with a desperation that hadn\u2019t allowed her to do much more than feel. This time she was able to think as well as experience and she tried to pay attention to every detail so she could relive it later.</p><p>She noticed that even as he claimed her mouth in a soft, teasing kiss that promised so much more, he placed one hand on her hip and the other on the back of her neck. He kept the hand on her hip still while he moved the other through her hair. He\u2019d done that before, she thought hazily as he bit down on her lower lip and made her want to squirm against him. He seemed to love touching her hair. He often\u2014</p><p>His tongue touched where he\u2019d nipped her and she parted instantly. As he swept inside, her stomach muscles clenched and her breasts began to ache. She rested her hands on his shoulders, enjoying the heat and strength of him.</p><p>He explored her mouth, touching, circling, enticing. When he retreated, she followed, wanting to know every part of him. He tasted of champagne, he smelled of ocean and night and desire.</p><p>When he shifted his mouth so that he could kiss her jaw, she leaned her head in the opposite direction to give him more room. He nibbled his way down her neck. Her skin puckered, her breasts swelled even as she felt her nipples get hard and sensitive. She wanted to rip off her clothes and have him take her right there. She wanted him to go slowly, so the moment never ended.</p><p>Indecision filled her as she clung to him. He sucked on her earlobe, licked the skin on her neck and then made a slow but steady beeline for her breasts.</p><p>Without thinking, she dropped her hands from his shoulders so she could unfasten her shirt and let it drop off her shoulders. He bent over her, moving closer and closer, making her work frantically at the hooks on her bra. The last one caught and she nearly broke it in her haste to bare herself before him.</p><p>At last the hook gave and she jerked the bra down and tossed it on the floor. But instead of touching her there, he straightened.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d he said as he stared into her eyes. \u201cYou make me want things.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>Although she wasn\u2019t all that interested in talking about them right now. If they were naked things, then doing would be much better than talking.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t seem to read her mind. Instead of reaching for her, he picked up his glass of champagne and took a long sip. Then he set the glass down, bent toward her and took her nipple in his mouth.</p><p>The combination of his heat, the cool champagne and the bubbles was a sensation she\u2019d never experienced before. She grabbed for his shoulders to keep herself from falling. When his tongue swirled around, moving the bubbles over her sensitized skin, she gasped with pleasure.</p><p>He swallowed, then straightened and reached for his glass. \u201cI need to take care of the other breast,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be fair.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bet,\u201d she told him, already weak with anticipation.</p><p>He filled his mouth with the champagne, then caressed her with a tingling, exciting, bubbly caress. She wrapped both arms around his head in a silent plea that he never stop.</p><p>When he\u2019d swallowed again, he licked her, then sucked until she felt her bones melt and her body turn to liquid.</p><p>He straightened and pulled her close, then kissed her mouth. She couldn\u2019t get enough of him. She couldn\u2019t be near enough, touching enough, feeling enough. There were so many sensations, so many promises between them. She wanted the chance to fulfill each other.</p><p>When he reached for the button on her jeans, she reached for his shirt. They managed to unfasten each other, then he shrugged out of his shirt and she stepped out of her jeans. She pulled down her panties while he took care of the rest of his clothes. Then they were both naked and heading for the bed.</p><p>He kissed her everywhere. As she lay on her back, he kissed and licked and nibbled his way from her ears to her toes. Sometimes he sipped champagne first and she experienced the erotic combination of hot, cold, smooth and bubbly kisses.</p><p>On the return trip, he nibbled her ankle before licking his way up to her knees. He bit down and made her giggle, he sucked and made her squirm. Then he moved higher, to her thigh.</p><p>His large hands kneaded her muscles, his thumbs sweeping closer and closer to the heat radiating from between her legs. He watched her as he touched her, his dark eyes bright with desire, his mouth curved up in a smile.</p><p>She let her gaze sweep over him, the broadness of his shoulders, the breadth of his chest, the dark hair swirling down his flat belly. He was hard and ready and she ached to have him inside of her...right up until he bent down and she felt his breath on her. She moved her legs farther apart and closed her eyes in anticipation. Then she felt it\u2014the soft brush of his mouth and the long, slow lick of his tongue.</p><p>As he moved against her, he slipped a single finger inside of her and gently pushed it in and out.</p><p>The combination of sensations made her gasp for breath. She\u2019d been prepared to like what he did but not to fall so hard and so fast. She could barely breathe. Her muscles tensed and she dug her heels into the bed. Good manners insisted that she wait at least a couple of minutes before losing herself in her orgasm, but she wasn\u2019t sure she could hold on that long.</p><p>He felt too good. When he stroked her, he seemed to know exactly the right speed. That relentless finger continued to move in and out, teasing, pushing, promising bigger and better things to come.</p><p>He circled her most sensitive spot, then caressed it with the flat part of his tongue. He blew on her and made her shiver. He covered her with his lips and gently sucked until she knew her release was as inevitable as the tide they\u2019d watched earlier.</p><p>He began to move a little faster. The finger, his tongue. Pressure built and built until she had no choice but to give way. She clutched at the sheets, raised her chin to the ceiling and gasped out her release.</p><p>The waves came one on top of the other. He continued to stroke her, to move in and out and she found herself carried along as the pleasure stretched out endlessly.</p><p>At last the need slowly died away. He drew back and kissed her thigh, then pushed up to his knees. She opened her eyes and smiled at him.</p><p>\u201cI have another F,\u201d she said lazily. \u201cFabulous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like that F.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She patted the mattress and waited until he stretched out next to her before standing and walking to get the bottle of champagne from the dresser.</p><p>Riley gave himself over to enjoying the show. From the back Gracie was all swaying hips and graceful curves. From the front\u2014he swore silently\u2014she was a goddess.</p><p>Her long blond hair covered enough of her breasts to make him want to see more. Her narrow waist only emphasized the swell of her hips. He liked the fullness of her thighs, the length of her legs and that secret place between them that gave her all the power.</p><p>When she returned to the bed, she waved the bottle. \u201cMind if I ignore the glass?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHelp yourself.\u201d</p><p>She knelt beside him and took a sip of champagne. He had to admit that a beautiful naked woman kneeling next to him, drinking out of the bottle just before they got to the next round was going on his top ten list of erotic moments.</p><p>After setting the bottle on the nightstand, she bent down and pressed her mouth against his belly. He groaned as he felt her warm mouth followed by the cool, bubbly sensation of the champagne. Her tongue swirled against his skin.</p><p>\u201cI like this,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the bottle and took another small sip. This time she moved lower and he braced himself for what was to come.</p><p>But all the preparation in the world couldn\u2019t stop his body from reacting as she knelt between his parted legs, reached down to hold him still and then took him in her mouth.</p><p>He forgot to breathe through the sheer pleasure of her lips and tongue caressing him even as the cool champagne tickled and aroused and her long hair brushed his belly and thighs. She swirled her tongue around, then licked the very tip of him.</p><p>He swore out loud, grabbed for control and had a feeling his grip could slip at any second. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cGracie, you can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>She raised her mouth, swallowed the champagne, then tilted her head. \u201cTechnically, I can.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay, yeah. I\u2019m begging you not to.\u201d</p> <p>She gave a heavy sigh. \u201cOh, all right. What would you prefer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe inside of you.\u201d</p><p>Her blue eyes widened slightly as she smiled. \u201cI guess. If you insist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>He reached for the nightstand and pulled open the top drawer. \u201cWant to stay in control or want me to take you?\u201d</p> <p>She laughed. \u201cI think I\u2019d like to be taken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cConsider it done.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed a condom and quickly slipped it on. When she stretched out next to him, he turned toward her and gathered her in his arms.</p><p>They kissed. She tasted faintly of champagne and mostly of herself. He claimed her, even as he stroked his hands all over her body.</p><p>She was sensitive, squirming as he brushed his fingers across her tight nipples. She was wet, moaning as he slipped his fingers between her thighs. She parted instantly and even though he\u2019d thought to make it last longer, he couldn\u2019t help shifting so that he could kneel between her legs and push his way home.</p><p>As he plunged inside of her, she tightened around him. Her arms drew him closer. He drove in as deeply as he could, losing himself in the slick heat. He withdrew, then pushed inside again. This time he felt a quickening to the tightness, a tension in her muscles.</p> <p>He braced himself, then bent down and kissed her mouth even as he began the steady rhythmic thrusting designed to take them both over the edge. She wrapped her legs around his hips and held him in place. Her hands grabbed for his butt and pulled him in deeper.</p><p>Faster and faster, pushing, reaching, needing, plunging until he felt her shatter beneath him. She broke the kiss and gasped for air, then screamed his name. As the contractions pulsed through her, he let go, shuddering as his climax claimed him and her body milked every drop of pleasure from him.</p><p>LATER, when they were both lying curled up together under the covers, he buried his fingers in her hair and kissed her forehead.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s late,\u201d he said. \u201cWant to sleep here?\u201d</p><p>She stirred, lifting her hair from his shoulder and blinking sleepily. \u201cYou don\u2019t strike me as the sleepover type.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making an exception.\u201d</p><p>She put her head back and closed her eyes. \u201cThat would be nice. But get me up early so I can head out before your neighbors wake up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI thought you hated morning.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI do, but I don\u2019t want to make things worse for you.\u201d</p><p>He rubbed his other hand along her bare back. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to get up early for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>She spoke slowly, as if barely able to stay awake. He squeezed her.</p><p>\u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d</p><p>Her breathing slowed.</p><p>Riley reached up and turned off the light, then pulled the covers around them both. He stared up at the dark ceiling.</p><p>She\u2019d been right. He wasn\u2019t a sleepover kind of guy. Considering all that was happening right now, including the fact that Gracie might be pregnant, he should be running for the hills. Funny how he didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>He wanted to stay right where he was\u2014with her.</p><p>He continued to stroke her back, then moved higher to play with the ends of her hair. Had he ever spent the night with a woman before? Had he ever let one stay with him? He frowned as he tried to remember, then decided it hadn\u2019t happened since his brief marriage to Pam.</p><p>Why now? Why Gracie? He didn\u2019t have any answers. Or maybe he didn\u2019t want to find them.</p><p>GRACIE WOKE UP as she usually did, slowly and with a great appreciation for having slept well. She stretched, rolled over and found herself in an unfamiliar bed.</p><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be good,\u201d she said as she raised herself into a sitting position and pushed her hair out of her face. She spotted a note on the pillow next to hers and as she reached for it, memories flooded back.</p><p>\u201cMy mistake. It was better than good,\u201d she said with a smile. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d</p><p>Riley sure knew how to make a woman\u2019s toes curl, she thought as she flopped back on the mattress and read the note.</p><p>\u201cI had an early meeting and didn\u2019t want to wake you. There\u2019s coffee downstairs. Help yourself. Last night was great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>She rubbed her thumb across the plain white paper, as if by touching it she could touch the man himself.</p><p>But there was no warm skin, no sexy scent, nothing but the memory of what they\u2019d done together and it was a poor substitute for the real thing.</p><p>She rolled on her side and faced the spot where he\u2019d slept. \u201cNow what?\u201d she asked aloud as she ran her fingers across the mussed sheets. Where did they go from here and what did they do when they got there? Who was this man who knew how to touch her heart and her soul?</p><p>Her stomach clenched. For once the tension had nothing to do with acid or even the thought she might be pregnant. Instead, it was all about her growing feelings for Riley.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can\u2019t fall for him.\u201d</p><p>He was her past. He was the root of every humiliation she\u2019d suffered for years. To get involved with him now would be....</p><p>She closed her eyes and heard her mother\u2019s voice telling her how everyone was laughing at her. She was the butt of jokes. Gracie winced at the thought. She wasn\u2019t willing to go through that again. Not when\u2014</p><p>\u201cWait a minute.\u201d She sat up and stared at the opposite wall. \u201cThis is my life. Not my mother\u2019s. Not anyone else\u2019s. Mine. I decide.\u201d</p><p>Okay. That sounded very self-actualized. Now what? If she wasn\u2019t going to live to please faceless strangers or her mother, what was she going to do?</p><p>\u201cSee it through,\u201d she said firmly. She had no idea what was happening with Riley, what she felt for him or what he felt for her, but she would see it through. If there was something there, she wanted to know. If this was just some twisted trip down memory lane, then she had to know that as well. One way or another, she would figure it all out. Even if she found herself brokenhearted at the end, it beat spending the rest of her life always wondering.</p><p>FIFTY-FIVE MINUTES later a freshly showered and dressed Gracie left her house with the intent of stopping by Jill\u2019s office. As of last count there had been eight messages from her friend. She wanted to reassure Jill that she was fine and maybe tell her a little of what had been happening. Since the mayor had announced the details of her private life to the whole town it seemed silly to try to keep secrets from her best friend.</p><p>As she turned at the stop sign, she noticed how close she was to her mom\u2019s house. Maybe she should swing by there and get her daily dose of stern talking-to. After that, she would tell her mother that while she loved her and appreciated her advice, she had to make her own choices. Right now she wanted to pursue things with Riley. Maybe it was a mistake, but the mistake was hers to make. If her family couldn\u2019t support that, she would do her best to understand.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds really powerful,\u201d she told herself as she pulled in front of the familiar two-story house. She had a feeling that actual rejection by her family would be pretty painful. It didn\u2019t seem to matter how badly they treated her, she kept coming back for more.</p><p>As she walked up toward the front door, she noticed Vivian\u2019s car parked in the driveway. Oh, joy, Gracie thought. A two for one.</p><p>She raised her hand to knock, then saw the door was partially ajar. She pushed it open as she called out, \u201cHi. It\u2019s me.\u201d</p><p>Silence followed her announcement.</p><p>\u201cMom? Vivian?\u201d</p><p>She heard a sound from the back of the house and headed in that direction. As she entered the long hallway, she could hear voices.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this,\u201d her mother said, sounding more than a little angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so upset,\u201d Vivian grumbled.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m upset because this wedding is costing thousands and thousands of dollars.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stopped in the middle of the hall. She wasn\u2019t sure if she should announce herself again or simply leave.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m helping with my wedding dress,\u201d Vivian said.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over three thousand dollars. To date your contribution is all of two hundred. Honey, I want you to be happy and have the wedding of your dreams, but you can\u2019t keep canceling it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. It\u2019s just Tom was really mean last night. I don\u2019t think I can be with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFine. If you want to cancel the wedding today, we will. But know that it\u2019s over. I\u2019m not doing this anymore. As it is, I\u2019ll be out nearly five thousand dollars, and that\u2019s just for deposits. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. I\u2019ve taken out a mortgage on the house to pay for this. I can put the rest of the money back, but where am I supposed to get the five thousand dollars I\u2019ve just lost? I didn\u2019t mind when it was for your wedding, but I won\u2019t just waste the money because you can\u2019t make up your mind.\u201d</p><p>Gracie took a step back. She didn\u2019t want to hear any of this.</p><p>Why on earth would her mother take out a home loan to pay for a wedding? That sounded crazy, especially with Vivian not being sure about what she wanted. Between the expensive wedding gown, the country club location and the formal dinner, Gracie would bet the total bill would be well over twenty-five thousand dollars. You could practically put a kid through college for that.</p><p>\u201cMom, no!\u201d Vivian began to cry. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I know I\u2019m making this hard. I don\u2019t want you to have to lose money and I know the wedding is too expensive. I\u2019ll work harder. I will. And I\u2019ll go talk to Tom. We\u2019ll work it out. Don\u2019t cancel the wedding. Please?\u201d</p><p>Her mother sighed. \u201cAll right. But no more games. There\u2019s too much at stake.\u201d</p><p>Gracie turned and quietly walked out of the house. She didn\u2019t want to intrude on a private moment between mother and daughter and she didn\u2019t agree with what they were doing.</p><p>While she understood her mother\u2019s reluctance to give up the deposit money for a wedding that wasn\u2019t happening, she didn\u2019t agree with getting married just to have a wedding. Vivian and Tom seemed to break up every fifteen minutes. That didn\u2019t bode well for their future together.</p><p>\u201cNot my rock to carry,\u201d Gracie muttered to herself as she got in her car and drove toward Jill\u2019s. But even as she tried to put the conversation behind her, she felt sad for the sense of being an outsider. The closeness she\u2019d once felt with her mother and her sisters was gone forever, which meant she was well and truly on her own.</p><p>RILEY FOUND himself enjoying his day at the bank. After his night with Gracie he could easily ignore the stares and whispers of his employees. Let \u2019em talk\u2014he knew the truth and in the end, he would win this battle.</p><p>Not that Zeke agreed.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d his campaign manager said as he paced in his office. \u201cI\u2019ll have new numbers by this afternoon, but they\u2019re not going to be good.\u201d Zeke stopped in front of his desk and stared at him. \u201cEveryone loved you for romancing Gracie and they\u2019ll hate you just as much for treating her badly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt sure sounds like it.\u201d</p><p>Thanks to Yardley. Riley leaned back in his chair. \u201cMy personal life....\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Zeke glared at him. \u201cDammit, Riley, if you had to get an itch scratched couldn\u2019t you have picked some other\u2014\u201d</p><p>Riley was out of his chair before the other man finished his sentence. He reached across the desk, grabbed Zeke by the tie and twisted the fabric to tighten it around Zeke\u2019s neck.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk about her that way,\u201d Riley said in a low voice. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Zeke nodded, then pulled back. Riley let him go. Zeke swallowed, then straightened his tie.</p><p>\u201cRight. Okay. So we need new numbers.\u201d He glanced at Riley, his expression wary. \u201cAre you going to keep seeing her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGracie\u2019s terrific. My sister-in-law. I\u2019ve always liked her. But you know that Yardley\u2019s claim is going to cost you votes. Maybe a few, maybe a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight. Sure. I\u2019ll come up with a new strategy. Let me think on it for the next day or so.\u201d He took a step back from the desk.</p><p>Just then Diane knocked on the door as she pushed it open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt, but you asked me to let you know as soon as your father returned. He\u2019s here.\u201d</p> <p>Riley wasn\u2019t even a little surprised. He nodded. \u201cLet me finish up here.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYour dad. That\u2019s cool. Maybe we could use him in the campaign.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m just saying it would make you seem more approachable.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zeke opened his mouth, then closed it. \u201cAll right. I\u2019ll get back to you by end of day tomorrow. By then I\u2019ll have poll numbers and a new strategy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d</p><p>Zeke gathered his folders and ducked out of the room. Seconds later, his father entered.</p><p>\u201cMorning, son,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cHow are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat.\u201d</p><p>Riley studied the older man. Same suit, he thought. Different shirt. This one a little more worn than the one from the previous day. Riley didn\u2019t know where his father had been or what he wanted the money for. Honest to God, he didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cHow much,\u201d he said before his father could speak again. \u201cHow much do you want.\u201d</p><p>The older man smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about going into a couple of franchises. They seem to be doing well. Some of those sandwich shops really rake in the money.\u201d</p><p>He continued talking, but Riley wasn\u2019t listening. Instead, he studied the man who was his father and searched for resemblances.</p> <p>The eyes, he supposed. Maybe the dark hair. Did they share a sense of humor? A taste for good Scotch? Obviously they both had no problem walking away from women.</p><p>At ten Riley had worshipped his father. The man\u2019s disappearance had cut out his heart and it had taken years to recover. His mother never had. Oh she\u2019d been brave, living her life, smiling, laughing, but there\u2019d been a sadness underneath. As if she\u2019d risked everything she had and then she\u2019d lost it all.</p><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d Riley asked again, interrupting him.</p><p>The old man stopped talking and blinked. \u201cTwo hundred thousand?\u201d</p><p>Riley opened the top desk drawer and removed the personal checkbook he\u2019d brought in that morning. He wrote the amount without saying a word.</p><p>\u201cI appreciate this, son. Your generosity means a lot.\u201d</p><p>Riley passed him the check. \u201cNext time, don\u2019t bother coming by. Just send me a letter.\u201d</p><p>They looked at each other, then his father nodded. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you\u2019d prefer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know how I found you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right.\u201d The old man looked at the check. \u201cOh. How\u2019s your mother? Happy?\u201d</p><p>Riley wanted to punch him then. Anger swelled inside of him until it threatened to burst out in a destructive wave.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s fine. Thanks for asking.\u201d He stared pointedly at the door. \u201cI have a meeting.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. Thanks for the money.\u201d</p><p>The man who had been his father for the first ten years of his life walked out. Riley was fairly confident he would never see him again, although there would be a steady stream of letters requesting more money for more failed dreams.</p><p>When he was alone again, he pushed the button to ring Diane\u2019s phone.</p><p>\u201cYes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to donate the money to the children\u2019s wing of the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mother\u2019s name.\u201d</p><p>There was a brief pause. Riley imagined his unflappable secretary openmouthed in astonishment.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call them right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He disconnected the call, then slowly turned in his chair. He still hated his uncle, he thought as he stared at the portrait of the man. He would never give an inch on his desire for revenge. But for the first time Riley understood what it must have been like to be one man who had the money to solve everyone\u2019s problems.</p><p>GRACIE TAPPED the cooling pan twice for good luck, gave it a quick twist, then pulled it up in one, quick motion. The cake fell out perfectly.</p><p>\u201cImpressive,\u201d Pam said with a sigh. \u201cI can\u2019t even get muffins to pop out of the pan. I end up using a knife and they get all bent and scrunchy on the edges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPractice,\u201d Gracie said with pride as she stared at the bottom layer of an oval cake. \u201cPractice and a little bit of prayer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow many layers will this one be?\u201d Pam asked.</p><p>\u201cFive, which means it\u2019s huge and it\u2019s heavy.\u201d She reached for the next cake pan and tapped it.</p><p>\u201cHow do you keep the layers from sinking into each other?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDowels. I stick them into the cake to provide support.\u201d The cake pan lifted easily. She sighed. \u201cI love it when a plan comes together.\u201d</p><p>Pam leaned over the cake and inhaled. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is you put in your mix, but your cakes always smell so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Gracie knew Pam wouldn\u2019t mention taste, what with never having eaten a single bite. Gracie wasn\u2019t sure she ate ever. She was unnaturally thin, which was very annoying.</p><p>\u201cThere are hundreds of flowers,\u201d Pam said, pointing to the carefully stacked trays of fondant roses. \u201cBut they\u2019re for the cake you made and iced yesterday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah. That\u2019s what comes next. Assembly.\u201d She glanced at the clock. The groom\u2019s father would arrive to pick up the cake in six hours. Eek! \u201cI have to let the cake cool completely or the heat will mess up the icing. That\u2019s the tricky part. Everyone gets married on the weekend, which makes it tough to stagger the work. I can prepare all the decorations in advance. In any case, it\u2019s easy because the cake I\u2019m finishing today doesn\u2019t have any fancy trim or piping. I just have to put on the decorations I\u2019ve already made. I\u2019ll decorate this one tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>She carried the cooling racks over to the far counter and lifted the protective box off the three tiered cake she\u2019d frosted the previous day.</p><p>\u201cIt looks perfect,\u201d Pam said, sounding impressed. \u201cIt\u2019s so smooth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks, I\u2014\u201d</p><p>Her cell phone rang. Instantly her body went on alert. She\u2019d reached that unfortunate stage where every call was either Riley or not Riley. A quick glance at the display screen told her she didn\u2019t recognize the number.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie Landon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi. My name is Neda Jackson. I freelance for several bridal magazines and I\u2019ve just been given an assignment to do a feature on you. They want me to come up and take pictures of you working, along with several of your cakes. We\u2019ll do an interview, I\u2019ll talk to former clients, that sort of thing. They\u2019re hoping for about a six-to eight-page spread.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI...They...\u201d Gracie forced herself to breathe. Six to eight pages in a bridal magazine? \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d More than excited. Giddy. Thrilled. Willing to do the happy dance in public.</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Neda said. \u201cOur deadline\u2019s tight. How\u2019s the first part of next week?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll have two cakes in progress. Are you in L.A.?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Let me get in touch with a couple of brides and see if you can take pictures this weekend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Neda gave Gracie her number, then confirmed the time of the meeting. When they hung up, Gracie shrieked as she twirled through the kitchen.</p><p>Pam laughed. \u201cI take it that was good news.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than good. In terms of career highlights, this is a grand-slam home run.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</p><p>GRACIE WAS STILL floating later that afternoon when she returned to her house. She had more decorations to make and she seemed to do those best in a quiet place without Pam watching.</p><p>She set up her supplies in the dining room, then pulled out sketches for the next three cakes she had to make. Five minutes later she had her list of decorations required, with a few extras for breakage. It was daunting, but she was sure she was up to the task. She was going to have to be, now that she\u2019d hit the big time.</p><p>\u201cA six-page spread,\u201d she said aloud, just to hear the wonderful words herself. Talk about a good life.</p><p>While the People magazine spread had made her known to the world, a feature in a major bridal magazine put her in front of her actual clients. With this free advertising coming her way, the decision to expand had just been made for her.</p><p>She started work on the leaves. After rolling out the gum paste to an even thickness, she used a tulip petal cutter, then trimmed each flower into individual petals. Using a sharp veining tool, she drew in lines and points on the leaves, then carefully placed them on a flower form dusted with cornstarch so they would dry in a curving shape. According to her calculations, she would need about three hundred and sixty leaves for the cakes. When those were done, she would start on the flowers themselves. Good thing she enjoyed working late into the night.</p><p>She\u2019d just settled into a steady rhythm of making leaves when she heard a car outside. She stood and walked toward the front door just as someone rang the bell.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t any someone, she thought as she opened the door. It was Riley.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d he said. \u201cI was driving by and I saw your car.\u201d</p><p>She felt giddy and nervous and a little bit melty on the inside. \u201cI\u2019m glad you stopped.\u201d She stepped back to let him in. \u201cWhat brings you to the low-rent side of town?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA couple of things.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the door closed, then pulled her close and kissed her. The melty sensation spread to her entire body. She closed her eyes and let herself get lost in the kiss. This was actually turning out to be a very good day.</p><p>\u201cFeel free to stop by for that anytime,\u201d she said when he\u2019d straightened.</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI will. But that\u2019s not the only reason. I wanted to ask you out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>Her insides gave a little lurch. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally. Mac called me earlier and suggested the four of us go out to eat tonight. I thought it would be fun.\u201d</p><p>Her first thought was that she\u2019d never made it over to Jill\u2019s and that they could talk over dinner. Her second thought was....</p><p>\u201cFun? Fun?\u201d She stared at him. \u201cHave you been taken over by those aliens from Pam\u2019s place? Fun? It won\u2019t be fun. The four of us in a restaurant together? Us on a date? In public? Have you forgotten the \u2018Gracie Chronicles\u2019? Do you have any idea what people will say? The scandal? You\u2019re running for mayor and I\u2019m trying to have a normal life here. That is not going to happen if the four of us go out to dinner.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her. \u201cIs that a no?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Of course not. I\u2019m just ranting. What time should I be ready?\u201d</p><p>He narrowed his gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this on purpose, aren\u2019t you? You\u2019re trying to make me freak out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot at all.\u201d She grinned. \u201cOkay, maybe a little. But people will talk. Walk with me. I have to work. I\u2019m falling behind and that\u2019s never good.\u201d</p><p>She led the way into the dining room and motioned to the chairs around the table. \u201cHave a seat. I have to do leaves.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He settled across from her. \u201cMaking cakes is a lot of work.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTell me about it. Oh, guess what happened. You\u2019ll never guess, so I\u2019ll tell you. I got a phone call today.\u201d She told him about her upcoming interview with Neda Jackson. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. Do you know what this is going to do for my business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMake it explode.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen your calendar, Gracie. You\u2019re already stretched pretty thin. Does this mean you\u2019re ready to expand?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. If I get much more work, I\u2019m going to have to hire some help. So I guess, yes. It\u2019s just I hate to give up the control. I love doing all the cakes myself.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can only put in so many hours a day. It sounds as if you\u2019re about to have to make a big career decision.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I have to?\u201d she asked.</p> <p>\u201cNot if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. She knew he was right. She\u2019d been building her business based on word of mouth for the past five years. Things were about to get complicated. There was no way she could do more cakes\u2014not during the busy wedding season of late spring through summer. Which meant she either started saying no or she got herself a staff.</p><p>\u201cI guess I\u2019m about to expand,\u201d she said slowly.</p><p>\u201cGood for you. Where will you set up shop? Here?\u201d</p><p>She made a strangling sound in her throat. \u201cNot even for money. Los Lobos is not my idea of fun. I\u2019ll head back to L.A.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m with you on that,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least on leaving Los Lobos.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut you won\u2019t be. Once you win the election, you\u2019ll be mayor. Isn\u2019t it a four-year term?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe will says I have to win, not that I have to serve.\u201d</p><p>She dropped her veining tool onto the table. \u201cYou\u2019ll just walk away from everything? What about the bank? Will you sell it?\u201d</p><p>That would be okay, she told herself. Her mother\u2019s loan would simply transfer to the next owner. No doubt the local bank would be bought out by some big multinational concern.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d shut it down,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cOnce I own the bank, I can pretty much do what I want. I\u2019ll close the doors. That damn business was the only thing my uncle cared about. I want it to disappear, as if it never existed.\u201d</p><p>Revenge. Of course. She\u2019d forgotten that\u2019s what all this was about for him. Getting back at his uncle.</p> <p>\u201cBut if the bank closes, what happens to all the people who have money in it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey get it all back. The accounts are cleared out, the loans called, debts paid. Then nothing.\u201d</p><p>Loans called? \u201cWhat do those people do? The ones who owe the money?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet other financing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot my problem.\u201d</p><p>But it might be hers. Although she was pretty sure her mother would be able to secure another loan. The house was paid for and she\u2019d only borrowed enough for Vivian\u2019s wedding. At least Gracie hoped that was all she\u2019d borrowed.</p><p>He smiled. \u201cPam\u2019s loan on her bed-and-breakfast is through the bank. That\u2019s got to be good news for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess, but I\u2019m worried about everyone else. Riley, I know you want to get back at your uncle and I completely understand that, but what about the town? You\u2019ll be destroying it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAgain, not my problem.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been so caught up in how he made her feel, how great he\u2019d been to her, that she\u2019d forgotten there was an angry man hiding inside. He\u2019d been carrying his pain for so long, it had damaged his soul.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you can harm innocent people for revenge on one man,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of guilt to carry for no reason.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t plan to feel guilty. Besides, why do you care? You can\u2019t wait to get out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know, but I feel badly for everyone who\u2019s going to be affected by this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ll get over it.\u201d</p><p>She felt badly for him, as well. He might think he could do this and walk away without any guilt, but she had her doubts. Was his revenge going to be worth all the regrets?</p><p>\u201cAre we still on for dinner?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cOf course. Why?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much. You don\u2019t approve.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to approve or disapprove. I just hope you\u2019ve thought it all through and that what you\u2019re doing will be worth it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. At the rate things are going, I won\u2019t win the election and inherit the bank. Then the town will be safe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t give up so easily. I would say you still have a good chance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d He stood. \u201cCan you be ready by seven-fifteen? We\u2019re meeting Jill and Mac at seven-thirty at Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d She glanced at the clock. It was barely after four. She had plenty of time to work on her leaves, then dress to dazzle. If she was going to be the center of attention tonight, she wanted to give everyone something special to talk about.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll let myself out,\u201d he said and headed for the door. \u201cSee you soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBye.\u201d</p><p>She heard the front door close behind him, then sighed.</p><p>While she understood why he felt he had to shut down the bank to get his revenge, she knew in her heart it was wrong. But how could she convince him of that?</p><p>Just one more thing for her to sweat. Oh, and that her mother could have her loan called. Of course Gracie could help out with that if necessary. At least she could let that worry go.</p><p>Which left her time to deal with her possible pregnancy, why Pam was being so nice, who was following her and/or Riley and taking pictures, the election, her sister\u2019s on-again-off-again wedding, her relationship with her sisters and her mother, and what kind of cake she was going to make for the heritage society. Oh, and the fact that she and Riley were going out on a date. In public.</p><p>HOLLY SLID OFF the desk and adjusted her skirt. She bent down and kissed Franklin Yardley before straightening and walking out of his office.</p><p>Franklin leaned back in his chair. Damn, he was going to miss screwing her. Just knowing she walked around his office in those short skirts and no panties was enough to get him hard.</p><p>He\u2019d always had willing assistants, from his first year in office. They\u2019d fit the same profile\u2014young, intelligent, sexual. He\u2019d taught them everything he\u2019d known and eventually they\u2019d moved on with no hard feelings.</p><p>He would miss the variety, the youth, the willingness to do anything, anywhere. But a promise was a promise and he\u2019d vowed to give them up. The idea of sex with just one woman for the rest of his life was a little daunting, but it would be worth it.</p><p>He would also miss this office and the perks that went with it. After he won the election, he would clean up the books, close the private account he\u2019d used to skim money from the city for the past fifteen years and make sure the paper trail went up in smoke.</p><p>He would divorce Sandra, of course, leave the country and settle into his life of luxury. His private line rang and as he reached for it he thought how much he loved it when a plan came together.</p><p>\u201cYardley,\u201d he said briskly.</p><p>\u201cHey, lover. How\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>Franklin glanced at the closed door and knew Holly sat on the other side. Less than ten minutes ago, he\u2019d been screwing her brains out right here on his desk.</p><p>\u201cGreat. You?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Happy. You were magnificent at the debate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you. I have to admit I was worried about Riley gaining in the polls. I thought we might have to hire our photographer friend again, but not anymore. Riley is going to lose the election without me having to try.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s stupid enough to mess with Gracie Landon.\u201d Her voice tightened. \u201cWhat a bitch. But it\u2019s our gain. In a couple of weeks you\u2019ll be reelected and Riley Whitefield will have lost everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIncluding his uncle\u2019s ninety-seven million dollars.\u201d Franklin sighed with satisfaction. \u201cYou know we won\u2019t be getting it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d she said easily. \u201cI can accept forty million as a consolation prize. It was so sweet of Donovan Whitefield to leave the bulk of his estate to the Grand Cayman Association for the Advancement of Orphans.\u201d</p><p>Franklin nodded. \u201cHe always liked to help those less fortunate than himself. Especially his friends. He\u2019s the one who suggested the Grand Cayman Islands. The rest of the estate will go to real charities to make everything seem on the up-and-up.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cI wonder what Riley would say if he knew his uncle had set him up to fail?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s never going to know,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead he\u2019s going to lose the election and leave town with his tail between his legs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you and I will pack our bags and be gone.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d she breathed. \u201cI want to be with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, Franklin.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love you, too, baby.\u201d</p><p>BILL\u2019S MEXICAN GRILL had fabulous food, but it wasn\u2019t known for its ambiance. The restaurant was casual, bordering on tacky, which left Gracie in something of a clothing dilemma.</p><p>She wanted to look fabulous. After all, she and Riley were about to be the center of attention for the entire evening. People who saw them together would talk about it with their friends and she wanted to make sure that one of the things they said was how great she looked.</p><p>It was only fair. The last time she\u2019d generated this much talk with her crush on Riley, she\u2019d been fourteen and, as her mother\u2019s neighbor Mrs. Baxter had mentioned, unfortunate-looking. All arms and legs with a completely flat chest, hair that never looked good, no matter what she did to it, braces and acne that had defined her face. Yuck.</p><p>Time and growing up had changed all that. She might not be a beauty queen, but she had left \u201cunfortunate-looking\u201d far behind. She wanted to celebrate her curves, her glossy hair and perfectly blemish-free complexion.</p><p>She stared in the mirror, ignored the electric curlers piled on her head and considered the blue sleeveless dress she held in front of herself. While it was pretty and had a low cut front, she thought it was a bit too obvious. Sort of an \u201coh, look, I\u2019m on a date\u201d dress. But she did want to wear a dress or at least a skirt because pants just seemed too\u2014something. Wrong, maybe. Plus she\u2019d not only shaved her legs, she\u2019d fake-tanned and the color had come out really nice.</p><p>\u201cKhaki skirt?\u201d she mused aloud. \u201cKhaki skirt with my pale blue twin set?\u201d</p><p>The twin set in question was kind of fun with a little beading and appliqu\u00e9 work. She\u2019d bought it for pennies on the dollar at a consignment store up in Palos Verdes the previous fall when all the rich women were getting rid of their summer wardrobes.</p><p>She dug through her closet, searching for the skirt, then stopped when she heard someone pounding on her front door. A quick glance at her watch told her it couldn\u2019t be Riley. It was barely after six.</p><p>Gracie grabbed the skirt and tossed it on the bed, then headed for the front of the house. She pulled open the door and had to hold in a groan when she saw Vivian standing there.</p><p>Tears poured down her sister\u2019s face. She stood hunched, as if she\u2019d been battered one too many times.</p><p>Gracie\u2019s first instinct was to offer sympathy. Then she remembered this was the sister who wanted the uber expensive wedding, but refused to actually commit to getting married.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>Vivian stepped into the house and choked on a sob. \u201cIt\u2019s over. With Tom.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAgain?\u201d Gracie asked, then winced when she realized that sounded kind of unfeeling.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get it,\u201d Vivian told her through her tears. \u201cBefore, all those fights, it was me. I kept telling him the wedding was off and walking out. I j-just wanted some attention from him. He seemed to be so quiet and serious lately. But after last night, when I walked out again, he came by to s-see me this morning. He said it was over. For real. That I w-wasn\u2019t ready to be married to him or anyone.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hands and continued to sob. Gracie moved close and patted her shoulder. She knew she should probably be hugging her sister, but that didn\u2019t feel right. They weren\u2019t that close anymore.</p> <p>Vivian reached in her jeans pocket and pulled out a tissue. \u201cHe said I\u2019m too immature, that he loves me, but he\u2019s not going to see me anymore until I grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gracie said softly.</p><p>Vivian shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do. He won\u2019t talk to me. He really means it. He said every time I called off the wedding I really hurt him, but that I didn\u2019t seem to care. He said I only thought about myself in all this. That I was wrong to make Mom take out a loan to pay for our wedding. He said I was a spoiled brat and that I should be ashamed of myself.\u201d</p><p>The tears started anew. Gracie hovered next to her, not sure what she should say.</p><p>\u201cHave you talked to Mom?\u201d she asked in desperation.</p> <p>\u201cN-no.\u201d Vivian sniffed and wiped her face. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be really mad about all this. She\u2019s told her friends everything about the wedding, and how great it\u2019s going to be. If she has to go back and say it\u2019s off, she\u2019ll just die.\u201d</p><p>Gracie had a strong feeling her mother would be far more upset about the money that couldn\u2019t be refunded. \u201cI\u2019m sure her friends will understand.\u201d</p><p>Vivian looked at her. \u201cAre you kidding? They\u2019ll gloat about it. That\u2019s how they are. Their daughters\u2019 weddings didn\u2019t get canceled. Mom is going to kill me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know this all seems really horrible right now,\u201d Gracie said as she rubbed her sister\u2019s back. \u201cIt hurts and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a solution, but it will get better. Now you have some time to figure out what you really want. Is Tom the guy you want to spend your life with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course he is. That\u2019s why I wanted to marry him. I only said I was canceling the wedding to get him to pay attention to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just ask for his attention?\u201d</p> <p>Vivian rolled her eyes. \u201cOh, please. Like anyone ever does that. Have you ever even had a boyfriend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLots. And I learned a long time ago that playing games was never smart. Vivian, did you listen to what Tom said to you? He wants you to be honest with him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo guy wants that.\u201d She straightened and squared her shoulders. \u201cOkay, I can fix this. I\u2019ll just show up at his place wearing nothing. He\u2019ll have to let me in then. Once I\u2019ve got him in bed, I can convince him of everything. Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s a good plan. It will be fine.\u201d She gave Gracie a watery smile. \u201cI gotta go get ready. Thanks for listening. I\u2019ll let you know when Tom agrees to the wedding again.\u201d</p><p>She waved, then hurried out of the house. Gracie closed the door behind her and leaned against the frame. She felt as if she\u2019d just had a close encounter with an alien from a different planet. Did Vivian really think she could seduce her fianc\u00e9 back into marriage? Gracie had only met Tom a couple of times but from what she\u2019d seen, he seemed like a rational, sensible sort of man. His points about her sister were all valid. She hoped he was strong enough to force Vivian to grow up a little, but who knew. Of course if he was weak enough to be done in by a naked woman in his hallway, then he deserved what he would get.</p><p>\u201cNot my problem,\u201d she said as she turned back toward her bedroom. She caught sight of the clock in the hallway and shrieked. It was nearly six-thirty and fabulous took way more than thirty minutes.</p><p>RILEY PAUSED outside of Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill and squeezed Gracie\u2019s hand. \u201cIf you keep breathing that fast, you\u2019re going to hyperventilate. We don\u2019t have to do this. We can leave now and I\u2019ll call Mac from the car and tell him we\u2019re having take-out at my place.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shook her head. Her normally straight blond hair moved in a cascade of curls that had him itching to touch. Makeup emphasized her wide eyes and full mouth. She was gorgeous.</p><p>The clothes were just as good. A short skirt emphasized her long, tanned legs. A kind of sweater thing hugged breasts he knew to be soft, erotic and luscious. She was a poster girl for sexual desire and he wanted to subscribe to get the autographed set.</p> <p>\u201cI can do this,\u201d she said, her voice low and determined.</p><p>He\u2019d been so busy thinking about how much he wanted her, it took him a second to catch up. \u201cDinner?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. I\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m completely okay with this. I have nerves of steel. I\u2019m invincible.\u201d She glanced at him. \u201cDo I look okay?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, then lightly kissed her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful. I\u2019ve been impressed for a long time, but now I\u2019m in awe.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow. Awe works.\u201d She leaned close. \u201cWhatever happens, promise you won\u2019t leave my side?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy word of honor. Ready?\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pushed open the door to the restaurant.</p><p>Inside the combination of voices and mariachi music from the bar assaulted them. He knew the restaurant would be quieter in the back, where Mac had booked their table. Riley gave his name to the hostess standing in front.</p><p>\u201cThe rest of your party is here,\u201d the teenager said with a smile. \u201cIf you\u2019ll follow me.\u201d</p><p>She wove her way through dozens of tables. Gracie gripped his hand hard enough to snap bone.</p><p>\u201cPeople are staring,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI can feel it. Oh, God, this was a really, really bad idea. It\u2019s because we\u2019re together. How could we do this?\u201d</p><p>He pulled his hand free and wrapped an arm around her waist. \u201cYou\u2019re fine. If anyone is staring it\u2019s because you look like a goddess. Every guy in the place wants you.\u201d</p><p>That made her laugh. \u201cOh, please. On what planet?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. If I\u2019d known how great you were going to turn out, I might have paid attention to you all those years ago.\u201d</p><p>She snorted. \u201cI was fourteen. I could have been a goddess and you still would have ignored me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe age difference seemed bigger back then,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPlus the whole go-to-prison thing. You were jailbait.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not anymore.\u201d</p><p>He squeezed her closer. \u201cIs that an invitation?\u201d he asked in a low whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>He was about to say that dinner no longer interested him when he saw Mac and Jill sitting at a table in the corner. The other couple rose and waved them over.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jill said brightly, as she settled back in her chair. \u201cWe saw this corner table was open and thought we should grab it while we could. It\u2019s much less conspicuous.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced. \u201cBecause people are going to talk, right? That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. I knew it. I think I\u2019m going to be sick.\u201d</p><p>Mac looked wary. \u201cFor real, or is this drama?\u201d</p><p>Gracie placed a hand on her stomach. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s drama,\u201d Riley said and pulled out a chair. \u201cA few chips and salsa will make you feel better.\u201d</p><p>Gracie brightened. \u201cI do like chips. They\u2019re not dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike bread?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d She beamed at him. \u201cYou remembered.\u201d</p><p>She sank into her seat. He and Mac exchanged a look that said \u201cwomen\u2014what can we do?\u201d then they sat down as well.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Mac asked Riley.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Poll numbers are down since the debate. Not a surprise. Zeke, my campaign manager, is coming up with some strategies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI never liked the mayor,\u201d Jill said with a sniff. \u201cHe\u2019s so smarmy.\u201d She shivered. \u201cI want you to kick his butt. In the election,\u201d she added when Mac raised his eyebrows. \u201cNot literally, although I wouldn\u2019t mind that either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd here I thought you were sworn to uphold the law,\u201d her husband said as he put his arm around her.</p><p>\u201cNo, honey. That\u2019s you.\u201d</p><p>They smiled at each other. Riley studied their easy exchange. When he\u2019d first heard his old friend had taken the job as sheriff and remarried, he\u2019d actually felt sorry for the guy. Who would want a life like that? But now, watching them together, he saw they had a connection. He wasn\u2019t sure he believed in love, but if it existed, then Mac and Jill shared it.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something different,\u201d Gracie said, leaning toward her friend. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>Jill shrugged. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, there\u2019s something. You\u2019re...different.\u201d Gracie tilted her head. \u201cIt\u2019s not your hair. No highlights. Show me your teeth. Did you get them whitened?\u201d</p><p>Jill laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Riley narrowed his gaze. Gracie was right. Something had changed. Jill looked radiant.</p><p>Suddenly Gracie shrieked loud enough for nearby diners to turn in their direction.</p><p>\u201cAre you?\u201d she demanded as she clutched her friend\u2019s hand. \u201cYou are. I can tell.\u201d</p><p>Jill blushed, then nodded. \u201cI just found out this morning. I never thought it would happen so fast. We just started trying, but yeah. I\u2019m pregnant.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat is so great!\u201d</p><p>Gracie flew out of her seat and rounded the table. Jill stood and they hugged. Riley leaned over to Mac and offered his hand.</p><p>\u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cThanks. We\u2019re both happy.\u201d Mac looked sheepish. \u201cIt\u2019s a little fast. I thought we\u2019d have a couple of months, but I guess we got it right the first time.\u201d</p><p>Gracie and Jill returned to their seats. \u201cAre you in shock?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah,\u201d Jill said. \u201cI haven\u2019t even bought any baby books.\u201d</p><p>Riley watched the women. Was Gracie pregnant as well? They still had a few days until they would know. What would he think if she was? From his perspective, he doubted he would consider the idea \u201cgetting it right the first time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, well, isn\u2019t this something.\u201d</p><p>Riley turned and saw two older women standing by their table. He started to rise, but the one with sausage curls put a surprisingly firm hand on his shoulder.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t get up. Not that I don\u2019t appreciate the manners.\u201d</p><p>Mac shifted uncomfortably. \u201cRiley, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve met Wilma. She runs the sheriff\u2019s office.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi.\u201d The shorter of the two women stared at him. \u201cThis is my friend, Eunice Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy neighbor,\u201d Gracie whispered. \u201cHi, Ms. Baxter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHello, Gracie. My, my, don\u2019t you young people look so nice out together?\u201d Eunice squeezed his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see you\u2019ve come to your senses, Riley. Gracie always did know how to love a man. When I think about all she did to get your attention, it does my heart good to see you with her now.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t sure what to say. \u201cUm, yes, ma\u2019am.\u201d</p><p>Eunice giggled. \u201cSuch fine manners. I liked your mama so much. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s not alive to see this. You\u2019ve done her proud.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe should go,\u201d Wilma said. \u201cHave a nice dinner.\u201d</p><p>The old ladies left. Gracie rubbed her temples.</p><p>\u201cI warned you,\u201d she said. \u201cI said this was really, really bad, that people would see and talk about us.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jill patted her arm. \u201cYou\u2019re legend, and you\u2019re going to have to accept that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan I be something else, like a pillar? I\u2019d be a great pillar.\u201d</p><p>Mac grinned. \u201cMaybe being seen with you will get Riley elected.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I doubt that,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019ve probably cost him points.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Riley told her. \u201cI didn\u2019t come this far to lose the election. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Worrying is like a sport with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen worry tomorrow. Tonight we\u2019re here to have fun. Can you do that?\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p> <p>The waitress arrived and asked for their drink orders. He and Mac each wanted a beer, while Gracie and Jill selected iced tea.</p><p>The reality of the situation struck him. She wasn\u2019t drinking. In fact the night they\u2019d made love and played with champagne at the same time, she\u2019d barely had any of the alcohol. He\u2019d noticed her nearly full glass the next morning. He knew that Gracie normally didn\u2019t mind drinking, so the change had to do with the fact that she might be pregnant.</p><p>He\u2019d known in his head it might be possible, but until that moment, the news hadn\u2019t sunk down to his gut.</p><p>What if she was? What would he do? Marry her?</p><p>He waited for the panic and frustration he\u2019d felt when he\u2019d had to marry Pam to swamp him, but there wasn\u2019t any. He wasn\u2019t even angry. So what the hell did that mean?</p><p>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</p> <p>NEDA JACKSON TURNED out to be a bright, attractive woman in her mid-twenties with fabulous braids hanging halfway down her back. Gracie eyed them and wondered if she could pull off a similar look.</p><p>\u201cGood to meet you,\u201d Neda said as she walked into Gracie\u2019s rental house. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my research and I have to tell you that all your brides are very happy with your cakes. One of them even invited me by after the wedding. Her mom had saved me a piece.\u201d Neda\u2019s dark brown eyes widened with pleasure. \u201cDelicious. I love how the cake tasted, and I\u2019m not a big cake eater. So what do you put in it?\u201d</p><p>Gracie laughed. \u201cSorry. House secret. I played with various cake recipes for over a year until I perfected the one I use. It\u2019s a white cake recipe that I modify for chocolate or yellow cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you working on now?\u201d Neda asked.</p><p>\u201cStaying sane. It\u2019s the busy season. I have at least three cakes to make every week for the next eleven weeks. Then it drops off to just two cakes a week. Some of the designs are simple and only take twenty or thirty hours. Some take double that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you work alone, don\u2019t you? There aren\u2019t that many hours in a day.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded. \u201cTell me about it. I save a lot of time by making the decorations in batches. A lot of them can be made in advance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you do it yourself. That\u2019s so great. I have to tell you, I\u2019ve met some wedding cake makers who really cut corners. As much as these cakes cost, that makes me crazy.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie led the way into the dining room where hundreds of leaves and individual flowers sat on stacked trays.</p><p>Neda moved close. \u201cWhat are these? Plastic flowers you buy at a craft store.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I made them. They\u2019re edible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Neda moved close and stared. \u201cThey\u2019re icing. Even the leaves. You made the leaves? You don\u2019t buy those?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI make each one by hand.\u201d</p><p>Gracie led her back into the kitchen where she had a two-layer shower cake on the counter.</p><p>\u201cHow do you get the frosting so smooth?\u201d Neda asked. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe cake is frosted in buttercream icing. Over that I\u2019ve placed rolled fondant. That\u2019s what makes it so smooth. The sides are decorated with little dots in two sizes.\u201d Gracie showed her how to apply them. \u201cRoses circle the base of the two layers.\u201d</p><p>She picked up a premade rose and gently set it into place. \u201cThe process isn\u2019t that difficult, but it\u2019s time consuming.\u201d</p><p>Neda laughed. \u201cNot to mention that you have to be able to design the cake in the first place and make all the decorations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt helps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI could never do that.\u201d She set her notepad on a kitchen chair then dug in her bag for her digital camera. \u201cOkay, let me take some general pictures, then I want to shoot you decorating this cake.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure.\u201d</p><p>Gracie worked on the shower cake while Neda circled her and took pictures. There was a partially assembled wedding cake on the other counter and Gracie worked on that as well. As Neda took photos, she asked questions.</p><p>\u201cWhy wedding cakes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like making them. I enjoy the challenge of coming up with a new design. I like being a part of a couple\u2019s special day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAny disasters?\u201d</p><p>Gracie sighed. \u201cSomeone dropped the top layer once. The bride\u2019s brother had picked up the cake, which was in six boxes. I was going to assemble it later. I received a frantic phone call that the top layer, including the blown-glass antique ornament, had been destroyed.\u201d</p><p>Neda stared at her. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Gracie slipped three more roses in place. \u201cI was making another cake for the following day and they were about the same size. I put a new top layer in the oven for bride number two and quickly changed the frosting on the one I already had. We still didn\u2019t have an ornament, so I put a call in to the florist. By the time I arrived at the reception location, she had delivered five dozen miniature roses in the bride\u2019s colors.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shivered at the memory. \u201cIt was a three-layer cake with pillars in between, so everything was visible. I had less than an hour to make it all work. I pretty much pulled off most of my decorations, to make the bottom two layers more plain, then I cut the rose stems off and piled the buds on each layer. I used leftover petals to dress up the table and tacked a few decorations on the top layer. No one ever knew, except the immediate family.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTalk about pressure,\u201d Neda said.</p><p>\u201cIt got my heart racing.\u201d</p><p>Neda took several more pictures, asked a couple more questions, then announced that the interview was finished.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so impressed,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cI love your work and I\u2019m going to say that in my article.\u201d Neda loaded up her bag. \u201cI\u2019m engaged. We\u2019re thinking of a Christmas wedding. Do you still have room in your schedule for my cake?\u201d</p><p>Gracie smiled. \u201cAbsolutely. Let me give you a card. You can call me in the next month or so and we can talk about what you\u2019d like. Holiday wedding cakes can be so beautiful. All those jewel tones.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. Thanks. You\u2019ve been terrific.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>Gracie led her to the front door, then walked her out to her car. As they approached Neda\u2019s Mustang, Gracie noticed a couple of boxes lying on the driveway next to her own car.</p><p>\u201cWhat are those?\u201d she asked as she moved closer.</p><p>When she caught sight of the familiar cake mix logo, she froze in place.</p><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Neda asked.</p><p>Gracie couldn\u2019t move, couldn\u2019t breathe. She could only stare at the two boxes that had obviously fallen out of her Subaru. No wonder, what with the back end of the vehicle being jam packed with what looked like hundreds of cake mix boxes.</p><p>\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d the reporter asked, sounding disgusted. \u201cYou use cake mix? That\u2019s your secret ingredient?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! These aren\u2019t mine. You didn\u2019t see them when you drove up. I haven\u2019t used a cake mix since I was twelve. Someone did this.\u201d</p><p>Neda shook her head. \u201cOh, sure. Someone knew I was coming and just happened to figure out when so they could plant this on you. Forget what I said about you making my wedding cake.\u201d</p><p>Gracie picked up the boxes. They were full. \u201cYou have to believe me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. You\u2019re not special after all. I should have known.\u201d</p><p>Neda opened her car door and tossed in her bag. When she turned around, Gracie saw the digital camera in her hand. Before Gracie could stop her, she\u2019d already taken half a dozen pictures.</p><p>\u201cOh, and never mind about the article. We\u2019re a reputable magazine,\u201d Neda said as she climbed in her car. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did this. Don\u2019t you realize you\u2019re spoiling people\u2019s weddings? That\u2019s so low. You seemed so nice, too, but I guess that was as much a lie as your cakes. You probably didn\u2019t even make those decorations yourself. That\u2019s why they were all stacked like that. You bought them somewhere.\u201d</p><p>With that Neda slammed her door and sped away. Gracie stared after her. This couldn\u2019t be happening, she told herself. It just couldn\u2019t.</p><p>But it was, she thought as she stared at the cake box in her hand. Someone had set her up. And there was only one name she could think of:</p><p>Pam.</p><p>But even as she told herself no one else would bother, she honestly couldn\u2019t think of a single reason as to why Pam would do this to her. The woman had been nothing but friendly and pleasant since Gracie moved back. She\u2019d even rented out her kitchen.</p><p>Gracie fought tears as she dropped the boxes in the trash. Then she walked in the house, grabbed her purse, made sure the oven was off, then hurried to her car.</p><p>RILEY WRAPPED UP the meeting and walked back to his office. As he crossed in front of the elevators, they opened and Gracie stepped out. He took one look at her face and knew the worst\u2014whatever that might be\u2014had happened.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d he asked as he put his arm around her and led her into his office. \u201cIs someone hurt?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head and gulped in a breath. \u201cThe cakes. I don\u2019t understand how it happened. I told a few people, but no one knew when exactly. I think it\u2019s Pam, but why? She\u2019s been nice. It can\u2019t be Jill, and I want to suspect my sisters but I never even told them. God forbid we talk about anything but them.\u201d</p><p>He ushered her inside and closed the door. When they were alone and in private, he pulled her close and wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>\u201cStart at the beginning,\u201d he said gently. \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>Instead, she began to cry. His first clue was the long silence. Then her body began to shake and finally he heard the soft sobs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ruined,\u201d she managed after a few minutes. \u201cCompletely ruined.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot possible,\u201d he said and kissed the top of her head. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><p>Her answer was to cry harder. Riley had never been a fan of tears on a woman\u2014they\u2019d always seemed like a manipulation. But with Gracie, he felt differently. She didn\u2019t want anything from him\u2014except possibly for him to ease her pain.</p><p>She sniffed. \u201cI need a tissue.\u201d</p><p>He pulled out a handkerchief and handed it to her.</p><p>She blotted her face, then turned from him and blew her nose.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not attractive when I cry. You should look away.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close again. \u201cRight. Because I\u2019m just in this because of how you look. Tell me what happened.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI had my interview with the bridal magazine person today.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay and then what?\u201d He led her over to the sofa in the corner and tugged her down next to him. After angling toward her, he cupped her face. \u201cI know you were charming and brilliant and you made a fan.\u201d</p><p>Tears filled her blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d think, wouldn\u2019t you? She even asked me to bake her wedding cake. She\u2019s getting married in December. But now....\u201d</p><p>Her voice wavered and her shoulders slumped.</p><p>\u201cNow, what?\u201d he asked gently as he wiped her cheeks with his thumbs.</p><p>\u201cShe was leaving and I walked her outside. One of the things she wanted to talk about was the secret ingredient. I don\u2019t tell anyone what I put in my cakes. I worked on the recipe forever and it\u2019s really good.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI know. I\u2019ve had your cake.\u201d</p><p>She sniffed again. \u201cThere were boxes everywhere. Someone planted cake mix boxes in my car. They were spilled out onto the ground. She got mad. She took pictures and called me a liar and now I\u2019m ruined.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face and began to sob. He drew her close and settled her against his side.</p> <p>The typical male side of him wanted to promise that everything would be all right, but he didn\u2019t actually know that and he wasn\u2019t about to pretend to Gracie. Her business survived on reputation and word-of-mouth. He knew what the mention in People had done for her career. If word got out that she was a fraud, clients could disappear overnight.</p><p>Frustration bubbled inside of him. He didn\u2019t have a clue as to how to fix the problem and the need to do so burned hot and bright inside.</p><p>\u201cWho would do this?\u201d he asked. \u201cWho would want to set you up? Are other cake decorators mad because you\u2019re doing so well?\u201d</p><p>She kept her head on his shoulder and wiped her face with the handkerchief. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019re not exactly a close-knit group. No monthly meetings or any of that. I\u2019ve met a few at wedding expos. They seemed nice enough. How would any of them know what I was doing or even where I was?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho knew about the interview?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou, me, Jill. I\u2019m sure she told Mac, but he would never do anything like this. And Pam.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam, my ex-wife?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh. She was there when I got the call. She was really excited for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, right. Pam\u2019s never been happy for anyone but herself in her entire life. Okay, she\u2019s a prime suspect.\u201d</p><p>Gracie straightened and looked at him. \u201cI agree that of all the people who knew, Pam is the only one I don\u2019t trust. But why would she do it? What does she care if I get a write-up in some bridal magazine? It\u2019s a big deal with me, but not to anyone else. It\u2019s not as if she has a rival bakery. My success, or lack of success, doesn\u2019t impact her at all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood question. But there isn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI know.\u201d Gracie sighed. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it. Why? And what do I do now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you want to confront Pam?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really. I want to crawl back home and have this never have happened. Can we do that?\u201d</p><p>He stroked her hair. \u201cGracie, I know it\u2019s horrible, but what\u2019s the worst-case scenario? You don\u2019t get the nice spread in the bridal magazine. You were doing well before\u2014is not getting the notice going to be all that bad?\u201d</p><p>She sat up and looked at him. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not so bad. But I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not the worst of it. I\u2019ve made cakes for famous people\u2014that makes me loosely linked to them. And there\u2019s nothing anyone likes more than a scandal related to movie and television stars. If Neda just bad-mouths me at the magazine, I\u2019ll be okay. But if she sells the story and the photos to a tabloid, then I\u2019m completely and totally screwed.\u201d</p><p>Pain darkened her eyes. Pain and a kind of hopelessness that made him want to lash out at someone\u2014anyone, so long as it would make her feel better.</p><p>\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cNothing. But I appreciate the thought.\u201d She stood.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been great, but I have to get going. There are more cakes to finish before my career flushes down the toilet.\u201d</p><p>He rose. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that will happen.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get lucky, but I don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>As he watched her leave, he tightened his hands into fists. There had to be something he could do, some way he could fix the problem. Or if not this problem, then another one. Because he had to do something. He couldn\u2019t leave Gracie in that much pain.</p><p>GRACIE LOST HERSELF in work. Home seemed the safest place to be and with the worry that she could be trashed in some tabloid at any second, she desperately needed to work while she still could.</p><p>She avoided everyone, even Riley. She talked to Jill by phone, but didn\u2019t mention the botched interview, and she stayed away from Pam and her bed-and-breakfast. Better to have to turn the pans every ten minutes than risk that encounter, she thought, still not sure why Pam would have done it.</p><p>Three days later, the world came calling in the form of someone knocking on her front door. She walked out to the small foyer and looked out the window.</p><p>\u201cJust what I need,\u201d she murmured as she saw her mother standing there. \u201cAnother emotional beating.\u201d</p><p>But there was no way to hide, not with her car parked in the driveway, she so braced herself for the forthcoming lecture and opened the door.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom,\u201d she said with a cheerfulness she didn\u2019t feel. \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Her mother stepped into the house. \u201cNot great.\u201d</p><p>Gracie drew in a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that. Honestly, I didn\u2019t come back here to make trouble, but that seems to be what\u2019s happening. Apparently, there are forces at work I can\u2019t control. In truth, while I appreciate your concern, I can\u2019t handle one more lecture. I don\u2019t want to talk about my relationship with Riley, my past, my issues or any of that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Great. More wedding talk. Had Vivian\u2019s plan of nakedness worked?</p><p>Gracie led the way into the small living room and motioned to the sofa. \u201cYou want anything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>Her mother settled on a sofa and waited until Gracie took a club chair before speaking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d her mother said. \u201cI\u2019m more sorry than I can ever say. I\u2019ve been a horrible mother and a worse person. I\u2019m disgusted with myself.\u201d Tears filled her eyes.</p><p>Gracie figured that was four-for-four on the Landon women sobbing in the past couple of weeks. It had to be a record.</p><p>\u201cMom, I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d More prepared than Gracie had been during her meltdown, her mother withdrew a small package of tissues from her purse. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to ignore it all, but I can\u2019t. It\u2019s just like it was all those years ago. I know what I did and I refuse to do it again. Those bitches can just go to hell.\u201d</p><p>Gracie blinked. She wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d ever heard her mother swear before. \u201cI\u2019m all in favor of bitches in hell. Really. But who are we talking about and what did they do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not them. It\u2019s me.\u201d Her mother drew in a deep breath. \u201cOh, Gracie, you were always such a bright, happy child. Then your father died and your world collapsed. You were his favorite.\u201d She gave a shaky smile. \u201cParents aren\u2019t supposed to have favorites, or if we do, we aren\u2019t supposed to say, but everyone knew your father loved you best. And when he died, you were so lost.\u201d</p><p>Gracie swallowed. She remembered her father. How he\u2019d always made time for her, how they\u2019d done things together. \u201cI missed him a lot.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know you did. I was worried, but I thought you\u2019d be fine. Then that Riley boy moved in next door and you fixated on him. I knew it had to do with you losing your father and needing a man in your life. I thought it would blow over. But it didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Gracie\u2019s warm fuzzy feelings faded. \u201cWe\u2019ve been over this, Mom.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. Here\u2019s my point. Things got out of hand so quickly and soon everyone knew you had a crush on him. People talked. There were those stories in the paper. You became legend. A lot of people thought it was sweet, but some women around town weren\u2019t so kind. You were so creative and they were cruel. They laughed at you and at me. I felt exposed and humiliated. As if I couldn\u2019t control my own daughter. Every week there was a new Gracie story.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt her cheeks get hot. She\u2019d never considered her actions from her mother\u2019s point of view. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be. You were young and it was your first crush. I should have been able to handle it. I should have told them you were my daughter and I would stand by you. Instead I tried to make you stop, which didn\u2019t work. Then Pam turned up pregnant and there was the quickie wedding. I knew I had to get you out of town so nothing happened.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded as she remembered the pain of being sent away.</p><p>\u201cBut it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d her mother continued. \u201cAt Pam and Riley\u2019s wedding, you were all anyone talked about. They placed bets on whether or not you would show up. They recounted their favorite Gracie story and talked about how you loved that boy with your whole heart. Some people admired that, but others were less kind.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not telling you now to be cruel, just to explain. The fault is mine. I didn\u2019t think I could face the ridicule anymore. When my sister offered to take you, I let you go because I was selfish and weak. And I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>Her mother started to cry again. \u201cI missed you so much. Every day I reached for the phone to tell you to come home. But then someone would say something and it all came back to me. In time the talk died down and it was such a relief to me. But on the inside I felt so guilty for being a coward. I let my so-called friends influence me and because of that, I lost a daughter.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t know what to think. She was numb. \u201cYou didn\u2019t lose me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, I did. You and I aren\u2019t close. You\u2019re angry with me for what I did, and I deserve that. I have no excuse. I was spineless and foolish. I\u2019m sorry, Gracie. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d She pressed a hand to her mouth. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a bad mother because of my three girls, you\u2019re the one who turned out the best. Vivian is spoiled and selfish and Alexis is a drama queen. I think I did that. I think it\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><p>Gracie moved to the sofa and hugged her mother.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. I lost you and I only have myself to blame. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>Gracie held on. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, too. I never meant to embarrass you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was me, not you. You were a little girl in a lot of pain. I should have seen that.\u201d</p><p>Gracie supposed it was true, but she still felt self-conscious about it all. \u201cRemind me to never have a crush on a guy again,\u201d she said.</p><p>Her mother gave a strangled laugh. \u201cI think you\u2019re over all that now.\u201d</p><p>Gracie pulled back and eyed her suspiciously. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you were saying a couple of weeks ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTrue, but I know better now. If Riley Whitefield makes you happy, then you go on seeing him.\u201d Gracie half expected the earth\u2019s crust to open and gnomes in pointy hats to appear. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>Her mother nodded. \u201cI don\u2019t want to lose you again, Gracie. I know we can\u2019t recover what\u2019s lost, but I want us to try to be close again. I\u2019m willing to be patient and earn your trust.\u201d</p><p>Gracie felt her heart opening and stretching. \u201cOh, Mom. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not now, but I want it to be.\u201d They hugged again.</p><p>\u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cAlexis and Vivian were over the other night and I realized that part of our family was missing. I felt so sad, I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I want us to be together again. I hope you can want that, too.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded. It might take her a little while to shift her thinking, but she was willing to make the effort.</p><p>Her mother squeezed her tight, then let go. \u201cAll right, now that I\u2019ve dumped all over you with my problems, how are you? How\u2019s the cake business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere are a few bumps in the road.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike what?\u201d</p><p>She hesitated for a second, not sure if she wanted to say anything, then drew in a deep breath. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI had an interview with a reporter from a bride magazine a few days ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie told her what had happened.</p><p>When she\u2019d finished, her mother looked stunned. \u201cWho on earth would have planted those cake boxes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t a clue. No one really knew about the interview. Just me, Riley, Jill and Pam.\u201d</p><p>Her mother\u2019s lips curled. \u201cPam\u2019s a bitch. How did you get messed up with her?\u201d</p><p>Gracie couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cTalk about a snap judgment.\u201d</p> <p>Her mother dismissed the comment with a flick of her wrist. \u201cI never liked Pam. No one does. She\u2019s only out for herself.

Too bad Vivian didn\u2019t plan the wedding at Pam\u2019s little B&amp;B. I would enjoy constantly canceling and upsetting her plans.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced. \u201cAbout the wedding....\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot your problem,\u201d her mother said. \u201cAnd except for making the phone calls, it\u2019s not mine, either. I\u2019m tired of running interference for Viv. She needs to grow up and accept the consequences of her actions.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCross my heart.\u201d Her mother hugged her again. \u201cAny leftover cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. Come on.\u201d</p><p>RILEY READ through the detective\u2019s report again. Nothing. No sign of a mystery reporter, no hint that the mayor was up to anything. Riley had even asked the man to keep tabs on Pam for a few days and so far she\u2019d been a model citizen.</p><p>It was all frustrating, he thought as he drove through Los Lobos. He was no closer to figuring out what was going on than he had been before he\u2019d hired the detective. Worse, he had no motive for anyone to set up Gracie.</p><p>As he couldn\u2019t fix that problem, he\u2019d decided to deal with another one. Which was why he parked in front of Zeke\u2019s insurance office just before closing and strolled inside.</p><p>\u201cIs he in?\u201d Riley asked the woman at the front desk.</p><p>\u201cYes. May I say who\u2019s...Oh. Mr. Whitefield. I\u2019ll announce you.\u201d</p><p>Riley gave her a quick smile. \u201cNot necessary. I\u2019ll find my way back.\u201d</p> <p>He walked down the short hallway and opened Zeke\u2019s door without knocking.</p><p>Zeke looked up. \u201cHey, boss. What are you doing here?\u201d He glanced at his calendar. \u201cDid we have a meeting I missed?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNope.\u201d Riley walked to Zeke\u2019s desk and perched on the corner. \u201cDid you know that when I left Los Lobos I headed north?\u201d</p><p>Zeke frowned. \u201cNo. Should I have?\u201d</p><p>Riley shrugged. \u201cNot really. I crewed on fishing boats in Alaska. It\u2019s hard work. Long hours. I was a kid from a small town. I didn\u2019t know shit about the world. But I learned fast. Got into a lot of fights with guys bigger and older. After getting the crap beat out of me, I learned to hold my own.\u201d</p><p>Zeke shifted in his chair. \u201cProbably not good campaign material.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s interesting. Oil rigs are even worse. Confined quarters, a lot of independent men. When fights start there, they can go on for hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou want to beat up the mayor?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I was thinking more of taking you on.\u201d</p><p>Zeke\u2019s eyes widened. He scrambled to his feet. \u201cMe? What did I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re keeping secrets and I gotta tell you, I don\u2019t like it. They upset your wife, which doesn\u2019t matter to me, but then she tells Gracie and Gracie gets upset. Gracie does matter. This whole mess with the pictures started because of you. I can\u2019t solve the other problems in Gracie\u2019s life, but I can solve this one. Where the hell are you going at night and what are you doing when you get there?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</p><p>GRACIE STOOD in front of her schedule and wondered how long it would be until it all hit the fan. While she wanted to believe that Neda Jackson would simply keep the news to herself, Gracie knew her luck wasn\u2019t that good. If Neda couldn\u2019t write her article for the bridal magazine, she would be out some serious money. Which meant the reporter would have to make up the money elsewhere. As tabloids had a reputation of paying big for a scandal, Gracie had a feeling that was where Neda would go.</p><p>But how long would it take? Gracie didn\u2019t know anything about the world of weekly publishing. Was it days? Weeks? When would it hit?</p><p>Not that it mattered. She still had cakes to bake and decorate. Since the debacle with the cake mixes, she hadn\u2019t been back at Pam\u2019s place. Somehow she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the other woman was involved and until Gracie figured out how to prove it, she didn\u2019t want to confront her.</p><p>A car pulled up in her driveway. Since reconciling with her mother, Gracie felt less worried about visitors. With luck, she would really like this one.</p><p>She hurried to the front door and smiled when she saw a familiar Mercedes next to her car and a handsome man walking toward her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a bank to run?\u201d she asked, trying to ignore the fluttering she felt inside. Liking Riley was one thing, but really liking Riley could be a big mistake.</p><p>\u201cI have a staff,\u201d he said as he approached, then bent down to lightly kiss her. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the perks of being the boss.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA staff, huh? I might have to get me one.\u201d She stepped back to let him in, then led the way to the kitchen. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d</p><p>He moved close and put his hands on her shoulders. \u201cI have good news about Zeke. He\u2019s not having an affair. Not even close.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been expecting him to say about a thousand other things. \u201cWhat? You talked to Zeke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t solve your really big problems, but I knew I could take care of this one.\u201d</p><p>Which was really sweet, she thought happily. \u201cOkay, what\u2019s he doing on his nights when he disappears.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBrace yourself.\u201d</p><p>Riley was touching her. The only thing she really wanted to do was get closer and purr like a well-fed cat.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m braced.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s doing stand-up.\u201d</p><p>Gracie stared at him. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat was my reaction. Apparently Zeke has always dreamed about being a stand-up comedian. Then he met Alexis and fell in love. He put the idea aside, but lately it\u2019s been bugging him. He doesn\u2019t want to live his whole life with regrets, so he\u2019s trying to make it now.\u201d</p><p>Stand-up? \u201cI never thought of Zeke as that funny. Why didn\u2019t he tell Alexis?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBeats the hell out of me. Part of it is they\u2019re talking about starting a family and he didn\u2019t think quitting his job would make her feel secure. He\u2019s been going to clubs in Santa Barbara and L.A. working on his act. A couple of weeks ago, some guys from Leno saw him, so he\u2019s been waiting for a phone call.\u201d</p><p>Gracie couldn\u2019t believe it. Not only that her brother-in-law\u2019s secret life was something she never would have thought of but that he and Alexis were thinking of having a baby. There was a lot of pre-pregnancy going around these days.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to tell Alexis?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cI convinced him that was the best plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo I want to know how this convincing took place?\u201d</p><p>Riley looked pleased with himself. \u201cI threatened him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith physical violence?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled. \u201cWas it good for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best. I haven\u2019t been in a fight in years, but I was willing to take him on. Zeke never was a real physical guy. He backed down right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so proud of both of you.\u201d She stepped closer to Riley and he wrapped his arms around her. \u201cOne problem down, fifty million to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that how it feels?\u201d he asked as he stroked her back.</p><p>\u201cEvery minute of every day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo we\u2019ll tackle the next one. Pam and the cake boxes.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t want to think about that. \u201cWhy would Pam be involved?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue, but she makes sense as a suspect. We just have to figure out what\u2019s going on with her.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced and thought longingly of an antacid. \u201cTell me we\u2019re not going to watch her house.\u201d</p><p>Riley stepped back and grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll be here at eight. Dress in black. Oh, and bring your camera.\u201d</p><p>WHEN RILEY LEFT, Gracie went to work on baking. As she had to turn the pans every ten minutes, the job was far more labor intensive than it should have been. She\u2019d just pulled layer one from the oven when her cell phone rang. She grabbed it and pushed the talk button.</p><p>\u201cThis is Gracie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow could you?\u201d Fury filled the unfamiliar female voice. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how horrible I think you are. Bitch doesn\u2019t even come close.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Gracie blinked. \u201cWho is this? I think you have the wrong number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, you wish. I hate you. I\u2019ll never forgive you. And dammit, I want my deposit back right now. How dare you pass yourself off as a professional? You\u2019re a hack. You\u2019re a liar. My father\u2019s a lawyer and I\u2019m going to talk to him about suing you for...for I don\u2019t know what, but something. You\u2019re disgusting.\u201d</p><p>Gracie\u2019s stomach turned over as the room seemed to get very, very cold.</p><p>\u201cWho am I speaking with?\u201d she asked as calmly as she could.</p><p>\u201cSheila Morgan. You\u2019re supposed to be making my wedding cake next month. You lied, Gracie. You lied about everything. Now I have to find someone else. I hope you rot in hell. Oh, I\u2019m so mad, I can\u2019t think of bad enough things to say to you.\u201d</p><p>The phone call ended abruptly. Gracie pushed the end button and stared at her phone. Then she turned it off.</p><p>Twenty minutes later she stood beside the checkout line of the local grocery store. The weekly tabloids were still stacked together, tied in bundles. She scanned the headlines of the first two before seeing the teaser on the third.</p><p>Wedding Cake Planner To The Stars Stirs Things Up With Bad Baking.</p><p>Next to the headline was a crumpled box of cake mix.</p><p>She pulled the tabloid out and flipped through it until she found the article. It wasn\u2019t very big, maybe half a page, but there was a picture of her car filled with cake mix boxes and another shot of herself looking more than a little upset.</p><p>The text damned with innuendo. No one came out and said she used the cake mix, but the way it was written, no one had to.</p><p>By six, eighty percent of her cakes had been canceled. She\u2019d been on some of the bridal Internet bulletin boards and had seen the angry posts there. Even the editor of the bridal magazine that had commissioned the story in the first place had called to yell at her.</p><p>Gracie lay curled up in bed, staring at her cell phone. Every time she turned it on, there were more messages from brides canceling their orders. They were all furious and she had no idea how to tell them she\u2019d been the one betrayed, not them.</p><p>This couldn\u2019t be happening, she told herself. It was a really, really bad dream. She\u2019d worked so hard for so long to build up her reputation and now it was gone. Just like that. No one cared about how many nights she\u2019d stayed up making sure each cake was perfect. No one wanted to hear the truth.</p><p>The room got dark and she told herself she had to get up and do something, but she didn\u2019t have the energy. Instead she pulled the pillow over her head and willed the world to go away.</p><p>Sometime later she heard pounding on her front door. She ignored it, even as she remembered she and Riley were supposed to go watch Pam\u2019s house. What did it matter if Pam had done this to her? The damage was irreparable. Gracie\u2019s career was ruined.</p><p>After a few minutes, the pounding went away. Gracie dropped the pillow onto the other side of the bed and stared at the ceiling. Shadows filled the room. In the distance, she heard a door open, then footsteps. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Under normal circumstances, she would have imagined the worst\u2014robbers or aliens or something\u2014but right now she didn\u2019t care.</p><p>\u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>Riley\u2019s voice. The man didn\u2019t give up.</p> <p>\u201cIn here,\u201d she called, her voice low and thick with pain. Everything hurt.</p><p>A light clicked on in the hallway. Seconds later he appeared in her room.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened? Are you sick?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wish. At least I could get better. Or die. Either way the problem would be solved.\u201d</p><p>He sat on the edge of the mattress and brushed the hair out of her face. \u201cTell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p> <p>She picked up the cell phone and pushed the buttons to replay the messages, then handed it to him.</p><p>He listened for a few minutes. When he turned off the phone, she found herself fighting tears.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had, I could accept what they\u2019re doing. But I didn\u2019t, and no one will listen. My business is all about reputation. Now it\u2019s gone. I get to keep the two cakes for this weekend because it\u2019s too late for the brides to find someone else. Just about everyone else has canceled, except for the stupid sheet cake the historical society wants me to do and I\u2019m sure the only reason they haven\u2019t canceled is that I\u2019m doing it for free.\u201d</p><p>She saw anger tighten his expression. He bent down and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll fix this,\u201d he promised.</p><p>\u201cNot to make trouble, but how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure something out. We\u2019re a great team. Come on. We\u2019re going to go stalk Pam. I\u2019ve already got my detective working on learning everything we can about her. There are secrets in her past and we\u2019re going to find them. In the meantime, let\u2019s go get some incriminating pictures.\u201d</p><p>Gracie shook her head. \u201cYou go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot without you.\u201d</p><p>He grabbed her arms and pulled her into a sitting position, then he crouched in front of her.</p><p>\u201cCome on, Gracie. Let\u2019s go ruin Pam. It will be fun.\u201d</p><p>The urge to simply curl back up in bed nearly overwhelmed her. She would have given in except she had the thought that if she did, she might never get up again, and that couldn\u2019t be good.</p><p>\u201cOkay. Give me a second to get changed.\u201d</p><p>She stood and walked to her closet. The clothing choices seemed overwhelming. Riley moved next to her then reached inside for a pair of black jeans and a dark purple T-shirt.</p> <p>\u201cVery fashion forward,\u201d he said, draping the clothes over her arm and pushing her toward the bathroom. \u201cYou have three minutes to get changed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere did you ever hear an expression like \u2018fashion forward\u2019?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cAre you kidding? The style network is really big on the oil rig. All those half-naked models draw us in, but the runway news keeps us riveted.\u201d</p><p>She smiled, which felt weird, but nice. \u201cI\u2019ll be right out.\u201d</p><p>Ten minutes later they were in his car and heading across town in the rapidly dwindling twilight.</p><p>She stared out the windshield and tried to keep her sighing to a minimum.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have time for this,\u201d she told him. \u201cThe election is in a couple of weeks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve got it covered. I\u2019ll start going door-to-door in a day or two.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you behind in the polls?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m holding my own.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley, I\u2019m not a baby. I can handle it. What are the numbers?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill falling.\u201d</p><p>How much of that was her fault? If she hadn\u2019t come back to Los Lobos, none of this would have happened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout all of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry about the cake disaster, but not the rest of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you crazy? You could lose. Have you considered that? It\u2019s ninety-seven million dollars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t lose.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut if you do. And what if I\u2019m pregnant?\u201d</p><p>That seemed to get his attention. \u201cAre you?\u201d</p><p>She slumped down in the seat. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. I can take the pregnancy test in three days. But what if I am?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with it.\u201d</p><p>He spoke calmly, which wasn\u2019t what she expected. In his position, she had a feeling she would be both furious and screaming. But after the day she\u2019d had, she appreciated the lack of dramatics.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll try not to be pregnant,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it works that way.\u201d</p><p>He drove down a street she thought she recognized, then parked behind a minivan.</p><p>\u201cPam\u2019s house is over there,\u201d he said, pointing to a house on the corner. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk the rest of the way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t one of us be humming the theme from Mission Impossible?\u201d she asked as she climbed out of his Mercedes.</p><p>\u201cOnly if it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI guess not.\u201d</p><p>She followed down the sidewalk. Streetlights illuminated much of the area, but there were still puddles of darkness to hide in.</p><p>When Riley ducked into a side yard, she followed. They made their way into the backyard and crouched by some bushes.</p><p>\u201cShe didn\u2019t close her blinds,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cShe probably didn\u2019t expect to be spied on. It\u2019s not something I think about either. Although given what\u2019s happening in my life, I guess I should.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere,\u201d he said, pointing.</p><p>Gracie strained to see in the window. Pam stood in the kitchen, pouring something from a large bowl into a\u2014</p><p>\u201cThat bitch has my baking pans!\u201d</p><p>The loud words filled the silence of the night. Even as Riley grabbed her and pulled her down next to him, she slapped both hands over her mouth.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d He spoke the words directly into her ear.</p><p>The soft sound was distracting enough, but when combined with the heat of his breath and the way his strong arms supported her, she started to go all gooey inside.</p><p>This was neither the time nor the place, she reminded herself as she dropped to her knees and shoved her hands into her pockets.</p><p>\u201cShe has my baking pans.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI gathered that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she take my baking pans?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot a clue.\u201d</p><p>Gracie considered the possibilities. \u201cTo make her own cakes? But why?\u201d She rose up slightly so she could see in the window again. Pam bent over the oven, positioning the cake.</p><p>\u201cThe rack\u2019s too high,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThe edges are going to burn. If she was planning to steal my business, she should have asked more questions.\u201d</p><p>She turned to him. \u201cIs that it? Is Pam going to steal my business?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy would she want to? She seems to have enough money of her own.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right. Someone is paying for very expensive clothing,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s the bed-and-breakfast. That wasn\u2019t cheap. Okay, now I\u2019m completely confused. What is she doing?\u201d</p><p>They stayed out in the bushes for nearly two hours in an attempt to find out. The only thing they discovered was that Pam was a really bad baker. Gracie felt some small measure of satisfaction when the cake turned out lopsided and burned on the edges. The pleasure peaked when Pam attempted to remove the cake from the pan and only about sixty percent of it fell onto the cooling rack.</p><p>\u201cIt was a complete disaster,\u201d Gracie said cheerfully as they headed back to the car. \u201cMy first cake was much better than that and I think I was all of ten when I made it. I guess I don\u2019t have to sweat her stealing my clients anytime....\u201d</p><p>Her voice trailed off as she realized she didn\u2019t have any clients to steal.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d Riley said as he put an arm around her and drew her close. \u201cWe\u2019ll watch her for as many nights as it takes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing sweeps month is over on television and there\u2019s nothing to watch.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her and raised his eyebrows. \u201cYou would rather watch television than spy on Pam with me?\u201d</p><p>She smiled. \u201cNever! Did I say that? Absolutely not. You sure know how to show a girl a good time.\u201d</p><p>THE NEXT two nights of spying produced similar results. Pam baked. Badly, Gracie thought with some measure of satisfaction. Pam also didn\u2019t take good care of the pans, which were getting dark and scratched, but that was the least of Gracie\u2019s problems.</p><p>But on the third night there wasn\u2019t a cooling rack in sight. Pam barely came into the kitchen and when she did it was to pop a cookie sheet of store-bought appetizers into the oven and pull a bottle of white wine out of the refrigerator.</p><p>\u201cCompany,\u201d Riley said with satisfaction. \u201cLet\u2019s see who Pam hangs out with these days. Maybe we\u2019ll get some answers there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe only possibly interesting person could be the mayor,\u201d Gracie whispered. \u201cAnd it can\u2019t be him. She thinks he\u2019s just as creepy as everyone else.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><p>Gracie realized she wasn\u2019t sure about anything except that she was getting a cramp in her leg.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll go around to the side yard,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be able to see who\u2019s arriving.\u201d</p><p>Gracie followed him, making sure to stay low. When they were in position in the side yard, she fumbled with her camera. Might as well get a picture of Pam\u2019s visitor.</p><p>A car drove down the street. Gracie rose so she could brace herself against a small tree. She raised her camera to her face and squinted to see out the tiny viewer. The car got closer.</p><p>\u201cCome on, big guy,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Riley chuckled. \u201cBig guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust an expression.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. The car\u2019s pulling in.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t sure what happened next. Maybe it was wet grass or leaves. Maybe it was just being clumsy. Maybe it was fate. Whatever the cause, just as she prepared to snap the picture of Pam\u2019s visitor, Gracie\u2019s foot slipped. She found herself sliding and falling. As she instinctively reached out to grab something, she squeezed the button on the camera. The flash exploded in the darkness. The tired mechanism pushed out a picture and whoever was in the car backed up and sped away.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d</p><p>Riley grabbed her free hand and dragged her out of the yard and toward their car. Lights popped on in Pam\u2019s house. The front door opened.</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s out there?\u201d Pam yelled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>Gracie threw herself into Riley\u2019s car and ducked down below the dashboard.</p><p>\u201cDrive. Drive!\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m driving.\u201d</p><p>He started the engine and made a U-turn. It was only when they were a couple of blocks away that he turned on the lights. Gracie slowly straightened.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said, afraid to look at him and see how mad he was. \u201cI didn\u2019t do that on purpose.\u201d</p><p>A strange sound made her stiffen. Was he...laughing?</p><p>She turned her head and stared at him. \u201cWhat is so funny?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou,\u201d he said with a chuckle. \u201cI know you didn\u2019t do that on purpose. I watched you start to slide, but I was too far away to prevent it. You were like a cartoon or something. Slow at first, then faster and faster.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cI\u2019ll give you this, Gracie. You\u2019re never boring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. You can put that on my tombstone. In the meantime, we still don\u2019t know what Pam\u2019s up to or who she\u2019s hanging out with. Did you see the car?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. It was too dark to figure out make or model.\u201d</p><p>Gracie pulled the covering off the picture and stared at a section of Pam\u2019s roof and a bunch of darkness she figured had to be the sky. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t get my baking career back, I\u2019ll never make it as a photographer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get your baking business back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause we\u2019re going to solve this mystery, and then whoever did it will make it right. Even if I have to stand over him or her and physically force them.\u201d</p><p>She liked the sound of that. \u201cYou can be so sweet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I\u2019m willing to beat people up for you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. It\u2019s great.\u201d</p><p>He reached over and touched her cheek. \u201cYou need to rethink your standards.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot even a little.\u201d She turned her head so she could press her mouth to his palm. \u201cWant to sleep over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d</p><p>She liked that he didn\u2019t even have to think about it.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good man, Riley Whitefield.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a bastard. You can\u2019t see it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p> <p>Sure, he had his flaws, but who didn\u2019t? The important thing was he\u2019d been there for her, almost from the beginning, and this despite their rather odd and scary past. He\u2019d obviously gotten over her being stalker girl. He was protective, caring, funny, smart and, when they made love, she touched a whole new dimension because of him. He made her feel safe. He made her feel sparks.</p><p>She watched him as they drove back to her place. After he parked in the driveway next to her car, he leaned over and kissed her. As she wrapped her arms around him and held on tight, she wondered if it was the least bit possible that she might very well have picked the man of her dreams at the tender age of fourteen.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</p><p>RILEY WOKE to a sunny room and an empty bed. He brushed his hands against the rumpled sheets and figured Gracie had to be somewhere in the house and that she\u2019d show up here eventually. Then he would grab her and pull her down next to him and have his way with her. Again.</p><p>He closed his eyes and smiled at the thought. He liked having her in his bed. He liked how she looked and smelled and how she made him feel. She was good for him, and he couldn\u2019t say that about many people he knew.</p><p>\u201cWhatcha smiling at?\u201d</p><p>He opened his eyes and saw her approaching. She wore a long T-shirt and, from the way her breasts swayed with each step, very little else.</p><p>\u201cYou.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d She sat next to him and brushed the hair off his forehead. \u201cWere you thinking about last night? You were an animal.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t bad yourself.\u201d He turned his head to glance at his left shoulder. \u201cI think you bit me.\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cI know I bit you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left marks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cComplaining?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOnly if you don\u2019t do it again.\u201d</p><p>She chuckled, then bent down and brushed her mouth across his.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re violating the three F\u2019s code and soon the three F\u2019s police will come and arrest you. The good news is you won\u2019t have to worry about being a daddy while you\u2019re locked up.\u201d She held out a white plastic stick. \u201cI\u2019m not pregnant.\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d forgotten it was time for her to take the test.</p><p>He reached for the stick, but she held it out of reach. \u201cI peed on that. I don\u2019t think you want to touch it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point.\u201d He studied her face. \u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYup. Not just from this.\u201d She waved the test. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been getting symptoms. I\u2019ll be getting my period in the next day or so. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s late because of all the stress in my life. That happens.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you okay with this?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cI\u2019m completely fine. Be happy. This is what we wanted. Isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d An unexpected pregnancy wasn\u2019t a part of his five-year plan.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve kept using protection after that first time, so no worries.\u201d She stood and tossed the plastic stick into the trash. \u201cI\u2019ve made coffee. I have some eggs if you want. I\u2019ll even scramble them for you.\u201d</p><p>He sat up, then grabbed her hand and squeezed her fingers. \u201cI only eat cake.\u201d</p><p>She laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re my kind of guy. Want to shower first?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>RILEY LEFT about thirty minutes later and drove home to change clothes before going to the bank. He\u2019d promised to call later so he and Gracie could figure out their \u201cPam\u201d strategy. He also had a meeting with Zeke about the campaign and a host of other responsibilities.</p><p>But all he could think about was Gracie and the fact that she wasn\u2019t pregnant. A good thing, he told himself. So why wasn\u2019t he more happy? Had he wanted her to be?</p><p>No way, he told himself. Then what? He would have had to marry her and be a husband and father. Neither were part of his game plan. He wasn\u2019t the kind of man who settled well in one place and Gracie....</p><p>Well, all right, maybe Gracie was the kind of woman that if he had to settle down she would make it okay. But he wasn\u2019t looking for a commitment. Not his thing. He didn\u2019t care.</p><p>Except he did care about her. He didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to her and he was determined to make her life right. He liked being around her.</p><p>Interesting, but not important, he told himself. When the election was over, win or lose, he planned on walking away. Nothing about that had changed.</p><p>\u201cWE\u2019RE DOING girl bonding,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cPlease say you\u2019ll come.\u201d</p><p>Gracie wasn\u2019t sure she was in the mood for her family\u2019s definition of togetherness, but she did want to see her mother. They hadn\u2019t spent any time together since clearing the air on their past.</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><p>\u201cVivian has a half day today, and Mom and I are taking a long lunch, so say noon? We\u2019re doing a potluck. Do you have any cake?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll bring some. I have tuna salad, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><p>Gracie chuckled, then sighed. \u201cIs Vivian\u2019s wedding back on?\u201d</p><p>Alexis hesitated. \u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t a clue, and I\u2019m not sure I want to even know. If we go back and forth one more time, I\u2019m going to have to kill her.\u201d</p><p>Gracie could relate to that. \u201cWhat about Tom? Has she talked to him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that, either. I guess we\u2019ll find out. See you in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p><p>Gracie hung up the phone, then wandered into the kitchen. Selfishly, she wouldn\u2019t mind if her sister\u2019s wedding was back on simply to have a cake to make. Right now the only thing on her calendar was the cake she was making for free for the historical society. While she planned to give them more than just the sheet cake they\u2019d asked for, the event wasn\u2019t appropriate for something too fancy.</p><p>Not that she had her actual design. She\u2019d left that at Pam\u2019s along with all her really good pans. At some point she was going to have to go back and get them, but not today. In the meantime, she would recreate the design and figure out her work schedule. At least now she didn\u2019t have to worry about fitting it in around other cakes.</p><p>At a little before twelve, Gracie drove over to her mother\u2019s house. In some ways, she actually felt better about everything. One by one her problems were being resolved. She wasn\u2019t pregnant and she wasn\u2019t fighting with her mother. Now if she could just get her career back on track, she would be pretty darned close to perfect.</p><p>She parked behind Alexis\u2019s car. Her sister waited while Gracie collected a pink bakery box from the passenger seat and stepped out.</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d Alexis asked, looking especially happy and cheerful.</p><p>\u201cGood. What about you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m great. Zeke and I have spent the past few nights talking.\u201d She grinned. \u201cAnd doing other things. Did Riley tell you about him wanting to do stand-up?\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded. \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHonestly, I was shocked at first and I pretty much went crazy. Then I thought about it and I realized that Zeke deserves the chance to follow his dreams. Plus I kind of like the idea of being married to someone famous.\u201d</p><p>Gracie nodded, as if that made perfect sense to her, even as she realized however much she might want to be emotionally close with her sisters, it was probably never going to happen. And the reason had nothing to do with being raised by her aunt and uncle. Instead it was because they were completely different people.</p><p>\u201cAfter the election, he\u2019s going to quit his job,\u201d Alexis said as she knocked once, then opened the front door. \u201cI\u2019ll be supporting the two of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d Gracie couldn\u2019t imagine Alexis taking that on.</p><p>\u201cDoing my best to be the supportive wife. He can repay me later with really great jewelry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting plan,\u201d Gracie said as she tried to keep an open mind. While she could appreciate that Alexis wanted to help Zeke out, she wasn\u2019t as comfortable with the payback mentality. But then she\u2019d never been married. Obviously it worked for them.</p><p>\u201cYou guys made it,\u201d Vivian said as she walked out of the kitchen. \u201cGracie, is there lots of cake, because I\u2019m doing a real sugar thing right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ten-inch triple-layer cake with chocolate filling.\u201d</p><p>Vivian sighed. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Gracie watched as her baby sister took the bakery box, then peeked inside. Somehow Vivian seemed older than when she\u2019d last seen her, and thinner. There were circles under her eyes and a sad set to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Gracie asked.</p><p>\u201cThe sex thing didn\u2019t work?\u201d Alexis asked with a grin. \u201cCoulda told you that.\u201d</p><p>Gracie winced. \u201cAre you okay, Vivian?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but I will be. This gets better, right? Heartache.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTom will come around,\u201d Alexis said. \u201cA couple of weeks without him getting any and he\u2019ll be yours to command.\u201d</p><p>Vivian shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. He\u2019s been pretty clear about it. Come on. Mom\u2019s in here.\u201d</p><p>She led the way into the kitchen where their mother had set four places at the large round table.</p><p>\u201cAll my girls together,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is lovely.\u201d</p><p>She hugged them all in turn. When she gathered Gracie close, she whispered, \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too,\u201d Gracie murmured back and was pleased to know she actually meant it.</p><p>They sat down. Vivian passed on the sandwiches and salad and cut herself a piece of cake. But instead of eating, she chased crumbs around her plate.</p><p>\u201cSo what happened with Tom?\u201d Alexis asked as she picked up a chicken salad sandwich and took a bite.</p><p>\u201cNot much. We\u2019ve talked a couple of times. He\u2019s standing firm. I just....\u201d She swallowed and looked at Gracie. \u201cI guess you were right. I should have been honest. It\u2019s just I never have been. Not with a guy. I thought being mysterious and unpredictable was the way to keep them interested. Plus Mom, remember how you\u2019d never tell Dad stuff. You\u2019d buy us all new shoes, then make us promise not to say anything for a few weeks.\u201d</p><p>Her mother looked at Vivian. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him angry because I\u2019d spent too much money, but that has nothing to do with being honest. Is that what you remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was only nine. I don\u2019t remember very much at all.\u201d Vivian turned to Alexis. \u201cDo you tell Zeke everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course not, but that\u2019s different. We\u2019re married.\u201d</p><p>Gracie did her best not to react to Alexis. \u201cI wonder if your threatening to call off the wedding time after time made Tom feel that you didn\u2019t love him enough.\u201d</p><p>Vivian straightened. \u201cYes. That\u2019s what he said. He wasn\u2019t sure of my feelings. He was afraid I\u2019d run off every time there was a problem. I wouldn\u2019t. Once we were married, I\u2019d be committed.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cMaybe he needed proof of that before the wedding,\u201d Gracie said softly.</p><p>\u201cI guess.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThings will get better,\u201d their mother said. \u201cIf you two are meant to be together, you\u2019ll find your way back to each other.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hope so.\u201d Tears filled Vivian\u2019s eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s just I miss him so much. Plus, I feel really horrible about everything that\u2019s already paid for. I\u2019m supposed to pick up the wedding dress on Friday. What on earth should I do with it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep it,\u201d Alexis said cheerfully. \u201cI told you\u2014he\u2019ll come around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. And even if he does, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d have the same wedding.\u201d Vivian stared at her cake. \u201cHe was really angry about how much everything was costing. He said he was going to call you and talk about repaying you for the deposits.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe already did,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding. What did you say?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat I would handle it, but I appreciated the offer.\u201d</p><p>Gracie found herself regretting that the wedding was off. Tom sounded like a great guy and someone who would treat her sister well.</p><p>\u201cKeep the dress,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get back together, you can sell it on e-Bay.\u201d</p><p>Vivian nodded. \u201cI can. You\u2019re right. I just have to....\u201d She squared her shoulders. \u201cMom, have you canceled everything already? I mean, I can make some phone calls and stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all done, but thanks for asking.\u201d</p><p>Vivian shook her head. \u201cNo. I need to do something. It\u2019s not right that you had all the work and all the expense. I know I said I\u2019d work to help pay for my wedding dress, but I wasn\u2019t very responsible about it. I really want to commit to working in the store. We\u2019ll come up with a schedule, okay? I\u2019ll promise at least fifteen hours a week until I\u2019ve paid you back.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHoney, you don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d</p><p>Vivian gave a shaky smile. \u201cI think you\u2019d better let me. It might be the only way I\u2019ll ever grow up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood point,\u201d her mother said.</p><p>Alexis rolled her eyes, but Gracie felt a tugging sensation around her heart. Maybe there was hope for Vivian after all. If she matured, she would certainly have a shot at winning back Tom.</p><p>Vivian turned to Gracie. \u201cMaybe you could give me some pointers on getting over the only guy I\u2019ve ever loved. How did you recover from Riley?\u201d</p><p>Gracie opened her mouth, then closed it. A month ago, she would have said time and distance. Today, she wasn\u2019t sure she was over Riley, and she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to be. He was everything she\u2019d ever dreamed of finding in a man with a few bonuses thrown in for good measure.</p><p>She blinked. \u201cI\u2019m the wrong person to ask,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cI\u2019m not over him. In fact, I\u2019m in love with him.\u201d She looked at her mother. \u201cSorry, Mom. I know this isn\u2019t what you wanted.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHa. I\u2019m done caring about those vultures I\u2019ve called friends. If you love him, then I want you two to be happy. Are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Right now I\u2019m in shock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all because of me,\u201d Alexis said smugly. \u201cI\u2019m the reason they got back together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs it a good thing?\u201d Vivian asked. \u201cDo you want to be in love with him again? Does he love you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Gracie said, feeling both shocked and more than a little bubbly. \u201cI think he cares some, but...I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to tell him, aren\u2019t you?\u201d her mother asked.</p><p>\u201cSure. Of course. After the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>The other three Landon women spoke at once.</p><p>\u201cI have to wait,\u201d Gracie said. \u201cHe\u2019s behind in the polls. I can\u2019t distract him from the election.\u201d</p><p>Although if she did and he lost, he couldn\u2019t close the bank and the loans wouldn\u2019t be called.</p><p>No! She refused to work like that, dealing behind his back. It was wrong.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so confused,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI will tell him, but not just yet.\u201d</p><p>Vivian eyed her. \u201cWhat size are you? Want to buy a beautiful but never worn wedding gown?\u201d</p><p>Gracie gave a strangled laugh. \u201cLet me get back to you on that one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCOME,\u201d RILEY CALLED without looking up from his computer screen. Diane\u2019s distinctive knock meant he always knew when it was her.</p><p>\u201cWe have been approached by the historical society ticket committee,\u201d she said after she\u2019d stepped into his office.</p><p>\u201cThey have a whole committee to sell tickets?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really only two people, but they like to sound bigger than that.\u201d</p><p>He pushed the save button and turned to face his secretary. \u201cFair enough. How many do they want me to buy?\u201d</p><p>Diane pressed her lips together. \u201cObviously as many as you would like, but I informed them you were not interested in supporting local civic charities and that it was unlikely\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take fifty.\u201d</p><p>He had the pleasure of watching Diane\u2019s mouth drop open.</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFifty tickets,\u201d he said, speaking slowly, as if not sure of her cognitive abilities. \u201cBuy them and pass them out to the staff. I want one, as well. Leave the extras on a table for those interested to take them for family members.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth closed and her eyes narrowed. \u201cWhy do you care about the historical society?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re buying tickets. They\u2019re ten dollars each.\u201d He leaned back in his chair and grinned. Ruffling Diane\u2019s prickly tweed-covered feathers was turning out to be a lot of fun. \u201cMaybe your attempts to guilt me into doing things I don\u2019t want to do have worked,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cI doubt that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe I want to preserve our historical past.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot even for money.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. If he were sticking around, he would want to give her a raise. \u201cGracie is baking the cake. Everyone who attends will try it and word will get out that she\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>The words were obviously loaded but he couldn\u2019t say with what. \u201cCare to expand on that?\u201d he asked.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll go call the committee?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich half?\u201d One corner of her mouth turned up in an almost smile. Then she excused herself and left his office.</p><p>Riley stared at the closed door. He liked Diane. At first she\u2019d simply been efficient, but now she was someone he respected and enjoyed working with. He would miss her when he left. Not that it mattered.</p><p>He returned his attention to his computer, but after a few minutes, he shut it down and grabbed his suit jacket. Suddenly the bank president\u2019s office had gotten too small.</p><p>He told Diane he was leaving and headed toward the parking lot in the rear. As he approached the double glass door, he saw a woman hurrying toward it. She had a small child by each hand and something about her was familiar.</p><p>He held open the door and smiled. \u201cAfternoon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Whitefield. How nice to see you.\u201d She nodded. \u201cI\u2019m Becca Jackson. I have the loan for the day-care center in my home.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, right. How are you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGreat. Busy and tired, but business is wonderful and I love what I do. Thank you again for approving my loan. You\u2019re a lifesaver.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy pleasure.\u201d</p><p>She stepped into the bank and he moved toward his car. As he walked, he wondered how difficult it would be for her to obtain other financing after the bank closed. She shouldn\u2019t have much of a problem. Of course the new bank would want to go over her profit and loss statements, and as a starting business, she wouldn\u2019t have much in the way of profit.</p><p>Not his problem, he told himself and got in his car.</p><p>As he drove through town, he found himself noticing different businesses that had loans with the bank. Some would be just fine, but others would never be able to find other funding. Then there were the houses. How many had their loans with him? Ten thousand? Twenty?</p><p>He reminded himself he didn\u2019t care. These people were nothing to him. He had a plan, and it wasn\u2019t about staying in Los Lobos. He wanted to destroy everything his uncle had ever cared about. Maybe then he would be able to sleep at night.</p><p>He turned into a residential neighborhood and pulled up to the sidewalk. Small, one-story homes lined the street. The lawns were well kept, the trees nearly touched over the center of the street. Families lived here. Babies were born and grew up. Fathers mowed the lawns on Saturday morning.</p><p>He\u2019d wanted that once. Years ago, after his dad had walked out, Riley had dreamed about a simple life filled with everyday activities. He\u2019d wanted a house instead of a single wide. Two parents instead of just one. He\u2019d wanted his mom happy, not crying when she thought he was asleep because she couldn\u2019t stretch the money far enough to buy him school supplies or get them cable. Sometimes she\u2019d only made dinner for him, while she went hungry.</p><p>He\u2019d hated that more than anything. And his uncle, who could have fixed it all, had simply turned his back on his only sister. The old bastard had even let her die.</p><p>Riley wouldn\u2019t forget that\u2014not ever.</p><p>He parked the car and turned off the engine. After slipping into his jacket, he walked up to the closest house and knocked on the front door. A woman in her early forties answered.</p><p>\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cMy name is Riley Whitefield and I\u2019m running for mayor.\u201d</p><p>The woman glared at him. \u201cI guess you are. I recognize your picture. If you\u2019re here about the election, you can forget it. I would have voted for you before. I don\u2019t like that weasel Yardley, but compared to you, he\u2019s a saint.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Riley had no idea how he could have offended someone he\u2019d never met. \u201cWhat changed your mind?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie Landon. I don\u2019t actually know her, but I\u2019ve heard all the stories. She was crazy about you. Loved you with her whole heart and you never appreciated it. You still don\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>No. This was not happening.</p><p>\u201cI can assure you Gracie and I never...\u201d Never what? Slept together? \u201cShe\u2019s not pregnant and if she were, I would marry her right away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. That\u2019s romantic. You\u2019ll take her on if your careless behavior screws up her life. Wow. Talk about noble.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t get it, do you? Gracie is a legend. She loved with a fearlessness we all admire. But you never understood what a gift she offered. You only saw her as a pain in the ass. Well, you\u2019re wrong. Her love is a precious gift and if you\u2019re too stupid to see that, you\u2019re too stupid to be mayor.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER NINETEEN</p><p>\u201cHOW DID IT GO?\u201d Zeke asked later that evening when they met at Riley\u2019s house to finalize their campaign plans.</p><p>\u201cInteresting.\u201d</p><p>Riley was already on his second Scotch. He figured he might as well go for a third later. The situation would be a hell of a lot easier to deal with drunk. Not that three drinks would even get him close, but it was a start.</p><p>\u201cDefine interesting,\u201d Zeke said. \u201cInteresting good?\u201d</p><p>Riley closed his eyes as he relived the afternoon he\u2019d spent going door-to-door in Los Lobos.</p><p>\u201cI visited about thirty houses where someone was home. I\u2019d say about eight-five percent of them basically told me they wouldn\u2019t vote for me until hell froze over.\u201d</p><p>Zeke swore. \u201cIt\u2019s the Gracie thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>Riley nodded. Who knew that something from his past would jump up and bite him so firmly in the ass? \u201cIt was those damn newspaper articles,\u201d he said grimly. \u201cPeople who had never heard of Gracie or me feel as if they lived a part of our lives with us. They feel involved. Right now they\u2019re taking her side and assuming I\u2019m the bastard in all this.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>To think he\u2019d come so far only to lose it over something like this.</p><p>\u201cYou must want to kill her, huh?\u201d Zeke said.</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d</p> <p>Riley knew it was probably the logical reaction, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to blame Gracie. She hadn\u2019t done anything wrong. Oh, sure, he was past angry. It was ninety-seven million dollars and more importantly, a chance to screw his uncle. But the disaster wasn\u2019t Gracie\u2019s fault.</p><p>Which brought him to an interesting question. Why wasn\u2019t he blaming her? If she hadn\u2019t come back to Los Lobos, none of this would have happened.</p><p>And that was the kicker, he thought as he stared at the bookshelf across from his chair and finished his drink. He didn\u2019t want to take back what had happened. Not the part that included her.</p><p>\u201cSo what are they saying?\u201d Zeke asked. \u201cThat you should treat her better?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I should marry her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo why don\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>Riley turned to his office manager and glared. \u201cMarry her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the election. Listen, it\u2019s not a crazy idea. You could work something out with her. A temporary marriage to win the election. You wouldn\u2019t even have to marry her. You could just get engaged. Gracie\u2019s a sweetie. She\u2019ll say yes.\u201d</p><p>She probably would, he thought. Knowing Gracie. She would feel horrible about what had happened and do everything in her power to make it right.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Zeke stared at him. \u201cWhat? No? Just like that? You\u2019re not even going to ask her?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019s the perfect solution. What\u2019s the problem?\u201d</p><p>Interesting question, and one Riley couldn\u2019t answer. He would have married Gracie if she\u2019d been pregnant, but he wouldn\u2019t do it this way. Not even a fake engagement. Besides, with his luck, an engagement wouldn\u2019t be enough. He\u2019d have to go through with it.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t screw with her life like that,\u201d Riley said. \u201cLeave it alone. We\u2019ll come up with another solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have another solution.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019re going to have to find one. That\u2019s why I pay you the big bucks.\u201d</p><p>Zeke looked cornered. \u201cRiley, the election is in less than a week. I can\u2019t fix this in a week without using Gracie. You have to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFind another way.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut...\u201d Zeke closed his mouth and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can come up with.\u201d</p><p>IT HAD BEEN forty-eight hours and Gracie still had trouble grasping the truth of the situation.</p><p>She loved Riley. Loved him. Crazy or not, he made her heart beat faster, her body tingle and when they kissed, she saw sparks. Even better, he was a great guy. She could imagine being with him always, growing old with him, having kids with him. The only thing she couldn\u2019t picture was how she was going to tell him the truth.</p><p>\u201cAfter the election,\u201d she reminded herself as she stretched the rolled fondant onto the last of the cakes. \u201cHe\u2019ll be able to deal with me then.\u201d</p><p>Until that time, she would simply bask in her newfound feelings and work on the cake for the historical society.</p><p>Her plans, and her good pans, were still at Pam\u2019s, but Gracie remembered the basic design. She\u2019d planned on a square three-layer cake in the center with smaller layer cakes spread out around. Almost like houses in a town. She\u2019d gone with a white fondant and a basket weave pattern on the sides. Simple flowers would decorate the top.</p><p>She\u2019d made a duplicate sketch from memory and consulted it now as she began decorating the cakes. Her head felt a little fuzzy, as if she hadn\u2019t been getting enough sleep. Which was partially true, but not enough to make her feel so weird.</p><p>Maybe it was Riley withdrawal, she thought with a smile. They\u2019d been talking several times a day on the phone, but he\u2019d been so caught up in election stuff that he hadn\u2019t been able to stop by. Too bad\u2014she was going to need another fix soon.</p><p>The strips of basket weaving went on easily. Gracie had created cakes like this dozens of times before. The roses were all prepared. When she finished the basket weave, she would anchor them in place.</p><p>Over the next few hours, the cake came together, even as her body seemed to be falling apart. Her head ached, her body felt heavy. Putting on the final roses seemed to take every bit of her concentration.</p><p>Finally she had the separate cakes in pink boxes and ready for delivery. She carefully put the boxes in the refrigerator so that she could take them over in the morning. She closed the door and felt the room tilt. Not a good sign.</p><p>Gracie checked to make sure the oven was off, then made her way to the bedroom where she collapsed onto the bed. A voice in her head said she should at least kick off her shoes or get under the covers, but then she got very, very sleepy and very, very weak and the whole world just faded away.</p><p>GRACIE WASN\u2019T SURE what time it was when she woke up. The room wouldn\u2019t stop spinning and she couldn\u2019t believe that she was both burning up and shivering. Her mouth was dry, her body ached and she really wanted someone to shoot her and put her out of her misery.</p><p>Instead she did her best to stare at the clock and try to figure out if it was the next day or not. There was sunshine. Had it been sunny when she\u2019d taken a header on the bed?</p><p>When the swirling numbers refused to focus, she forced herself to her feet where she staggered through the house until she found her cell phone and called a number she\u2019d only recently put in her directory.</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley?\u201d It hurt to talk. Her throat felt as if she\u2019d been snacking on fire.</p><p>\u201cGracie? Is that you? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just...\u201d She shuffled to a chair and sank onto the seat. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very good. I have a bug, or something. I can\u2019t....\u201d Rational thought faded. What was her point? Oh, yeah. \u201cThe cake. Is it Saturday?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMost of the day.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Good. I haven\u2019t missed it.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t missed it. Why did that line sound familiar? It was from a movie, she thought hazily. Yeah. A movie she liked. She closed her eyes and concentrated.</p><p>\u201cA Christmas Carol,\u201d she said triumphantly. \u201cI haven\u2019t missed it. The spirits have done it all in one night.\u201d</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the phone.</p><p>\u201cHow sick are you?\u201d Riley asked.</p><p>\u201cNot a clue. But the cake has to go to the historical society. I can\u2019t take it. Can you take it? Can you take it and set it up? Can you take it and set it up and make sure it\u2019s okay?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Stop trying to talk. Do you have any food? Are you eating?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy tuna salad, but I had a bunch yesterday and I don\u2019t want any more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAre you drinking?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot sure liquor\u2019s the answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously not. I\u2019ll stop and bring by supplies. Give me an hour.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll just be here.\u201d She closed her eyes. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll go back to bed.\u201d She touched her hot face. \u201cI don\u2019t think I look very good. I might have to throw up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can handle it. Just try to rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. No problem.\u201d</p><p>The phone slipped from her fingers. Gracie thought about trying to pick it up but the ground was so far away. When had it gotten so far away?</p><p>\u201cLast week,\u201d she said as she pushed to her feet. She swayed for a second, then made her way back to her bedroom where she did her best to get out of her clothes. The shirt was easy, as was the bra. But her pants proved insurmountable, so she left them on, along with her socks. She\u2019d already lost her shoes somewhere.</p><p>She dug a nightgown out of a drawer, although the act of bending over nearly had her passing out. She managed to pull the nightgown over her head, then she had to fall onto the bed and sleep.</p><p>She came awake to the sound of someone pounding on the door. The loudness of the banging, along with the semi-frantic speed told her that whoever it was had been at it for a while.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d she said, though her voice sounded faint and scratchy. She pushed into a sitting position, then forced herself to her feet. Once there it wasn\u2019t too hard to sort of walk and bump her way along the hallway wall.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like pinball,\u201d she said with a giggle as she reached for the front door. \u201cI want extra points.\u201d</p><p>That statement was made as Riley pushed inside. \u201cPoints for what?\u201d he asked as he looked her over, then touched her face. \u201cYou have a fever.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d She pointed at the bag in his arms. \u201cWhattcha got? Something for me?\u201d</p><p>She took a step forward, intending to look inside the bag. But somehow her feet got caught or didn\u2019t move or something because she was falling and falling and there didn\u2019t seem to be a way to stop herself.</p><p>Then big strong arms scooped her up and she was flying down the hall and into her bedroom.</p><p>\u201cTylenol for fever,\u201d Riley said as he set her on the mattress. \u201cI called Diane and asked. Then I bought some. And soup. But I don\u2019t think I should leave you alone.\u201d</p><p>She sank back on the bed and sighed. \u201cThen you should stay. It\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Her eyes slowly closed for a second, before she forced them open again. \u201cThe cake. You have to take the cake. It\u2019s Saturday, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cStill. Yes.\u201d He sat down next to her and brushed the hair off her forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to call your sister. Give me her number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich one?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe has more than one phone number?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? No. Which sister. Alexis. Call Alexis. But don\u2019t bother her. I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><p>She read off the number. Riley punched it into his cell phone and started speaking. Gracie did her best to listen. She wanted to tell him not to bother, that she would survive on her own. Had he brought soup? Was there soup?</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019ll be here in a couple of hours,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll wait.\u201d</p><p>That sounded good to her, except...\u201cThe cake. Just take it over now, please. They\u2019ve got to be worried. It\u2019s in boxes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMore than one?\u201d</p><p>She nodded, then wished she hadn\u2019t when her head began to ache. \u201cFive. I was going to connect them like a street thing. You know. A map or whatever, but just set them out so they look nice. There are five boxes. Did I say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. Why are you wearing your jeans under your nightgown?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey were too hard to get off.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help with that.\u201d</p><p>He bent over her and quickly removed her jeans, then pulled down her nightgown.</p><p>\u201cSlide under the covers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tuck you in.\u201d</p><p>She liked the sound of that. She liked having him around. In the back of her mind, a thought nagged, but she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. Was she supposed to tell him something? Or was she keeping a secret?</p><p>\u201cHow\u2019s the campaign going?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t look at her as he spoke, which made her wonder if he was telling the truth. Was there\u2014</p><p>Oh! She loved him! That was it. The secret. She found herself wanting to blurt it out right now. To say the words and see how he reacted. If he cared about her, maybe it would be a good thing. Maybe\u2014</p><p>\u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>She heard him speak her name, but the sounds came from far, far away. Her eyes were far too heavy to open. Everything was heavy. And hot. And just too...</p><p>GRACIE ROLLED OVER and found herself drenched. Her body was cold and chilled, her nightgown soaked. Her eyes popped open and she looked around, half expecting to see the ocean in her bedroom.</p><p>Instead Alexis sat on a chair in the corner. She looked up and smiled. \u201cAre you sane again?\u201d</p><p>Gracie blinked at her. \u201cWhen wasn\u2019t I?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve been out of it ever since I got here. Riley said he got a couple of Tylenol down you and I guess they kicked in. Or you beat the fever. You were burning up for a while. How do you feel now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike I just fell into a pool.\u201d</p><p>Alexis stood and walked to the bed. \u201cThat means the fever\u2019s broken. Good for you.\u201d She touched her sister\u2019s forehead. \u201cYup. Cool to the touch. Are you hungry?\u201d</p> <p>Gracie considered the question. \u201cStarving. I don\u2019t remember falling asleep. I don\u2019t remember much of anything. Oh. The cake for the historical society.\u201d</p><p>\u201cRiley\u2019s taking care of it. You called him. Remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot really.\u201d She had a few hazy images that were more dreamlike than anything else. \u201cWhatever bug I picked up was strong, but short-lived. I think I\u2019m okay now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take it easy? I\u2019ll go fix some soup and toast for you.\u201d Alexis fingered the damp sheets. \u201cCan you move to the sofa? You can lay down there and I\u2019ll change these later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do all that for me. It\u2019s the weekend. What about Zeke? Shouldn\u2019t you be with him?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. He\u2019s working all day on Riley\u2019s campaign then picking me up about six so I can go with him to see him do stand-up at a club in Ventura tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like fun.\u201d</p><p>Gracie sat up and tested her equilibrium. The walls and floor stayed exactly where they were supposed to. She felt tired and a little weak, but otherwise, fine.</p><p>Alexis helped her to her feet, then led her to the sofa in the living room. As she went to work in the kitchen, Gracie had the thought that she wouldn\u2019t have expected her sister to come through for her like this. Which just went to show that she\u2019d pretty much been wrong about every member of her family. Maybe in the future she should simply let them be and not try to predict or assign value judgments.</p><p>\u201cWhat does Zeke have to do today for Riley?\u201d she asked as Alexis puttered in the kitchen. \u201cAre they still going door-to-door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot exactly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? The election is in a few days.\u201d</p><p>There was a long silence, as if Alexis was considering what to say. The longer her sister was quiet, the more Gracie began to wonder what she didn\u2019t know.</p><p>\u201cAlexis,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEverything is great. Really.\u201d</p><p>Uh-huh. As if Gracie would believe that high, tight voice. \u201cYou\u2019re not a good liar. Tell me.\u201d</p><p>Alexis appeared in the doorway. \u201cZeke wasn\u2019t supposed to say anything to me. If Riley knew I knew, he would never have asked me to come over.\u201d</p> <p>Gracie\u2019s stomach tightened and it had nothing to do with acid or lack of food. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>Her sister shifted her weight from foot to foot. \u201cJust that Riley\u2019s poll numbers are really down. They went up when everyone thought the two of you were together, but since the debate, they\u2019ve been falling. The people in town are taking your side in this, which is really nice for you. But they hate Riley because, well, you know.\u201d</p><p>Gracie didn\u2019t know but she could guess. Because of those stupid newspaper stories, half the town felt as if they knew her. Now, all these years later, Riley was the bad guy for not falling in love with her and giving her what they thought was her happy ending.</p><p>Of course the irony of the situation was that she really was in love with Riley and she wanted to be with him, but that was her business, not theirs.</p><p>\u201cIs he going to lose?\u201d Gracie asked quietly.</p><p>Alexis nodded.</p><p>Ninety-seven million dollars gone because of her.</p><p>\u201cI have to fix this,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll go talk to him when he\u2019s done delivering the cake and we\u2019ll come up with something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a miracle,\u201d Alexis told her.</p><p>Gracie wished she had one of those in the corner of her suitcase. As she was fresh out, she would have to think of something else.</p><p>THERE WERE SEVERAL security guards on duty at the large house on the hill. Riley had never paid much attention to the historic value of some of the older homes in Los Lobos, but now as he walked up the wide front steps, he felt as if he were stepping back in history.</p><p>The Victorian mansion had been restored to its original fussiness. Rockers and tables were scattered across the long front porch. Flowers decorated the pillars.</p><p>\u201cCan I help you?\u201d a rent-a-cop said from his position by the front door.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m delivering the cake for the fund-raiser tonight,\u201d Riley said, motioning to the large box in his arms. \u201cThere are four more of these in my car.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure thing. Go on up. Then drive around back and use the rear entrance. It\u2019ll be closer for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Riley jerked his head to the three guards by the driveway and the two security vans set up by the fence. \u201cWhy all the firepower?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA lot of items are on loan,\u201d the guard told him. \u201cApparently they\u2019re worth so much, the insurance company insisted.\u201d He grinned. \u201cSo don\u2019t try anything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot me. I\u2019m just the guy with the cake.\u201d</p><p>Riley followed his directions to the main reception area in the ballroom on the second floor. As he walked into the huge open room, he saw the tables set up for the buffet, two bars and a lace covered table complete with several pink bakery boxes.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d he muttered as he walked closer.</p><p>He set down his box and looked at the others. It was a cake. One that looked amazingly similar to the one Gracie had baked. Nearly identical. The same basket weave on the side, the same flowers. Except, now that he looked more closely, he saw the weave was crooked and the individual pieces of it were poorly done and broken. The flowers looked as if they\u2019d spent one too many nights out on the town.</p><p>Questions crowded his brain. Who had done this and why?</p><p>Riley moved his box to the edge of the table and crossed to the window overlooking the rear of his property. Just then a familiar Lexus sped down the driveway.</p><p>Pam! He swore long and loud, then reached for his cell. Gracie picked up on the first ring. \u201cHow you feeling?\u201d he asked.</p><p>\u201cBetter. The fever\u2019s gone. Alexis has fed me and I just had a shower. I think I\u2019ll live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know. I have a situation here. I\u2019m delivering the cake, but there\u2019s already one here. I also just spotted Pam heading away from the scene of the crime.\u201d</p><p>Gracie gasped. \u201cIs that what she was doing with my cake pans? Making a cake for the benefit? But why? And how does it look?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLike crap. I don\u2019t get it. What\u2019s the point? This can\u2019t be to get her business. No one will know she baked it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, but they\u2019ll think I did. Taste it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cTaste it. I have to know if it\u2019s horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHold on.\u201d</p><p>Riley eyed the pink boxes, then grabbed a fork from the pile by napkins and stuck it into the small layer cake close to him. He sucked in a breath, then took a bite.</p><p>\u201cJesus,\u201d he said as he spat it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSalt instead of sugar. At least I think that\u2019s it.\u201d He grabbed a paper napkin and wiped off his tongue. The horrible flavor lingered.</p><p>\u201cRiley, you have to get her cake out of there. She\u2019s trying to make sure I can never recover from the scandal about my cakes. Get hers out and put mine in its place.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWill do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCan you call me when you\u2019re done? I have something I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\u201d</p><p>Normally those were words to make him head out to sea, but not this time. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNothing. I just want to talk about the election.\u201d</p><p>Damn. \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat you\u2019re in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d</p><p>He eyed the table. \u201cLook, I need to get the cakes changed. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m done, then come by. Fair enough?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great. Thanks.\u201d</p><p>He clicked off his cell phone and dropped it into his pocket. Then he collected two of the small boxes from Pam\u2019s cake and carried them back to his car.</p><p>It took him three more trips to get Gracie\u2019s cake inside. He set it up as best he could and was leaving with the largest layer of Pam\u2019s cake when a guard met him at the top of the stairs.</p><p>\u201cNot so fast,\u201d the burly man said. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA cake. Two were delivered by mistake.\u201d</p><p>The other man didn\u2019t look convinced. \u201cWe just got a call that someone would try to trade out the cakes as a joke. Something about the election and one of the candidates wanting to make a fuss.\u201d His eyes narrowed. \u201cFunny how you just happen to look like that guy running for mayor.\u201d</p><p>Riley couldn\u2019t believe it. Pam had sure as hell covered her bases on this one.</p><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t what you think,\u201d Riley said as he tried to inch his way around the guard. \u201cThe new cake is in place and it\u2019s delicious. Take a bite of it if you don\u2019t believe me. This is the bad cake.\u201d He held out the box in his hands. \u201cBig mistake to eat this one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou just hold it right there. I\u2019m going to have to call this in.\u201d The guard reached for his walkie-talkie and pushed a button.</p><p>Riley tried to judge the distance to the front door and wondered if he could make a run for it. When he heard the guy on the other end of the conversation say \u201cHold him,\u201d he knew he didn\u2019t have a choice.</p><p>He started down the stairs, noticing too late that someone was coming up the stairs\u2014a big guy carrying a case of wine. Riley went left, the guy went right. They ended up on the same step and tried to avoid the crash.</p><p>It happened anyway. The impact knocked Riley off his feet. He grabbed for the railing, slipped and reached for it again. The cake went flying. The other guy lost control of the box of wine. Riley and the other man fell at the same time, bouncing down the stairs in a tangle of arms and legs.</p><p>When they hit the ground, they landed onto wine-soaked cake and a floor full of glass.</p><p>Every part of him hurt. Riley knew this couldn\u2019t be good, an opinion that was confirmed when he heard sirens in the distance and getting closer.</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY</p><p>THE CELL PHONE woke Gracie early the next morning. Her first thought was that whatever bug had gripped her had been firmly squashed. The second was that Riley had never called or come by. Was this him?</p><p>\u201cHello?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGracie, it\u2019s Mom. Have you seen the paper?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHuh? No.\u201d She rolled over in bed. At least she knew this time whatever scandal it was couldn\u2019t be about her. She hadn\u2019t left the house in two days.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Riley,\u201d her mother said. \u201cHe was arrested.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat? Are you kidding?\u201d</p><p>She scrambled out of the bed and hurried to the front door. After flinging it open, she raced to the edge of the porch where the morning paper waited. A quick glance at the headline had her cringing.</p><p>\u201cMayoral Candidate Arrested for Drunk and Disorderly Conduct.\u201d</p><p>The picture showed Riley covered with cake and surrounded by broken wine bottles in the foyer of the historic mansion.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to throw up,\u201d she whispered as she walked back inside and closed the door. \u201cThis is all my fault.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were sick in bed. Alexis told me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExactly. I got sick so Riley took the cake over for me. Only Pam had already been there to put a nasty-tasting cake in its place. He was helping me out and somehow things went wrong.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen I guess you\u2019re going to have to fix them. How can I help?\u201d</p><p>The support made her eyes burn. \u201cI don\u2019t know, but as soon as I figure something out, I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting. We\u2019re here for you, Gracie. I want you to know that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI appreciate it, Mom. I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d</p><p>She hung up and quickly punched in Riley\u2019s number. Several seconds passed before he answered.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked frantically. \u201cI just saw the paper. What happened?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI just got home and I need to take a shower,\u201d he said. \u201cCome on over and I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d</p><p>She had a thousand questions, the first one being why he was just getting home.</p> <p>\u201cThey kept you in jail?\u201d she asked, outraged.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOkay. Go take your shower. I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave the front door open.\u201d</p><p>Gracie dressed in record time and made her way to Riley\u2019s house. She felt a little weak, but a big breakfast should take care of that, she thought. After parking in the driveway\u2014at this point what did it matter if anyone saw her car there\u2014she walked inside and headed upstairs.</p><p>She found Riley in his bedroom. He\u2019d already showered and shaved and was just pulling on jeans as she walked in.</p> <p>After a brief thought that she was sorry to have missed the good part of watching him dress, she moved close and hugged him.</p><p>\u201cThis is all my fault, and I\u2019m really, really sorry.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her against him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you. It was Pam and circumstances. Don\u2019t blame yourself.\u201d He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her.</p><p>The melty sensation began instantly, but Gracie told herself this wasn\u2019t the time to get distracted. There were too many other things to worry about.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked when he drew back. \u201cHow did you end up covered in cake? And who arrested you? And why didn\u2019t you get home until this morning?\u201d</p><p>He released her and picked up a shirt on the bed. After shrugging into it, he started on the buttons.</p><p>\u201cOne of the guards figured out I was taking out a cake as well as bringing one in. Someone had called to warn security I might try to pull something.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI saw Pam driving away, which means she saw my car. I\u2019m guessing she made the call to get me in trouble and it worked perfectly. The guards tried to detain me, I didn\u2019t want to stay. What I didn\u2019t see was the liquor guy coming up the stairs. We collided and both went down. The wine broke and we fell in it and the cake.\u201d</p><p>Her breath caught. \u201cWhat about all that glass? Are you hurt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA few cuts. Nothing serious. Then the deputies arrived to take me away. There was enough blood that we had to stop by the hospital first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBlood? Where?\u201d</p><p>He pulled up his shirt and turned so she could see the bandages on his back. There were five and none were very big.</p><p>\u201cDid they have to pick any glass out?\u201d She asked, feeling more horrible by the second.</p><p>\u201cSome. I have a couple of stitches.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</p><p>He dropped the shirt and set his hands on her shoulders. \u201cNot your fault. Remember that. This is Pam\u2019s doing and by God, she\u2019s going to pay.\u201d</p><p>Gracie wanted to ask how, but she had other, more pressing questions.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Mac release you right away?\u201d</p><p>Riley tucked in his shirt. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t on duty and the damned deputies wouldn\u2019t call him. They didn\u2019t want me to call anyone either. They finally did let me and I got in touch with Zeke who drove out to Mac\u2019s house, but he wasn\u2019t there. Apparently Mac and Jill went out of town for the night. Zeke called around to hotels in Santa Barbara until he found them. Mac drove back and let me out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I slept through the whole thing,\u201d Gracie said mournfully.</p><p>\u201cYou were sick. Alexis left when you fell asleep. Don\u2019t sweat it,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m fine now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo how are we going to get Pam?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cToo bad she\u2019s a woman. If she was a guy I\u2019d just go beat the shit out of her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe could confront her and threaten her. That would be good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSounds like a plan,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have your camera in your car, just in case we find something interesting?\u201d</p><p>She grinned. \u201cYou bet.\u201d</p><p>They drove to Pam\u2019s house and parked right in front.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care who knows we\u2019re here,\u201d Riley said as he climbed out.</p><p>Gracie agreed and followed him to the front door, which was standing ajar.</p><p>They both stared at the slight crack of space just begging to be entered.</p><p>\u201cIs it a setup?\u201d Gracie asked in a whisper. \u201cIs she going to have us arrested for breaking and entering?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProve that it wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said, nodding to her camera.</p><p>\u201cOh. Great idea.\u201d</p><p>She snapped a picture of the half-open door, then winced at the loud click and whirr of the picture being shot out. She grabbed it and handed the picture to Riley to shove it in his jeans back pocket. Then he pushed the door open wider and they stepped inside.</p><p>Gracie\u2019s first impression was of elegant furnishings and plenty of light. \u201cNice house,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>Riley shot her a glance that said this wasn\u2019t the time to be discussing Pam\u2019s decorating ability, then motioned to her to follow him. He pointed to the hall.</p><p>Gracie wondered why until she heard a faint sound. A faint rhythmic sound that was familiar. And intimate.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s doing it!\u201d she whispered. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to see who the guy is. Whoever he is, he\u2019s helping her!\u201d</p><p>Riley pressed a finger to his lips and led the way. The noises got louder. There was heavy breathing, a cry of \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m close,\u201d from Pam, then a low groan.</p><p>\u201cGet ready,\u201d Riley mouthed, pointing to the camera.</p><p>They paused outside the half-closed bedroom door for a second, then Riley pushed it open and rushed inside.</p><p>Several things happened at once. As Gracie followed, the couple on the bed noticed the intrusion. Pam screamed, which made Gracie jump and maybe scream a little, too. But she was careful to keep her camera positioned.</p><p>Through the tiny lens she got an eyeful of Pam\u2019s breasts, some guy\u2019s back and then the guy turned and she found herself staring directly at the still-erect private parts of Franklin Yardley.</p><p>\u201cOh, yuck,\u201d she yelled, even as she started clicking pictures.</p><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d the mayor demanded.</p><p>He grabbed for the blanket, jerking it off the bed, but not before Gracie got several pictures of him and Pam in what could only be described as compromising circumstances. The ever-lovely Mrs. Yardley was not going to like this.</p><p>Riley was careful to catch the pictures as they popped out of the camera.</p><p>\u201cInteresting,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cIt\u2019s about time someone else starred in the local paper. I\u2019m getting tired of all the notoriety.\u201d</p><p>Yardley grabbed for the pictures, but Riley kept them out of reach.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d Yardley said.</p><p>\u201cHow?\u201d Riley asked. \u201cA picture\u2019s worth a thousand words.\u201d He looked at Pam, who had pulled the sheet up over her breasts. \u201cWhen did your taste get so lousy?\u201d</p><p>She glared at him. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about lousy taste, you bastard. You\u2019re the one sleeping with Gracie.\u201d Her face tightened and her voice rose. \u201cHow could you want that bitch?\u201d</p><p>Gracie jumped. \u201cI\u2019m not a bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting and horrible,\u201d Pam yelled. \u201cI hate you. Do you hear me? I hate you. I hate everything about you. I wish you were dead. You ruined my life. All those damn articles back when we were in high school. Everyone thought you were so sweet and I was just the whore who wanted to marry Riley for the money. You ruined my wedding. It was supposed to be my day, do you hear me? My day. And it was all about you. All everyone could talk about was Gracie Landon. \u2018Do you think she\u2019ll show up?\u2019\u201d Pam said in a mock high voice. \u201c\u2018What will precious Gracie do\u2019?\u201d</p><p>Pam narrowed her eyes. \u201cI wanted you punished back then, but I couldn\u2019t find you. So I waited and planned and I\u2019ve got you now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam!\u201d Yardley move away from the bed. \u201cYou\u2019re unbalanced. What have you done?\u201d</p><p>Pam turned on him. \u201cWhat?\u201d she shrieked. \u201cOh, don\u2019t you dare pretend you weren\u2019t in on this from the beginning.\u201d</p><p>Yardley\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cI swear, I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about. Pam, have you broken the law?\u201d</p><p>Pam screamed. \u201cDon\u2019t you play innocent with me, you old goat. You\u2019re in this up to your eyeballs.\u201d</p><p>Yardley turned to Gracie. \u201cI swear, I have no idea what she\u2019s talking about.\u201d</p><p>Pam swore. \u201cFine. If that\u2019s the way you want to play it.\u201d She turned on Riley. \u201cOh, this is good. I might have to go down, but I\u2019m taking your precious Gracie with me.\u201d She swung her attention to Gracie.</p><p>\u201cI ruined you,\u201d she said with glee. \u201cI ruined your precious business and now you have nothing.\u201d She turned back to Riley. \u201cI\u2019ve ruined you, too and I\u2019m glad. You know why? Because when you left me, you said Gracie was right. I\u2019ve never forgiven you for that.\u201d</p><p>Gracie turned to Riley. \u201cYou said that?\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. \u201cYou were.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow.\u201d</p><p>Pam screamed. \u201cI never got a penny out of that divorce and I want my money now. Do you hear me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cBe quiet. You\u2019re obviously not feeling well. I had no idea you were harboring all of this anger.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnger?\u201d Pam started screaming and crying and laughing. Gracie wondered if she had gone over the edge.</p><p>\u201cI hate you both,\u201d she said as she sank back on the bed. \u201cDammit, I worked so hard. I hate you all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam!\u201d Yardley sounded shocked. \u201cI don\u2019t know you anymore.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, like you ever did,\u201d Pam said, sounding defiant. \u201cI only ever slept with you because you\u2019re getting most of the estate when Riley fails. I was planning to take half of it and run as soon as we were married.\u201d She looked at Riley. \u201cHe keeps a separate set of books in his office. He has a secret drawer in his desk. He\u2019s been skimming money for years.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPam, no!\u201d Yardley protested.</p><p>She stood and jerked the sheet free, then wrapped it around herself. \u201cI nearly got everything.\u201d She glared at Gracie. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re feeling fine.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure. Why would you...\u201d Gracie stared at her, remembering her sudden illness. \u201cWhat did you do to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMixed some very old mayonnaise in your stupid tuna salad. My God, how can you eat that? It smells like cat food. I wanted to get you out of the way and I did. I planned everything.\u201d She kicked Yardley. \u201cUntil you messed it all up. I\u2019ll never forgive you.\u201d</p><p>Riley took Gracie\u2019s arm. \u201cThis is our cue to leave.\u201d</p><p>Yardley stared at Pam as if he\u2019d never seen her. \u201cBut I loved you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. That\u2019s why you screwed all your assistants. You\u2019re old and you can barely get it up and you\u2019re lousy in bed.\u201d She turned her attention to Riley. \u201cYou\u2019re crap in the sack, too.\u201d</p><p>With that she stomped into the bathroom, closed the door and clicked the lock.</p><p>Riley led Gracie out of the bedroom. She couldn\u2019t believe all that she\u2019d heard.</p><p>\u201cIt was them all the time,\u201d she said, feeling as if she\u2019d just watched a very intense live show. \u201cThe photographer, the cake mixes. Everything.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLooks that way.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe tried to poison me and it worked. I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sure the sheriff will want to talk to her about that.\u201d</p> <p>She glanced at him as he walked them out of the house. \u201cYou\u2019re not really lousy in bed.\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>BACK AT HIS HOUSE, Riley fixed a pot of coffee and then spread the pictures out on the long kitchen counter. There was plenty of evidence\u2014unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the kind he could use.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to call Mac, right?\u201d Gracie asked as she took the mug he offered and sipped. \u201cHe can arrest Yardley today. And Pam, although I care less about her. We\u2019ll ignore the sexual stuff, because sleeping with his assistants is gross but not illegal, but he\u2019s been stealing money for years. Isn\u2019t that great?\u201d</p><p>\u201cUh-huh.\u201d</p> <p>He turned his back on the pictures and stared out the window at the large backyard.</p><p>Funny how he\u2019d hated this house when he\u2019d first arrived in Los Lobos. The big space had represented everything he\u2019d hated about his uncle. But in the past few months, he\u2019d grown to like the house. The room, the quiet. Just as he liked the bank. He enjoyed working with numbers, making things right for people. He enjoyed the challenges of playing the funding market, getting the best deal for his customers. He would miss it.</p><p>Gracie shook his arm. \u201cAre you listening to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>He looked at her face, at the dark blue of her eyes, the easy smile, the way she lit up when they were together. He couldn\u2019t think of a single thing he didn\u2019t like about her. She was...perfect. Or at least perfect for him.</p> <p>\u201cI was saying that as soon as the mayor is charged, you have to go on the radio and talk to the town. You can tell everyone it will be a smooth transition and they\u2019ll really like having you as mayor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYardley\u2019s accused me of some things. Now I\u2019m going to accuse him of worse things. Who are the voters going to believe? Someone they\u2019ve known for sixteen years, or me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the charges.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll take a couple of days to get him formally charged by the D.A. It\u2019s Sunday. Nothing\u2019s going to happen until well into next week and the election\u2019s Tuesday. Yardley can stall long enough to tell everyone the truth about my uncle\u2019s will. Once they know why I\u2019m running, do you think they\u2019ll care about what he\u2019s been doing? It\u2019s all true, Gracie. I was only doing it for the money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut...but...No! We have to come up with a way.\u201d She set down her coffee and grabbed his arm. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked so hard. I won\u2019t let this happen to you. Can\u2019t you want to stay and be mayor? You could say you\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201d</p><p>He smiled at her. \u201cI have, but who\u2019s going to believe me?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI will. I\u2019ll\u2014\u201d She opened her mouth, then closed it. Color flooded her face. \u201cMarry me. That\u2019s what the town wants. Their happy ending. So marry me. We\u2019ll have Jill draw up some papers right now. I don\u2019t want any of your money and I\u2019ll say that in writing. We\u2019ll get married today. We can fly to Vegas and be back tonight. Then we make a big announcement tomorrow. You\u2019ll win for sure. Then we can split up later. It could work.\u201d</p><p>She was so damned earnest, he thought. Bright and willing to do anything to help.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s ninety-seven million dollars,\u201d she said.</p><p>\u201cI know the amount.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen?\u201d</p><p>He\u2019d been feeling something for a long time. A vague feeling he couldn\u2019t identify until just that second.</p><p>He tucked her hair behind her ears and kissed her.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Gracie Landon,\u201d he said quietly.</p><p>She stared at him. \u201cW-what?\u201d</p><p>He grinned. \u201cI love you. You\u2019re the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever met. You lead with your heart and I admire that. I want to marry you, have babies with you and grow old with you.\u201d</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak and he pressed his fingers against her lips.</p><p>\u201cBut I won\u2019t agree to anything until after the election.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d The word came out as a yelp. \u201cAre you crazy? Why are you waiting?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want you to ever wonder if I just did it for the money.\u201d</p><p>She covered her face with her hands. \u201cThis is not happening,\u201d she said, then dropped her hands. \u201cRiley, listen to me. We can announce our engagement.\u201d She grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cI love you, too. I have for a long time. Maybe fourteen years, I don\u2019t know. I love you so much, I will not let you throw this away. It\u2019s ninety-seven million dollars. It\u2019s this house and the bank and I know you\u2019ve started to care about the town. You want to stay here and settle down. We can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have money.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money.\u201d She grabbed him by his shoulders and tried to shake him. \u201cIt\u2019s about your heritage and belonging and having roots.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have money from the oil rigs.\u201d</p><p>He loved her intensity and how much she wanted to convince him. Funny how she hadn\u2019t figured out she was all he needed.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about the money,\u201d she repeated. \u201cI have a good business. At least I had one. I can rebuild it. I\u2019ll make Pam issue a statement or something. I know I can do it. Anyway, that\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s about having choices. Don\u2019t walk away from this without trying.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about trying,\u201d he said. \u201cI meant what I said. I love you and I don\u2019t want you to ever have to question that.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t believe it. She had water on her brain or something. \u201cIt\u2019s ninety-seven million dollars. No one is worth that.\u201d</p><p>He pulled her close and kissed her. \u201cYou are. I\u2019ll come find you Tuesday night, after the polls close. I\u2019ll get down on one knee and propose and you\u2019d better be prepared to say yes.\u201d</p><p>GRACIE DIDN\u2019T REMEMBER driving home. Luckily there weren\u2019t many other cars on the road and she arrived unscathed. She felt battered and numb and in total and complete shock.</p><p>Riley loved her. He\u2019d said so about fifteen times and had promised to propose. She felt all warm and happy inside. They were going to be together.</p><p>But at the same time, she battled outrage and indignation. How could he be willing to walk away from everything just to prove he wasn\u2019t marrying her for the money? She knew that. She would always know that.</p><p>It was completely stupid and pigheaded and male for him to turn his back on his inheritance.</p><p>She walked into the house and pulled her cell phone out of her purse, then she pushed in a number. Dealing with Pam\u2019s poisoning attempt and the sheriff\u2019s office would come later. First, she had important business to deal with.</p><p>\u201cHi, Mom, it\u2019s me. I need your help. Vivian\u2019s and Alexis\u2019s, too, and we don\u2019t have much time. Can you get them to come over in half an hour? I need to call Jill and a few other people. Uh-huh. I\u2019ll explain it when I get there. Oh, do you know anyone at the newspaper office?\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</p><p>RILEY SPENT the rest of Sunday by himself. Gracie had called to say she wasn\u2019t feeling well and wanted to rest. Although he\u2019d wanted to go over and see her, he wanted her better more so he\u2019d stayed away.</p><p>In the afternoon he\u2019d driven down to Santa Barbara and looked at engagement rings. He\u2019d wanted to find just the right one for Gracie. Something beautiful and special.</p><p>He\u2019d found it in the fourth store he\u2019d gone to and now it sat on his dresser until after the election when he could propose for real.</p><p>Funny how he\u2019d never thought he would get married. He\u2019d assumed he would live his life alone. Two months ago if someone had told him he would fall in love with Gracie Landon, he would have punched the guy. But she\u2019d swept into his world and had changed everything\u2014most of all, him.</p><p>Monday morning he woke up early and collected the paper. The mayor\u2019s arrest was front-page news. Riley grinned as he read the start of the article. He might have lost the election but at least Yardley would be doing some serious time in jail. He had a feeling things wouldn\u2019t go so well for the mayor once he was there.</p><p>There was a separate article on Pam where she confessed to messing with Gracie and planting the cake boxes in her car. If Riley knew the good citizens of Los Lobos, they would make sure Pam wasn\u2019t ever able to live here again.</p><p>So they would all be leaving, he thought as he drank his coffee. He would miss the town. It had finally begun to feel like home to him. But without the bank, he didn\u2019t have anything to keep him here. It wasn\u2019t as if he could set up an oil rig in the center square.</p><p>He studied the picture of the mayor being led into the sheriff\u2019s office. No doubt the news would lose the older man a few votes, but not enough. If Riley had taken Gracie up on her offer and married her, he would have had the election nailed. Not that he would have. Yeah, it was a lot of money, but she was more important. He\u2019d never been in love before and by God, he was going to do it right.</p><p>He turned to the second page and nearly spit the coffee he\u2019d just sipped. Instead of a recap of local, state and national news, there was a two page ad with Gracie\u2019s face smack in the middle. Across the top, huge print proclaimed: I Need Your Help To Get My Man!</p><p>Riley swore. What had she done now? He scanned the text, which was a letter addressed to the town.</p><p>Dear Los Lobos,</p><p>It\u2019s me. Gracie. I know most of you remember me from those articles in the paper, both fourteen years ago and recently. The ones about my crush on Riley Whitefield. You followed the tragic story of my unrequited love and felt my pain when it ended with Riley marrying another woman.</p><p>So here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m still in love with Riley and I want to marry him. And you know the best part? He loves me, too. But he has this crazy idea he can\u2019t propose until after the election.</p><p>Riley is a great guy. He\u2019ll be terrific for this town and honestly, I want to be with him here...in Los Lobos. But for that to happen, I need your help. I need you to vote for Riley on Tuesday.</p><p>You\u2019ve always been proud of the fact that I loved with my whole heart. That hasn\u2019t changed. The only thing different this time is I\u2019d like you to be part of that. I\u2019m pulling off the biggest stunt of my life and I can\u2019t do it without you. If you\u2019ve ever rooted for me and Riley, please vote for him on Tuesday.</p><p>Thanks, Gracie.</p><p>He read it twice, then set his coffee on the counter and picked up the phone. Of course Gracie didn\u2019t answer.</p><p>Five minutes later he was dressed and out of the house. As he drove toward her place, he saw hundreds of Gracie Says Vote For Riley posters and flyers plastered everywhere.</p><p>He made it to her house in record time, but she wasn\u2019t there. He tried her mom\u2019s house, then headed to the bank. Could she have done this and then left town?</p><p>But as he drove up to the bank, he saw a huge banner hanging from the side of the old building. Gracie Says Vote For Riley flapped in the morning breeze. Waiting in front were all his employees, Zeke, Gracie\u2019s mom and sisters and Gracie herself.</p><p>She walked to his car, then stood on the sidewalk while he shut off the engine and stepped out.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked, sounding more than a little nervous.</p><p>God, she looked great. \u201cThat you\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood crazy or bad crazy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a difference?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, sure. I was bad crazy before, when I stalked you. I like to think I\u2019ve changed.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t change for me. I love everything about you.\u201d He nodded at the banner. \u201cWhy did you do this?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBecause you want to be mayor. It\u2019s not all about the money. I know you can do a good job and I think we could be happy here. I believe you love me, Riley. You don\u2019t have anything to prove. You\u2019ve always been a better man than you believed.\u201d</p><p>He drew her close and hugged her. Feelings flooded him\u2014feelings he\u2019d never had before. \u201cI love you. I want you to know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p> <p>He looked at her and grinned. \u201cPracticing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I be?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely. I bought you a ring.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her and in the background he heard cheering. \u201cI think I just lost my authority with the staff,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cNo, they\u2019ll work harder because they care about you.\u201d</p> <p>He kissed her again and breathed in the scent of her. \u201cMarry me, Gracie. Marry me and let me take care of you. Let me love you and prove it each and every day.\u201d</p><p>She looked into his eyes and smiled. \u201cOnly if you let me love you back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlways.\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve officially violated the three F\u2019s, big guy. They\u2019re going to throw you out of the club.\u201d</p><p>He cupped her cheeks and let himself get lost in her. \u201cThere\u2019s only one F. Falling. Falling for Gracie.\u201d</p><p>EPILOGUE</p> <p>THEY HELD the rehearsal dinner at Bill\u2019s Mexican Grill because it was Los Lobos and where else would they hold it?</p><p>\u201cWe only have a few minutes,\u201d Riley said as he glanced at his watch, then at the big television Bill had wheeled into their private banquet room.</p><p>Gracie leaned against him. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Zeke is going to be on Jay Leno. Isn\u2019t that the best?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great,\u201d he said, although not his idea of the best. The best was being with Gracie. He would marry her in the morning, and then they would fly to Hawaii for a romantic, albeit short, honeymoon. They had to be back in five days for the swearing-in ceremony.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be called His Honor, the mayor, do I get to be Mrs. His Honor, or am I Her Honor?\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. \u201cI haven\u2019t a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d Vivian said from the far side of the table. \u201cI wonder if we\u2019ll be able to see Alexis in the audience. She must be so nervous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut proud,\u201d Tom said.</p> <p>Riley glanced at the younger couple. They weren\u2019t engaged yet, but they were dating and Gracie had high hopes.</p><p>\u201cTurn up the TV,\u201d someone called.</p><p>Gracie hit the volume button on the remote, then she tucked her arm around Riley\u2019s and sighed.</p><p>\u201cYou know I love you, right?\u201d she whispered.</p><p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d</p><p>She looked at him. \u201cAbout that family we wanted to start right away....\u201d</p><p>His heart stopped. He felt the absence of thudding and everything else went still. \u201cGracie?\u201d</p><p>She leaned close and lowered her voice. \u201cI have a stick I peed on earlier. Want to see?\u201d</p><p>He started to laugh. As Zeke had just told his first joke, everyone else joined in. Riley pulled Gracie onto his lap and started to kiss her. They would tell their friends and family later. Right now it was enough to know and have her close and in love with him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d he asked, more delighted than he could say.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d She grinned. \u201cThis is going to make the town love you more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you\u2019re the one I care about.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSure, but I\u2019ll have competition. All the old ladies in town will start knitting. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe best,\u201d he said. \u201cYou always make it the best.\u201d </p> </body></html>"]
