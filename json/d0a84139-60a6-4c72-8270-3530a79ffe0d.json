And his embrace. She tried sliding out from under his arm, but he tightened his grip, mumbling something in his sleep as he threw a heavy thigh over her legs.</p><p>She sighed. So much for that idea.</p><p>Rubbing her feet together, she glanced down and edged a foot out from under the covers. One hot pink high heel shone in the morning sun.</p> <p>\u201cLeave on the shoes, babe,\u201d he had ordered.</p><p>Her dress slipped to the floor, but the shoes stayed on. \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018babe\u2019,\u201d she snapped, then went willingly into his arms.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a glorious morning,\u201d Finn said, his hand coasting down her side to cup one of her butt cheeks. \u201cDamn fine morning.\u201d He gave a little squeeze. \u201cOf course you\u2019re frowning.\u201d</p><p>Turning her attention to the sexy Irishman who\u2019d slept fully nude beside her, she allowed a smile to curve the corners of her mouth. She was really happy, ecstatic even, because he was in such a good mood. Although, it seemed Finn was always in a good mood.</p><p>In any case she had really big, scary news and wasn\u2019t sure how to tell him, but starting the day with him smiling was a good thing.</p> <p>\u201cNow that\u2019s something you don\u2019t see every day,\u201d he said, kissing her nose. \u201cI\u2019ll have to spring for a hotel room more often.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you as my date to one of my sorority sister\u2019s wedding in June. It\u2019s going to be on Jekyll Island, down in Georgia, so overnight accommodations are a must,\u201d she said and his smile disappeared. Oh, crap. She wanted to die for being so careless with her words. Still she maintained her smile. No matter what, her flipping smile would stay. It always had. One didn\u2019t have a father in politics and not learn something.</p><p>He rose above her, all lickable broad shoulders and tight abs while his sexy blue eyes studied her face. \u201cThat\u2019s sounds quite serious, Miss Billingsworth. You sure about that?\u201d</p><p>A couple of minutes ago, heck even a day ago, she would have said yes, she was totally serious about him. But now, with his serious expression and lack of smile, she had to say, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be sure about? I thought that since I\u2019d most likely be bored, you could ride along and keep me...amused.\u201d</p><p>Brows rising, he tilted his head to one side. \u201cDid you now?\u201d Before she could answer, his phone rang and he groaned. \u201cMind if I take this, babe?\u201d</p><p>A sarcastic reply almost broke free of her lips, but she tampered it down. Don\u2019t screw this up, she reminded herself. \u201cGo ahead, but stop with the \u2018babe\u2019, I hate it.\u201d Actually she loved it, but most of her girlfriends would think it was demeaning and sexist.</p> <p>She didn\u2019t give a damn, but Finn didn\u2019t need to know that.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a corker, April. A real corker,\u201d he said, kissing her softly on the lips. Grabbing the phone and sliding out of bed, he walked away, speaking softly, and her stomach did a little flip at the sight of his fine butt and hard thighs.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting,\u201d she called out in a sing-songy voice. Something the old April would have never done, but she was tired of being her.</p><p>Finn paused and turned, his eyes widening a little. That sexy mouth of his kicked up at the corners and he winked. Then he slipped inside the bathroom and shut the door behind him.</p><p>She sat up in bed, pulling the covers up and over her breasts, then tucked the sheets under her arms. Sunlight poured into their room now and she grinned like a Cheshire cat. After years of falling for the wrong guy, then falling for what on paper should have been the right one, she was in love with the \u201cone\u201d. Totally, completely in love.</p><p>Finn had been the rebound guy, but not anymore. He had become more than one night stand turned twice a week date and had morphed into serious boyfriend. Unlike the relationship with her ex-fianc\u00e9, she and Finn weren\u2019t toxic for each other. She didn\u2019t feel a need to make Finn jealous or lie to him just so she\u2019d know that she was number one.</p><p>With Finn, she was number one and he didn\u2019t keep things from her. He was a good guy, a cop or bounty hunter or something like that. She never could keep it straight, because he didn\u2019t like to talk about work. He wanted to know about her: What she liked and what she didn\u2019t.</p><p>Not that her ex hadn\u2019t been a good guy, he had been and still was one. When she\u2019d broken up with him, it had truly been an \u2018it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me\u2019 moment. She had been scared to death of getting married, of settling down and becoming another family pimped out to voters for her daddy\u2019s campaigns.</p> <p>Worse, she had been scared to death of turning out like her mother. Oh who was she kidding\u2014she still was terrified.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes and began to rehearse what she\u2019d say in her head. Finn, I know we\u2019ve only been together for four months, but\u2014</p><p>The door to the bathroom banged open. \u201cGet dressed.\u201d He picked up her clothes and threw them at her, then began to tug on his own. His movements were angry and hurried while she sat there frozen. \u201cDammit, woman. Get. Up.\u201d</p><p>April blinked at him. She\u2019d never seen Finn like this. \u201cBut...I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, there\u2019s something I\u2019ve been meaning to tell you, babe\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re married,\u201d she shrieked, her heart plummeting to her toes.</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d He made a face. \u201cI\u2019m completely single.\u201d</p><p>Okay, so not married, but did he have to sound so opposed to it? \u201cYou\u2019re not really twenty-nine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHave you been drinking this morning?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Then it hit her and she wanted to cry at the injustice. \u201cYou\u2019re gay, but you\u2019ve been told it\u2019s wrong and that if you just sleep with a woman like a \u201creal\u201d man then you\u2019d be cured. Don\u2019t listen to those people. Be yourself!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any shame in it if you were.\u201d But she would be heartbroken. Oh, good grief, gay men didn\u2019t sleep with women.</p><p>He rolled his eyes. \u201cMy brother\u2019s gay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou never told me that.\u201d She narrowed her eyes. \u201cIs it because you\u2019re ashamed of him?\u201d</p><p>His head fell back and he pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cI was his best man, at his wedding. And I\u2019m a godparent to his daughter. He adopted her, with his partner, who\u2019s a man, in case you\u2019re still assuming things about me.\u201d</p><p>She winced. \u201cSorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a strange woman sometimes, with strange ideas, but you\u2019re forgiven. Now back to the subject at hand.\u201d He placed a knee on the bed, looking around the room before fixing his blue eyes on her. \u201cI should have told you sooner. And I want you to know that what we have means something to me. It\u2019s real. Me and you are real. Together. We\u2019re good together and\u2014\u201d</p><p>She felt herself go all soft at his nonsensical speech. This was too perfect. He could admit his feelings and then she could tell him. \u201cAre you trying to say that you\u2019re in love with me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo!\u201d</p><p>She jerked back as if he\u2019d slapped her. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><p>He held up his hand. \u201cWhat I mean is that I\u2019m not sure. I could be. Maybe? I know I like you and the sex...\u201d He let out a whistle and gave her a wicked grin.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m exceptional at sex,\u201d she said with a confident smile. \u201cAnd flexible. Oh, and willing to try things.\u201d</p><p>His mouth flattened. \u201cI would agree, only I feel so bloody jealous that\u2014\u201d</p><p>Someone pounded on the door to their hotel room.</p><p>\u201cWho in the world would be\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cOpen up,\u201d a man called out, sounding vaguely familiar to April.</p><p>Finn muttered a curse, then raised his voice and said, \u201cYou remember what I told you, yeah?\u201d Without waiting for an answer, he strode to the door and yanked it open.</p><p>The governor\u2019s security team walked in, followed by their boss, her father, the current governor of North Carolina. She stifled a scream and schooled her face. \u201cCan I help you?\u201d This was more than a little humiliating.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart,\u201d Chad Billingsworth began, his blue eyes, so like hers, sad. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve been misled into believing\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I\u2019m an adult, and don\u2019t need my daddy and his men to check up on me?\u201d she asked sweetly and flicked her eyes to Finn. She wanted to mouth an \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, but that would show weakness to her father, and a Billingsworth never showed any weakness.</p><p>Finn stood to the side, pants on and shirt off. \u201cSir, I\u2019m sorry you had to find out like this.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s gaze snapped to Finn. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later.</p><p>\u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><p>Chad didn\u2019t take his eyes off of Finn. \u201cHe works for me. Or rather he did work for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not what you think, sir,\u201d Finn said, pulling on his shirt and strapping on his gun holster. Something that had never failed to give her a little thrill. \u201cYour daughter and I\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. My daughter. Someone you were paid to protect and keep tabs on, not screw in some seedy motel,\u201d her dad snapped.</p><p>\u201cThe Rise is three hundred a night,\u201d Finn shot back, but she noticed he didn\u2019t deny or correct anything else Chad had said.</p><p>Her vision suddenly got fuzzy, black spots and white lights dancing in front of her eyes. \u201cYou work for him?\u201d Her voice sounded strange, whispery light. Nausea rose, the first of its kind since she\u2019d discovered her little predicament.</p><p>\u201cYou look a little pale.\u201d Finn crossed the room, sitting beside her on the bed, where she was nude and still only had on one shoe. A less confident woman would have collapsed in tears.</p><p>She would not cry. She never cried. \u201cGet. Away. From. Me.\u201d</p><p>Blowing out a breath, Finn stood and took a step back. \u201cDon\u2019t do this, April.\u201d</p><p>She stared straight ahead, her shoulder rigid and a little haughty look on her face. How she could manage to look so in control while wearing nothing but the bed sheets was one of the things he admired about her. Mostly because when she allowed him to take control, she surrendered so completely that it humbled him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t do what, Mr. Burke?\u201d she asked, in her drop-dead-asshole voice.</p><p>Dammit. He wanted to slam his head against the nearest wall. Repeatedly. He\u2019d screwed up, plain and simple. He should have told April before they\u2019d fallen into bed together. Although, he conceded, she had had her way with him on the rug in front of her fireplace, not a bed.</p><p>Still... \u201cRemember what we talked about earlier?\u201d he asked, clenching his jaw. He did not need an audience for this. \u201cThat what we have is real and...\u201d Raking a hand through his hair, he let his words trail away and adjusted his stance. If only he could have had five more minutes alone with her. Sure, she would have been mad as hell, but at least he would have been the one doing the telling. \u201cApril, please.\u201d</p><p>Finally, finally she looked at him. He would have preferred she hadn\u2019t. Her eyes were beautifully blue and blank. Completely and utterly blank. Emotionless. \u201cYour services are no longer needed, Mr. Burke.\u201d</p><p>Chad raised his brows. \u201cI\u2019ll be sending your employer a detailed report of this incident today.\u201d</p><p>Finn shook his head. The son of bitch still didn\u2019t know. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime to go, buddy.\u201d One of the men on the governor\u2019s security team grabbed his arm.</p><p>With a simple sidestep and twist, he freed himself. \u201cNot your buddy.\u201d He gave April one last, lingering look, but she\u2019d turned her attention to the window. He\u2019d been dismissed. His gut clenched. \u201cI know the way out.\u201d</p><p>The governor and his security team watched as he gathered his things and pulled on his boots. A bright pink shoe lay haphazardly in the floor near the dresser. The urge to take that shoe, just so she had to come to him and get it, rode him hard. But the problem with dating a woman like April, rich and independent, was that she wouldn\u2019t bother. She\u2019d just buy another pair. Or three hundred.</p><p>Finn sliced his gaze to April, wishing like hell he could take her in his arms. Instead he walked out the door.</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p>Finn sat in his favorite pub, in his favorite spot, drinking his favorite pint, but it tasted like shite to him.</p><p>A month had passed, with it Christmas and New Year\u2019s, since he\u2019d last seen April. He\u2019d gone to her house on Kingston, but no one answered. He\u2019d gone to her usual hangouts: clubs where the trendy and wealthy merged together into one writhing mass of hot bodies. He\u2019d gone to her not-so-well-known hangouts, like the assisted-living community center on Oak and the food pantry at Grace Church on Aspen.</p><p>Maybe he\u2019d gone on the wrong days, or maybe she\u2019d changed her schedule so that he was running around in circles. He toasted his reflection. \u201cDeserve every bit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus H., dude, are those tears?\u201d Hunter asked as he sat down on the barstool beside Finn. He motioned for the bartender to bring him his usual.</p><p>Finn took a deep drink of his ale and slammed it down on the bar. \u201cShove off, mate.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNah, think I\u2019ll stay right here,\u201d Hunter said with a smirk. \u201cSome perps gave me shit today, so you\u2019re the winner of who\u2019s-gonna-listen-to-me-bitch.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLucky me,\u201d Finn mumbled, then grabbed a handful of peanuts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come work for Kennedy Investigations?\u201d</p><p>Hunter shook his head. \u201cHell, no. Word on the street is that the owner is a real pu\u2014\u201d</p><p>Finn made a face at his friend. \u201cShut it.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThis girl\u2019s got you all tied up, and not in a Fifty Shades kinda way either.\u201d Hunter popped a handful of peanuts in his mouth. \u201cI say it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile I say it\u2019s time for you to read How to Hold On to Your Mancards.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease, Tiffany is all about some romance and I\u2019m the beneficiary of it.\u201d Hunter grinned, his white teeth flashing against his dark skin. \u201cIn fact, I bought her an e-reader for Christmas so she didn\u2019t have to wait\u2014\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Jesus.\u201d Finn scrubbed his face with his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t actually read those with her, do you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal men read romance, Finn.\u201d</p><p>Finn chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re whipped.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBetter than being alone.\u201d Hunter pulled out his phone. \u201cText from my woman. Gotta go. She\u2019s cooking chicken and dumplings tonight, with some sweet potato casserole on the side.\u201d</p><p>Finn ticked up his chin. \u201cSee you online later?\u201d He was in the mood to virtually blow up everything and then some.</p> <p>\u201cW.oW or Call of Duty?\u201d Hunter asked as he paid his tab.</p><p>\u201cCall of Duty.\u201d</p><p>Hunter punched him on the shoulder as he strode away. \u201cGet your shit worked out with her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf only it were so easy,\u201d Finn muttered at his empty glass.</p><p>He could use Kennedy Investigations\u2019\u2019 contacts to find her. Although, that would be rather underhanded. Then again, he didn\u2019t give a shit. He wasn\u2019t stalking the woman, just making sure she was okay. And if making sure she was okay led to him \u201caccidentally\u201d running into her, well, that wasn\u2019t his fault.</p><p>Besides, was he supposed to just give up four months of amazing sex, because she said so? Jesus, he sounded like an asshole. It wasn\u2019t the amazing sex, okay so the amazing sex was just that, but he was in love with April. He was completely in love with a bossy, pain in the ass woman who never missed an opportunity to tell him what she thought.</p> <p>God, he missed her.</p><p>His vision blurred suddenly. Perhaps he shouldn\u2019t have drunk that last pint. It was number eight or nine. He paid the tab and staggered to his feet. The walk home should be interesting. He stumbled across the bar and out the door. Cold January air hit him and he stood straighter.</p><p>Another blast of arctic wind hit him. \u201cHoly shit.\u201d That was it. He was texting his driver. Pulling out his phone, he made the arrangement. Ten minutes until arrival. He could wait out here that long. Real men didn\u2019t read romance, but they sure as hell waited out in the freeze-your-nuts-off cold.</p><p>He could only imagine what April would be saying right now. \u201cGo back inside, you idiot, before you freeze to death.\u201d Such a considerate woman. His mouth kicked up at the corners.</p><p>Are you home? Shit, he just drunk-texted April.</p><p>Error Message: STOP TEXTING ME.</p><p>Whi&amp;ch actu$#ally means text me kjpd. Dammit. Stupid drunk thumbs. More</p><p>By the time his driver arrived, there was still no response from April. He nearly fell into the backseat, the driver shutting the door behind him. He blinked at his phone, then closed one eye in order to get the screen to come into focus. One last text and if she didn\u2019t respond, then he was done.</p> <p>Then he read what he\u2019d sent to her. \u201cDamn you, autocorrect!\u201d</p><p>Now she\u2019d never text him back. Hell, she might file a restraining order against him. He shoved his phone into his coat pocket, leaned against the leather seat and closed his eyes. Tomorrow, he\u2019d try again, tomorrow.</p><p>April made a face at the screen on her cell. Finn missed her hot tits? He had to be drunk.</p><p>\u201cPut down the damn phone,\u201d Chad said, pounding a fist on his desk. A desk that was rumored to have been owned by General Robert E. Lee. \u201cI\u2019ve given you long enough to get over whatever snit you\u2019re in. I have a major fundraising dinner in February that you\u2019ll need to attend with me, and...\u201d</p><p>She listened with half an ear as her dad droned on and on about family duty, constituents and campaigning coupled with her inability to not keep her head on straight when it came to outward appearances.</p><p>Same lecture, different day.</p><p>It didn\u2019t matter if she were perfect or not, she\u2019d never measure up to her dad\u2019s standards. No one could. Maybe that was why her mother had run off and married the gardener. Last she heard, they were living it up in Acapulco.</p><p>She glanced around her dad\u2019s office. Same dark woods, same wall of books and same smell of old leather and bullcrap. Lots of deal-making and hand shaking went on in this room.</p><p>And she was so tired of it. She wanted a normal life, without politics. Without the scrutiny and campaigns.</p><p>\u201cWell, what do you have to say for yourself?\u201d Her dad downed his glass of rum and coke.</p><p>Looking Chad straight in the eye, she took a deep breath and said, \u201cI\u2019m almost four months pregnant.\u201d</p><p>The nearly empty glass fell to the desk with a thud, ice and mixed drink going everywhere. \u201cTell me you\u2019re joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s the father?\u201d he asked and April blinked at him. \u201cDo you even know?\u201d</p><p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou heard me.\u201d He came from around his desk, advancing on her with a dark look on his face, and for the first time in her life, she was afraid of her dad. But she refused to cower.</p><p>\u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d Besides, if he wanted to think she slept around...fine.</p><p>His jaw worked. \u201cWhy does it matter?\u201d he repeated. \u201cGod Almighty, April.\u201d He glanced around the room, then back at her. \u201cGet rid of it.\u201d</p><p>Get rid of it? Like it was an inconvenience to him? Like he had to the right to dictate to her? He\u2019d lost his damn mind. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen tell me who the father is.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She stood, lifting her chin and gripping her phone tightly in her hand. \u201cI\u2019m keeping the baby and you\u2019re going to have to deal with it. I\u2019m sure your campaign manager will know how to spin it. Think of all the conservative women votes you have yet to capture.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to reach Margo\u2019s ears,\u201d he said and she could see the gears turning in his head. One thing that every opponent could count on from her dad was his ability to think on his feet. He was a master at debate and could turn any rebuttal into a gaff. \u201cIf only you were still with that Ambrose boy. We could work with him. Nice kid but dumb as hell when it comes to politics.\u201d</p><p>That had been what drew her to him. He couldn\u2019t have cared less who her daddy was. \u201cWe were toxic together. I didn\u2019t like the person I was with him.\u201d Normally, she wouldn\u2019t have admitted this to him, but the pregnancy made her vulnerable. It made her wish for a father that was concerned for her and would tell her things like: I support and love you, no matter what.</p><p>\u201cSugar, you can\u2019t help it,\u201d he said, almost absentmindedly. \u201cToo much of your mother in you.\u201d</p><p>Hurt slashed through her. She bit down on the inside of her cheek for so hard and so long that blood flooded her mouth. Bile rose in her throat and she had to close her eyes.</p><p>Breathe, she told herself, just breathe. Then she opened her eyes.</p><p>\u201cStill, I wonder...\u201d Suddenly, her dad smiled. Oh God. She knew that smile. \u201cYou\u2019re still friendly with Leah Ambrose, aren\u2019t you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cCarter\u2019s mother...yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo visit with her. Enlist her help in getting Carter back.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want him back.\u201d She wanted Finn back, with all her heart. Stupid heart.</p><p>Chad wasn\u2019t listening. \u201cAnd to sweeten the pot.\u201d He strode to his desk and opened the middle drawer. His checkbook. Did her dad really think he could buy Carter off? Wouldn\u2019t happen in a million years. \u201cMake it happen, April.\u201d</p><p>Or else hung in the air, daring her to ask, \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m cutting you off.\u201d He held out the check. \u201cThink about it, sugar. You don\u2019t have a job, unless I say you do, which means no insurance, no salary, no pretty clothes and shoes. I\u2019ll sell the car, sell the house\u2014\u201d</p><p>It galled her to think that her own father had narrowed down her focus in life to material things. Though in the past that might have been true. \u201cI already sold the house and bought another one. In my name only this time.\u201d She gave him a saccharine smile. \u201cDidn\u2019t your secretary tell you? Maybe you should start reading things before you sign them.\u201d But she needed her job, if only for the medical insurance. No one would insure a pregnant woman after the fact.</p><p>God, she hated the corner she\u2019d painted herself into. This was exactly why one never went into business with family.</p><p>\u201cFine. Keep the car. Good luck paying for maintenance, gas or insurance.\u201d</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cThanks.\u201d</p><p>The check crumpled in his hand at her mutinous expression. \u201cDammit, April. At least think of the baby.\u201d He said the word as if it were a curse. \u201cYou\u2019ll need transportation, food, a roof over your head and baby stuff. All of that costs a lot of money that you\u2019ll no longer have. And do you really think all of your so-called friends will be there for you? Sure, they might come over and play with the baby, but honey, think about it...You\u2019d be all alone, with a child that you can\u2019t afford to raise.\u201d</p><p>Biting down on the inside of her cheek again, she looked away. Tears threatened to fall. Slowly uncrossing her arms, she held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d</p><p>He set the check in her palm, closing her fingers around it. \u201cYou did the right thing, baby girl.\u201d Pressing a kiss to her forehead, he gripped her chin and forced her to face him. \u201cDo what needs to be done and if you can convince the son of a bitch it\u2019s his, do it.\u201d</p><p>Then he released her, striding out of his office and slamming the door behind him.</p><p>April sank into the chair, check in one hand and phone in the other. She let the check fall to the floor. Tears flowed down her cheeks, but she refused to acknowledge them. She pressed that empty hand to her stomach. \u201cFor you...I\u2019ll do anything for you.\u201d Unlike her parents, she would put her family first.</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p>April was not used to losing and she hated coming in second to anything or anyone. Yet here she was, driving back to Charlotte in defeat, with a smile on her face. She hadn\u2019t been able to convince Carter that they needed to get back together, and like she had predicted, the check from the governor hadn\u2019t helped things.</p><p>However, she had taken it upon herself to purposefully sabotage the entire thing, though to be honest, as soon as she and Carter were in the same room together that familiar pattern of their toxic relationship reared its ugly head. Instead of whoring herself out, she lied to her ex by saying that she\u2019d cheated on him while they were together, and became the biggest witch this side of the Mississippi to him and everyone else she came in contact with, except his mother.</p><p>However, that wasn\u2019t too much of a stretch, especially now that she was becoming sick at the most odd times of day. No morning sickness for her. It was more like all day sickness.</p><p>Not that Carter would have cared. He wouldn\u2019t have cared if she\u2019d screwed every man in Holland Springs and uploaded videos of her sexcapades on YouTube. Nope, his attention was firmly fixed on his sister\u2019s best friend. Too bad the dumbtail didn\u2019t know he was in love with the girl. But April hadn\u2019t been inclined to help either of them. Instead she managed get herself practically thrown out of the Ambrose\u2019s house.</p><p>Something that her father couldn\u2019t possibly blame on her, because he didn\u2019t know the details while she knew that the Ambroses wouldn\u2019t breathe a word about it. She\u2019d always thought something had been a little off about that family. Maybe it was all those brothers and sisters, with two parents that not only loved their kids, but actually liked them.</p><p>Maybe she should have tried harder to be\u2014she grimaced\u2014nice after all, because she was back to square one: twenty-six years old, all alone, unmarried, pregnant by a no good lying asshole of a man and without a job.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>Making a left on North Davidson Street, NoDa\u2019s familiar landscape greeted her. All funky shops and eclectic eateries. Some even called the historic mill village SoHo\u2019s little sister. She preferred to call it home.</p><p>Almost there, she thought with a little smile.</p><p>Her little bungalow, located on Thirty-Seventh Street, was the only place that had ever felt like home to her. It was cozy and comfortable, with a pretty little front yard and a great backyard, complete with a patio and a swing-set.</p><p>Placing a hand on her belly, she said, \u201cI\u2019ll play with you. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d No way would she raise her child like she\u2019d been raised. On at all times, never able to show emotions about anything, not even when her mother had left her.</p><p>Blue and red lights flashed in her rear view mirror.</p><p>Glancing down, she checked her speed. Thirty-six in a thirty-five zone. \u201cOh, come on,\u201d she muttered, pressing on the brakes and hitting the hazard lights. She pulled over to the right side of the street, put her car in park and rolled her window down. This was the last thing she needed. Jerking her purse out of the passenger side seat, she dug through it and found her wallet.</p><p>By the time the officer got to her window, she had her license out and was tapping it against the steering wheel. Only the officer wasn\u2019t dressed like a cop. He wore black cargo pants, a black long-sleeved t-shirt and a black Kevlar vest.</p><p>\u201cLicense, please,\u201d a familiar voice said and her heart stopped. Finn Burke.</p><p>A flutter of anticipation slid through her, but she turned to him with the haughtiest look she could muster, letting him take the square piece of plastic. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be out arresting mobsters? Or at least sleeping with their daughters?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a big Mafia problem in NoDa?\u201d he asked, with that brogue of his. She would never admit it to him, but that combination of Irish accent with a touch of the Bronx drove her wild. Made her wet and hot.</p><p>And she hated it now. Him, really. Hated how out of control he could make her feel by saying such mundane things as butter, hotter and basically any word ending with an \u2018r\u2019. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of his crimes,not by a long shot. He had made her fall in love with him, or who she thought he was.</p><p>\u201cAre we through here?\u201d Snatching her license out of his hand, she flung it away, not caring where it landed. The smell of Salvador Deli, normally taste bud heaven, made her stomach roil and she gasped. A cold sweat broke out on her forehead and she felt the blood drain from her face.</p> <p>He opened the car door so quickly that she couldn\u2019t stop him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, babe?\u201d</p><p>Breathing through her nose, she slanted him a look. \u201cDon\u2019t call me babe, you damn Yankee.\u201d Another roil of her stomach and she had to lean back in her seat, eyes closing. She would not puke in front of him. On him though, was an entirely different matter.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m Irish, April. Lived in Ireland most of my life,\u201d he reminded her.</p><p>\u201cBut you lived in the Bronx for five years,\u201d she insisted, then moaned a little as the next wave of nausea hit her. \u201cMakes you a Yankee.\u201d</p><p>He grunted. \u201cGet out of the car.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t make me,\u201d she said weakly, but didn\u2019t protest when he unfastened her seatbelt and lifted her out. His bullet proof vest was hard and as unforgiving as she felt on the inside. Wrapping her arms around his neck was something she had to do, because she had no desire to fall.</p><p>Too bad she\u2019d never stopped falling for him.</p><p>Damn stubborn woman. Finn kicked the car door shut, then pressed the lock button on her key fob before readjusting her in his arms. She snuggled up against him, and he glanced down. The color had returned to her face, but she still looked a bit peaked.</p><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t contagious, are you?\u201d he asked, striding to his SUV.</p><p>Her head lulled to one side, one eye cracking open to narrow at him. \u201cWill you leave me alone if I say yes?\u201d Which was April-speak for she wasn\u2019t contagious and wanted him to stay with her.</p><p>A smile kicked up the corners of his mouth. He managed to get his keys out, unlock the door and place her inside. \u201cSit there, and if you have to hurl, kindly roll down the bloody window first.\u201d Then he slammed the door shut and jogged to the driver\u2019s side and got in. \u201cI\u2019ll get one of my buddies to drive your car home.\u201d</p> <p>After he started up his Range Rover and merged onto Davidson, she cleared her throat. \u201cI don\u2019t live on Kingston anymore.\u201d</p><p>Grunting, he glanced at her, then back at the road. \u201cFinally moved up to Myers Park, yeah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEastover, then.\u201d It was pure luck that he\u2019d been doing a ride-along with Hunter and was on his way back to his SUV. When he\u2019d seen that silver little BMW whip out onto Davidson, it had been all he could do not to tell Hunter to punch it. Instead he\u2019d suggested that his buddy tail the roadster, just for shits and giggles.</p><p>So, when her speed had gone a mile over, Finn couldn\u2019t have hit the lights fast enough. Pride made him sit in the car so she could sweat it out.</p><p>\u201cPretty nice ride, for a cop,\u201d she said as he braked for a red light. \u201cOr Uptown\u2019s businesses are doling out major kickbacks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSecurity business pays well, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShould I know every mundane fact about your life?\u201d</p> <p>Which meant, yes, she did remember. Too amused to be angry with her, he smiled and shook his head. \u201cDo you believe every Hollywood film you see?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you explain it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I told you, then I\u2019d have to kill you,\u201d he said with a quick glance in her direction.</p><p>She smirked at him, then closed her eyes. \u201cNice.\u201d</p><p>His stomach rumbled. A quick stop at the deli and he could get his dinner to go. \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t answer. Glancing her way again, he found April asleep, her mouth slightly parted. Damn, whatever bad dose she\u2019d gotten had made her all knackered.</p><p>He parked his truck again, ran to the window, ordered and was back on the road in under ten minutes. April slept the entire time, until he turned into her driveway. Then she woke up, looked at him and her face went white, then green.</p><p>\u201cOh, no, no, no,\u201d he chanted, pressing the unlock button while she worked at the door handle.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>Jumping out, he ran like a man on fire to her side. \u201cLet go,\u201d he shouted, but every time he pulled, so did she and the door refused to budge. Finally, she gave up and stuck her head out of the window, puking down the side of his Range Rover.</p><p>He made a face, running a hand over his eyes, nose and mouth. \u201cDid you have to get it all over the door?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSandwich,\u201d she moaned.</p><p>She wanted eat. After all that? \u201cSorry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGet. Your. Sandwich,\u201d she said through gritted teeth.</p><p>He stood there, stupidly, until his sandwich came flying through the window, hitting him squarely in the chest. Catching it on the way down, he watched April get out on his side and wobble on high heels to her front door. She jiggled the knob a couple of times, then sank to the floor and did...nothing.</p><p>A gentleman would go help his lady up. But he was no gentleman and his \u201clady\u201d hated him, hadn\u2019t spoken to him in over a month and had puked all over his new SUV\u2019s paint job. He stomped to the side of her house, threw the sandwich away in her trashcan, then searched for a garden hose. After finding it, he turned on the water and pulled the hose along side of him.</p><p>Taking his time, he rinsed off the passenger side door, then rummaged through the back for some soap, a bucket and a sponge. After finding all three, he set to washing the thing, humming a tune as he got the job done.</p><p>When the SUV looked as good as new, he put everything back in its place and headed to April\u2019s porch. He stopped cold when he found her still sitting there, unmoving with her head against the door frame.</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go inside?\u201d</p><p>She made a little noise. \u201cYou have my keys.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut the spare\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs in the back, hidden under the deck,\u201d she finished. Holding out her hand, she wiggled her fingers at him. \u201cKeys.\u201d</p><p>Damn his temper and damn her stubbornness. She could have asked for his help. He snorted. Fat chance of that happening. Ever.</p><p>\u201cPlease,\u201d she whispered, then her arm went limp.</p><p>And didn\u2019t he feel like a big man for reducing her to this. April Billingsworth never said please. Oh hell, no. She demanded and he gave, until they were in bed together, then her demands turned into pleas.</p><p>\u201cNow, Frank,\u201d she growled.</p><p>He smiled. There was that flash of temper he\u2019d missed. Thought she could make him mad by calling him by the wrong name? Not a chance. His smile widened. \u201cThere\u2019s my girl.\u201d</p><p>His girl chucked her phone at his head.</p><p>Chapter Four</p><p>April eyed Finn as he held a bag of frozen peas on his cheek. A very, very tiny part of her felt bad for hurting him, while a very, very large part of her thought it served him right.</p><p>Wrapping her robe tighter around her, she sailed past him and into the kitchen. Damp strands of hair slapped her in the face. The shower she\u2019d taken had made her feel a million times better. So had the saltine crackers and ginger ale she\u2019d sneaked into the bathroom while he wasn\u2019t looking.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take a steak-medium; a potato-baked; and a glass of your finest in lieu of your apology,\u201d Finn called out from her living room. \u201cAnd a twenty for the gas I spent getting you home safely.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDream on,\u201d she snapped, then stopped short, spun around and stomped to the living room. \u201cHow did you know where I lived?\u201d</p><p>His oh so very handsome face paled a little under his tan. \u201cYou told me, right before you passed out.\u201d</p><p>Crossing her arms, she lifted her chin. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou talk in your sleep, don\u2019t you know,\u201d he said with a wink. \u201cAlthough, this time there were considerably less \u2018more, Finn, more\u2019 coming from that sweet mouth.\u201d</p><p>Of all the nerve. She tossed her head and lifted her chin. \u201cI\u2019m glad the sex was memorable for one of us. Sorry, Fred, but I\u2019ve moved on to bigger things. Huge.\u201d Her gaze flicked down to his crotch and back up again, a smirk fixed on her sweet mouth. Just leave me be, she thought, until another voice in her head spoke up, Don\u2019t let him go. \u201cMaybe you should try to do the same.\u201d</p><p>His face turned dark. \u201cDammit, April. You can\u2019t keep running away from me.\u201d</p><p>Uncrossing her arms, she shoved a finger into his chest. \u201cMaybe I could, if your buddy hadn\u2019t pulled me over for a false traffic violation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFalse? You were speeding,\u201d he yelled, his hands swiping through the air. Automatically, she flinched and used her hands to shield her face. \u201cWhat the hell? I would never hit a woman.\u201d</p><p>Humiliation washed over her, turning her body hot, then cold and then back to hot. Slowly lowering her arms, she narrowed her eyes. \u201cHow would I know that?\u201d</p><p>Slowly, he took a step towards her, then another, his blue eyes serious. \u201cI would never hurt you. Ever.\u201d</p><p>Not physically, that she believed. However, her poor heart was still trying to recover from the bruises he\u2019d left on it, with his lies and false promises.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve gone to all this trouble to help me home, but I think it\u2019s best if you go.\u201d She side-stepped him, heading to the door and opening it.</p><p>He moved to the door and her heart plummeted. Stay, please stay. Pausing he looked her straight in the eye and shut the door. \u201cI\u2019m staying.\u201d</p><p>Yay, her heart cheered. She frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t you have cop stuff to do, like eat donuts?\u201d Although if he ate donuts, then he must do a thousand sit-ups afterwards, because the man was more than cut.</p><p>As if reading her thoughts, he slid his hand up his black t-shirt, exposing those washboard abs and her weakness for them. She whimpered and he grinned. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the abs of a desk jockey.\u201d</p><p>Of their own accord, her fingers stretched toward him and she licked her lips.</p><p>\u201cGo on. Touch them,\u201d he said, voice all low and husky. He met her halfway, encircling her wrist with his large hand and placing her palm right on his stomach. The muscles contracted beneath it.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she whimpered again. What was wrong with her? Finn was just a man, with red hair for goodness\u2019 sake. Okay, so it was a dark auburn and his blue eyes were sexy as anything. He was sexy as anything.</p><p>\u201cKnew you\u2019d love it.\u201d He smiled, wicked and full of promised.</p><p>And so smug that she snatched her hand away. \u201cBetter keep working out, Felix. There was a little pudge.\u201d</p><p>His brows shot up to his hairline and his smile fell off his face. \u201cMy what?\u201d Then that smile returned. \u201cI\u2019ve got you all figured out, Miss Billingsworth.\u201d</p><p>She backed away from that smile. \u201cThe only thing you\u2019ve figured out about me is that I happen to like men with nice physiques.\u201d Stopping a couple feet of away from him, she pretended to consider her next words. \u201cLike my ex-fiance, for instance, has abs that make grandmothers sigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that where you\u2019ve been?\u201d he asked.</p><p>Was Finn jealous? \u201cI missed Carter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s so great, then why aren\u2019t you with the arse. Oh, sorry, Mr. Wonderful?\u201d</p><p>Because she didn\u2019t want Carter. She wanted Finn, the man who had lied to her, who\u2019d made her laugh and feel so loved that it physically hurt to be without him. And he was the father of her unborn child. Eventually, she would have to tell him about the pregnancy, but the other...probably never.</p><p>So she resorted to what she did best, annoy the hell out of Finn. \u201cWho says he\u2019s not on his way here right now?\u201d</p><p>Finn could barely contain the eye roll over her bald-faced lie. \u201cAs sick as you were, I\u2019d sure as hell wouldn\u2019t be letting you out of my sight.\u201d He strode to the kitchen and opened her fridge. There was barely anything on the shelves worth eating or drinking, unless one liked crackers and soda water. \u201cWhere\u2019s your beer?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRight where you left your manners,\u201d April said from the doorway between the kitchen and the living room.</p><p>He straightened, taking in her tiny tank top and stripped pajama bottoms that her open robe had revealed. Her breasts looked huge and there was a softness to her curves that hadn\u2019t been there before. \u201cDid you get your tits done?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest, making them stand out even more. \u201cDid you miss my hot tits?\u201d</p><p>He would never live that text down. \u201cI\u2019m a man, aren\u2019t I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you really want me to answer that?\u201d</p><p>Damn, but he loved teasing her. \u201cGain some weight, then?\u201d</p><p>Jaw working, she whirled around and stomped down the hall. He followed, \u201cC\u2019mon, April. I was only joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo away.\u201d She stopped at a door, her head bowed. Hair the color of caramel fell forward, exposing the soft nape of her neck.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sweetheart. You look gorgeous.\u201d He moved closer, placing his hands on her hips and dipped his head. \u201cI\u2019m an arse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn,\u201d she said, her hands joining his, then bringing one around front. His palm coasting over the firm swell of her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m pregnant.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Chapter Five</p><p>\u201cI see,\u201d Finn said, although he could barely see anything at all, much less breathe. He blinked at the back of her head, saw double, then blinked again.</p><p>She sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s yours. The first time we had sex...we didn\u2019t use protection, remember?\u201d</p> <p>But he had pulled out at the last minute. Guess he mucked that up. \u201cI see,\u201d he said again. Damn, but he was utterly brilliant at this moment. He was going to be a father. Responsible for someone else\u2019s life. Responsible for screwing them up in a way that only parents could. \u201cJesus.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019d like to have visitation with the baby after it\u2019s born, I\u2019m sure my lawyer can work something out with yours,\u201d she said, in voice calm, like she was discussing her plans for the weekend. \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford one, then\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can bloody well afford my own lawyer,\u201d he growled, applying pressure to the one hip still in his hand. She turned, her chin tipping up. Pretty blue eyes met his, head on and tear free. \u201cBut I won\u2019t need one.\u201d</p><p>This time she was the one to say, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou and I will work things out before the baby is born,\u201d he said and her eyes fractionally widened. \u201cAs it happens, I\u2019m in need of a flatmate and \u2013\u201d</p> <p>She crossed her arms. \u201cI\u2019m not moving in with you in some pest-infested apartment.\u201d</p><p>His \u201cpest-infested\u201d apartment was located in Charlotte\u2019s swankiest Uptown address. \u201cWasn\u2019t asking you to.\u201d He cupped her cheek and her eyes closed, lashes falling. \u201cBesides, your place has a yard and sidewalks. Good schools.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019ll be moving nearby?\u201d A shuddering breath left her as she leaned into his touch. \u201cThat\u2019ll be nice.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the baby,\u201d she added quickly, her pink lips oh so close to his.</p><p>\u201cGlad you think so,\u201d he murmured.</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Rising on the balls of her feet, she kissed him. A quick meeting of lips that had him pressing her against him as he went in for more.</p> <p>He kissed her again, nipping at her bottom lip. \u201cNot done.\u201d</p><p>She slid her hands up his chest, to his arms, gripping his biceps. \u201cWe should stop,\u201d she said between kisses.</p><p>\u201cWe should,\u201d he agreed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m still mad at you, Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAs you should be, but lay into me tomorrow,\u201d he said, then sealed his mouth over hers. Damn, he\u2019d missed kissing her. He\u2019d missed the way she would surrender to herself and let him explore her mouth with his tongue. Like he was doing now. He growled low in his throat when her tongue touched his.</p><p>Sweeping her off of her feet, he bumped open the door with his hip and walked inside. Without breaking their kiss, he kept one eye open and made his way to her bed, carefully placing her in the center.</p><p>She looked up at him, breathless and all shiny-mouthed. He pulled his shirt over his head, then his holster and placed it on the dresser. When he came back to bed, she lay there nude but for her panties.</p><p>Placing a knee on the mattress, he unfastened the top button of his black pants. \u201cTake those off.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do it...please.\u201d</p><p>After shucking off his pants, boxers, socks and shoes, he climbed on the bed and dipped his head to her hip. Using only his teeth, he tugged off her silk panties, then gently pushed her thighs apart. A thin strip of blonde curls and pink flesh greeted him.</p><p>\u201cNow that\u2019s a sight,\u201d he said with a wiggle of his brows.</p><p>She giggled, then slapped a hand over her mouth, like she\u2019d just revealed her most shocking secret to him.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t hide from me,\u201d he ordered, pulling her hand away from her face. \u201cAnd don\u2019t be afraid to be you with me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not like other women\u2014you know, nice and sweet,\u201d she said. The vulnerability on her face was nearly his undoing.</p><p>\u201cNot much of a sweet tooth.\u201d He lowered himself between her thighs and parted her delicate sex, giving her a lick. \u201cI prefer tart.\u201d Another lick and her hips rolled. \u201cA little tangy.\u201d This time he found her clit and sucked, until she beat at his shoulders and called out his name. \u201cFull of vim and vinegar.\u201d</p><p>Pushing her hair out of her eyes, she blinked at him. \u201cI taste like vinegar down there?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a low laugh, then crawled up her body, mindful of what lay between them. \u201cCare to taste for yourself?\u201d</p><p>She turned her head and he kissed her ear instead. \u201cMaybe another time.\u201d</p><p>He worried a lobe, pleased when her nipples hardened. Working his way down the long column of her throat, he traced a path to her breasts and palmed one. He placed an open mouth over the top of one hard nipple, then peered at her from beneath his lashes. She watched him intently, her cheeks pink as she panted. He felt her fingers curl around his dick, tightening. He groaned, then began to suck on her.</p><p>\u201cIn me, Finn. I need you in me,\u201d she said on a wail. \u201cPlease...put your cock inside of me.\u201d</p><p>His dick grew as hard as the Kevlar in his vest. He let her nipple pop out of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019ll fuck you, love.\u201d Brushing her hand out of the way, he guided his cock to where she was wet, slick and hot, and gave a hard pump of his hips. She jolted beneath him, her inner muscles clamping down on him.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she hissed.</p><p>His eyes rolled at the pleasure of it, then he rolled her on top of him.\u201dDon\u2019t want to hurt you,\u201d he said softly.</p><p>She placed her hands on his chest and worked herself up and down his cock, until finally he slid all the way inside of her. This time, they both groaned.</p><p>\u201cOh God,\u201d she said, her head falling back and her luscious breast bouncing as she rode him. Leaning forward, he bit a nipple and she spasmed around him.</p><p>\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d he said and her head snapped up.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtection.\u201d</p><p>Tilting her head to one side, she made a face. \u201cLittle late for that, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWorse things than a baby.\u201d</p><p>She frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t have those, remember?\u201d</p><p>He grinned, memories of a similar conversation taking place the first time he stripped her out of her dress.\u201cNeither do I, remember?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201d she snapped, then a hard thrust made her moan.</p><p>Cupping each hip, he helped her ride him, urging her faster and harder until she let him take completely over. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Forget that you hate me, that you always need to be in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to be in control.\u201d But he noticed she didn\u2019t say a word about hating him, which could only mean that she didn\u2019t hate him and couldn\u2019t bring herself to admit it.</p><p>He sucked a hard neglected nipple into his mouth, then let it pop out. Something he knew she loved for him to do, because she had told him in explicit details how she liked to be touched and stroked.</p><p>Most perfect woman ever created, he thought.</p><p>\u201cLet me take care of you.\u201d He brushed his thumb across the outer edge of her clit again and again, until she shoved his hand away and began to rub herself.</p><p>\u201cMore, Finn, more,\u201d she gasped.</p><p>Her arm came down across the front of her body, cupping a breast and playing with a hard nipple. \u201cYou\u2019re killing me, woman,\u201d he said, then sat up. He held her close, pumping into her hard and sucking at a spot on her neck.</p><p>She shuddered around him, calling out his name.</p><p>His head fell back as his own orgasm claimed him, pouring out of his body into hers. Deeper and deeper he thrust, his arms tightening around her curvaceous body.</p><p>Finally, he rolled his head to one side then the other. \u201cAlmost forgot what a hot piece you are.\u201d</p><p>Big blue eyes, slumberous with satisfaction and some other emotion regarded him. She yawned and stretched, her legs uncurling from around his waist. \u201cI\u2019m sleepy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been told in the past that I\u2019m hard to keep up with,\u201d he said with a smug smile.</p><p>She yawned again. \u201cStop believing the lies.\u201d Then she lay her head on his shoulder, relaxing in slow degrees until her breath evened out.</p><p>Easing down on the mattress, he lay there with her, long after he\u2019d gone soft and slipped out of her warmth. He ran his hands up and down her back, until she shivered and goosebumps appeared. Then he somehow managed to draw the covers up and over them both.</p><p>\u201c\u2019Night, babe,\u201d he said, as the sun set.</p><p>She mumbled something in her sleep, then snuggled up to him.</p><p>Wonder what she would think when she woke up next to him tomorrow morning? If her reaction to what had just happened between them was any indication, she\u2019d be putty in his hands. He grinned.</p><p>Chapter Six</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t trick you into having sex, April.\u201d Finn rubbed the back of his neck and groaned. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you listen to reason?\u201d They had been arguing for twenty minutes now and he was no closer to changing her opinion of him. Hell, he hadn\u2019t even had a chance to try to change her mind.</p><p>She picked up a decorative pillow from the floor and placed it on the bed. \u201cYou used my raging pregnancy hormones against me, with your tight shirt and abs...and other things.\u201d She tied the sash on her robe tighter and flicked her eyes over him.</p><p>He stood there, straight from her shower, wearing nothing but a towel. Grinning, he said, \u201cThose raging pregnancy hormones bothering you, babe? I could help you out again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou need serious psychological help.\u201d She stomped to her closet.</p><p>He followed her, then leaned against the doorway with his arms folded across his chest. \u201cIn all seriousness, we need to talk. I\u2019ll go first.\u201d Her jaw turned mutinous and he uncrossed one arm to hold up a finger. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather us be on good terms, for the sake of our baby.\u201d</p><p>That mutinous jaw softened and she nodded. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI was hired by your father, to watch over and keep tabs on you. However, it wasn\u2019t my plan to sleep with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo, it was my fault, then?\u201d</p><p>He straightened and took a step closer. \u201cNo. It was mine. I never get involved with clients or with anyone in their family.\u201d</p><p>Raising a hand in the air, she waved a finger around. \u201cYay for being special.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLook, I wanted to tell you, but I was confident that you\u2019d leave if I did...and I couldn\u2019t risk that, at the time anyway.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause it would have been extra hard to keep tabs on me once I got your tail fired? Bless your heart, Finn.\u201d</p><p>Closing his eyes, he counted to fifty and prayed for patience. He deserved this. He had screwed up and had lied to her. She was the victim, no matter how tart her tongue.</p><p>\u201cAre you done talking now, because I have things to do that don\u2019t involve you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTime for your weekly mani/pedi, babe?\u201d he asked, eyes opening. That\u2019s what she usually did on Tuesdays. He knew her entire schedule, down to the hour. He wondered if she had any idea that she was so habitual. If someone ever did plot to kidnap her, they\u2019d have no problem at all.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her gaze skittered away. \u201cCar stuff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut it\u2019s not Friday.\u201d He frowned. \u201cYou always get your car detailed on Fridays.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you stop reminding me of how my dad paid you to stalk me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cProtect you,\u201d he corrected.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re splitting hairs.\u201d She hung up her robe and got dressed, slipping into a pair of brown trousers and a pale pink fluffy sweater. Next were animal print flats. \u201cNow get dressed and leave.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s it. You\u2019re not willing to give me another chance?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m willing to let you have visitation with our child. That should be enough.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting it, me...this.\u201d He shifted his weigh from one leg to the other. \u201cI want you and the baby. It\u2019s a package deal now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow romantic. Is that how you charm all the girls out of their panties, big talk of your package?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMy big package seemed to impress you all right.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re so crass.\u201d She brushed past him. \u201cI expect you to be gone before I get back.\u201d</p><p>There was no way he could leave her, no matter what she said or how she tried to insult him. Four months of dating her had seen to that. He was immune to her barbs and he\u2019d cracked the code to April-speak. \u201cSorry, babe, I\u2019m in it for the long haul.\u201d</p><p>The last thing April expected to be in her driveway was a moving van, but there it was, blocking her. The house beside hers had been for sale, until yesterday when a sold sign suddenly appeared, so maybe the moving company had made a mistake.</p><p>She gently tapped on the horn of her new minivan. \u201cMinivan,\u201d she whimpered. She had always loathed minivans, stuffed full with kids, toys and DVDs. And now she owned one.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t feel sorry for herself. It was paid for, with enough money left over from selling her pretty little BMW to the dealership, to pay for insurance and gas for a long, long time. Besides, NoDa was entirely walkable. She should be proud for making such a sacrifice. Still her BMW had been so sleek and fast and cute and...not a minivan!</p><p>Finn walked around to the back, bag of chips in his hand. His eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>Great. Now she wanted to slump down in her seat and hide. Instead she rolled down the window and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cMoving,\u201d he said, popping a chip in his mouth.</p><p>\u201cInto my house?\u201d She shook her head, hair flying everywhere. \u201cNo, uh-uh, no way. Not happening.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSettle down, preggo, I\u2019m moving next door. Figured you wouldn\u2019t mind your new neighbor borrowing your driveway for a couple of hours.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She impersonated a fish gasping for air for several long seconds while he calmly ate chip after chip, then her brain kicked into gear. Finn had moved here, beside her. To be with her and the baby.</p><p>A ribbon of warmth wove around her and she wanted to cry in happiness. Stupid hormones. \u201cHow long?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThirty minutes, give or take a few. Why don\u2019t you leave this here and I\u2019ll move it when the guys are done,\u201d he offered.</p> <p>Well, she was tired. Actually, she was exhausted and wanted to do nothing more than to crawl into bed and sleep for the next hundred years. \u201cFine. Don\u2019t scratch the paint job when you do.\u201d</p><p>Grinning as he opened the door for her, she turned up her nose at his hand and quickly made her way to her house. \u201cI\u2019m digging the new ride, babe. You make anything look good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever,\u201d she tossed over her shoulder. Secretly, she was pleased with his compliments and the look of admiration in his eyes. Call her shallow, but after years of second guessing every decision she made, it was nice to have immediate support.</p><p>Once inside, she threw her purse on the couch, her shoes in the closet, peeled off her clothes and tumbled into bed. In what seemed like seconds later, she was waking up to Finn calling her name.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sleeping,\u201d she grumbled, burying herself more deeply in the covers. His heavy footsteps sounded and she frowned. That damn man forgot to take off his shoes.</p> <p>A large hand stroked her head gently. \u201cIt\u2019s almost six in the evening. You need to eat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need to sleep,\u201d she argued, then her stomach growled.</p><p>He laughed. \u201cI brought you dinner.\u201d</p><p>That made her perk up and sit up, putting her bare breasts on display. Gasping, she covered them from his very intense stare, then glared at him. \u201cStop ogling me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow about I feed you instead?\u201d He turned, bringing a tray with little legs that fit perfectly over her lap. \u201cSome soup, fresh bread and a little dessert\u2014strawberry ice cream\u2014if you\u2019re up to it.\u201d</p><p>The aroma of chicken noodle soup washed over her and suddenly, she was ravenous. She ate the entire bowl of soup, all the bread and half the dessert before she realized that he was still sitting beside her, not speaking or eating. \u201cWant some,\u201d she said around a mouthful of ice cream. A couple of cold drops fell to her chest and she shivered.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yeah.\u201d His blue eyes flicked to her chest, staring at the tops of her breasts.</p><p>She put down the spoon. \u201cGet this off of me first.\u201d</p><p>He dipped his head and she leaned back, allowing him to lick the ice cream off of her. His tongue was soft against her skin. The covers dropped to her waist and she felt his finger, cold and wet, circle a nipple. Then his hot mouth opened over it and he began to suck, in hard tugs that she could feel between her thighs. The more he sucked, the wetter she got.</p><p>Over and over he painted her nipples with ice cream, until she was shaking with need. Desperate to have him. One of his hands found her thigh, the other moving the tray to the floor. Higher and higher his fingers climbed, until he sank two deep inside of her.</p><p>Then he kissed her, sinking his tongue in her mouth in the same lazy glide as his fingers. \u201cCome on my fingers, sweetheart,\u201d he whispered against her lips.</p><p>She moaned in response and widened her thighs, sending him deeper. He shifted, his head going to her lap. The stroke of his tongue had her crying out. Sweet torture. She watched as his head moved, his dark hair soft against the inner skin of thighs. Another lick and she jerked her hips. His fingers curled at the exact moment he sucked hard on her clit.</p><p>A scream tore from her throat and she dug her fingers into his hair, gripping the strands tightly. When she came back to her earth, Finn was kissing his way up her thigh, her stomach, and nipped at each nipple until his mouth found hers once more.</p><p>\u201cLet me,\u201d \u2013her hands went to the fly of his pants and he stood up, beside the bed\u2014\u201creturn the favor.\u201d She quickly unbuttoned them and pulled out his very large cock, then she wrapped her mouth around the head.</p> <p>She licked and sucked, taking him to the back of her throat again and again, until his hand fisted in her hair and he directed the pace. \u201cLove watching you like this. Oh yeah, right there...just like that. Suck it.\u201d His hips moved faster and faster and she kept right up with him. \u201cStop,\u201d he suddenly growled, slowly but surely extricating himself from her mouth and hand. \u201cI didn\u2019t come\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou would have, if you\u2019d let me finish,\u201d April said, confused.</p><p>He turned around, the sound of his zipper going up loud in her bedroom. Muttering a few curse words, he turned to face her again. \u201cI didn\u2019t come over for sex, of any kind. I wanted to do something nice, not\u2014\u201d He grabbed the tray and left the room. She heard him rummaging around in her kitchen, then the front door slammed.</p><p>April sat there, stunned. What had just happened?</p><p>The next morning, April found Finn in her backyard, repairing the gargantuan swing set/tree house/fort/slide combo.</p><p>\u201cGood morning,\u201d she said softly, coming to stand by him. He worked at the chains on the swings, covering the metal with a protective plastic covering.</p><p>\u201cSpeaking to me, are you?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who left.\u201d</p><p>The sun shone in his eyes and he squinted at her. \u201cBut you were the one who wouldn\u2019t answer my texts last night.\u201d</p><p>Her cheeks heated. \u201cMy phone\u2019s not working.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSince when?\u201d</p><p>Since the governor had kept his promise of cutting her off. She had forgotten his office paid for the service plan. He\u2019d also cancelled her credit cards and closed her checking account. Well, the one that was in both of their names. However, a few years back, she had gotten a wild hair and had decided to start putting money away in one of the local banks in Charlotte.</p><p>Thank God for wild hairs, she silently mused. \u201cRight after you left.\u201d</p><p>He went back to work on the swings. \u201cConvenient.\u201d</p><p>More like humiliating. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said and his attention snapped to her.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d He let go of the chain and placed his hands low on his hips, still squinting from the sun. \u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s sorry. I messed up. I lied to you and I\u2019m sorry. Jesus, I can\u2019t say it enough to make myself feel better. For what it\u2019s worth, I leased my apartment in Uptown, bought the house beside you and signed up for partner-parenting classes at the community center. My last name is Kennedy, Burke\u2019s my middle name and I own Kennedy Investigations, but I don\u2019t advertise it, since I like to actually take on jobs.\u201d He came to her then, wrapping his arms around her. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, April. And I want to make it up to you. To our baby. I\u2019ll never lie to you again. Ask me anything.\u201d</p><p>She couldn\u2019t move as he held her and not because she was imprisoned by his arms. Oh no. She was imprisoned by his words, by his actions...by the thought of him trying and doing.</p><p>Taking a chance she asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come inside and let me fix you some iced tea?\u201d</p><p>Over the weeks that followed, it seemed that all Finn did was try to earn her trust back. He\u2019d check on her, fix things that need it, cooked her dinner and accompanied her to doctor visits. All done in such a way that never made her feel crowded or uncomfortable</p><p>He never insisted, always asked, and the walls surrounding her poor heart got weaker every day. Only she wasn\u2019t sure if he was doing this to be with her, with the baby or a sense of duty to family.</p><p>If only she knew his feelings. If only she was woman enough to ask him.</p><p>Things were growing worse with her dad. She had refused to take any call from him, ignored his emails and his letters. She didn\u2019t care what he threatened. There was no way she would go back to her old life or her old self.</p><p>But that nagging feeling that her dad wouldn\u2019t be put off for much longer remained.</p><p>Chapter Seven</p><p>\u201cFor the love of God, woman, please don\u2019t ever ask me to do that again,\u201d Finn groaned.</p><p>They\u2019d just spent an hour in one of the community centers, watching a DVD of women giving birth. Now, thank God, they were now on their way home. Well, not their home. He still lived next to her and she still lived next to him. But they were talking and spending time together, almost like old times if he didn\u2019t think about the lack of sex.</p><p>But he was a man, so he constantly thought about the lack of sex with her. He only wanted sex with her, despite the numerous opportunities he had in the past month.</p><p>April spared him a glance as they walked down North Davidson. The wind gusted, giving truth to the whole March coming in like a lion saying. \u201cBless your heart, Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat means I\u2019ve stuck my foot in it,\u201d he said. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll be going to as many as you want me to, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go to any at all, you know,\u201d she said softly.</p><p>He nodded. \u201cI do.\u201d</p><p>Avoiding a mother pushing a stroller, he moved to the right side of April and their fingers brushed. His gut clenched, his libido jumped up and down like a dog wanting to play catch. He jerked his hand away like she\u2019d set it on fire. He didn\u2019t know how much longer he could take her friendship.</p><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d she asked, her big blue eyes taking him in.</p><p>Yep, nothing but friendship there. He was so screwed and not the way he wanted to be. \u201cTrying to maintain, ba\u2014April.\u201d She frowned. At his almost slip of calling her babe or his flip reply, he didn\u2019t know. \u201cSo, I was wondering if you were free tomorrow night? Thought we could go to dinner, then back to my place for a movie.\u201d</p><p>She laughed as they made a right onto Thirty-Sixth Street. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how free your social calendar becomes once you stop going to all the places your single friends like to go.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019m single and your friend,\u201d he said and she laughed again. \u201cAnd I\u2019m asking you out.\u201d</p><p>Stopping at his driveway, she gazed up at him and strange look in her eyes. The setting sun highlighted her pretty face. \u201cAre you asking me out as a friend or as a guy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cC\u2019mon, April.\u201d He had to look away from her knowing eyes. \u201cThought we were besties now. Hell, Hunter is jealous of all the time we\u2019ve been spending together.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen maybe you should ask him out.\u201d She left him standing there, shoving her hands in her coat as she made her way to her side of their property fence.</p><p>Way to go, dumbass. The luck of the Irish was definitely not with him tonight. \u201cNight, April.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t respond, just walked up her driveway, up the porch stairs and let herself inside. Out of habit, he waited for her to turn on an interior light and lock her door before he went inside.</p><p>Tomorrow, if she would speak to him, he would apologize. Perhaps even bring her some grapefruit covered in hot sauce. Ugh. He had no idea what that dreadful combination made her so happy.</p><p>A pounding on the front door woke him out of a dead sleep. Pulling on a pair of pajama bottoms, he yawned and started for the door. He smacked his toe along the way and began to hop like a deranged Easter Bunny. \u201cMotherfu\u2014\u201d</p><p>The pounding started up again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m coming. I\u2019m coming.\u201d He punched in the security code before unlocking his door and opening it. April nearly fell into his arms.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said on a hiccup, then began to speak at him, a rush of words that ran together. \u201cButhehadallmy-myutilitiescuto-off, and I had a noteab-boutmyhouse, myhorribleminivan. And he foundoutaboutmymoney. Oh God, Finn, I\u2019ms-scaredandhaven-no one b-but you.\u201d</p><p>Still not fully awake or comprehending what she was saying, he gently guided her into the house, flipping on the living room lights along the way. After getting her settled on the couch, he sat down beside her. She had a death grip on his hand.</p><p>\u201cStart from the beginning and go slowly,\u201d he said.</p><p>A shudder racked her body. \u201cHe kept his promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018he\u2019?\u201d he asked, wrapping a blanket around her bare shoulders. She wore nothing but a yellow tank top, green shorts and flip-flops. He wanted to lecture her for going outside in the middle of a freezing March night, but couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. She had come to him. Him. That had to mean something, right?</p><p>\u201cThe Governor.\u201d She stared off in the distance. \u201cI thought I could do this, all by myself. I thought I didn\u2019t need anyone.\u201d</p><p>Not even him? So much for coming to him. So much for the past month of dates, of tentative smiles and talks and baby classes. April still didn\u2019t trust him. His fault though. \u201cEveryone needs a little help now and again.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI need more than a little help, Finn,\u201d she said, her pretty eyes fixing on his face. \u201cI\u2019m broke. I have no insurance. No house, no phone, no lights or water. Not even that stupid minivan is mine anymore. He took it all away, just like he promised, because I couldn\u2019t convince my ex to pretend that the baby was his. I couldn\u2019t do it, Finn. I just couldn\u2019t, especially after offering Carter money to be with me. I felt like a whore.\u201d</p><p>Swallowing down his righteous fury at the thought of his child being passed off as someone else\u2019s, he said, \u201cYou are not a whore, April.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m worse. I\u2019m a liar and a horrible person to be around.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA liar wouldn\u2019t have told me the truth about the baby.\u201d</p><p>Big blue eyes blinked up at him, lashes all spiky and wet. \u201cYou\u2019re not mad at me?\u201d</p><p>Oh, he was mad all right, but not at her. Jesus, he hated to see her like this. So defeated and small. He knew her, knew she valued her independence above all things. Chad Billingsworth had to have done a number on April, using his political connections to take everything from her. \u201cNo, sweetheart.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She began to cry in earnest. \u201cI don\u2019t deserve you or your friendship.\u201d</p><p>He couldn\u2019t take her crying, not like this. \u201c What can I do? Tell me what you need and I\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d Both of their prideful natures be damned.</p><p>\u201cCan I move in with you, just for a little while? After I get a job, I\u2019ll pay you, then after the baby\u2019s born...\u201d Her lower lip trembled and she buried her face in her hands. \u201cOh God, who\u2019s going to hire a pregnant woman?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe,\u201d he blurted. Oh hell, he was totally going to regret this. It was hard enough to keep his distance now, but to see her at his office everyday...He was taking the next client\u2019s request, no matter how small.</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d She lifted her head. \u201cBut what would I do?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, remind me what you went to university for.\u201d</p><p>\u201cInterior design,\u201d she said with a little sniff. \u201cI refused to major in political science, like every other Billingsworth who went to Carolina. I refused go to Carolina, too.\u201d</p><p>He ruffled her hair. \u201cRebel.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m pretty sure an Investigation firm doesn\u2019t need someone to mix patterns or pick out window treatments.\u201d She stood, letting his blanket fall to the couch. \u201cSorry to have bothered you. I\u2019ll go back to my place now. The Governor has given me thirty-six hours to vacate the property.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour dad\u2019s a bastard, if you don\u2019t mind me saying.\u201d Finn joined her, taking her small hand in his.</p><p>Their fingers curled around each other. For long moments, they did nothing but stand there, holding on to each other. She seemed no more inclined to let go than he did. So he stayed, rubbing his thumb along her skin and said nothing.</p><p>Time seemed to slow as her gaze met his, beautifully blue and vulnerable as he\u2019d ever seen. Her grip tightened and he took a step closer to her, bringing their joined hands to his mouth. He kissed her knuckles, then simply held hand against his mouth and closed his eyes.</p><p>Right then, it hit him. He had to say it. He opened his eyes and smiled. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>April tried snatching her hand out of his grip, but it was like vise. \u201cNo you don\u2019t. You just feel sorry for me and want to make me feel better.\u201d</p> <p>He gave her an incredulous look. \u201cBy saying I love you? Of all the reasons a man will say I love you, that isn\u2019t one.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. She was totally screwing this up. The only thing that could make the whole situation worse was if she had said thank you to his confession. \u201cSo you mean it?\u201d</p><p>This time he let go of her hand and ran his fingers through his already messy-from-sleep hair. \u201cIt\u2019s not a phrase I throw around, willy-nilly. Why do you think I bought this house, changed my entire life, my routine...everything?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFor the baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you. Package deal, remember?\u201d</p><p>Yeah, she remembered. Still a shred of doubt remained. \u201cWhat if you don\u2019t love me after the baby is born?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll love you after every baby is born,\u201d he said, his words so firm and confident that she began to believe him. That she allowed the new walls she\u2019d built around her heart to keep him from getting in again to crumble. \u201cI\u2019ll love you when we have lots of grandchildren and hardly any teeth.\u201d</p><p>A giggle escaped her, then a sob, until she was doing both. She had to tell him, had to get it out there before she destroyed her second chance at happiness, even if it scared her to death. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll love you when you\u2019re fat and bald and can\u2019t get it up anymore.\u201d</p> <p>Grinning, he pulled her to him, let go of her hand and wrapped his arms around her. \u201cNever fear, my darling. Viagra has made it so I can always get it up for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou say the most romantic things, Finn Kennedy,\u201d she said, her arms slipping around his neck. Rising on her tip-toes, she gently pressed her lips against his. He growled low in his throat and deepened the kiss, then swept her off her feet.</p><p>\u201cStay the night with me,\u201d he said and a thrill of excitement ran through her.</p><p>She kissed all the parts of him she could reach as he moved to his bedroom and placed her in the middle of his bed. \u201cI missed this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMe, too.\u201d Dipping his head, he placed a kiss on the swell of her belly. \u201cHello, in there. This is your dad and I\u2019d like to marry your mother, if it\u2019s all right with you.\u201d</p><p>A fresh round of tears welled. \u201cStop making me cry. I am not a pretty crier.\u201d</p><p>Smiling, he shushed her and turned his head, placing his ear against her baby bump. \u201cOh, you\u2018d like that, would you? Mommy, the baby says to say yes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBossy baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust like its mother,\u201d he said, then frowned. \u201cA pony? I\u2019m not so sure...okay, you win.\u201d She ran her fingers in Finn\u2019s hair as he continued talking to their baby, her eyes growing heavy. The last thing she remembered Finn saying to her bump was, \u201cYou do have the best mommy ever. She\u2019s a real corker.\u201d</p><p>April was in the middle of packing when the Governor walked through her door. Of course he would show up on the last day, when she was almost done and sorting through her odds and ends.</p><p>\u201cStubborn as ever I see.\u201d His dress shoes were shiny, his suit immaculate and his hair perfect. He reminded her of a snake-oil salesman.</p><p>Carefully wrapping up her great-great grandmother\u2019s candy dish, she placed it in a box. \u201cYou know how those Billingsworth\u2019s are.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bet you\u2019re wondering why I\u2019m here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019d lose that bet.\u201d She smiled, then picked up a pair of candlesticks. \u201cNow who did these belong to?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour great-grandfather on my side. They\u2019re priceless and should be in the Capitol\u2019s history museum, not displayed in some Chippendale knockoff.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHere.\u201d She held them out to him and let them drop from her hands before he could take the brass fixtures. \u201cWhoops, my bad.\u201d</p><p>Her father\u2019s jaw worked. \u201cChildish, April.\u201d</p><p>Placing a hand on her belly, she turned and smirked at the look on his face. Yeah, that\u2019s right, everyone with eyes in their head can see that I\u2019m knocked up. \u201cPregnancy hormones tend to make me temperamental.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not do this, sugar. I\u2019ve come here to apologize.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth dropped open. She couldn\u2019t help it. Her dad never apologized, except to his constituents and it was always the I\u2019m sorry if you were offended B.S.. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be joking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m serious. I was wrong about the baby... my future grandchild.\u201d April rolled her eyes. So now it was his grandchild. \u201cAnd that young man of yours, well, I was wrong about him, too.\u201d</p><p>Something about Chad\u2019s speech didn\u2019t pass her smell test. He was lying or knew something that would be to his benefit. \u201cThen you\u2019ll be thrilled to know we\u2019re getting married. After the baby is born, because I am not walking down the aisle like this.\u201d Not that she minded how she looked right now. Finn sure as heck liked how she looked. The man couldn\u2019t keep his hands off of her.</p><p>Heat rose to her cheeks. That was not something she should be thinking about right now. Finn walked in and she had to look away. His sudden appearance wasn\u2019t helping at all.</p><p>\u201cYou okay, babe?\u201d Finn asked, coming to stand beside her. He placed his arm along her shoulder, very casually, but she could feel the tension that radiated off of him.</p><p>\u201cJust the man I wanted to see,\u201d Chad said, one of those all white, big teeth grins that he saved for campaigning appearing.</p><p>Her stomach roiled. \u201cWhy would you want to see Finn?\u201d</p><p>Chad gave her a look. \u201cThe question is: Why wouldn\u2019t I want to see my soon to be son-in-law Finn Kennedy? President and CEO of Kennedy Investigations. You, young man, are hard to pin down for an appointment.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m booked, sir. Won\u2019t be having any openings for a long, long time.\u201d</p><p>She glanced at Finn. \u201cDon\u2019t turn his money down because of me. Business is business.\u201d But in her heart she didn\u2019t mean it. Choose me, she screamed inside her head, Choose me and our baby, then tell my dad to take his money and shove it.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not here for his business,\u201d Chad said, shocking April and from the looks of it, Finn as well.</p><p>\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d she asked.</p><p>\u201cWant you two to come on the campaign trail. I\u2019ve decided to start putting feelers out for a possible run for President.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf America?\u201d she croaked, but no one was listening to her.</p><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019ve made the right decision by getting back together with Finn, like your daddy told you to do from the start\u2014\u201c Chad winked at Finn and tsked at April.\u2014\u201cour families, the Kennedys and the Billingsworths, can come together, join forces and continue to make this country great.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo unpack those boxes, fill up the fridge and make a table for three. I plan on dining here tonight, with Margo, of course. Can\u2019t discuss strategy without her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d April chanted, her whole world crashing in on her.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d Finn said.</p><p>Chad tilted his head to one side. \u201cI thought you were on board. Our last phone call\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWas a mistake. One I won\u2019t be repeating.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou knew about this?\u201d Trust him, April told herself. Trust him and give him a chance to explain. She knew how her dad operated.</p><p>Finn sliced his gaze to her. \u201cCan we talk about this later, in private?\u201d</p><p>Before she could agree, her dad spoke up. \u201cOh come on, sugar, you\u2019re still not mad at me because your ex wouldn\u2019t take you back and didn\u2019t want anything to do with the baby. It\u2019s been...what, a month now?\u201d</p><p>Great. Now he was attacking them both, trying to pit them against each other. It wouldn\u2019t work, not with her or Finn. She crossed her arms over her chest. Finn\u2019s arm fell away, but a quick glance told her that he had done the same.</p><p>Her confidence in their relationship soared. They were in this together. Not even her slimeball of a dad could ruin it.</p><p>\u201cPlease leave,\u201d she said, echoing Finn\u2019s words. \u201cDon\u2019t come back ever again. I don\u2019t want your money, this house, the minivan...nothing. It\u2019s yours, take it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEasy to say when the man you\u2019re marrying\u2019s loaded. \u201c Chad shook his head. \u201cHave to hand it to you, sugar. You always did know how to land on your feet, just like your momma.\u201d</p><p>She ignored the dig about her mother and looked at Finn. \u201cYou know he\u2019s lying, right?\u201d</p><p>Finn\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to discuss this with you later, in private.\u201d He directed his attention to her dad. \u201cYou heard your daughter. She doesn\u2019t want you here and neither do I.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo much like your mother.\u201d Chad laughed and she bit the inside of her cheek. She was nothing like her mother or him. \u201cGuess I\u2019ll be going now. Don\u2019t bothering contacting me, either of you.\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cTick-tock, children. House cleaners will be here in a couple of hours.\u201d</p><p>She watched her dad walk away, from her house, her life, and his grandchild. A sense of relief came over her. She felt lighter, freer and happier than she had in years. Laughter bubbled up, she couldn\u2019t help it.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gone, Finn.\u201d She uncrossed her arms and wrapped them around Finn. \u201cAnd I\u2019m free!\u201d Only he wasn\u2019t hugging her back or laughing. In fact he looked grim and stoic, his arms firmly crossed and in her way.</p><p>\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d</p><p>Oh God. He hadn\u2019t believe her. She gulped. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you love me?\u201d Finn asked, a frown firmly fixed on his face.</p><p>\u201cYou know I do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen why in the hell would you want to argue with me in front of that dirty bastard? We\u2019re a team. There\u2019s no need to pretend to be solidified in front of him. We are solidified.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>Finally, finally, he uncrossed his arms, sat on the edge of the dining table and drew her between his legs. \u201cI don\u2019t give a flying fuck what Billingsworth has to say, about anything and especially about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHell, no. I voted for the other guy.\u201d</p><p>April didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. \u201cI voted for the other guy too, but just to spite my dad. He does have some really good policies and I think, when he was younger, he truly thought he could change the world, make it better. But politics changed him.\u201d</p><p>He stroked her cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re a good daughter to think so, but power tends to bring out the qualities that are already hidden inside of us, be they good or bad.\u201d</p><p>\u201cQuite the philosopher, Mr. Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou mean quite the reader of superhero comic books,\u201d he corrected, then ran a hand through his hair. \u201cThat phone call he mentioned...I haven\u2019t spoken to Billingsworth since the day he found us together. I swear I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI believe you,\u201d she said. She really did. \u201cSo...you and me, we\u2019re still together and in love until our teeth fall out?\u201d</p><p>\u201cLonger than that, babe, longer than that.\u201d</p><p>She kissed him, then leaned back. \u201cYou know, I love it when you call me \u2018babe\u2019.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat I do, babe.\u201d He dipped his head, claiming her mouth in a kiss that made her forget all about packing and moving and politics and everything else that wasn\u2019t Finn.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t forget how happy she was in this moment. \u201cI love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDitto,\u201d he said with a smirk.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a Patrick Swayze fan?\u201d</p><p>\u201cReal men watch chick flicks, April.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood thing I got me a real man, then.\u201d</p><p>Smirk giving way to a real smile, he hopped down from the table and took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><p>They walked out the front door and into the sunshine.</p><p>It occurred to her that she had never bothered to ask Finn about his financial status. She knew he did well for himself, but her dad had made that comment for a reason. \u201cAre you really loaded?\u201d</p><p>\u201cRicher than God himself,\u201d Finn answered cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cIs this like the time you told me your\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is that big.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFinn.\u201d</p><p>He lifted a brow. \u201cApril.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs this how it\u2019s always going to be between us?\u201d</p><p>He laced his fingers through her and grinned. \u201cI sure as hell hope so.\u201d</p> <p>Epilogue</p><p>Eight months later</p><p>Finn adjusted his cuff links, then looked over at his brother. \u201cReady.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll do, I guess.\u201d William smiled, bouncing his nephew in his arms. \u201cThe ring bearer\u2019s ready, too.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Neil?\u201d Finn asked, looking for William\u2019s partner.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s with Alice. She had a wee bit of a problem sharing flower girl duties.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGirls are drama,\u201d Finn said as they walked out of the makeshift dressing room and into his back yard. \u201cYou sure he didn\u2019t mind walking her down the aisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNeil was touched and honored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGood.\u201d Finn glanced around, making sure that everything was perfect for his bride.</p><p>Chairs lined each side, with a white runner down the middle. A trio of musicians played a banjo, violin and cello. Flowers were everywhere, as were kids and the new friends he and April had made in their neighborhood.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t faint on me, Finn. I\u2019ll kick your arse,\u201d William growled.</p><p>Finn rolled his eyes, striding to the pastor. \u201cDon\u2019t get your knickers in bunch. I was admiring the d\u00e9cor.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re such a pussy,\u201d William whispered as Hunter joined them.</p><p>Hunter clapped Finn on the back. \u201cGreat job on the d\u00e9cor, man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJesus and Mary, there\u2019s two of you now?\u201d William placed Aidan in a pram festooned with ribbons and flowers. The baby fussed, then settled back into a deep sleep.</p><p>Hunter grinned. \u201cReal men like weddings, William.\u201d</p><p>Two flowers girls, one wedding attendant and a maid of honor later, the Wedding March started. April appeared with Neil at her side. She was beautiful, taking his breath away.</p><p>She seemed to float toward him, taking a hand that shook like crazy. He said the right words at the right time, barely able to concentrate on anything that wasn\u2019t her.</p><p>After the kiss, they strolled down the aisle hand in hand, only to come face to face with April\u2019s father. He stood in the shadows, watching.</p><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t come here to impose on you. Just wanted to say congratulations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Finn said, turning as his brother, Neil, and his niece joined them with Aidan.</p><p>Neil handed the baby over to April without a word.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see to the food,\u201d William said and Finn nodded.</p><p>\u201cIs that him?\u201d Chad asked, then grimaced. \u201cStupid question. Who else\u2019s baby would my daughter be holding? Anyway, I\u2019m happy for you both and wish the three of you the best.\u201d He stated to walk away.</p><p>\u201cWait,\u201d April said, glancing up at Finn with a pleading look in her eyes. \u201cWould you like to meet your grandson?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re a team,\u201d Finn whispered. If she wanted to include her dad, he would go along with it. Real men didn\u2019t say no to their brides on their wedding day.</p><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><p>April nodded, her veil swinging with the motion. \u201cYes. We named him Aidan, in honor of Finn\u2019s grandfather.\u201d Carefully, she placed Aidan in Chad arms. Finn had the urge to snatch his son away, but he clenched his fists instead.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous, just like his mother.\u201d Chad bounced the baby a few times, at first awkward, then experience took over and the man began to sway, side to side. \u201cI remember when you were this age and got colic. Your mother and I had to take turns walking the floor with you. We were such a good team, like you and Finn.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s your entourage?\u201d April asked.</p><p>\u201cLeft them in Raleigh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo no photo-op with the bride?\u201d</p><p>Chad shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d He handed the baby back to April. \u201cYou look beautiful, sugar. I wish the two of you nothing but the best.\u201d</p><p>April kissed the top of Aidan\u2019s head. \u201cAre you heading back now?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d For a moment hope shone in Chad\u2019s eyes, but then April turned and walked away, without saying good-bye. He glanced at Finn. \u201cGuess I deserved that.\u201d</p><p>Finn wasn\u2019t about to argue with his father-in-law. \u201cYou did. Wish I could tell you not to be a stranger, but lying isn\u2019t my strong suit.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood to know.\u201d Then Chad simply walked away.</p><p>Finn spun around. He found April by one of her oldest friends, Love Leigh Clayborne. Love held Aidan, a pretty smile on her face. Weird name. Nice girl. The two had recently reconnected, and April had been stunned to find that one of her single friends had no problem doing stuff with her and the baby.</p><p>\u201cMay I have this dance, Mrs. Kennedy?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, Mr. Kennedy. Love, will you watch Aidan for a couple of minutes?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI sure will.\u201d Love\u2019s smile grew and she buried her nose in the little tuft of hair that stuck up from his son\u2019s head. \u201cGod, he smells so good. I can\u2019t wait to have one.\u201d</p><p>Taking his hand, April laughed. \u201cI recommend going about it a different way than I did.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, now that Jason broke off our engagement, I might have to do exactly what you did.\u201d</p><p>April\u2019s forehead wrinkled in concern. \u201cOh, no. We\u2019ll talk later, okay?\u201d</p><p>Love nodded, her attention firmly fixed on the baby. A tall, blond-haired bloke joined her and her face lit up even more.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not her ex, is it?\u201d Finn asked, spinning her around as the trio of musicians played.</p><p>\u201cChase? No, he\u2019s one of my exes...from a long, loooong, time ago.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood thing I\u2019m a confident man.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only man I want.\u201d April eyed the couple and laughed. \u201cWould you look at them? They\u2019re friends, or at least she thinks they are. That poor man\u2019s in love with her and she doesn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t care much about them right now.\u201d He kissed the top of her head.</p><p>April smiled at him, one full of wicked promises that he sure as hell hoped she\u2019d keep. \u201cThinking about the honeymoon?\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d They would be travelling to Ireland, to introduce Aidan to Finn\u2019s parents and the rest of the Kennedy clan.</p><p>\u201cI have something of a confession to make.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you now?\u201d If she was pregnant again, he would faint. Unmanly, maybe, but babies were exhausting.</p><p>\u201cThat day I drove from Raleigh to Charlotte, after everything my dad had planned had gone wrong...I thought I was driving home, but I was mistaken.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were?\u201d</p><p>A confident smile replaced the wicked one. Both were sexy as hell. \u201cYeah, I wasn\u2019t driving home, to a place. I was driving to you. You\u2019re my home.\u201d</p><p>His throat felt a little tight. \u201cI love you, April Kennedy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Hunter leaned in, his wife tugging on his arm and mouthing \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019. \u201cReal men cry at weddings, Finn.\u201d</p><p>April rolled her eyes. \u201cReal men kiss their brides, Finn.\u201d</p><p>So, Finn did just that. </p> </body></html>"]
