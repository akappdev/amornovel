The gorgeous Victorian practically glowed, a warm welcoming sight in contrast to the frigid wonderland surrounding it. It was a huge damn disparity to the distress signal they\u2019d received earlier. Right now, everything about this place looked perfect and cheerful. Beautiful\u2014a lot like the woman who lived here.</p><p>Looks, Burke had learned over the years, could be very deceiving.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s still not answering her phone.\u201d His brother\u2019s voice cracked harshly through the chilled air as he tucked his phone in his pocket.</p><p>Cole was bone-deep tired. Burke could feel the weariness coming off his brother in waves. He was certain he reflected the same back, and that Cole felt it, too. Their mother had termed their odd, silent communication \u201cWonder Twins\u201d powers. Burke didn\u2019t need to ask Cole how he felt. He simply knew. And they shared other feelings tonight. Desperation. Edginess. They both shook a little like an addict who\u2019d been on the wagon for a long time and realized that he might just get one more coveted taste.</p><p>No doubt about it, they were both addicted to Jessa Wade.</p><p>\u201cShould we knock?\u201d Cole asked, sounding more uncertain than Burke could ever remember.</p><p>Cole was the darker one. He usually plowed through any given mission without ever letting on that he wasn\u2019t one hundred percent confident. But Jessa had knocked him on his ass, and just over a year later, Cole hadn\u2019t quite recovered.</p> <p>It had been that long since either of them had laid eyes on the lovely girl. Burke still remembered the last time he\u2019d seen her, naked in a hotel room bed, rumpled sheets around her. Her auburn hair had been a sensual contrast to the white pillow. She\u2019d looked like an angel.</p><p>When he closed his eyes, he could still remember the scent of that room. Jessa always smelled like citrus, sweet and sharp. And that night she\u2019d smelled like sex, like him and his brother because they had spent the whole evening inside her. In her pussy, her mouth, her ass. They had taken her over and over again, as though they could imprint themselves on her.</p><p>She\u2019d been the most gorgeous thing he\u2019d ever seen, ever touched.</p><p>He\u2019d left her there with a promise that he\u2019d be back. Cole had made the same promise, kissing her deeply before they\u2019d gone.</p><p>In the last year, everything had gone to shit. God, sometimes that amazing night felt like a fucking lifetime ago.</p><p>\u201cWhy would she leave us a distress message then not answer our calls? Shit. What if she can\u2019t answer the phone because that fucker she married is stopping her?\u201d Cole asked as they walked across the yard.</p> <p>Yeah. The fucker she\u2019d married. Angus.</p><p>According to the reports they\u2019d received from the investigator they\u2019d hired to keep tabs on Jessa, she hadn\u2019t let the grass grow under her feet before moving on. Less than three months after they\u2019d left, she\u2019d traveled to Scotland, apparently met and married some guy named Angus, then returned to the States with him in tow.</p><p>Burke could still remember the day their fantasy of Jessa waiting for him and Cole had come crashing down. Their dutiful personal assistant of five years, Hilary, had kept Lennox Investigations running during their long operation in South America. They\u2019d returned home, ready to hop a plane to New York and claim Jessa for good, but their assistant had delivered the terrible news their private investigator had dug up: Jessa was married. He winced at the memory and tried to console himself with the knowledge that he\u2019d given Hilary an extra holiday bonus to atone for their bad behavior that day.</p><p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t take good care of her,\u201d Burke muttered, wishing he could take something apart with his bare hands. God, he knew he had no right to be, but he was really fucking bitter that she\u2019d married someone else. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even shovel the damn walkway. She could break her leg just trying to get her mail.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhich she clearly retrieved as soon as the storm let up.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s gaze tracked the dainty footsteps in the snow directly to the mailbox, then back to the front door. It was so damn cold those footprints had frozen in the powder.</p><p>It hadn\u2019t been cold in South America. The weather had been hot, so humid he could still feel the thick air clogging in his lungs. The chill of the Virginia night should have been a welcome change, but it only brought home the fact that he\u2019d spent the worst year of his life in a tropical hellhole doing a job that had cost him and Cole the only woman they would likely ever love.</p><p>But when they\u2019d gotten the urgent call twenty-four hours ago, they\u2019d come running for Jessa, anyway.</p> <p>Last winter, as their case had led them to South America and they\u2019d realized just how deep undercover they would have to go, they had left behind a phone number for Jessa to contact them in case she needed anything. While abroad, they\u2019d left that phone with their friend and sometimes employer, Dex James of Black Oak Oil, along with instructions to keep it charged and to contact them immediately if Jessa called. Dex owed them a couple of big-time favors, and it seemed more appropriate to task the man experienced with security\u2014and m\u00e9nage relationships\u2014than their assistant. That poor woman had enough to keep up with in their absence.</p><p>God, he hadn\u2019t expected to survive the op in South America. In fact, neither one of them really had thought they would make it. In the back of his head, Burke had hoped that Jessa would reach out to them. But she hadn\u2019t called. Finally, nearly a year after they\u2019d last seen her, she\u2019d sent a simple text, which Dex had relayed.</p><p>Please. I need to see you. As soon as possible.</p><p>Burke had instructed Dex to call and find out what she needed, but she hadn\u2019t answered. She hadn\u2019t replied to a text back, either. Three planes, thousands of miles, and not a wink of sleep later, they stood outside her house, wondering what the hell was going on. If she needed help, why wasn\u2019t she turning to her husband?</p><p>Unless he was the problem... Had Jessa brought home a man who hurt her, who scared her so much she would reach out to two men who had left her so abruptly after a few brief days of heaven?</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way to know until we find her and ask.\u201d God, he\u2019d faced down some of the most dangerous men in the world, but one sweet-faced five foot three inch woman had him trembling.</p><p>Perhaps because that sweet-faced woman held way more in her hands than his life. She still held his goddamned heart.</p><p>He stared at the front door, his breath puffing out in little clouds. Jessa was behind that door. She\u2019d built a whole new life for herself while they\u2019d worked that op. She\u2019d left New York and her school, found someone new. Jessa had utterly moved on, while he and Cole hadn\u2019t even begun to try yet.</p><p>The wrongness of the situation hit him. It felt like a blow to the chest. Jessa hadn\u2019t just moved down the road, but from one state to another, from one relationship to another. From one life to another.</p><p>\u201cAccording to Dex, she didn\u2019t give us her new address. How did she expect us to find her?\u201d How had he missed that? His brain was overloaded with possibilities.</p><p>Cole turned to him with troubled blue eyes. \u201cShe can\u2019t possibly have a clue that we know where she lives because we\u2019ve kept tabs on her. Was she trying to get us to New York? Is this some kind of fucking game? It feels all wrong.\u201d</p><p>Burke was about to agree. Then the lights went out, all at once. Every last one of them.</p><p>\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Cole tensed.</p><p>Burke could feel him shift. One moment Cole teetered on the edge. The next, his brother was a predator, his every muscle tense and every sense on high alert.</p><p>Scanning the area, Burke focused on small clues. Despite the fact that the house had suddenly gone black, the snow and the moon worked in tandem to illuminate the yard. He could see his and Cole\u2019s boot prints. They had already noted the line of smaller prints that ran from the front door to the mailbox and back. He would bet his life they were Jessa\u2019s.</p><p>But he saw another larger set that led from the side yard, then around the porch. The husband\u2019s? Why would he be creeping around the house and onto the outdoor space in January after a fucking snow storm? Keeping as silent as possible, he pointed them out to his brother.</p><p>Cole nodded, already on it. His stare followed the line of prints. Thick, heavy. They were made by boots Burke estimated were somewhere around size twelve, maybe bigger. Definitely not Jessa\u2019s. Probably not Angus\u2019s, given the location. Then who?</p><p>They followed the footprints and found something that scared Burke even more. Someone had stood by her big elm tree. From the number of cigarettes dotting the snow like nasty little scars on a blanket of white, that someone had been there for a while. Five butts. One still spiraled smoke into the frigid air.</p><p>\u201cWe need to get inside,\u201d Cole whispered. \u201cNow.\u201d</p><p>Burke knew it, too, felt the wrongness. Something nasty was about to happen. The world seemed too quiet, as though simply holding its breath and waiting.</p><p>And then he heard the sharp female scream.</p><p>Burke took off, Cole right beside him. He hit the porch at a run and tried the door. Locked.</p><p>Another scream, high-pitched and primal. Jessa. Sweet Jessa, who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, was screaming. No words, just screams, as though the horror could only be conveyed by yelling.</p><p>Cole hit the door with his full force. It held strong. The door looked solid, and the glass in the middle was a thick stained glass. But the windows nearby looked to be regular glass.</p><p>There was a heavy potted plant sitting at the doorstep. With a grunt, he hoisted it up and tossed it through the big bay window. The glass shattered, the sound splitting the air. He hated making their entrance obvious, but he didn\u2019t see another quick way in.</p><p>Cole followed his lead, using his foot to shove glass free. He kicked at it, trying to make a man-sized hole. This maneuver had the potential to slice him wide open. Not getting to Jessa was far worse. Her screams echoed through the house now, followed by a loud thud. Burke leapt through the window, wincing as protruding glass cut him. The thick coat he\u2019d bought for way too much money at Dulles protected most of his torso, but his knuckles burned with pain. He ignored it.</p><p>There was a loud hissing sound, and then Burke was assaulted by a ball of fur and rage. Big green eyes. Claws. He couldn\u2019t see it as more than a blur of moving animal parts, but that hiss registered as cat. Again, he was deeply grateful for the parka as the big feline clawed the Goretex, trying to climb Burke like a tree. Wishing he\u2019d bought gloves, he reached for the animal. The cat scratched at him, but Burke took it by the back of the neck and tossed it across the room. It fell on the floor with a thud.</p><p>\u201cIs that loud fucker a...cat?\u201d Cole asked, SIG Sauer in hand, pointed at the animal who snarled and shook.</p><p>\u201cYeah. Probably Jessa\u2019s.\u201d She\u2019d talked about buying a house in the country and getting a kitten. Apparently she\u2019d done just that after meeting Mr. Fucking Right.</p><p>The furball whined, assuring Burke that it was still alive. He reached into his holster and pulled his own gun. The weight was reassuring in his hand. He flicked off the safety. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d</p><p>Cole pointed toward the back of the house. \u201cThe scream came from the back, but not the second floor.\u201d</p><p>They ran together on nearly silent feet. It was difficult to see in the darkened house. The only light came from the windows of Jessa\u2019s kitchen, casting ominous shadows.</p><p>\u201cBasement.\u201d Cole pointed down the hall.</p><p>Another scream had Burke running down the hall. His brain assessed the situation, asking all the questions. Was this a domestic situation? If so, how many pieces could he reasonably get Angus\u2019s body into with his bare hands? Or was it an intruder? If so, one or more? What did they want?</p><p>Was Jessa still alive? God, please let her be alive.</p><p>Cole kicked in the basement door. It was dark down there, too. The sharp scent of chemicals assaulted Burke.</p><p>Jessa screamed again, the sound so much louder as they closed in. He charged down the shadowy stairs, his feet taking each step with a short jerk, his hand holding the railing. Cole was hard behind him. No damn way to be quiet now. Whoever was here could hear that they were coming.</p><p>What was that awful smell? Turpentine? Yeah, and a lot of it. He felt the moment his feet hit the bottom, his body jerking to stay balanced. A thin stream of light whirled around, seeking. Burke couldn\u2019t duck fast enough and was nearly blinded when it hit him, his eyes accustomed to the dark. He threw his arms over his face and pressed forward, nearly tripping over something that lay squarely in his path. A body. There was no way to mistake it for anything else.</p><p>\u201cGet out! Get out! I already called the cops!\u201d Jessa\u2019s voice sounded hoarse and shaky.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, it\u2019s us.\u201d Burke took a step toward her.</p><p>\u201cGet out! I have a gun.\u201d She wasn\u2019t listening. He couldn\u2019t see her eyes, but he could practically feel the panic screaming off her. And she was lying. He hadn\u2019t heard a shot, and Jessa didn\u2019t know shit about guns. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cJessa,\u201d Cole barked in that voice that always let Burke know he was taking control and wouldn\u2019t tolerate an argument. \u201cStand down. You\u2019re safe, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole?\u201d Her voice suddenly sounded so small. \u201cBurke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Burke breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cYes, sweetheart, it\u2019s us. You\u2019re safe. We won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>There was an ugly laugh from behind him. \u201cShows what you know, Lennox.\u201d</p> <p>The voice made his blood freeze instantly. Who the fuck would know his name without seeing his face? Unless this someone else had sent the text, not Jessa. And this someone had expected them to come running. Had they walked into a death trap?</p><p>\u201cGive me some light on him, Jessa.\u201d Burke thought his heart rate would slow once he knew Jessa was alive, but now his pulse jacked up all over again.</p><p>The light shifted and illuminated the man lying on the floor. There was an enormous gash on his head, blood dripping everywhere, and he held his hands over his eyes.</p><p>\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no one. I\u2019m nothing now that this bitch beat me in the head and caught me. Doesn\u2019t matter. I already planted the charges. This whole place is going to blow, and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do. I didn\u2019t mean to go down with her. Fucking bitch.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCharges?\u201d Jessa\u2019s hand began to shake, the light bouncing.</p><p>\u201cI recognize that asshole,\u201d Cole snapped. \u201cHe worked for Ricardo Delgado. What the fuck is going on? Delgado died almost a year ago in prison.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s stomach turned. He\u2019d assumed the world would be a safer place without Ricardo Delgado. How was the asshole reaching out with his violent fist from beyond the grave?</p><p>\u201cLater,\u201d he snapped. \u201cWe need to leave before this house blows!\u201d</p><p>The flashlight dropped, and Burke felt something whiz by him.</p><p>He picked it up and aimed the stream of light up the stairs. Fuck. Jessa was running. He didn\u2019t know where she was headed, but they had to get her out of the house damn quick.</p> <p>Cole turned, his body a ghostly shadow in the darkened room. \u201cWho the hell sent you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, Cole,\u201d Burke snapped. He had no idea when the charges were set to go off. It could be right fucking now. He didn\u2019t know if they were on a timer or a remote. The whole house could explode at any minute, and Jessa was running to god knew where. \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to interrogate this asshole, we don\u2019t have time. We have to get Jessa out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll never make it.\u201d The man on the floor groaned. \u201cBitch is going to get what\u2019s coming to her. Well, what\u2019s coming to you. Did you think you could fool anyone? You better pray my bombs kill her. If my boss catches her instead, he\u2019s gonna have a real good time with her.\u201d</p><p>Boss? His stomach turned. If this guy had been working for Delgado and was talking about a new boss... Fuck, this organization hadn\u2019t died. It had more lives than a fucking cat. Was there a new boss out for revenge? How could the bastard know about Jessa and the few precious days they\u2019d spent with her?</p><p>He had a million questions, but no time to ask. They had to get Jessa out. If the man on the floor wasn\u2019t lying, they were all in grave danger. With a deep and angry regret, he turned and darted up the stairs just behind Cole, locking the fucker in the basement.</p><p>\u201cJessa!\u201d Burke shouted.</p><p>\u201cI can hear her going to the second story.\u201d Cole took off after her.</p><p>The light was better upstairs. Jessa had left the drapes open, and moonlight drenched the hallway in an eerie silvery glow. Burke ran beside his brother. They caught Jessa at the top of the stairs, Burke\u2019s arm going around her waist.</p> <p>He\u2019d dreamed of holding her again, touching her. Not once in those dreams did she kick and scream and fight like hell.</p><p>\u201cNo! Let me go, damn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa, calm down.\u201d Burke demanded.</p><p>\u201cLet me go. I have to get him!\u201d Jessa\u2019s voice sounded strangled in her throat. He could feel her hot tears hit his hand.</p><p>Her husband. She was fighting for him. She was clawing at Burke, scratching and fighting to get to another man. His chest buckled. His heart fucking ached. Jessa was in love with someone else and willing to die to save this douche she\u2019d married who\u2019d left her alone to fend off an intruder in the basement by herself.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll get Angus, Jessa,\u201d Cole growled. \u201cWhere is he? You let Burke get you the hell out of here.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAngus? Oh, god. He was in the living room sleeping earlier.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOn it.\u201d Cole turned and ran down the stairs.</p><p>\u201cOh, god. Please. Let me go. I have to get Caleb!\u201d Jessa fought again, bringing her foot forward, knee up to her waist, and kicked back with all her might.</p><p>Caleb? Burke groaned as her heel met his cock with surprising force. He released Jessa and dropped to his knees.</p><p>She wasted not a minute. As Burke strained to get to his feet, she disappeared around the corner.</p><p>Goddamn it. Burke forced himself up. From downstairs, he heard a loud hissing and Cole swearing. Apparently his brother had found the damn cat again instead of Jessa\u2019s husband. He let it go. If Cole couldn\u2019t handle a kitty cat by himself, then all those years as a SEAL had been for nothing. Ignoring the pain, he ran after Jessa.</p><p>Who the fuck was Caleb? Another lover? Why hadn\u2019t the investigator\u2019s report mentioned him? And why did Jessa think he was worth dying over?</p><p>He lurched down the hall. There was no question where she had gone. Only one door was open at the end of the corridor.</p><p>Rage churned in his gut. She\u2019d obviously never loved him or Cole. He\u2019d tortured himself nightly with visions of her, sweet and warm and loving, while she\u2019d run happily off and apparently found not one but two men. Well, he and Cole had shown her the pleasures of m\u00e9nage. He guessed it was all their fault. She\u2019d taken to it beautifully even though she\u2019d been a virgin at the time.</p><p>Yet he couldn\u2019t walk away. He was going to get Jessa, Angus, and this Caleb person out of here if it was the last fucking thing he did. Then he was going to find some way to get on with his life.</p><p>He stalked into the room, unwilling to take no for an answer. This time he would be ready for her struggles. He would drag her out, kicking and screaming if he had to. He opened his mouth to explain to her just how this was going to go. Then he stopped dead in his tracks. He\u2019d expected to be in her bedroom. This room was filled with stuffed toy puppy dogs and smiling lions. And a crib.</p><p>Jessa stood, tears coursing down her face as she grabbed a swaddled, slightly fussing baby to her chest. She\u2019d slung a big tote bag over her shoulder.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m ready. We can go,\u201d she headed for the door. \u201cAs soon as Cole gets Angus. You should warn him. Angus gets twitchy around new people. He scratches. Uhm, and he throws up. He\u2019s really a terrible cat.\u201d</p><p>Cat? Angus wasn\u2019t her husband, but a cat. And Caleb was... Even in the dark, he could tell the baby was small and very young. He came to one stunning, jaw-dropping conclusion.</p><p>Caleb was their son.</p><p>One year earlier, Christmas Eve \u2013 New York City</p><p>Jessa Wade eyed the ladder.</p><p>\u201cAh, my nemesis. We meet again. Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll best me tonight. This time, I will use you and put you away and come out of the experience unscathed.\u201d</p><p>Fat chance of that happening. And, awesome, she was all alone on Christmas Eve, talking to a ladder. Nothing said \u201cpathetic\u201d quite like that.</p><p>She glanced around the bar of the Hotel DuMonde. Her aunt owned the place, but she was off in Barbados, her usual holiday haunt. Jessa had been invited to go, but she\u2019d had the ridiculous dream that her parents would get into the Christmas spirit and call her home.</p><p>Clearly, that wasn\u2019t happening. So she was alone in the hotel bar, cleaning up and doing inventory. And dealing with a ladder that had it in for her.</p><p>She picked up the martini glasses. They belonged on the highest shelf. The DuMonde\u2019s bar was a magnificent concoction of glass and silver and mirrors that reached to the top of the twelve-foot ceiling. On a normal night, she wouldn\u2019t have to climb up there. Those glasses on the highest level were almost decorative, but the night before had been a blowout of the highest order. Some corporate party. Every damn glass in the place had been used, and the cleaning crew had only just finished with the dishes.</p><p>She sighed. She\u2019d sent the bartender and the waitress home. She\u2019d always heard that Christmas Eve was a big night for bars, but she didn\u2019t have any customers. It hadn\u2019t seemed right to keep those two away from their families when the money would be crap.</p><p>\u201cMiss, a Scotch, please? Single malt.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, grateful for the distraction. Working would keep her mind off the fact that her mother and father had turned her out, and the only relative still speaking to her in the world was currently windsurfing in the Caribbean. She turned to look at her new customer and practically forgot to breathe.</p><p>He stood at the bar, six feet four inches of pure sex. Dark hair, vibrant blue eyes, shoulders that seemed to go on forever.</p><p>\u201cMiss?\u201d He stood there with a knowing smile on his sensual mouth.</p><p>Jessa forced herself back to reality with an inward sigh. He knew how ridiculously hot he was. And she knew she was a waitress who needed to lose a couple of pounds. Her mother\u2019s admonitions came back to haunt her. She would never land a man at a size 12. Her mother, the bulimic. She viewed throwing up as a socially polite way to stay thin. Why had she wanted to go home for the holidays?</p><p>Jessa turned on her best sassy-girl smile. \u201cThere\u2019s no poor single malt. So you get your choice of expensive or even more expensive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, a sarcastic one. Cole, we hit the jackpot.\u201d</p><p>There were two of them? A second wretchedly hot man walked up to the bar, identical to the first. This one shrugged out of his coat. It took all Jessa had to not fan herself despite the cold.</p><p>Cool blue eyes assessed her. She stared back. The two brothers weren\u2019t totally identical now that she really looked. There was something more reserved about this twin. The first had a sensual ease about him. She found nothing gentle in Cole. He was pure predator.</p><p>So why didn\u2019t she want to run? Why was she wondering what it would be like to be caught by him?</p><p>\u201cSaucy, huh? Well, I know how to fix that.\u201d His smile was razor sharp, dangerous. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll both take two fingers of the Glenlivet, fifteen year.\u201d</p><p>So richer. Even more expensive. She reached for the bottle, catching two of the heavy crystal glasses the bar reserved for premium beverages. She poured the Scotch out, measuring carefully before sliding them toward the men.</p><p>\u201cHere you go. Feel free to sit anywhere. It looks like you\u2019re my only customers tonight.\u201d She tried to give them a friendly but dismissive nod. She might be inexperienced, but she wasn\u2019t an idiot. If they weren\u2019t with family, one or both of them might be looking for a lonely heart to share the sheets with tonight. If so, they would hit on her because she was the only woman available here. Best to sidle away now. \u201cJust yell if you need a refill.\u201d</p><p>The first man leaned forward, smiling. \u201cWhy should we yell when we could sit right here and talk to you?\u201d</p><p>Yep, they were definitely going to hit on her. She opened her mouth to shut them down, but Cole put out a hand to stop her. He looked at his brother, and she could see them having a whole conversation with small facial tics and raised eyebrows. She stared in fascination.</p><p>Finally, they looked back at her. Cole seemed to have won the silent argument. He nodded her way, his hand on his glass. \u201cThank you, Miss. We\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready.\u201d</p><p>She watched as they walked to the corner of the bar. Damn, their back sides were just as nice as their fronts. Each man wore tight jeans that molded to perfectly formed butts.</p><p>She sighed. They were way, way out of her league. She didn\u2019t even have a league anymore. Once it had been the debutante circle, but she\u2019d hated the wealthy social whirl she\u2019d been brought up in. She\u2019d hated it so much that she\u2019d turned down a job with her father after the prescribed years at Wharton Business School. She\u2019d played the dutiful daughter, but she couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of working in big business. She\u2019d just wanted to paint.</p><p>And her parents didn\u2019t want an artist for a daughter. They had cut her off with the ruthless precision that had gotten her father to the top. They wouldn\u2019t take her calls or allow her on the grounds of their estate until she came around and accepted a job with the corporation. They had thought she wouldn\u2019t last two weeks on her own, but a year later, she could see the end of the tunnel.</p><p>In a few months she would turn twenty-three, and her trust fund would kick in. Her parents couldn\u2019t stop it, couldn\u2019t touch it. Thank you, Grandmere.</p><p>Jessa turned away from the hotties. They weren\u2019t for her. She had a job and a life. That would have to be enough. Well, she had a job anyway, and right now it involved the hated ladder. She could see herself grimacing in the mirror. Yeah, that was attractive. She grabbed the last of the martini glasses and prayed for grace. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>She started up the ladder, every step a careful move. She passed the rows of vodka and whiskey, rose above the gin and tequila. She stole a look toward the bar. The men sat there, leaning toward each other, speaking in whispers, in their own world. She wished she had a sister or someone to talk to. Despite the heady freedom of the last year, she had to admit she was lonely. She\u2019d pulled into herself and her work, shutting out everyone.</p><p>Would it be so bad to get hit on? Would it be so horrible to finally give in to a man? She was twenty-two years old and out on her own. There hadn\u2019t been time for a relationship, and she\u2019d clung to the idea of true love. Well, that wasn\u2019t anywhere on the horizon. Did she really want to turn another year older without knowing what a man\u2019s touch felt like? No. Ugh, she sounded pathetic. She felt pathetic, too.</p><p>And clumsy. Her foot slipped on a rung. She hadn\u2019t been paying attention. The glasses fell out of her hand, crashing to the floor. The ladder teetered and she began to lose her balance. She groped but had nothing to hang onto. She began to fall.</p><p>Crap. She didn\u2019t have the money to pay for an ambulance, and she\u2019d need one for sure after she fell ten feet. She shrieked and braced herself for impact. She was going to land on shattered glass, cut herself wide open, and break something vital. It was going to hurt so freaking much.</p> <p>She woofed, the air thudding from her lungs as she landed not on hard tile, but in two strong arms. She looked up into Cole\u2019s eyes, her heart racing. He was the most beautiful man she\u2019d ever seen, even more so up close. The only one who matched him was his twin, who stood behind him, a slight smile on his gorgeous face.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, baby?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa,\u201d she breathed. The way he\u2019d called her baby made her shiver.</p><p>\u201cWell, Jessa. You should be more careful,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>Yep, she should definitely be more careful because right now, it felt like she was in big trouble.</p> <p>The woman was serious trouble. Cole knew it the second he laid eyes on her. He\u2019d been a man who cleaned up messes for too long to not be able to recognize that a mile away. He\u2019d done it first for the Navy, then with his brother privately for a lovely fee. This little waitress was the softest, sweetest mess he\u2019d ever had the pleasure to hold.</p><p>Pure, gorgeous trouble.</p><p>The firelight illuminated Jessa\u2019s soft features, making her creamy skin look warm and inviting. She took the drink in her hands, still shaking a bit.</p><p>\u201cThanks. I shouldn\u2019t be drinking.\u201d She took a little sip anyway. Her face twisted up in the most adorable grimace. \u201cUgh. People pay top dollar for this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cScotch is an acquired taste, but it\u2019ll get rid of the shakes. Sip a little.\u201d</p><p>Burke sank into the couch opposite from Cole and Jessa, a knowing smirk on his face. His little brother was just loving this, Cole knew. Burke had wanted to pounce on the redhead the minute he\u2019d laid eyes on her. Sometimes his brother thought with his cock. But they were too close to Delgado right now. Six months on the case and they were finally going to meet the man who had taken their clients\u2019 cousin. They couldn\u2019t get involved with any woman, no matter how beautiful or sweet. No matter how her big green eyes pulled at him or how sexy her curves were. They couldn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cI swept away the broken glass. Everything is fine now.\u201d Burke grabbed his own drink. He didn\u2019t struggle with the liquor the way Jessa did. Burke could imbibe it all night and never notice the effects.</p><p>Thanks,\u201d Jessa said quietly. Her attention moved between them as though trying to pick apart their differences. \u201cI still shouldn\u2019t be dipping into the stock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We won\u2019t tell,\u201d Burke said with a wink.</p><p>Cole had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Burke was using his seductive voice. He wanted this girl bad.</p><p>\u201cTell me something, sweetheart. Why aren\u2019t you at home with your husband?\u201d</p><p>\u201cSmooth,\u201d Cole said under his breath. One of Burke\u2019s shoulders came up in a negligent shrug.</p><p>Jessa\u2019s lips curved up in a smile. She held up her left hand. \u201cNo husband. And before you come up with a subtle way of asking, no boyfriend either. I\u2019m on my own this Christmas. My family, well, let\u2019s just say they aren\u2019t exactly in the picture.\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t like the sound of that. She didn\u2019t look like she could be much over twenty-two or twenty-three. She was living in midtown Manhattan on her own? \u201cAre your parents gone?\u201d</p> <p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. They don\u2019t approve of my choices. I decided to pursue art instead of big business. So they cut me off. Luckily, my aunt runs this place. She gave me a room and a job.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you live here?\u201d Cole heard himself asking. He needed to make sure she was okay, then haul his brother upstairs to their room so they weren\u2019t tempted to linger all night and work their way inside her. Yeah, that was a solid plan. Instead, he found himself settling into the comfy sofa and inching closer to her delectable body. She would be small in between them. She could nestle in the middle, her breasts against his chest, her ass cradled against Burke.</p><p>He glanced at his brother as Jessa talked about her room and the view of Central Park. Burke arched a brow. Come on, brother. She\u2019s right here. She\u2019s gorgeous and she\u2019s alone. We can take care of her. We can make her feel good tonight.</p><p>And what about tomorrow? They\u2019d had the argument moments before Jessa had taken a header off that rickety ladder and almost broken her neck. Cole had just finished his \u201cwe\u2019re-undercover-and-things-could-get-dangerous\u201d spiel when he\u2019d seen her begin to fall. He\u2019d moved faster than he had in forever, getting there just in time to catch her.</p><p>Not that Jessa Wade wasn\u2019t tempting. And so fucking luscious she made his mouth water. She was attractive in a way no woman had been to him before. She also wasn\u2019t a good-time girl. That fact was stamped all over her face. She was the kind of girl a man dated and cared for. Eventually married. She absolutely wasn\u2019t the kind of girl a man shared with his twin brother for the night. She looked so innocent. Hell, she would probably run from a m\u00e9nage if he even suggested it. Not that many women truly wanted one. Sure they fantasized, but when push came to shove...not so much. Then when he added his other proclivities on top of it... Cole winced. Definitely not.</p><p>Of course, he mused as she and Burke chatted, his friend Dex had found a woman to share with his two brothers. And they all topped her. Hell, he and Burke were practically normal compared to the James gang.</p><p>But that wasn\u2019t the real issue. He and his brother were knee-deep in a case involving missing girls being sold into sexual slavery.</p><p>At the mental reminder, he sat back up. Jessa didn\u2019t need to get involved in that. God, she really didn\u2019t need to get involved with them, but fuck if he wasn\u2019t salivating over her. He\u2019d met her thirty minutes ago, and he already wanted to know about her childhood, her favorite foods, and how she\u2019d feel around his cock. Too damn dangerous.</p><p>\u201cGosh, that\u2019s enough about me. I\u2019m going on and on.\u201d She blushed, the color invading her skin like a rosy blanket. He\u2019d been surrounded by tough women for too long. Jessa\u2019s softness was getting to him.</p><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t mind, do we, Cole?\u201d Burke\u2019s question was pointed like a dagger. Don\u2019t fuck this up. I want her.</p><p>Cole wanted her, too, but he was more realistic. Burke was an optimist who thought the world crapped rainbows and that the sun really fucking would come out tomorrow. Cole refused to believe that shit until he saw it. Burke seemed to have gotten all the positive DNA their parents had to give, leaving Cole the broody realist. Still, his mouth moved as though it agreed fully with his cock, rather than his wholly sensible brain. \u201cNo, we don\u2019t mind, baby.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Her gorgeous hair was a deep, burnished auburn. It would look beautiful spread across his pillow while she took his cock. \u201cI\u2019m boring. Poor little rich girl. Not so rich anymore, but that\u2019s okay. Where are you two from?\u201d</p><p>\u201cDallas,\u201d Burke replied. \u201cWe grew up in the suburbs, but we live in the city now.\u201d</p><p>They had a very nice condo with a great view. It had three bedrooms. One for Cole. One for Burke. And one ridiculously oversized master bedroom for the women they shared. They hadn\u2019t shared in a while beyond the occasional one-night stand. Cole was sick of them. He wanted more. But now wasn\u2019t the right time. Jessa wasn\u2019t the right girl, as much as he wished otherwise.</p><p>The conversation flowed, more easily than ever before. Cole found himself drawn out. Usually he let Burke do the charming and he just joined in for the sex. But he really talked to Jessa. He and Burke joked about their childhood and the twin pranks they\u2019d pulled on friends and teachers alike. God, he\u2019d forgotten the fun they used to have. He\u2019d been so mired in the job, the danger. How long had it been since he just relaxed?</p><p>He took another long sip of the Scotch as a slow Christmas song began. Burke got up and held out his hand to the woman in front of him. Damn, his brother was smooth.</p><p>\u201cDance with me?\u201d Burke asked, a hint of a smile on his face.</p><p>Jessa looked around as though assuring herself that they were truly alone. \u201cSure, but on once condition. I get to dance with Cole, too. Don\u2019t say no. It\u2019s Christmas Eve, and I want a present.\u201d</p><p>He never danced. He wasn\u2019t sure he could. And yet after Burke finished twirling her around, Cole found himself standing and taking her in his arms, his hand curling around her little waist. He practically sighed when she put her head on his chest.</p><p>What the hell was he doing? This was a bad idea. But the moment she snuggled closer, he knew there was nothing he could do except sway to the music. The snow fell on the streets of New York just outside the window and, despite the danger and the world\u2019s seedy underbelly awaiting him, Cole Lennox felt happy for the first time in what felt like forever.</p><p>CHAPTER TWO</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Virginia</p><p>The chill in the air hit Burke\u2019s lungs like a knife to his chest. He forced the air in deeper as he moved them outside the house, toward the car.</p><p>Them. Not just Jessa, but Caleb, too. Their son. That truth hammered at him. If the tiny mop of black hair didn\u2019t give the kid away, there was the fact that Jessa hadn\u2019t been around any man for the last year except Angus. Who, it turned out, was a cat. So it was a pretty damn good bet that Caleb was theirs.</p><p>After all, she\u2019d only had two lovers in her whole life.</p><p>How had the PI they\u2019d hired gotten it so wrong? Another question for another time.</p><p>Cole stood by the car. \u201cI couldn\u2019t find anyone else in the house, just that fucking cat. He\u2019s in the car. Obnoxious furball. I called the cops. Let\u2019s get Jessa away from the house in case that idiot of Delgado\u2019s is telling the truth.\u201d Cole frowned as Jessa hurried to the car, the baby swaddled in a blanket against her chest. \u201cIs that another damn cat? No more. The first one has a seriously bad attitude. I won\u2019t mention his breath.\u201d</p><p>The blanket came loose, and Caleb gave a little gurgle, his tiny head turning to take in the newcomers. Unlike his mother\u2019s grim face, Caleb\u2019s was happy. He grinned, showing off a completely toothless mouth.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a baby, Burke. What the hell?\u201d Cole\u2019s mouth hung open.</p><p>If the situation hadn\u2019t been so goddamn dire, he would have reveled in his brother\u2019s surprise. Nothing ever fazed Cole. Even when they had been jumped by ten armed Taliban fighters in an Afghan backstreet, he\u2019d merely killed his half, shrugged and said \u201cI told you so\u201d before popping open another black-market beer. Burke took the opportunity to snatch the keys from his brother\u2019s hands. \u201cYour powers of observation are staggering. Get in the car. We need to reach the cops. Jessa, get in.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll take my car. I have Caleb\u2019s car seat.\u201d</p><p>Burke felt his patience slipping. Did the gravity of this situation not register with her? \u201cYou will get in the car now. Goddamn it, Jessa, someone just tried to kill you. That asshole said he planted charges around your house. Charges mean shit blows up,\u201d he snarled. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many eyes are on us right now. Get in the car.\u201d</p><p>Jessa\u2019s head swiveled as though she was looking for whoever stood in the darkness watching. Her hand went protectively over Caleb\u2019s head, cupping his whole body against hers. She eased into the front seat of the rented SUV and closed the door.</p><p>Cole simply stared at the spot where she\u2019d stood.</p><p>Burke glared at his brother and opened the driver\u2019s side door. \u201cSnap out of it.\u201d</p><p>He pointed back to the house. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to leave her husband to die? She won\u2019t forgive us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere is no husband. Angus is the fucking cat. She wasn\u2019t trying to save her husband, Cole. She was trying to save Caleb, her baby.\u201d</p><p>Cole frowned and shook his head. \u201cThat baby can\u2019t be more than a few months old. If there\u2019s no husband, that means...\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cCaleb is our son, yes. Well, one of our sons, biologically speaking.\u201d Biology didn\u2019t matter in their case. A simple paternity test would tell them nothing of importance. This was their son. It didn\u2019t matter who had actually provided the DNA. Like everything in their lives, it was shared and identical. Caleb was theirs.</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck did the investigator miss this?\u201d Cole snarled. \u201cWe\u2019ve been getting reports for a year, and he didn\u2019t think to mention that she was pregnant? And why would he think Angus was her husband? Can\u2019t the idiot tell the difference between a man and a cat? She had our baby. She\u2019s been dealing with this all alone.\u201d</p><p>Burke totally understood his brother\u2019s fury. He felt it himself. The idea of Jessa in a hospital giving birth without either of them to hold her hand made his heart clench and his stomach turn. \u201cNot here and not now. We have to go.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. Burke could feel the anxiety coming off his brother in waves, but there was no time to calm him down. Burke breathed a sigh of relief when Cole acquiesced, getting into the back of the SUV and shutting the door with a hard thud.</p> <p>Burke hopped in, his heart twisting at Cole\u2019s words. God, his brother was right. Jessa had been alone. They hadn\u2019t even known she needed them, despite all of the money and effort they\u2019d put forth to have a PI keep tabs on her. How the hell had this happened?</p><p>He started the car. The night around them was quiet. The baby cooed. The cat meowed. But the tension between the human adults was thick and pervasive. Burke gunned the car, and it flew down the road.</p><p>\u201cWhich way to the police station? I\u2019d rather not be sitting ducks here waiting for them.\u201d The station would be a good, safe place to stash Jessa and Caleb while he and Cole figured out which of Delgado\u2019s henchman had taken over the business and was looking for a little revenge.</p><p>\u201cWhen you get to the road, take a left.\u201d Jessa\u2019s hands trembled. Caleb patted his mother\u2019s face as though he could sense her fear and was trying to soothe her. \u201cWhy are you two here? Who was that man? He came out of nowhere. I was cleaning the brushes after working on a painting, and he just walked in.\u201d</p><p>That explained the turpentine. \u201cWhat did you hit him with?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI was using some ashes from the fireplace to mix with the paint. It was kind of a metaphor. I\u2019d put them in a bucket and used a poker to stir them. Luckily, I\u2019d brought those to the basement to clean, too. So that\u2019s what I hit him with.\u201d</p><p>Their Jessa fought tough when she had to. \u201cYou did the right thing, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho was he? What does he want with me?\u201d</p><p>Burke opened his mouth to answer her, but the sound of an explosion cracking through the air cut off his reply. A loud boom split the night, and the rearview mirror showed the brilliant flash of orange and red as Jessa\u2019s pretty house went up in a ball of hot orange flames. He could feel the heat of it down the road. Burke fought to maintain control of the car as the earth shook. All around him pieces of the house rained down. They hit the top of the SUV like pellets striking tin.</p><p>\u201cOh, my god.\u201d Clutching Caleb, Jessa cut her gaze out the back window to gawk at the devastation that used to be her home. She gasped, and tears coursed down her cheeks.</p><p>Burke was about to reach for her hand when his cell rang. Goddamn it. He didn\u2019t need to deal with his secretary or a client now. Jessa was far more important. He ignored it.</p> <p>\u201cAnswer it, Burke,\u201d Cole said gravely. His own cell was in his hand as he held it up so Burke could see it in the rearview mirror. \u201cI just got a text. Marco Delgado wants to talk to you.\u201d</p><p>Marco Delgado. The bastard Ricardo\u2019s son. At least he knew who they were dealing with now. But it wasn\u2019t good\u2014at all.</p><p>\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d Jessa asked, panic rising in her tone. \u201cWho is Marco? Is he the bastard who just blew up my house?\u201d</p><p>Burke was glad to see Cole\u2019s hand on her shoulder. His brother whispered to Jessa, attempting to soothe her. Burke dealt with the problem at hand as he drove, gravel crunching under the tires, and answered. \u201cThis is Burke.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWelcome back to the States, Mr. Lennox. You\u2019ve been gone for so long. I trust your flight went well.\u201d There was a silky satisfaction to Marco\u2019s voice.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the one who sent us the text.\u201d There was no doubt. Jessa hadn\u2019t called them when she was pregnant. She hadn\u2019t texted yesterday. In fact, she\u2019d never meant to talk to them again. He compartmentalized that realization to deal with at a better time.</p><p>\u201cI thought it was time we talked. You killed my father.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Burke corrected, his jaw tight with tension. \u201cI put your father in jail for selling young women to bordellos in South America. Some guy doing life shanked his ass.\u201d</p> <p>A fitting end, in Burke\u2019s opinion. It had saved them all the effort of a trial. He and Cole had seen what happened to the women the elder Delgado had sold to his friends in South America. He could still see their haunted eyes. Some had died. Others had lost their souls. He didn\u2019t feel a moment\u2019s remorse about that fucking bastard\u2019s fate.</p><p>\u201cYou might not have thrust the blade in, but you made it possible. Family means something to me. Did you think I would let this pass?\u201d There was a slight pause on Marco\u2019s end. \u201cSince your parents are gone, I went after the next best thing.\u201d</p><p>It took everything he had to keep his hands on the wheel. He knew what Marco meant. Jessa.</p><p>\u201cHow the fuck did you know about her?\u201d Burke held the phone in one hand, his other tightening on the steering wheel. He didn\u2019t want Jessa to hear this conversation, but he didn\u2019t see a way around it. He had to figure some things out and quickly.</p><p>\u201cYou have several people on your payroll, Mr. Lennox. Employees are not family. I learned that the hard way. It\u2019s quite easy to bribe someone. You should know. That\u2019s how you got to my father. By the way, I already killed Michael. He died squealing like a pig.\u201d</p><p>Michael. The young man had been an up and comer in the Delgado organization when he\u2019d had an attack of conscience. Michael had been willing to push the man\u2019s drugs, but not to sell young women into prostitution. He\u2019d become their informant. And his conscience had gotten him killed. \u201cWhat do you want? I\u2019ll meet you. It was my doing. I took the case. I\u2019ll take the blame.\u201d</p><p>A disbelieving snort ripped across the line. \u201cIt\u2019s never just you, Lennox. It\u2019s you and that brother of yours. I thought long and hard about killing one of you, but that lets one of you off too easy. I wanted both of you to suffer as I have, grieving. Then I remembered the delectable Miss Wade. Unfortunately, by the time I tracked her down, she was pregnant. I believe in karma. Nor am I completely cruel. I don\u2019t intend to harm the boy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t think killing his mother would harm him?\u201d</p><p>Beside him, Jessa gasped, a trembling sound full of fear. Burke tried to block her out and focus. Almost as soon as he wished for Cole to comfort her, his brother\u2019s hand caressed her shoulder again. Burke listened to Marco again.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m making a deal here, Burke. I\u2019m a reasonable man, but I like to gamble. I\u2019ve been setting this game up for months now. The pieces are all in place. We begin soon.\u201d</p><p>God, this fucker was insane. But smart. Burke brought the car to a stop at the edge of the road. Once he had Jessa secured by the police, he would call in the feds. He began to turn left.</p><p>\u201cDo you really want to go that direction, Mr. Lennox?\u201d</p><p>Burke stopped, pressing his foot on the brake. The asshole was still watching them? Of course. He must have eyes on the entire road that led up to Jessa\u2019s property.</p><p>Her gaze darted around them nervously. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? The station is about a mile to the west. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><p>He shook his head. \u201cWe have eyes on us.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s gun was back in his hand. Through the mirror, Burke could see his brother watching. His free hand came up, gently pushing at Jessa. \u201cGet on the floorboard, baby. You and Caleb stay down.\u201d</p><p>Jessa went without a protest.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not coming to you as long as she\u2019s in the car,\u201d Burke insisted. \u201cLet me take her and the child to the police, then I\u2019ll come in. So will Cole.\u201d</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a word of protest from Cole, but then Burke hadn\u2019t expected one. As usual, he and his brother were in synch. They loved Jessa. They would do anything to save her, even die.</p><p>Marco chuckled. \u201cYou can take her to the police, but as I said, I\u2019ve been setting up this game for a while now. Ask Miss Wade if she knows a friendly deputy named Fred?\u201d</p><p>He looked down at Jessa. \u201cYou know someone named Fred, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cYes, he\u2019s the man we need to talk to. He\u2019s my friend. He\u2019s on the police force here. He\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d</p><p>No. He was a fucking small-town spy. A puppet, and Marco was pulling the strings. He\u2019d given them this one hint to prove it. Burke turned away from her, speaking into the phone again. \u201cI get your point.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should also know I have friends in the FBI, DEA, and just about every other agency where there are underpaid employees. Oh, you might be able to find the good ones, but do you really want to take that chance?\u201d</p><p>Fuck. His eyes met with Cole\u2019s in the mirror. He could see plainly that Cole was following the logic of the conversation without hearing it.</p><p>\u201cNo police? No feds?\u201d Cole asked, his voice tight.</p><p>Burke shook his head slightly.</p><p>Cole cursed. He knew how fucked they were. They could take the chance and risk Jessa, or they could run on their own.</p><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Delgado?\u201d</p><p>Marco\u2019s voice went ragged. \u201cI want my father back, but since that\u2019s not going to happen, I\u2019ll settle for you feeling just as fucking bad as I do. I am going to kill your girl. If you follow my instructions, I\u2019ll leave your son out of it. If you don\u2019t, then he\u2019ll be collateral damage. I\u2019ve already given you proof of my good will.\u201d</p><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. I waited to blow up the house until you\u2019d taken the child out. I\u2019d rather not kill the boy, but I will if you force me to. You have twenty-four hours to lose the kid. After that, I come in with guns blazing, and I don\u2019t care who gets a bullet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou do understand that if you hurt her, Cole and I will never stop hunting you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh, then our game can go on. I was rather counting on that. Twenty-four hours.\u201d</p><p>The line went dead, and Burke felt his stomach roll. The road stretched in front of him. Three choices. Left to the police, right to the highway, or straight into god knew what. Fuck. What if he chose wrong?</p><p>\u201cHe wants to kill me.\u201d Jessa blinked up at him from her crouched position. It wasn\u2019t a question.</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d There was no way to protect her from that. \u201cYou can sit back in the seat, sweetheart. We have twenty-four hours to stash our son someplace safe, or he\u2019ll kill Caleb, too. I believe him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarco. The son. The gambler. Fuck. I hadn\u2019t even thought about him. He didn\u2019t seem even vaguely interested in his father\u2019s business.\u201d Cole scrubbed a hand across his face, his eyes bleak.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s interested now,\u201d Burke confirmed. \u201cIn revenge especially.\u201d</p><p>Jessa sniffled as she got back to her seat. \u201cWe need supplies. Everything I had for Caleb just blew up. We need a car seat and more diapers and clothes. Formula. He needs formula. He\u2019ll get hungry soon.\u201d She tightened her arms around her son. \u201cGod, please let me wake up. Please let this be a bad dream.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s heart ached. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019m going to fix this.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes met his, anger making them flare. \u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Don\u2019t ever call me that again. I want to go to the police, but I can\u2019t, can I? Some guy hates you and wants to take it out on me, and I can\u2019t go to the police because this jerk has them on his payroll. My nice friend, Deputy Fred, is working for this guy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAccording to Marco, yes.\u201d He would give anything to take away the betrayal on her face. To remove the danger to her life. \u201cAll law enforcement is off the table if we want to be one hundred percent sure of your safety.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSeriously? Even the FBI?\u201d</p><p>He swallowed, bile in his throat. This wasn\u2019t how he\u2019d pictured their reunion. \u201cWe can\u2019t go to them or anyone else. We\u2019re on our own, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019ll spare my son if we take him someplace out of the way?\u201d Jessa\u2019s voice caught, but she had so much strength. She was a mother protecting her child, but she was still listening, assessing, processing. She wasn\u2019t trained for this, but she was handling everything amazingly well. \u201cIf I give myself to him, he\u2019ll spare my son?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not giving yourself up.\u201d Cole barked.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t let anyone hurt you,\u201d Burke assured her. \u201cI believe him about not wanting Caleb involved. He would have blown up the house before we fled if he didn\u2019t. We need to get the baby someplace safe. I know you aren\u2019t going to like this, but we have friends, powerful friends. They\u2019ll absolutely protect Caleb. And we\u2019ll protect you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He reached for her, but she pulled back. \u201cI don\u2019t like any of this, Burke. But I don\u2019t seem to have a choice. It\u2019s just me and Caleb. My parents won\u2019t lift a finger to help us. My only friend here turns out to be working for the enemy. You two are my only option. I want to talk to these friends of yours. Call them. I can\u2019t just turn over my son to anyone.\u201d</p><p>Cole made the call, murmuring, \u201cGavin James will reassure you, baby. You\u2019ll want to talk to Hannah, his wife, too.\u201d</p><p>Burke watched Jessa as she glared at Cole, hand outstretched for the phone. They\u2019d brought her to this place. God, she was never going to forgive them.</p><p>He made a right turn toward the highway that would lead them back to D.C. Gavin would come. Dex and Slade, his brothers, would do anything to protect Caleb, too. Hannah would cuddle and love their boy as soon as she heard the story. And if the worst happened, and none of them made it, the James family would take care of Caleb.</p> <p>Burke resisted the urge to drive his fist through the windshield. God, he wanted to know his son. He\u2019d already missed out on months of Caleb\u2019s life, and now he had to give the boy up? For how long\u2014days? Weeks? He refused to think it could be longer. Or forever. And the thought of Jessa in danger made him even more insane. He began to understand Cole\u2019s violent streak.</p><p>His mind wandered as the miles flew by, images of Jessa laughing played through his brain. Happier times.</p><p>Would she ever smile for them again?</p><p>One year earlier \u2013 New York City</p><p>Jessa hurried inside the little Mexican place, her portfolio in one hand. She was running late, but she couldn\u2019t help the smile on her face. The last few days had been amazing. Burke and Cole had spent Christmas Day with her, taking her for breakfast and lunch, then sitting in the bar while she worked the night shift. They\u2019d had to work the next day. According to her friends on the maid staff, they had been at the hotel for a week, coming and going at odd hours of the night. She wasn\u2019t sure exactly what they did for a living. They had told her something about the import export business, but she just couldn\u2019t see them behind desks. They had too much energy. They were too...dangerous.</p> <p>She hadn\u2019t figured them out yet.</p><p>And she might never. She really didn\u2019t care why they were here. She was just damn happy they were. The restaurant was loud, vibrant, and proudly proclaimed that they sold the largest margaritas in Manhattan.</p><p>\u201cJessa!\u201d Burke stood up, waving her over to the small table he and Cole had claimed.</p><p>With a smile, she made her way toward them, brimming with excitement.</p><p>Burke\u2019s friendly smile lit up the place. Cole was darker. She saw them for what they were, halves of a whole. Just looking at them sparked her creativity. And her libido. Was she really considering doing something about that? Would she really have the courage to be honest with them?</p><p>\u201cI ordered you a margarita. I hope you don\u2019t mind. I remembered you said you liked mango.\u201d Cole didn\u2019t smile as he offered the insanely huge glass to her. He was slightly grave, almost as though he expected her to refuse him.</p> <p>She slid a hand over his, delighted at the relief that crossed his face, the way he relaxed. \u201cI love mango. Thank you. And I have something to celebrate.\u201d</p><p>Burke sat back down. The two men surrounded her. She felt oddly safe when she was between them, which happened often. Whenever they took a cab, she found herself in the middle. Walking through Times Square the night before, she\u2019d had a brother on either side of her, their big bodies a bulwark against the encroaching crowd. She fit between them. She wanted to see just how she fit between them in bed.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re blushing,\u201d Burke said with a grin. \u201cIs this celebration turning naughty?\u201d</p><p>She was sure she flushed even more. \u201cI sold a painting.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes flared. \u201cJessa, that\u2019s wonderful. To a gallery?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. She was going to have a work in a gallery in Soho. It seemed too good to be true. \u201cI didn\u2019t really sell it, but the gallery owner agreed to put it up. I have a painting for sale! She wants to see more. I can\u2019t believe it. I know it\u2019s small, but it\u2019s a start.\u201d</p><p>She was practically humming with glee.</p><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t small,\u201d Cole said, his voice a deep rumble. \u201cIt\u2019s huge. That\u2019s great.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing, Jessa. I can\u2019t wait for your first show,\u201d Burke said with an enormous smile on his face.</p><p>God, if she wasn\u2019t glowing, it was only because it was impossible for human skin to do it. She was pretty damn sure she now understood what it meant to beam with happiness. They were so kind to her. She had spent the last several days basking in it, desperate for this giddiness to never end. She thought about them all day...and all night. Now she knew what she wanted.</p><p>Both of them.</p><p>She\u2019d waited. Well, not exactly waited. Sex just hadn\u2019t come up. She\u2019d spent so many years trying to please her parents by becoming the perfect student. She\u2019d graduated from high school early. She\u2019d gone to college too young to really fit in with her classmates. Since coming to New York, all she\u2019d been able to think about was keeping a roof over her head and food in her belly.</p><p>It was time to have a relationship. This might not last more than a week, but she would know what it meant to belong to someone.</p><p>\u201cWe should celebrate,\u201d Burke offered. \u201cI think dancing is in order.\u201d</p><p>Cole groaned. Though he hadn\u2019t been much of a dancer, she\u2019d loved being held in his strong arms when they\u2019d danced on Christmas Eve. He\u2019d sighed and called himself an elephant with two left feet, but being close to him made all the grousing worthwhile.</p><p>\u201cHow about a movie?\u201d Cole practically pleaded. \u201cOr a show. I\u2019ll go see a show. See, I can compromise.\u201d</p><p>She took a long sip of margarita, wishing she had a tequila shot instead. Liquid courage, she needed it. Instead, she drew in a breath and plowed ahead. \u201cI think we should all go to bed.\u201d</p><p>They both stopped, and in perfect synchronicity, swung their dark heads her way.</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say, sweetheart?\u201d Burke asked.</p><p>She licked her suddenly dry lips. \u201cYou heard me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that you want us in bed.\u201d Cole stared at her like a lion about to pounce on something soft and furry. \u201cAll of us. Together.\u201d</p><p>Yep. They just stared in silence, those blue eyes hot, dissecting. Embarrassment swamped her. Had she been wrong about them? Had she let the fantasies in her head color her judgment?</p><p>Burke\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cYou want a m\u00e9nage, sweetheart? Have you ever had one?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. Oh, she didn\u2019t want to admit more than that. Surely she could fake some experience. She\u2019d seen movies. Mostly R rated, but Jimmy from concierge services had once had a party where some of the guys had gone to the back and watched porn films. She\u2019d sneaked a peek. A long peek.</p><p>\u201cDo you understand what you\u2019re asking for?\u201d Cole asked. He\u2019d completely closed his expression off. Burke had relaxed, his sensual expression almost decadent. But Cole sat stiffly, his whole body seeming to shut down.</p><p>Jessa fought the tears that threatened. She\u2019d thought they both wanted her. Cole, it appeared, was just being nice. If she couldn\u2019t have them both, she wondered if she shouldn\u2019t just walk away. It would be like accepting half of something. Ever since that first night, she\u2019d viewed them as a single unit. She forced a bright smile on her face, hating the sniffle that came out. She\u2019d gotten herself in this mess. She could get herself out.</p><p>\u201cJust kidding.\u201d She forced a laugh. \u201cSorry, guys. I\u2019ll stop telling bad jokes, I promise. Let\u2019s just have a nice dinner, then I\u2019ll head back to the hotel since I have to work tonight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you don\u2019t. Eric is working. I saw the schedule.\u201d Burke raised a dark brow.</p><p>She was a horrible liar. She couldn\u2019t hold the sunny pretense anymore, not with humiliation stinging every corner of her body. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I just go?\u201d</p><p>Grabbing her coat, she stood.</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Burke barked with a ferocious frown. \u201cJessa, sit back in your seat. We need to talk about this.\u201d</p><p>Slowly, she set her coat aside and eased back into her chair. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to say. If you don\u2019t want\u2014\u201d</p><p>Cole snorted, his gaze looking as if it had heated up ten thousand degrees in the last minute, though the rest of his body remained frozen.</p><p>But Burke spoke. \u201cSweetheart, we\u2019re not shocked by the idea. Trust me. We\u2019ve done this a time or two. We prefer to share lovers, but you\u2019re very young.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd very inexperienced.\u201d A fact that obviously made Cole grit his teeth.</p><p>\u201cHow would you know that?\u201d Jessa challenged. It was true, but his assumption annoyed her. She fought the urge to get up and walk away\u2014end this whole embarrassing evening. \u201cYou don\u2019t know my history. I could have had a bunch of lovers.\u201d</p><p>Both men snorted. Somehow they made it seem elegant.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, if you\u2019ve had more than a couple, I\u2019ll eat my socks.\u201d Burke watched her closely, then paled. \u201cYou have had a couple, right?\u201d</p><p>She took another long swallow, wringing her hands. They could see right through her. No sense in lying now. \u201cFine. All right. No.\u201d</p><p>Cole clenched his jaw and sent Burke an accusing stare. \u201cI told you the minute we met her that she was a virgin. Goddamn it.\u201d</p><p>Jessa suddenly felt alone. The twins were looking at each other, their eyes speaking while their mouths stayed closed. Sometimes they retreated into a private world where she couldn\u2019t follow.</p><p>Moments later, Cole stood, buttoning the jacket of his suit coat. \u201cIt\u2019s time for me to leave. She\u2019s too innocent for what I need. I can\u2019t put that on a virgin. Besides, she\u2019s more interested in you. I\u2019ll go back to the hotel. We do have work to do, remember?\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s face fell. \u201cCan\u2019t we talk about this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat the fuck is there to say?\u201d</p><p>She sat there watching them, wishing she hadn\u2019t ever spoken up. They could still be sitting here having a nice dinner and planning to go to a movie or a show together. But no, she\u2019d needed to forge her own path. She always did. She could hear her mother complaining in her head about what an ungrateful daughter she was for turning aside all their plans for her and making her own. Painting, not international business. Two men, not one.</p><p>Jessa listened to them argue. She was on the outside now, but then she\u2019d felt that way all of her life. Even at the lavish parties her parents had thrown, she\u2019d been on the outside. When she\u2019d tried to fit in, going to a school she didn\u2019t want to go to, studying what she didn\u2019t love, it had been terrible. Always on the outside.</p><p>The best thing she\u2019d ever done had been defying her parents. She\u2019d stood up and gotten kicked out, but it had been for the best. She would have suffocated if she\u2019d stayed. She\u2019d been happier since leaving all that behind and didn\u2019t regret her choice for a minute. So why was she retreating now instead of fighting for what she wanted? Wasn\u2019t she simply proving Cole\u2019s point that she was too inexperienced to handle him?</p><p>She wasn\u2019t a child. She might not have slept around, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t deal. She looked at him, really looked at him. She tried to look past her insecurity and see him as he truly was. Jessa gnawed at her lip. How would she draw Cole in this moment? His face was all broad lines and bleak angles, but under the pain she saw gentleness lurking. Yearning even. She would love to draw him, then transfer that image to canvas, the colors of her palate bringing everything to life. Time slowed for Jessa. She studied him as she would a subject she painted, looking deep. Bold colors. He required them. He wasn\u2019t as black and white as he tried to portray. He was a million shades, just like his brother.</p><p>He turned to her, and she realized his carefully blank stare wasn\u2019t about her. He was scared of something.</p><p>Maybe she was fooling herself or seeing what she wanted to see, but his sudden refusal didn\u2019t make a lick of sense. For four days, Cole had been right beside her, eating her up with his stare again and again, silently seducing her with the desire in his remote eyes. Burke was more blatant, but she hadn\u2019t imagined Cole\u2019s attraction to her. What was he afraid of?</p><p>\u201cGoodbye, Jessa.\u201d His voice sounded ragged. \u201cYou have a good time with Burke. He\u2019ll take care of you, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d The word slipped out. Now that she\u2019d truly seen him, she knew deep down that if he let his fear win, it would haunt them all.</p><p>Burke smiled, but Cole scowled, suddenly on the offense.</p><p>\u201cNo?\u201d Cole challenged, leaning in. \u201cWhat is that supposed to mean?\u201d</p><p>Stopping him in his tracks emboldened her. Jessa stood, certainty running through her veins, settling her face inches from his. She was still nervous, but no one got what they wanted by giving up. And she just knew she was doing the right thing. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cIt means that you two are a packaged deal. I won\u2019t settle for half, and that\u2019s what I would get if I only gave myself to Burke. I would get the good and the gentle, but there\u2019d be no balance.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck balance. Stick to Prince Charming. I\u2019m a ruthless bastard.\u201d Cole\u2019s eyes narrowed. His fists clenched.</p><p>She was getting to him.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t need gentle all the time,\u201d Jessa assured him softly. \u201cI need what you can give me.\u201d</p> <p>Cole sunk his hand into her hair and pulled slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t have gentle in me. I\u2019m brutal. I\u2019ll demand everything from you, then want more. I\u2019ll want to give you a little bite of pain, then I\u2019ll get hard at all your little cries. I\u2019ll want to tie you up, spank your ass, and share you with Burke. You\u2019re right; we aren\u2019t exactly whole. And we won\u2019t do this for fun. We\u2019ll consume you.\u201d</p><p>They needed to share her. They balanced each other in every facet of their lives, even sexually. As an artist, she understood symmetry completely.</p><p>She smiled at Burke who sat patiently, awaiting the outcome of their little skirmish with a faint smile. She drank in strength from his encouragement before rising up on her tiptoes and brushing her mouth against Cole\u2019s. The kiss was a soft, sweet caress of lips that had her longing for more.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m game to try every dirty, dark thing you can think of,\u201d she whispered. \u201cBut can you ease me into it? Let me have a lover...\u201d She grinned. \u201cOr two. Then I\u2019ll be ready.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Cole fisted her hair in his hand and pulled, pinning her with a wracked blue stare for a long moment. She could sense the war inside him, the need clashing with the caution. Then he took her mouth.</p> <p>Jessa held on for dear life. She\u2019d been kissed before, but not like this. She\u2019d been pecked and bussed, and a couple of boys had thrust their tongues at her, but Cole dominated. His kiss made her really understand the word. He was in total control. Using his tongue, he surged in, not asking but demanding entry. She gave it because she wanted him inside. She ceded control to him, riding the wave. Her body flooded with a hot swell of desire as his tongue rubbed against hers in a silky slide. She could feel her pussy tightening, her folds warming and softening. Moistening. It was unlike anything she\u2019d ever imagined before. With those hard, sinewy arms, Cole dragged her in, his chest impossibly solid and wide against her breasts. His hips slammed against hers, and she could feel the long, thick line of his erection.</p><p>He wanted her. She trembled. God, she wanted him.</p><p>He lifted his head, his lips almost a snarl, his voice a harsh rasp. \u201cKiss Burke. Let me watch you.\u201d</p><p>Burke stood, smiling and open, as though something had blissfully fallen into place. \u201cYou should do what he says, sweetheart. He\u2019s incredibly bossy.\u201d</p><p>For all the dark passion she\u2019d felt with Cole, a light-hearted joy stole over her as Burke took her in his arms. He kissed her every bit as passionately, but playfully. He nipped, flirted, toyed with her lips, his fingers sliding down her back to rest playfully on her ass.</p><p>Everything. She could have everything. It was right here in her grasp.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s tongue found hers and they danced, a teasing waltz of desire. When he released her, his deep blue eyes found hers, and he kissed her forehead with such tenderness it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered.</p><p>\u201cTake me to your room. I want you both so much.\u201d She reached out to Cole. He hesitated only a moment before he took her hand. She smiled brightly at him. Their circle was complete.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Virginia</p><p>Cole stared at the baby in his arms. The baby peered back with blue, blue eyes. God, he\u2019d seen those eyes in the mirror thousands of times, but he couldn\u2019t remember a time when they\u2019d looked so wide and trusting.</p><p>Caleb. Their son. God, they had a son. Would that fact ever just sink in, or would it constantly spark at him like a live wire?</p><p>The baby reached out, arms and legs kicking in his puppy-print footie pajamas. A tuft of dark hair covered the kid\u2019s head. He cooed, making all sorts of strange sounds that went straight to Cole\u2019s heart, which had been doing weird flip-flops ever since Jessa had asked him if he\u2019d like to hold the baby when they had stopped for gas.</p> <p>A big box store loomed in the near distance. While gassing up, Jessa had used the restroom. Now Burke was inside the store, grabbing everything Caleb would need for the next few days. Cole didn\u2019t like hanging out in the parking lot like a sitting duck, but he wouldn\u2019t leave Jessa or their son unprotected.</p><p>Thankfully, Gavin James was already on his way to a small, private airfield just outside of D.C. They had lucked out when they\u2019d called him. The oil executive was in New York. He\u2019d dropped everything to meet with them and take them to Dallas, where they would leave Caleb behind and start this nasty game of Marco\u2019s.</p><p>He only had a few hours with his son. The knowledge that he might never see the boy again carved a gaping hole in his chest.</p><p>\u201cDa!\u201d Caleb said with a grin on his face.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I bet you say that to all the guys,\u201d Cole joked grimly. Caleb also seemed big on Ma, Ba, and Na.</p><p>At his feet, the cat meowed. At least he\u2019d stopped making that strangled choking sound. Angus didn\u2019t travel well, but with the car stopped, he\u2019d decided to curl up on top of Cole\u2019s feet and purr like an engine.</p><p>How in the hell had he been left babysitting a cantankerous cat?</p><p>\u201cDa,\u201d Caleb said with a forceful kick of his legs.</p><p>If anyone he knew could see him now, they\u2019d laugh their ass off. Cole had to grin. And cuddle his son closer to his chest.</p><p>\u201cHe likes you,\u201d Jessa said as she slid back into the car. She was wearing Cole\u2019s coat, her small body swallowed by it, but he couldn\u2019t have her cold. Despite the chill outside, the car was still warm and toasty, so she shrugged out of the coat as she got in.</p><p>Cole had to swallow before looking up into Jessa\u2019s eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d</p><p>Jessa frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait out here while Burke shops. I know what Caleb needs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already had this argument. You\u2019ll draw attention since you\u2019re wearing pajama bottoms and a tank top. Without a bra. And yes, I can tell.\u201d In fact, he could see the outline of her pert little nipples even through the near darkness, and it was driving him crazy. Cole squirmed, but he couldn\u2019t let his dick do his thinking now.</p><p>She crossed her arms over her chest. As if that was going to stop him from looking. He snorted.</p><p>\u201cI told Burke that if I\u2019d gotten the \u2018we\u2019re going to try to kill you tonight\u2019 memo, I would have dressed for the occasion.\u201d</p><p>That sharpened his focus. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you got tangled up in this.\u201d</p><p>Those words weren\u2019t enough, but he couldn\u2019t say or do anything more at the moment. Caleb settled his little head on Cole\u2019s shoulder. The baby sighed, and Cole\u2019s hand covered the baby\u2019s back as he enjoyed the motion of Caleb breathing in and out, calming him, soothing him.</p><p>\u201cWhat exactly am I tangled up in? Look, I figured out you weren\u2019t really businessmen. I wasn\u2019t ever sure if you were criminals or cops.\u201d</p><p>Something in between, perhaps. \u201cNeither. If you thought we were criminals, why the hell did you get involved?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes rolled, weariness plain in the green depth. The gas station neons illuminated her skin. \u201cStupid, I guess. I was a kid. I thought I was in love.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d tried to tell her. She\u2019d finally wised up, it seemed. She hadn\u2019t called or texted when she\u2019d had their baby. She\u2019d just cut them out of her life. \u201cWe\u2019re private investigators. We were on a case in New York when we met you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWith all the lies you fed me, I figured there was something going on. Do you want me to take him?\u201d Jessa asked, eyeing the baby.</p><p>No. This might be his only moment with Caleb. \u201cHe\u2019s asleep. I don\u2019t want to wake him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAll right,\u201d she replied with a deep sigh. \u201cI think you owe me some explanations. What kind of case were you on? When did it end? And why did you show up at my house tonight?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe were hired by three gentlemen from a country called Bezakistan. It\u2019s a small country just outside the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d She frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t they practice polyandry, multiple men with one woman? Do you guys have a network or something? A Craig\u2019s List for sharing?\u201d</p><p>He felt his eyes narrow. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explain. If you can\u2019t give me a little courtesy, then maybe you should wait for Burke.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her bottom lip, a sure sign that she was nervous. God, he loved that lip. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m on edge. Please continue.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe met Rafe and Kade after a mission. I\u2019d helped their brother, Talib, out of a tough spot. When their cousin went missing, they called. She was only eighteen.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA missing girl? Did you find her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cEventually. Her name was Alea. She went to New York for college. Six months of daily phone calls to her mother, and then nothing. When we started looking into it, we realized that there was a pattern. Alea wasn\u2019t the only girl missing. She\u2019d been working in a club. She kept her wealth and privilege a secret. Everyone thought she was just another student living in an NYU dorm. That was what did her in. Ricardo Delgado ran coke for one of the big Colombian syndicates, but that wasn\u2019t enough for him. He decided to start trafficking women.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, my god.\u201d She put a hand over her mouth and sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s terrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe would find pretty homeless girls or foreign students and clean them up. He would display them in his club, and if they worked out, he would sell them to private owners or South American bordellos. We posed as wealthy men looking for a private pet.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat sounds dangerous. God, Cole, you could have been killed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost was a couple of times. We videotaped our meetings with Delgado when we purchased a young Asian girl. She\u2019s home with her family now. Delgado had friends in the FBI, but it didn\u2019t matter at that point. They couldn\u2019t risk their positions when we had everything on tape, ready for primetime news, so the fucker finally went down.\u201d</p><p>Jessa wiped at her eyes. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about your mission when we met?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd get you involved in all that danger? Hell, no! We never intended to drag you into any of this. We thought we were careful, but Delgado\u2019s son found out about you. Do you remember the morning we had breakfast at the Waldorf? The morning after we first made love? Remember the man who walked up as we sat at the table?\u201d</p><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cYes! Oh, my god, that was Marco? I heard Burke say his name when he was talking on the phone. He blew up my house?\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. Jessa was a sharp woman. \u201cHis father was the man we put in jail. He died shortly after, before he could go to trial. Burke and I were down in South America looking for Alea. According to the authorities, Delgado\u2019s murder in prison was payback from another cartel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you found her?\u201d</p><p>Cole took a deep breath, his hand going to the baby\u2019s back. So innocent. Fuck, he would do just about anything to protect this child from the shit the world could throw. \u201cFinally. Shortly before his arrest, Delgado had shipped Alea off to South America. We went down there and spent three months just trying to find her. It took another month of greasing the right palms so we could eventually rescue her. We pulled her out of a Colombian brothel in one of the worst parts of Medellin. She was strung out on drugs and had almost wasted away.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t tell her how she\u2019d begged them to kill her. She hadn\u2019t wanted to go home, just get her next fix\u2014or die. She hadn\u2019t looked a thing like the vibrant college girl in the picture her cousins had given them. She\u2019d been a shell.</p><p>\u201cIf you found her within a couple of months, why were you gone for a year?\u201d</p><p>He hesitated. Fuck, he didn\u2019t want to tell her how hurt he\u2019d been after being told that she\u2019d married. The kicker was, all that time apart\u2014he and Burke had been almost entirely at fault. Eventually, they\u2019d have to confess how stupid they\u2019d been, just not minutes after seeing her house explode. \u201cAfter we found Alea, we discovered there were another ten families who\u2019d lost their daughters. We brought Alea back home, and her cousins opened their wallets to help us reunite these other women with their loved ones. The families didn\u2019t have the money to pay us, but Tal, Rafe, and Kade did. In the end, we found seven broken women and three bodies. We gave a year of our lives to this fucking case, and we barely scratched the surface of the misery Delgado spread. I feel like we failed. It wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d</p><p>Jessa sat back, solemn. \u201cI had no idea. I thought you had just left.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been buried in drug dealers, slavers, and pimps. I\u2019ve felt so goddamn dirty for the last year, dealing with drug dealers, slavers, and pimps. And we didn\u2019t want to drag you in deeper.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI can understand that you had a job to do, but tell me something, Cole. Do they not have phones in South America? You couldn\u2019t find one?\u201d</p><p>If you had been married, a phone call from your lovers might have pissed off your husband.</p><p>But that hadn\u2019t been the only reason. Instead, he said, \u201cAnd risk those bastards tracing the call back to you? No way, baby. You don\u2019t understand how corrupt these men are or how far their reach extends.\u201d</p><p>She nodded reluctantly. \u201cSince they just blew up my house, I have to suppose you\u2019re right. You could have given me your real names before you left. All I had was a phone number written on a tiny piece of paper. Do you know how easy it was to lose that number?\u201d</p> <p>She\u2019d lost it? \u201cDid you try to call us?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen I found out I was pregnant, yes. But I shoved the paper into my jeans that morning when you left. Housekeeping took my jeans and washed them. No more number. So I waited. I was sure you would come back. You said you loved me.\u201d She sniffled but kept her tough-girl armor around her. \u201cI believed you.\u201d</p><p>Cole closed his eyes, feeling low and sad and twenty kinds of pissed off at fate. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI used every dime I had saved up to try to track you down so I could tell you I was pregnant, but no one knew Burke and Cole Carlisle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Lennox. Our last name is Lennox,\u201d Cole conceded.</p> <p>Jessa simply shook her head as though it no longer mattered. \u201cWhen I was about seven months along, I gave up. I figured the whole song and dance about coming back was just a line to ease your way out of my life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa...\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d She held up a hand, looking moments away from tears. \u201cI understand why you did it. I\u2019ll concede that I would have tried to keep you. I would have cried and begged and been a general nuisance, so you were probably right to lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to lie, Jessa.\u201d His voice started to rise, but Caleb shifted. He had to stay calm for their son\u2019s sake. A son they had to protect above all else.</p><p>\u201cAll this dangerous stuff... This is your life, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This was why he\u2019d stayed away from women like Jessa. \u201cBurke and I joined the Navy when we were just kids. Our parents died when we were fifteen. We had one relative, a cruel bastard of an uncle. He went through any money our parents had, not that it was a lot. When we turned eighteen and the state support stopped, he gave us twenty bucks each and told us to get out. We joined up and made the SEAL program. We served overseas and started our own security company when we were discharged. Burke took heavy fire in Afghanistan. He lost some use of his left arm. The Navy cut him loose. I followed. We take rough cases. It\u2019s the only life I know.\u201d</p> <p>It was brutal and ruthless and never stopped.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t live this way. You know that if we survive this, I can\u2019t be around you. I can\u2019t let Caleb be around you. He\u2019s my baby. He\u2019s my only family. I can\u2019t risk him. I want you gone as soon as possible.\u201d</p><p>Cole felt the cold like never before. He\u2019d told her from the start. He\u2019d warned her. He\u2019d fucking tried to walk away from her, but she\u2019d drawn him in. Damn it, he\u2019d loved her. And now she was telling him he had no place in his son\u2019s life? Bitterness crept through his veins. Caleb was so sweet, so trusting. The kid\u2019s fathers had been in his life for less than two hours, and what did he have to show for it? His house in rubble, and he was on the run. He was about to be separated from his mother. Yeah, Cole saw that he\u2019d been real fucking good for the kid so far.</p><p>Jessa\u2019s lip trembled. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean that. I\u2019m twelve kinds of freaked out right now. I really did try to call you and Burke because I thought Caleb needed his dads. Can we not make any decisions right now?\u201d</p><p>But she\u2019d already made the smart one. Cole pulled Caleb off his shoulder gently and handed him to Jessa. \u201cTake him.\u201d</p><p>As soon as the baby\u2019s soft, sleeping weight left his arms, he clenched his jaw and exited the car. Fuck. He might never hold his son again, but she was right. Caleb deserved better.</p><p>Jessa followed, the coat back around her body. She\u2019d tucked Caleb inside, only a tuft of hair visible. \u201cCole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m no good for him. I never wanted a kid in the first place.\u201d</p> <p>He hadn\u2019t\u2014at least in the past. But now he wanted Caleb desperately. He wanted Jessa. Even that stupid cat who had thrown up everywhere. He wanted the goddamn white picket fence, but his life didn\u2019t work that way.</p><p>Caleb turned his little head, pushing at the coat around him. His sleepy eyes sought Cole. That innocent gaze felt like a stab in the fucking heart.</p><p>\u201cJust do what we tell you and you\u2019ll be with him again. You won\u2019t see me after this.\u201d He would disappear. He would walk into Colombia and save as many abducted girls as he could until he found that bullet with his name on it. Burke would stay. He\u2019d said as much that day in the Mexican restaurant. Burke had been willing to take Jessa without Cole. Burke loved her. He was way fucking smarter.</p><p>\u201cI got everything on the list.\u201d Burke approached, pushing a full cart. At the tension in the air, his eyes shifted, narrowed, quickly figuring out the situation and assigning blame. \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head. He wasn\u2019t having this fight. She was Burke\u2019s now. Burke would charm her, say all the right things. He would take care of her and Caleb.</p><p>And Cole would protect them all from afar.</p><p>When Jessa started to cry, Burke wrapped his arms around her. Cole turned away.</p><p>This was for the best. He wasn\u2019t good for anyone. His uncle had drummed that into his head for years, and given the ugly things Cole had done to survive and put money in the bank, he couldn\u2019t disagree. Jessa and Caleb would be better off if he disappeared from their lives forever.</p><p>One year earlier, December 28 \u2013 New York City</p><p>Jessa wanted to have sex\u2014with both of them. Burke was pretty sure his cock was going to explode. And he was pretty sure his heart wasn\u2019t far behind.</p><p>She was different. He\u2019d known it the minute he\u2019d set eyes on her. Cole was just a stubborn bastard. But Jessa had quickly figured out exactly how to take him down.</p><p>She turned as Burke closed the door to their suite. \u201cIs it okay if I use the bathroom first?\u201d</p><p>He practically laughed. She looked so soft and sweet. She was perfect, and right now she was perfectly scared.</p><p>He pulled her into his arms. The minute he drew her close, she softened against him. \u201cYes, sweetheart. Take all the time you want. If you want to wait, we\u2019ll wait. We can still go out, you know. Nothing has to happen right now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurke is right, Jessa. Nothing has to happen at all. We\u2019re not going to be mad,\u201d Cole assured, his voice low.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be mad.\u201d Jessa frowned, turning her face up to his. \u201cI\u2019ll be very mad. I was promised sex.\u201d</p><p>He kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cI think we can handle that.\u201d</p><p>She nodded and pulled away. \u201cI just want to freshen up is all. Give me a couple of minutes. I promise you that I want this. I want you both.\u201d</p><p>She disappeared into the bathroom.</p><p>\u201cThis is a bad idea.\u201d Cole was always the voice of doom.</p><p>\u201cShut up, Eeyore. She\u2019s made her decision.\u201d Burke looked at his brother with a sigh. \u201cI really like this girl.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I don\u2019t?\u201d Cole challenged. \u201cI\u2019m crazy about her. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever...\u201d</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but he didn\u2019t have to. Burke understood precisely how he felt. He felt it, too. Jessa was special. In fact, she just might be the one. The ease with which she\u2019d handled Cole\u2019s withdrawal into himself proved it. She understood and accepted that they were a strange package deal. Burke couldn\u2019t remember a time when he hadn\u2019t had his brother to rely on\u2014and in many ways to take care of. Cole was more thoughtful, but he brooded. He\u2019d let their fucker of an uncle crawl in his head, and he carried scars on his heart. Burke often had to pull him out of the darkness. Maybe Jessa could finally convince his brother that he was not only worthwhile, but perfect.</p><p>Of course, Cole was the one who had Burke\u2019s back and had risked everything to save him in Afghanistan. Cole was the one who had taken care of his ass, leaving his own military career behind when Burke had taken an IED. Burke might be more functional, more charming, but he couldn\u2019t do much without his brother.</p><p>\u201cI know the timing sucks,\u201d Burke offered.</p><p>\u201cWe have a meeting soon where we\u2019re basically buying a human being. These people are dangerous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re saving a girl. We\u2019re not the bad guys here.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t about to let the best thing that had happened to them slip through their fingers. Jessa didn\u2019t have anything to do with their undercover work. They would catch the bad guys, save the girls, then come back and claim their own woman. End of story.</p><p>\u201cAnd what happens if we find out Alea has already been transported to South America? You know it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019s still in New York. We have to find her. We owe it to her cousins. Fuck. We owe it to her.\u201d</p><p>That was Cole in a nutshell. He wanted to save the whole fucking world. He might be dark, but he truly believed in the light. \u201cWe\u2019ll find Alea and bring down Delgado, but I want Jessa. Don\u2019t we get some reward for all the shit we do? Doesn\u2019t the universe owe us one little slice of happiness? A goddamn future?\u201d</p><p>He knew it sounded selfish, but he had to believe that the battles he\u2019d fought for his country and his fellow man would net him a little happiness. He needed to believe that one day he could lay down his gun and sink into a happy marriage and family, even if his picket fence didn\u2019t look all Normal Rockwell.</p><p>\u201cHey.\u201d Cole put a hand on his shoulder. \u201cI understand. I want her as much as you do. I want her so fucking bad. But I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t think I can change. I need some dark stuff. Maybe not tonight, but sooner or later.\u201d He paused. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hurt her. I\u2019ll leave her to you. I\u2019ll handle the business, and you can be happy.\u201d</p><p>Always the damn martyr. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat about what I want?\u201d Jessa asked.</p><p>Burke turned and saw her standing in the bathroom door wearing nothing but the luxurious robe the hotel provided. Her auburn hair lay against the soft white velour. She\u2019d tied the robe at the waist, but it still gaped, showing porcelain skin and the hint of round breasts.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s being a self-sacrificing idiot,\u201d Burke said. There was no other way to describe it. His brother huffed and sent him a dirty look.</p><p>Jessa merely smiled, looking on with a lazy, sexy indulgence. \u201cHe\u2019s good at that. But I won\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa...\u201d Cole began, his brow furrowing.</p><p>\u201cWe covered this,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cI want you, Cole, no matter how brooding or dark. I don\u2019t just want Burke\u2019s vibrance. I can be difficult, too. I\u2019m not always sweet. Seriously, I\u2019m on my best behavior. But I can be stubborn. When I feel like I\u2019m in a corner, I come out scratching and clawing. I can get lost in my work and forget people exist. I\u2019m not perfect. Can you handle that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can.\u201d Burke was so fucking proud of her. He\u2019d known her for such a short time, but she\u2019d filled up his whole heart so quickly. Sweet and funny and brave. She was smart and talented, and she knew how to handle them. That was so fucking sexy to him.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re sure?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Burke watched her gather her patience. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Cole hesitated, drew in a deep breath, then... \u201cStrip.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s inner caveman had emerged, and for the first time, Jessa\u2019s confidence faltered. Her hands came up to the flaps of the robe, nervously pulling them together.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, sweetheart,\u201d Burke coached. \u201cYou\u2019ve handled him beautifully so far. Don\u2019t stop now. Drop the robe. He wants to inspect you. I want to look at you, too. I want to see the body that\u2019s going to belong to us soon.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou made your choice, Jessa,\u201d Cole said, standing shoulder to shoulder with Burke. \u201cThis is how it\u2019s going to be. We\u2019re in control. We\u2019ll treat you like a princess. We\u2019ll indulge you, but here in our bed, you\u2019re going to submit to us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI promise you\u2019ll enjoy it, sweetheart. We\u2019ll take care of you. Just trust us.\u201d</p><p>With trembling fingers, she pulled at the ties of the robe and let it fall to the floor.</p><p>Burke caught his breath. She was beautiful, all luscious curves and breasts and perfect skin. She stood there, biting her lip, waiting for them to say something.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re gorgeous, sweetheart.\u201d Burke couldn\u2019t take his eyes off her.</p><p>\u201cTurn around,\u201d Cole choked out, twirling his finger to mimic what he wanted. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa took a deep breath and turned, giving them a spectacular view of her backside.</p><p>\u201cGod, that is a gorgeous ass,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cPerfectly heart shaped.\u201d Burke was calmer now. This was going to happen. His brother was in. Now that Cole had seen her naked, heard from her own lips that she wanted him, and she\u2019d shown him trust in baring herself, there was zero chance of him walking away. \u201cWe need to prepare it.\u201d</p><p>Jessa looked over her shoulder. \u201cPrepare what?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour ass, baby,\u201d Cole explained. \u201cWe won\u2019t take you together tonight, but eventually, we want to fill you up.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take your pussy, sweetheart,\u201d Burke explained, voice low. \u201cI\u2019ll work my way into your tight little cunt. You\u2019ll think you\u2019re full then, but then Cole will start in on that sweet backside. Then he\u2019s going to fuck your ass while I take you pussy. Over and over. Or the other way around.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth opened. Then she closed it in apparent shock, but desire lurked there, too. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re not triplets.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTurn around again,\u201d Cole commanded.</p><p>Jessa turned and stared at them. \u201cIt would really be easier for me if you two were undressed as well. I\u2019m feeling a little lonely here.\u201d</p><p>Cole ignored her, eyes narrowed and focused right between her legs. \u201cHer pussy is shaved. How many virgins are bare?\u201d</p><p>Jessa\u2019s skin flushed a pretty pink.</p><p>True, but Burke sure liked the view. \u201cHer skin is exquisite. Imagine what her ass is going to look like after we paddle her.\u201d</p><p>Burke could see her, bent over and accepting Cole\u2019s discipline. His cock twitched. Maybe he would wield the paddle, too. He\u2019d never really wanted to before, simply enjoyed watching his brother do it, but he wanted to be responsible for Jessa, as well.</p><p>Cole walked over to her, still staring down at her perfectly naked pussy on display. \u201cDid you shave for us?\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cI read that men like it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo you know why men like it?\u201d Burke asked, enjoying her slightly nervous demeanor.</p><p>He\u2019d never thought about virginity before, he and Cole having lost theirs at sixteen to an adventurous woman who lived in the same trailer park as his uncle, but now he could see the appeal. Later, when Jessa came into her sexuality, she would be a force to be reckoned with, a goddess. But he loved this brave little nymph, too. All of Jessa\u2019s sexual self would belong to them\u2014the temptress and the girl just opening her wings. The thought did strange things to his heart.</p><p>\u201cUhm, I think they like to look at it.\u201d</p><p>A knowing grin stretched across Cole\u2019s lips. He\u2019d finally relaxed. \u201cI do like to look at it. I\u2019m a little perverse.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA little?\u201d Burke prodded.</p><p>Cole shrugged. \u201cOkay, a lot. But that\u2019s not the only reason. I think she knows, and she just doesn\u2019t want to say it. Tell me the truth, baby, why did you shave your pussy?\u201d</p><p>They were crowding her, one on each side, but she didn\u2019t back down. Burke leaned in and kissed her lips, a soft little touch of flesh on flesh. He played, his lips skimming hers, then retreating. When Burke released her, Jessa turned and accepted Cole\u2019s kiss. His brother\u2019s tongue surged in, never one to simply play. Jessa was breathless when Cole let her go.</p><p>\u201cAnswer me.\u201d</p> <p>Burke touched her, his hand skimming down from her shoulder to her hip, leaving goose bumps along the way. Her nipples tightened, and Burke swore he could smell the musky scent of her arousal permeate the air.</p><p>He let his hand slide from the delicious curve of her hip to the mound of her pussy. Sweetly wet. He closed his eyes. His mouth watered as he leaned in, letting his nose find her neck. \u201cTell Cole why you shaved your pussy.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI heard that men are more willing to do things down there if there\u2019s no hair.\u201d</p><p>He felt a grin split his face as he slipped his fingers through her folds. More arousal coated his fingers. She was getting hot. He was already blazing. \u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><p>She sighed. \u201cYou know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Burke teased. He found the jewel of her clit and ran his thumb over it. Jessa jolted, a little cry falling from those plump lips.</p><p>\u201cI do. She wants you to eat her pussy, Burke.\u201d Cole\u2019s hand slid beside his own.</p><p>\u201cCole,\u201d Jessa gasped. \u201cThat sounds so dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is dirty. But I want to hear you say it. Do you want Burke to eat your pussy? He\u2019ll get his tongue in deep. He won\u2019t miss an inch of your cunt. He\u2019s going to lap up all that cream you\u2019re making and demand more. I\u2019m going to love watching. How\u2019s that, baby?\u201d</p><p>Her voice was shaky as she replied. \u201cI\u2014I... That sounds incredible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen ask him nicely,\u201d Cole commanded, face stern.</p><p>Jessa turned to Burke. \u201cWill you...kiss me?\u201d</p><p>Cole raised his brow, then landed a sharp smack across Jessa\u2019s ass. She jumped, a little huff leaving her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHe spanked me.\u201d Wide-eyed, Jessa smoothed her hand across her bottom.</p><p>\u201cYou disobeyed,\u201d Cole pointed out. \u201cAnd there\u2019s more where that came from if you\u2019re a bad little girl. Now ask correctly.\u201d</p><p>She turned to Burke a bit nervously, her green eyes so beautiful and clear. \u201cI\u2019d very much like for you to eat my pussy.\u201d</p><p>Joy threatened to overtake him. He lifted her up, his arm going under her knees, pulling her against his chest. She was a pleasant weight in his arms, and suddenly Burke was goddamn excited about the future. He set aside all his worries about Delgado and the case. No one would think a thing about Jessa. As far as Delgado knew, he and Cole were only interested in very young, well-trained slaves.</p><p>Jessa was perfect for them. She was the one. He knew it deep down. They\u2019d claim her tonight, and as soon as this case was over, they\u2019d return and claim her forever.</p><p>Burke settled Jessa on the enormous bed, satisfaction pouring through his veins. Wearing a smile as primal lust pounded inside him, he took her ankles in his hands and spread her wide.</p><p>Jessa felt the soft comforter at her back, contrasting with the hard man on top of her. Burke had spread her legs and settled himself between them. She stared up at him, wondering how she\u2019d gotten so lucky. These men called to her in a way no single man had or could. They were pieces of a puzzle she\u2019d been looking to solve her whole life. She fit. She finally fit.</p><p>Burke lowered his mouth to hers, his lips brushing them. She could feel his erection gently nudging against her. He was big, but she wanted him. She wanted to do away with the whole \u201cvirgin\u201d thing and be their woman in every sense of the word.</p><p>As she wrapped her arms around his neck, she silently admitted that she wasn\u2019t being smart. She\u2019d only known them for a few days. But they were already in her heart.</p><p>She returned Burke\u2019s kiss, need sweeping over her, and bucked her hips to his in silent entreaty. She was fooling herself if she thought a few nights with them would do. Already, she wanted a lifetime.</p><p>Burke broke away and started to kiss his way down her body. She shivered as his lips swept over her neck, his tongue grazed her collarbone. He caressed her, seemingly fascinated by her skin. Then he touched her nipples, a tender glide of his thumb. She gasped as he pinched one while his tongue circled the other. She\u2019d never guessed how much sensation the little buds could feel. When Burke pulled her nipple deep in his mouth, she felt it in her aching pussy. She was getting wet. So wet. She closed her eyes and let Burke\u2019s touch bathe her in heat.</p><p>And then Burke\u2019s fingers were replaced with another mouth. She looked down. Cole nuzzled her other breast, and she arched helplessly at the hot, jagged need they created. Two dark heads worked over her, sucking at her nipples, their hands playing at her mound. Someone\u2019s fingers slipped inside her while another toyed with her clit.</p><p>With a last long suck, Burke released her nipple. His tongue delved into her navel, licking a line all the way down to her pussy. Cole growled at her breast, the sensation rumbling along her skin. He bit at her sensitive little tip, taking it between his teeth.</p><p>A little pain was all right by Cole. The way he did it, she liked it, too. When he\u2019d slapped her ass earlier, all she\u2019d been able to think about was what it would be like to lie across his lap, immobile, and take the sting of his palm on her bare backside. Even the thought excited her.</p><p>Cole sat up and began unbuttoning his shirt. Jessa stared. With every inch he revealed, she couldn\u2019t help but notice that he was ripped with pure, hard muscle, every inch of flesh a testament to his strength and determination. Broad shoulders. A sculpted chest. Big biceps. Flat, tight abs. He was a work of art. A tattoo of a dagger, the hilt ornate and detailed, decorated his left arm, and she touched it. Someone with a very steady hand had spent hours crafting this image onto his skin.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t get out of the Navy without a little ink.\u201d Cole shrugged out of his shirt, letting it fall to the floor. \u201cBurke has an identical one.\u201d</p><p>Naturally.</p><p>The thought died when Burke pulled her folds apart and licked at her clit. Then she couldn\u2019t think at all anymore. Tingles erupted across her skin. Fire spread through her system.</p><p>\u201cDoes that feel good, baby?\u201d Cole\u2019s hand was on the buckle of his belt. Jessa watched as he slowly pulled it open and eased his slacks down.</p><p>Good? Burke tormented her. His tongue lashed at her, then he suckled the sensitive bud. He traded little teasing licks with long sucks at her clit. A burning wave of feeling built inside her. It was huge and foreign and a bit overwhelming.</p><p>Cole stopped his slow striptease and growled at her. \u201cYou stay still. Let Burke have his way.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d been moving, she realized, unconsciously trying to escape the need starting to overwhelm her. \u201cIt\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just getting started. You move again, and I\u2019ll spank you red. Do you understand? Burke, let\u2019s finish her off.\u201d</p><p>As though they had planned it, Burke moved lower, spreading her legs even wider with his shoulders, and fucked her with his tongue, filling her and making her writhe and cry out. She stayed still, Cole\u2019s warning still ringing in her ears.</p><p>And then she couldn\u2019t move at all. Cole covered her torso with his big body and the warm press of his skin. He leaned toward her pussy. No, he couldn\u2019t... But he did. In a move of practiced seduction, his mouth claimed her clit as Burke speared his tongue high into her pussy. Sensation ramped up, and she began disintegrating under the onslaught. It was too much. It was everything.</p><p>\u201cCome, sweetheart. Right on my tongue. I want to lick you up.\u201d Burke\u2019s hands tightened on her thighs as he thrust his tongue back in.</p><p>Cole sucked her clit in between his teeth, pulling hard.</p><p>That was all it took. Sensation tightened, seizing her breath and heartbeat, blood pounding. Then she exploded, thrashing and screaming as the orgasm took her. It was more than she\u2019d ever imagined. Pleasure thrummed through every inch of her body as they suckled and fucked her with their mouths until she lay in a boneless puddle.</p><p>As she came down, the twins licked more leisurely, as though they simply enjoyed her taste. She panted, melted, feeling drugged by their very presence. This was where she wanted to be. This was what she\u2019d waited for.</p><p>Her body jerked in little aftershocks. Cole got to his knees. Burke looked up, his stare locking on hers.</p><p>\u201cThat was delicious, sweetheart.\u201d He pushed up and started to undress.</p><p>Jessa watched him. Burke stripped out of his pants. His cock jutted from the V of his thighs. It was big and intimidating, just like the man himself, reaching almost to his navel. She couldn\u2019t take her eyes off the graceful lines and plum-shaped head. What would he taste like? Pearly pre-come seeped from the head.</p><p>\u201cI need you, baby.\u201d Cole\u2019s voice was deep and honest.</p><p>Desire was stamped on his face, and she could tell this was more than just needing her body. He needed her. Whatever insane feelings had overtaken her heart, that expression said she wasn\u2019t alone. She was the only one he wanted. Jessa held her arms out, welcoming him.</p><p>\u201cLift up, sweetheart. I want to be a part of this.\u201d Burke helped her sit up, then slid in behind her, his body half under hers. He wrapped her in his arms.</p><p>Cole tore open a condom and began working it over his cock, his hands shaking.</p><p>\u201cHe wants you. He wants you so bad, sweetheart,\u201d Burke whispered in her ear. \u201cHe\u2019s never wanted anyone like he wants you. You know how I know? Because I feel the same way. We\u2019re crazy about you.\u201d</p><p>She let her head roll back, finding a place in the crook of his neck. His words both soothed and aroused her. His breath played over her skin. His palm cradled her breast.</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes glittered a dark, fathomless blue as he gripped her thighs, cock just barely touching her pussy. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back from here.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her gaze tangled in his. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go back.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cThen you\u2019re ours now.\u201d He thrust up, joining them in a single, smooth move. Her recent orgasm had made her folds soft and swollen. Jessa cried out at the tearing pain as he broke through her barrier and kept sinking deeper. Then the pain faded, replaced by a foreign, delicious fullness that grew with each second.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so good.\u201d Cole groaned and thrust into her with slow, short strokes. An inch in and then out. Another inch, burning, unstoppable. He fucked her carefully, moving in and out, giving her time to take him comfortably. She welcomed the burn. He was so big, stretching her relentlessly and making her writhe.</p><p>Burke\u2019s hands cupped her breasts as he whispered, \u201cTake all of him. Yes, that\u2019s beautiful, sweetheart. So fucking beautiful. You\u2019ll take me next, and I\u2019ll sink so deep...\u201d</p><p>Jessa let her hands find Cole\u2019s back. His skin was hot, smooth, bunched with muscles as he invaded her, his strokes burning and filling her, becoming more and more urgent. Burke pressed kisses along her neck. She was surrounded by them, every inch of space taken up with their feel and scent.</p><p>She belonged to them.</p><p>Cole picked up the pace, his face contorting as he worked over her. \u201cYou feel so damn good, baby. So tight. So...ours.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s hand slipped between them and pinched at her clit. Cole thrust faster, hitting some place deep inside. The kind of pleasure they\u2019d given her with their mouths built all over again, but deeper, more demanding. Jessa whimpered and wrapped her legs around Cole, rushing up to meet his thrusts. She gave herself to him completely.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Cole said on a groan. \u201cGive it to us. Come, baby. Let us have it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can hear you panting,\u201d Burke whispered. \u201cFeel your rapid heartbeat. Your whole body is tensing. Come, sweetheart. Cole won\u2019t resist joining you. You\u2019re too sweet.\u201d</p><p>Burke rubbed her clit with every low word he spoke, and she exploded, pleasure wracking her. Cole held her hips, driving in with hard thrusts, teeth bared, as he came. He called out her name and shoved in as deeply as he could, as though he wanted to fuse them together. His body shook then fell against hers.</p><p>She was pressed between them, Burke\u2019s arms wrapped around her, Cole\u2019s head buried in her neck. She moaned, feeling absolutely exhausted\u2014and at utter peace.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think we\u2019re through yet,\u201d Burke whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>With his soft, subtle warning, her body went on alert.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to through,\u201d Cole added, his lips brushing the space between her breasts before taking a nipple in his mouth tenderly. Between them, she felt special, beloved.</p><p>No. They weren\u2019t through. She would never be through with them.</p><p>Gingerly, Cole withdrew from her pussy. Almost immediately, Burke loomed over her, his sheathed cock in hand. Cole disposed of his own condom, then he eased into the spot Burke had occupied just moments ago, wrapping his arms around her. Her breath caught. Burke smiled seductively as he covered her, slid inside of her, then let out a long moan. \u201cThat\u2019s it, sweetheart. This is fucking heaven.\u201d Another deep stroke, another groan. \u201cAnd I\u2019m never going to want to leave.\u201d</p><p>CHAPTER FOUR</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p><p>The jerk of the plane hitting the runway brought Jessa out of her dream. She blinked, forcing her eyes to focus. Moments ago, she\u2019d been back in a world where everything had seemed warm and perfect. She\u2019d dreamed of the night she\u2019d first made love with Cole and Burke. She\u2019d been surrounded by them, feeling safe and cherished.</p><p>It had been a dream\u2014all of it. Oh, she\u2019d lived it, but it had been her fantasy. In reality, she had been nothing more to them than a way to kill time while they worked a job. She\u2019d been fooling herself, and the proof of her gullible nature was currently sleeping in his new car seat. The bouncing of the plane hadn\u2019t woken Caleb. Nor had it awakened Burke, who slept beside him, hand resting on the baby\u2019s little belly.</p><p>\u201cMy brother can sleep through anything. I think that\u2019s what happens when you spend too much of your life on cargo planes.\u201d Cole rubbed his eyes and stretched.</p><p>\u201cBurke could sleep through Armageddon,\u201d Gavin James drawled, then eyed Angus in his new carrier. The feline gave a guttural meow of supreme displeasure. No surprise since he\u2019d spent most of the flight throwing up.</p><p>With a grimace, Gavin unbuckled his belt, stood and buttoned his jacket, then picked up the cat carrier. \u201cThe car is waiting for us. Hannah has everything ready. You don\u2019t need to worry about Caleb. Or this charming cat you\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>Not worry? The thought of leaving her child behind with strangers tore at Jessa\u2019s gut, threatening to rip her open.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Gavin James said, his eyes hooded. \u201cThat was a thoughtless thing to say. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. Of course you\u2019re going to worry. I have two children of my own, a boy and a girl. I would die a little if I were in your shoes. But I want you to know that I will protect Caleb as though he were my own.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes. She believed him. The man in the thousand dollar suit seemed genuine, despite the fact that everyone around him jumped to do his bidding. He\u2019d been waiting at the private airport outside of D.C. with a Learjet cleared for takeoff. He\u2019d huddled near the back of the plane while Cole filled him in on the situation. She\u2019d heard Gavin try to talk Cole and Burke into staying at his home in Dallas, but she agreed with them. Staying far away from Caleb was safer. She couldn\u2019t risk his little life.</p><p>Burke came awake as the airplane screeched to a halt. \u201cAre we here?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, princess,\u201d Cole replied. \u201cAnd you managed to get your beauty sleep in, as usual. Jessa rested a little, too. We\u2019re going to say goodbye to Caleb and take off before Marco can catch up with us. Did Dex find a car for us?\u201d</p><p>Gavin frowned. \u201cYes. He\u2019s waiting outside with it. He also tried to get hold of Mick Landry. He\u2019s the PI you had watching Jessa for the past year, right?\u201d</p><p>Cole unhooked his seatbelt. \u201cYes. He\u2019s the good-for-nothing son of a bitch who didn\u2019t do his goddamn job. I have a few words to say to him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s going to be difficult. He was murdered two days ago.\u201d Gavin\u2019s words fell like a ticking bomb waiting to go off.</p><p>\u201cFuck,\u201d Burke said.</p><p>\u201cWell, we knew Marco was serious,\u201d Cole muttered.</p><p>\u201cWhy did you hire a PI?\u201d Jessa asked.</p><p>She didn\u2019t understand them. They had walked away without even giving her their real last name, making it impossible for her to find them. But they\u2019d hired someone to keep tabs on her? It didn\u2019t make any sense.</p><p>\u201cWhen we realized how long we were going to be in South America, we hired a PI to make sure you were okay. We just wanted to keep tabs on you,\u201d Cole explained. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to do anything but check on you. Make sure you were safe and had everything you needed. He sent monthly reports to our office. Our secretary forwarded them to us.\u201d He greeted his teeth and cursed. \u201cThe bastard was obviously working for Marco. He told us you married Angus in Scotland this past spring.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMarried? Seriously?\u201d Jessa shook her head. \u201cNo. I went to Scotland because I sold some work at the Soho gallery, and the owner liked me so much she let me spend some time in her house there in exchange for painting it. It\u2019s an old monastery on a gorgeous piece of land. When I came home, I was still only a few months along, so I adopted Angus from the animal shelter.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe had no idea you were pregnant,\u201d Burke said, bitterness dripping.</p><p>She shrugged. \u201cWould it have mattered? You still had a job to do.\u201d</p><p>It wasn\u2019t fair, but she was jealous of their mission. They had spent a full year saving other people\u2019s children while their own child had been born in a county hospital. She could still remember standing outside the hospital with Caleb in a car seat, waiting on a taxi to take her home. She\u2019d been the only new mom with no one to take care of her.</p><p>She could feel Cole\u2019s stare burning through her. \u201cOne of us would have come back while the other stayed and did the job. We wouldn\u2019t have left you alone.\u201d</p><p>The door to the Lear opened, and a big man wearing a cowboy hat charged in. He wore a long-sleeved western shirt, jeans, and boots. The casual outfit didn\u2019t hide the man\u2019s air of authority. A lovely blonde followed behind him, her pretty face grimacing with worry.</p><p>\u201cDex? Seriously?\u201d Gavin James stared at the cowboy. \u201cYou brought Hannah?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s earned a couple hundred licks.\u201d Dex scowled. \u201cBut she wouldn\u2019t be left behind. Slade\u2019s back at the house making some calls. He\u2019s working his way up the FBI ranks, screaming all the way. Unfortunately, no one can prove that this Marco asshole has taken over his father\u2019s business. He\u2019s been perfectly clean for years. We\u2019re in a bind.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter,\u201d Cole said, standing to shake hands with Dex. \u201cMarco has FBI contacts. We could go into protective custody, and it would be a crap shoot. In fact, I think that\u2019s exactly what the fucker wants us to do.\u201d</p><p>The men started talking strategy, moving to exit the plane. The pretty blonde stepped forward and sat down across from Jessa, looking both concerned and kind. She was dressed in white slacks and a colorful sweater that had come straight off a designer\u2019s rack. She was soft and natural, and there was no doubt this woman was well loved.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s beautiful. Caleb, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d This was the woman who would take care of her baby. The blonde reached over and gently touched Caleb\u2019s cheek, a tender look on her face. Jessa liked her right away. She had \u201cexperienced mother\u201d written all over her.</p><p>She turned back to Jessa, holding out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Hannah James. I\u2019m married to those two and one who\u2019s still at home. We have two babies. I promise, I will take care of yours. I love your men.\u201d</p><p>Jessa shook her head. \u201cThey aren\u2019t mine.\u201d</p><p>They had never been.</p><p>Hannah\u2019s perfectly manicured eyebrow rose on her face. \u201cSay that all you like, but I promise you, those men have barely taken their eyes off you. They\u2019re not going to give you up. But that\u2019s an Alpha male for you. They can be obnoxious, but I wouldn\u2019t have mine any other way.\u201d</p><p>Hannah was married to three men? Jessa leaned in, her curiosity getting the better of her. She stole a glance at the two men talking to Cole and Burke. They looked...difficult. \u201cHow do you handle them?\u201d</p><p>Hannah\u2019s smile was brighter than the lights on the plane, her laughter tinkling through the cabin. \u201cOh, they don\u2019t make it easy. They gang up on me. I rarely win a fight... But making up is worth it.\u201d She turned serious, tears pricking her eyes. \u201cTrust me. As difficult as this kind of relationship can be, it\u2019s worth every moment. I wouldn\u2019t know a damn thing about love or happiness without them.\u201d</p><p>Jessa turned away, the look of adoration on Hannah\u2019s face too much for her to bear. \u201cWell, you got lucky.\u201d</p><p>Hannah touched her knee. \u201cI\u2019ve known Cole and Burke for a couple of years now. They would talk about you on their brief trips home. I have never seen them as crazy about a woman as they are about you. Of course, they also haven\u2019t had a case as bad as the one they\u2019ve been working for the last year. If they say they didn\u2019t know about Caleb, then they didn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>Did that really matter? They had left her, walked away, and not returned for a year. They had only come now because they thought she was in danger. Great. They didn\u2019t want her to die. She bet she could find a whole bunch of people who didn\u2019t particularly want her to die. That didn\u2019t mean they cared. And now that they knew about Caleb, whatever they said or did would be colored by the fact that she\u2019d given birth to their son. Jessa didn\u2019t want to be tied to them simply because her reproductive organs worked.</p><p>She glanced at Cole. He stood, looking so masculine it hurt. And Burke\u2019s eyes strayed to hers. She looked away, too confused and angry to meet his stare.</p><p>Burke walked over, his face a grim mask. \u201cWe have to go now.\u201d</p><p>Jessa put a hand to her mouth, stifling her cry. She was leaving her baby, her very soul. A moment later, Cole stood beside his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m so fucking sorry, baby.\u201d Cole started to reach a hand toward her. She flinched. Cole\u2019s face went blank. \u201cThe faster we get out of here, the less chance Marco has of following us. We have cash. We have an untraceable vehicle. We have new IDs. I promise, I will keep you alive or I will die trying.\u201d</p><p>With tears falling, she leaned over and kissed her sleeping child. All this time, Caleb had been her strength. How had she ever thought differently? Shame filled her as she thought of those first, dark days when he had seemed like a burden. Now, he was the light of her life. His sweet smile, his sunny disposition, had kept her going through some very lonely times. Would she ever seen him again? </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI love you, baby boy,\u201d she whispered against his cheek. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>She stood and followed Cole and Burke out of the plane, her heart aching, threatening to seize up. God, she\u2019d give anything to return to a happier time.</p><p>One year earlier \u2013 New York City</p><p>Cole looked around the richly furnished dining room of the Waldorf Astoria, an ornate echo of its grander past. \u201cSo, this is your idea of breakfast?\u201d</p> <p>Jessa\u2019s bright smile lit up the fucking room. What the hell had she done to him? One night with the curvy redhead, and he was practically her lapdog.</p><p>\u201cWell, after you insatiable men ravished me all night, I\u2019m starved,\u201d she said with a wink. \u201cI\u2019m ready for the whole \u2018treat me like a princess\u2019 thing.\u201d</p><p>Oh, he could do that. He slipped his hand into hers and leaned over, kissing her. His whole body still hummed from the hours of their lovemaking. He couldn\u2019t fool himself. It hadn\u2019t been simple fucking. Or even mere sex. He\u2019d made love to her. He hadn\u2019t even understood what the phrase meant until last night.</p><p>\u201cThen that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.\u201d He nodded toward the hostess.</p><p>\u201cWhat is our sweet thing going to get?\u201d Burke asked, looking happier than Cole had seen him in a long time. Burke\u2019s arms wrapped around Jessa\u2019s waist, and he buried his face in her hair. \u201cProbably everything. Poor baby, we gave her all she could take.\u201d</p> <p>Sweet Jessa had finally begged them to stop. They\u2019d been relentless, easing into the snug heaven of her sweet pussy and loving her over and over. Cole had also introduced her to some ass play. He could still feel the way her virgin hole had clamped down on his finger as he\u2019d worked to open her backside up. Soon, he\u2019d take her there, and it would be a supreme pleasure.</p><p>But all their vigorous attention had worked up her appetite for food. And made their poor sweetheart more than a little sore.</p><p>The hostess\u2019s eyes widened as she took in the three of them, but she showed them to a table without staring too much.</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it beautiful? I love New York at holiday time.\u201d Jessa looked around the dining room, all decorated for the season, pleasure evident in her eyes. The haunted look he\u2019d seen in her eyes when they\u2019d first met was gone. A smile of contentment lingered. He and his brother had given that to her. Cole stared across the table at his brother and shared a single thought.</p><p>She\u2019s the one.</p><p>He felt it, knew that Burke felt it, too.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re having one of those silent conversations.\u201d Jessa shook her head as she gave them both pointed stares. \u201cThat is so not fair to me. I don\u2019t have a telepathic link with anyone.\u201d</p><p>Burke snorted. It was something they did almost unconsciously. \u201cIt\u2019s not telepathic, exactly. When you spend your whole damn life chained to someone as ugly as that, you just get to know what he\u2019s thinking. Right now, he\u2019s thinking about bacon.\u201d</p><p>Cole rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, but I am thinking about ham. You, brother.\u201d</p><p>Burke shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ve been called worse. By you mostly.\u201d</p><p>Jessa slapped lightly at Cole\u2019s chest. \u201cYou boys behave. I\u2019m going to run to the more than likely outrageously decadent bathroom, then grab some of that smoked salmon. It all looks so good.\u201d</p><p>She stood. Both he and his brother rose to their feet. She kissed them both lightly, then walked off, her sweet curves swaying.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re in trouble,\u201d Burke said, sitting back down.</p><p>Cole lost his smile. He\u2019d had twenty-four hours to forget why he was in New York. Reality came crashing down, and she was a bitch. \u201cI know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have to meet with Delgado tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Months of negotiating, and tomorrow they would finally meet the man. Up until now, they had dealt with lackeys. The day before they had met Marco, the big guy\u2019s son, who apparently ran the legitimate side of the business. It had been a terribly civilized meeting with absolutely no mention of the business at hand. The super small recording device that Burke wore in the button of his suit coat hadn\u2019t had anything to pick up. The recording would show nothing but three men talking about business interests and recent sporting events. Every time he or Burke would try to get the man to say something incriminating, he would simply smile and turn the conversation toward something less illegal.</p><p>But tomorrow there would be no avoiding it. Tomorrow they met with the man himself, and there would be no way around the fact that they were negotiating to buy another human being. The thought had bile rising in his throat. He wanted to keep Jessa far, far away from this shit.</p><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be over tomorrow. Finishing this up will take days, maybe even a week. We have to take custody of the girl to prove our case, let her tell her story, turn over the recordings and any other evidence we collect. We may have to help set up a sting...\u201d Burke sighed and toyed with the perfectly placed silverware. \u201cFuck, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse, but we can\u2019t veer now.\u201d</p><p>Neither of them wanted to do this. Cole knew what his brother was thinking. He wanted to be with Jessa, in their bed, passing her between them. He wanted to be happy with the one woman who handled and completed them both.</p><p>\u201cLook on the bright side,\u201d Cole said. \u201cYes, we\u2019re going to spend an enormous amount of Rafe and Kade\u2019s money on a slave, but at least one woman will be safe and free very soon.\u201d But Burke was right; they couldn\u2019t back away now. If they did, Cole knew he\u2019d never be able to sleep at night. He would always wonder where Alea was, regret not trying harder to save her. She was only eighteen, for fuck\u2019s sake.</p><p>From the moment he\u2019d seen the snapshot of her young, vibrant face, he\u2019d known that they had to save her. They were bigger and stronger than most men. And he was a predator. His life could have gone one of two ways. He was built to hunt, to kill. He could have taken advantage of those who were weaker. Instead, he chose to protect them.</p><p>It would take everything he had to walk into the fucker\u2019s office tomorrow and not blow a hole through his skull. Delgado deserved it. He\u2019d ruined so many lives. He lived in luxury while the families of the women he\u2019d abducted lived victimized, without hope. He wanted nothing more than to take vengeance on the man. But they\u2019d been hired to find a girl and collect evidence. He\u2019d been hired to save a life.</p><p>\u201cWe could try the feds.\u201d Burke toyed with the fork in front of him.</p><p>Cole shook his head. \u201cNo. Everything we have right now is circumstantial. And you know this bastard has some men on the inside. They would squash the case, and Delgado would probably kill all the girls he still has in the States. Even if we got lucky and found the good guys, the feds won\u2019t move overnight. If we fail to make that meeting tomorrow, Delgado will fold up his tent and disappear for who knows how long. We can\u2019t risk either one happening.\u201d</p><p>Burke nodded miserably. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t risk Jessa, either.\u201d</p><p>The thought of Jessa in danger turned his stomach. All that amazing food had looked so tempting a moment before, and now he couldn\u2019t stand the thought of it. \u201cI pray he doesn\u2019t know about Jessa, but this guy hasn\u2019t risen to the top of a crime family without being ruthless and smart. I know he\u2019s vetted us already.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur cover will hold. I put it in place myself. There\u2019s zero chance he can figure out it\u2019s all made up. I\u2019m a damn good hacker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Burke was the best in the business. If he hadn\u2019t gone into the Navy, Burke might have been a fine criminal. Cole stared at the hall where Jessa had disappeared. \u201cHe can believe our cover and still have someone watching us. You know he had someone at the airport. He knows where we\u2019re staying. He hasn\u2019t stayed in business for so many years without playing it smart and getting to know his clients. I\u2019m worried that if he has someone watching us who I haven\u2019t made yet, he\u2019s going to find out about Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want that any more than you do, man,\u201d Burke replied. \u201cBut it\u2019s done now. We can\u2019t go back and undo last night. I wouldn\u2019t want to. All we can do is lay low. If anyone asks, she\u2019s just a nice piece of ass.\u201d</p><p>Cole clenched his fists. Fuck that. She was so much more. Smart and funny, she\u2019d worked hard for her independence and scraped by, upholding a life and a passion she believed in. Despite her youth and inexperience, she\u2019d done her best to tackle the big, bad world her way. She deserved more than a lie, but he couldn\u2019t give her the truth right now. It would put her in too much danger.</p><p>Jessa bounced back to the table, her smile vibrant, a plate of food in her hand. \u201cI caught our waitress. I ordered coffee for us all. There\u2019s a juice bar, too. There\u2019s just about everything. I love this place.\u201d</p><p>Her obvious joy brought out his own. He\u2019d always felt like he was simply existing, moving from one job to the next, but Jessa made him want to stop and enjoy life for a change. The world had seemed like a shithole before, but that was because he went to all of its dark, terrible places. Jessa reminded him there was goodness, too. She shined her bright light on all of the reasons he had to fight. For her. For all the girls Delgado had manipulated and abused.</p><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll definitely come back soon.\u201d Cole put a hand on hers.</p><p>God, he loved the way her fingers felt threaded through his. Burke reached for her other hand, and their circle was complete. Jessa accepted them. Her warmth was a balm for all the rejection of the past. His uncle had beaten into his head for years that no woman could ever want someone so guarded and angry. Females had used him before to get closer to Burke, then ditched him like trash once they thought they had his brother\u2019s attention. Jessa simply held on to them both in the golden glow of her adoration.</p><p>She squeezed his hand. \u201cIf I eat here too often, I might end up weighing four hundred pounds.\u201d</p><p>And he would still love her. Fuck. He was in love with her. He loved her smile and her rich auburn hair and the curve of her hips. He loved her quirky view of the world. Seeing everything through her eyes was a startling revelation. Jessa had been through hell with her parents. They\u2019d rejected her true soul and cut her off when she\u2019d refused to conform. Still, she\u2019d managed to move on without being bitter or vindictive\u2014or letting their crappy games play with her head. When his uncle had died, Cole had spit on his grave and gleefully continued hating the bastard. Now, he winced. Definitely, he could take a lesson or two from Jessa.</p><p>He and Burke had been drifting emotionally. And they\u2019d guarded their hearts. Jessa hadn\u2019t. She\u2019d been through hell, yet she had opened her heart and asked for love. Jessa was perfect.</p><p>He brought her hand to his mouth, Burke did the same thing, having the same instinct. \u201cGo on, then. Weigh whatever you like. We\u2019ll still want you.\u201d</p><p>She would always look like this to him. His eyes would be broken, lost in this moment. When she was eighty and frail and wrinkled, he would look at her and see her the way she was today. Vibrant. Beautiful. His heart thudded in his chest. He was in love for the first time. The last time. They would never love anyone the way they loved Jessa Wade. She was the end of their journey. His eyes met his brother\u2019s. Not grim this time. Burke was happy and full of love.</p><p>A lifetime of joy spread out before Cole when he\u2019d expected so much less. He\u2019d never once thought that he\u2019d have or deserve this sort of devotion. But it was his. Jessa was his.</p><p>\u201cWell, I never expected to see the two of you here.\u201d</p><p>Cole looked up, a dark voice yanking him out of his thoughts. He felt his eyes flare as he caught sight of Marco Delgado standing at the end of their table in a perfectly tailored suit. Marco was the picture of a well-groomed businessman, right down to the bodyguard who hovered behind him.</p><p>Cole felt his stomach turn. He dropped Jessa\u2019s hand, hating the fact that he had to do it. \u201cMarco. It\u2019s nice to see you. What are you doing in this part of the world?\u201d</p><p>He should be in lower Manhattan. There were about a thousand restaurants in the city, but he chose this one?</p><p>Burke\u2019s whole frame had stiffened, his hand dropping Jessa\u2019s, too. \u201cMarco.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled, a reptilian expression. \u201cI have brunch here all the time.\u201d His eyes went to Jessa. \u201cI find it a good way to restore my energy after a busy night.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing the same.\u201d He prayed Jessa would smile and go along with them.</p><p>\u201cHi,\u201d Jessa said brightly, holding out her hand. \u201cI\u2019m Jessa Wade. They have no manners. Oh, well, they have to have some faults.\u201d</p><p>Marco smiled, satisfaction oozing from his pores, as if he\u2019d found a chink he\u2019d thought he\u2019d never find. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, dear Jessa Wade. Such a pretty name. Do you live around here? How did you meet the twins?\u201d</p><p>Cole leaned forward, pulling Jessa back. \u201cShe\u2019s just in town for the weekend.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa\u2019s frowned. \u201cI live here. In Manhattan. I\u2019m an artist.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI live here as well. On the Upper East Side. It is so nice to meet you. I am a business associate of Cole and Burke. How very nice to make your acquaintance. Enjoy your breakfast.\u201d Marco moved off, his bodyguard moving behind him.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s with you two?\u201d Jessa frowned. \u201cHe was nice, and you two were terribly rude. Eat something and feed your inner beasts.\u201d She picked up her plate. \u201cI\u2019m getting some smoked salmon.\u201d</p><p>The second Jessa strode toward the buffet, her sweet curves swaying, Burke turned to Cole, brows furrowed. \u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMarco knows Jessa is important.\u201d There was no denying it. Marco Delgado had just seen into his soul, and there was nothing he could do about it. \u201cWhich means Ricardo will know soon, too.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s whole face tightened. \u201cFuck.\u201d</p><p>Fuck was right. Cole had to hope that Marco wouldn\u2019t remember Jessa. He had to pray that he would write her off as another bimbo who\u2019d fucked a couple of hot guys with too much money to blow. Marco hadn\u2019t been listening in. For all he knew, he\u2019d caught them indulging in a one-night stand. It was okay. It had to be.</p><p>Cole watched Jessa, resisting the urge to pull her into his lap and never let go, and prayed he was right.</p><p>CHAPTER FIVE</p> <p>Present Day \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p><p>Burke put the nondescript sedan in park, well aware of just how tired he was. The neon lights of what had to be the skankiest motel he\u2019d seen in a long time\u2014and he\u2019d seen a few\u2014blinked off and on as though they couldn\u2019t decide to just give up the ghost and die.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d he said, aware that his voice was gravelly, his tone bleak.</p><p>Jessa stirred in the backseat. She\u2019d climbed in when they had left the airport, dragging the small suitcase Hannah had brought for her filled with clothes, a toothbrush, and shampoo. Then she\u2019d curled up and cried a few silent tears after leaving Caleb. He\u2019d seen the quiet shake of her shoulders in the rearview mirror\u2014and it had nearly ripped his heart out. But she\u2019d refused all comfort. She\u2019d shut them out.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that we should stop,\u201d Cole said, rubbing a hand across his eyes.</p><p>Burke shook his head. \u201cWe all need sleep. We have to figure out what we\u2019re doing and where we\u2019re going to stash Jessa while we do it.\u201d</p> <p>Cole took a long breath, then got out of the car, his acquiescence plain.</p><p>Burke turned to look at Jessa. Her face was puffy from crying. God, she was making his heart twist and hurt. He wanted to hold her. It wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure you\u2019re okay. Cole and I won\u2019t allow anything to happen to you. And Caleb is safe. The James brothers will kill anyone who looks at him sideways.\u201d</p><p>She nodded without showing a hint of emotion on her face. It was as though she\u2019d simply turned her feelings off after a river of tears. \u201cI know. I liked them. I believed them.\u201d</p><p>He reached for her, catching her hand in his before she could pull away. \u201cThen believe in us, Jessa. We would die before we let anything happen to you.\u201d</p><p>She tugged her hand free. \u201cUnless, of course, you need to work. Can\u2019t let a little thing like a girlfriend get between you and a paycheck, can you, Burke?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa, we thought you were married,\u201d Cole growled. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cImportant,\u201d she cut in. \u201cJust get this guy so I can have my son back and start rebuilding my home and my career.\u201d</p><p>She opened the door and slid out before he could say another word. Burke smacked the steering wheel, wishing it was Marco Delgado\u2019s fucking head. They should have killed the fucker that morning at the Waldorf. He\u2019d been a loose end that they should have taken out.</p> <p>Fucking hindsight was twenty-twenty. He got out of the car and palmed the key he\u2019d been given just moments before when he\u2019d registered under the name Brian Palmer. Like the sedan, it was suitably bland and nondescript. He\u2019d paid cash. It was one of the reasons he\u2019d chosen this particular lodging. The Hilton would want a credit card on file. Given the fact that Delgado seemed to have been planning this for nearly a year, he would almost certainly be on the lookout for their credit card to ping.</p><p>Cole opened the trunk and pulled out their bags. Burke couldn\u2019t help but notice an addition to the duffel bags he and Cole had carried with them from South America. When Dex James had seen them off, he\u2019d handed over a couple of bags he\u2019d packed from the condo Burke and Cole shared. No doubt, the small briefcase-like bag contained Burke\u2019s computer and an untraceable Internet hotspot device that linked to a satellite. He was pretty sure Dex had also packed some heavy-duty guns and plenty of cartridges, along with the hard drives from Burke and Cole\u2019s office.</p><p>But the beaten brown bag currently in Cole\u2019s hand had another purpose entirely. Burke just knew that it contained ropes, handcuffs, lube, condoms, and other wonderful things needed to restrain and fuck pretty little submissives.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d Burke jibed as he made his way up the stairs.</p><p>Cole turned and glared at him over the top of Jessa\u2019s head.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s some awfully positive thinking, brother.\u201d Burke shook his head as he hit the landing and opened the door to room fourteen. He turned on the light\u2014and wished that he hadn\u2019t. It was clean but old and worn. There was a sadness to the room. Neglect.</p><p>It wasn\u2019t at all what he\u2019d envisioned when he\u2019d fantasized about reuniting with Jessa.</p><p>Cole followed him in, toting his bag of tricks. \u201cDex is the positive thinker. He brought it. After a whole fucking year, it may be full of cobwebs.\u201d</p><p>Dex, true perv that he was, had picked up Cole\u2019s BDSM bag when he\u2019d gone to their place to get the essentials. Clearly, Dex considered the numerous devices with which to sensually torture and pleasure a woman really fucking vital.</p><p>As Burke went back outside to watch over Jessa, Cole set the bags aside and immediately searched the room.</p><p>\u201cCan I go in?\u201d Jessa asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not as cold as it was in Virginia, but it\u2019s still nippy.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged out of his coat and had it around her shoulders before she could protest. \u201cNot until Cole says we\u2019re secure. It\u2019s not a big room. It won\u2019t take more than a minute.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, her head turning toward the Dallas skyline. It twinkled in the distance like a jewel just out of reach. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty. At least you didn\u2019t lie about living here.\u201d</p><p>God, they were in such deep shit with Jessa, they\u2019d probably never dig out, much less get to that bag of tricks. \u201cWe only lied to protect you from this.\u201d</p><p>She laughed, an utterly humorless sound. It seemed that all of her life and happiness had been left behind with her son. \u201cYeah, you didn\u2019t do a very good job.\u201d</p><p>He closed his eyes briefly, the pain that flared almost overwhelming him. They had failed her on every level. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen.\u201d</p><p>She shrugged, continuing to watch the horizon. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so bad once I got my trust fund. My folks wouldn\u2019t give me a loan. They told me I\u2019d made my bed so I should lie in it. Dad offered to pay for an abortion, but only if I came back to the company and behaved the way his daughter should.\u201d</p><p>How close had Caleb come to never being born? He\u2019d only met the little guy a few hours before, but he already loved their son, missed him sorely. It would have been smarter for Jessa to end the pregnancy. She would have been able to get on with her life. But Burke was glad she hadn\u2019t.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to meet your father someday,\u201d he ground out.</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s never going to change. He truly believes he\u2019s doing the right thing. In his mind, being an artist is one step away from being a mental patient. Don\u2019t ask about that logic. Despite the long, convoluted lecture, I don\u2019t understand, either. I had assumed they would want to know their grandchild regardless, but no. I don\u2019t care anymore. I have the trust my grandmother left me, and my art is starting to pay. Caleb and I are going to be fine. Well, if I\u2019m not dead in the next couple of days.\u201d</p><p>Burke couldn\u2019t stop himself. Jessa wasn\u2019t going to like it\u2014but she needed what he could give her.</p><p>\u201cCome here.\u201d He put his arms around her and brought her close. She didn\u2019t fight, but she didn\u2019t return the embrace, either. That was all right. She needed comfort; he would provide it. And just being close to her, feeling the heat of her body, calmed him, too. \u201cI\u2019m never going to let that happen. I swear I\u2019ll die first.\u201d</p><p>She softened slightly, giving him some small measure of hope.</p><p>\u201cThe room\u2019s clear.\u201d Cole stood in the doorway, watching them with burning eyes. Burke could see plainly that his brother wasn\u2019t jealous, but envious that he was hugging Jessa. Cole wanted to do the same thing. Burke felt his twin\u2019s frustration and worry. Cole didn\u2019t trust himself to stop at a hug. If Cole touched her, he would try to mount her, seal their bond again. He wanted to dominate her, sink into her, make her remember who her Masters were, and he didn\u2019t feel he had the right.</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go inside, sweetheart,\u201d Burke murmured.</p><p>She jerked away from him and stomped past Cole. \u201cI told you not to call me that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been good at taking orders.\u201d Burke followed her in. He watched Jessa\u2019s face as she took in the sad room. Though painfully clean, there was only one very large bed. No wonder they charged by the hour rate.</p><p>\u201cWhere are you two going to sleep?\u201d Jessa raised a brow as she sat on the bed.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m planning to wait until you\u2019re asleep, then climb in with you,\u201d Burke admitted.</p><p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d Jessa crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping with you ever again.\u201d</p><p>Several charged retorts ran through Burke\u2019s mind. He swallowed them down. Challenging her when she felt like her back was against the wall wasn\u2019t productive. But god, how he wanted to make her eat those words.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t try to touch you. But we all need rest.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you can sleep on the floor. I don\u2019t exactly trust you to be a man of your word since everything you told me a year ago was a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, we\u2019ve explained that!\u201d Burke felt his temper slipping. Anxiety, adrenaline, and a burning need to fuck Jessa weren\u2019t good for his mood.</p><p>She jumped up and got in his face. \u201cOnly because Marco forced you to. Otherwise, you\u2019d still be working, and Caleb and I would still be at the bottom of your priority list. I\u2019d still know that you\u2019d seduced and abandoned me, but at least I\u2019d have my beautiful Victorian home, my son, and some really beautiful memories of the night he was conceived. Now, all I have is some asshole trying to kill me and the two...\u201d she fumbled for a word, \u201cmercenaries who abandoned me saying they\u2019re going to save me. Forgive me if I\u2019m not thrilled with your sudden honesty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBoth of you, enough,\u201d Cole growled, his voice deep, low, and dominant. \u201cThis argument is pointless and over. I concur with Burke\u2019s plan. You will fall asleep in the bed, then we will crawl in with you and rest. All in favor say aye.\u201d</p><p>Burke smiled. \u201cAye.\u201d</p><p>Jessa glared at them in turn, her mouth hanging open. \u201cYou can\u2019t vote on this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe just did,\u201d Burke said. \u201cAnd guess what? We win. Ah, the joys of democracy.\u201d</p><p>She rolled her eyes. And there it was. A hint of a smile, albeit reluctant. The faintest trace of the Jessa that Burke had been worried was lost forever. \u201cFine. Gang up on me. But don\u2019t be surprised if I toss and turn in my sleep and kick. There definitely might be some kicking.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere might be some spanking, too,\u201d Cole vowed. \u201cThink on that.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s cell rang, cutting off a very interesting turn in the conversation. He pulled it from his pocket and checked the number and frowned at Cole. \u201cIt\u2019s Hilary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho is she and why does she have this number? I thought no one had it.\u201d The chilliness of the question made Burke repress a smile.</p><p>\u201cOur assistant. She\u2019s been running the office in our absence. She procures all the phones we keep around the place, and she has the numbers in case of emergency. Dex picked them up when he got the hard drives. It\u2019s fine.\u201d He swiped his hand across the phone, answering it. \u201cThis is Burke.\u201d</p><p>Cole stood over Jessa. \u201cAre you hungry? I\u2019ll get you something.\u201d</p><p>Burke stepped away as Jessa replied, confident his brother would take care of her while he dealt with Hilary. For some reason, Cole and Hilary didn\u2019t communicate well. Then again, Cole didn\u2019t communicate well with a lot of people. Hilary was competent and punctual. She always did exactly as asked. Burke simply made sure he was the one who dealt with her, just as he dealt with most of their clients. They were reassured by Burke\u2019s affable manner. Cole\u2019s snarling...not so much. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cBurke. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here. You are back in the country, right?\u201d Hilary\u2019s voice was tremulous.</p><p>\u201cYes, we\u2019re both here.\u201d</p><p>She sighed with relief. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re back. Something strange happened. A man came into the office asking all sorts of questions about you and Cole.\u201d</p><p>Marco or one of his henchmen. Burke\u2019s blood ran cold. While Burke wasn\u2019t terribly surprised the bastard would question Hilary, he hadn\u2019t expected Marco to do it so openly. So brazenly. Marco would only do it if he felt entirely confident he could win this game.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk to anyone. I can\u2019t say more, but you need to close the office and work out of the Black Oak building for now. Tell Dex James I said to put you up in a hotel.\u201d</p><p>Marco hadn\u2019t said a word about going after anyone besides Jessa, but Burke didn\u2019t need any more guilt if the fucker changed his mind.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. Please, Burke. Can you just come back and tell me what\u2019s going on? I need to see you. You\u2019ve been gone so long, and I need your signature on about a hundred documents. I don\u2019t want to work from Black Oak. Dex James was here earlier today, and he was very rude.\u201d</p><p>Dex? Rude? Yeah, not a shock. If Hilary had given Dex the slightest bit of grief, he would have steamrolled right over the petite blonde. Dex got things done. He didn\u2019t let little things like procedure or protocol stop him. Procedure and protocol were two of Hilary\u2019s favorite words. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, Hilary, but Dex had to move fast.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just call me? I would have gotten you whatever you needed. I run this office. I didn\u2019t need some brute to come in and take over.\u201d</p> <p>He sighed. This was the trouble with Hilary. She sometimes sounded like a fainting Southern belle. And sometimes she protected her territory like a rabid pit bull. He didn\u2019t need this shit, but he\u2019d left her a lot to deal with.</p><p>Much like Jessa.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hilary. We had to move quickly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even know what he took. He simply detached a couple of the computer things. He even demanded that I give up my laptop. I barely managed to convince him to let me get my CD out. It was rather like a burglary. He should be happy I didn\u2019t call the police.\u201d</p><p>He could practically see her frown. Hilary Stevens was only thirty-two, but sometimes her disapproval made her seem much older. She really should have been a school teacher since she often made those around her feel like naughty children. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think Dex would have taken well to that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAt least his brothers are polite. I don\u2019t see how brothers can be so very different, but you and Cole are proof, I suppose. Anyway, why don\u2019t you come into the office? Or I can meet you. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but it sounds dangerous. It\u2019s best if we stick together.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, that would be great. Adding a woman with a perpetual stick up her ass and a little crush on him to the mix would be awesome. No. Marco\u2019s target was Jessa, and Burke had to concentrate on her. \u201cNo. We\u2019re involved in something bad, and I\u2019m worried that anyone close to us will be hurt. Do you remember Mick Landry?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t he the investigator you hired to keep track of that woman in New York?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa, yes.\u201d</p><p>He could practically see her shrug. \u201cWhat does Mr. Landry have to do with any of this? He was supposed to submit a report two days ago. He\u2019s late and won\u2019t answer my calls. Do you see what I\u2019ve had to deal with?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe was murdered.\u201d</p><p>That shut her up. \u201cI-I had no idea.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo call Gavin James. Get to a hotel. Don\u2019t tell anyone where you\u2019re going. And don\u2019t call again unless it\u2019s an emergency.\u201d He flicked the phone off.</p><p>\u201cI only had to hear half that conversation to know that Hilary sounds an awful lot like a jealous girlfriend.\u201d Jessa watched him, her feet curved under her as she reclined on the bed.</p> <p>\u201cHilary has a thing for Burke. She can\u2019t stand me.\u201d Cole looked up from his work. He had wires going everywhere. \u201cI\u2019m a caveman. I shouldn\u2019t be allowed in polite society.\u201d</p><p>Again, that tiny hint of a smile. \u201cSo she\u2019s met you, then.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMany times.\u201d</p><p>Burke stepped up. His brother might be the better tracker and better with weapons, but he was going to screw up the computer. \u201cGive me that.\u201d</p><p>Cole seemed damn happy to defer. He stared at Burke for a moment, sharing the link that bonded them together. His brother was happy that Jessa was no longer spitting and fuming. Burke nodded, but wasn\u2019t so sure that their little kitten had quite put her claws away yet.</p><p>\u201cGet some sleep, you two. Well, Jessa, you get some sleep. The faster you drop off, the faster Cole can slink into bed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI hate you both.\u201d But she was shaking her head as she crawled under the covers. \u201cJust get in, Cole. But stay on your side.\u201d</p><p>Burke had never seen his brother move so fast. Cole shrugged out of his jacket, pulled off his shoes, and had his hand on the fly of his jeans.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you dare. The pants stay on.\u201d Jessa settled in and turned out the light on her side of the bed.</p><p>Cole sighed, but didn\u2019t remove his jeans before he climbed into bed.</p><p>Burke turned back to his work, his mind on the last time he\u2019d been in a hotel room with Jessa. New Year\u2019s Eve. The night he was pretty sure Caleb had been conceived.</p><p>One year earlier, New Year\u2019s Eve \u2013 New York City</p><p>Burke watched as Jessa walked through the door, her breasts practically falling out of the little black dress she\u2019d poured herself into. She walked into their suite and sank down on the couch, a seductive little smile on her face.</p><p>She was so fucking gorgeous. He felt his brother step in next to him. Desire practically poured off Cole.</p><p>How did she do this to them? They\u2019d been with her for a week. They had been sleeping with her for four days. Despite their misgivings over this terrible case, they hadn\u2019t been able to stay away from her. They were addicted. They\u2019d tried to lay low, spending most of their time in the suite, in their bed, inside her.</p><p>\u201cI know we\u2019ve talked about going to Times Square,\u201d Jessa said, crossing her legs slowly.</p><p>That wasn\u2019t a good idea. And it certainly wasn\u2019t what Burke wanted to do. \u201cWe talked about it. We didn\u2019t agree to it. It\u2019s going to be very crowded.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know. I think I had enough crowds at dinner tonight.\u201d</p><p>Thank god. Burke could feel Cole relax a little. He hated big crowds, hated not being able to watch his back. \u201cWe can watch it on TV or go down to the bar, if you like.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t like. I thought we could...experiment.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s cock jerked in his slacks. They had taken Jessa over and over, but they hadn\u2019t taken her together yet. They had spent nights preparing her, working fingers and plugs high into her perfect ass, forcing her to take more and more. \u201cBe very explicit, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>She grinned saucily. \u201cYou two perverts love it when I talk dirty.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. And I want you to talk dirty now,\u201d Cole said, expressing exactly what Burke wanted. \u201cSay it. Tell me every little detail, or you might not get what you want.\u201d</p><p>Her nose wrinkled up, a sweet little expression. \u201cYou make things so hard, Cole. It would be so much easier if you\u2019d just pounce and do nasty things to me.\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head. \u201cBut I need to know exactly what you want so I can give it to you.\u201d</p><p>Burke patted his brother\u2019s back. That wasn\u2019t exactly true. Cole feared his own tendencies. Jessa could give Cole what he needed most: Permission. His brother never simply took what he wanted. He snarled with and fought his nature to conquer, to bring a woman to her knees. Cole didn\u2019t want to hurt, but he craved the consent to let loose his inner restraints and utterly possess. And Burke himself simply needed to be wanted for something other than his cock, body, and smile.</p><p>Jessa cocked her head. \u201cNo, you need me to tell you that I want to be dominated. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</p><p>With a faint smile, Burke wondered how Jessa could, despite her relative inexperience, be so intuitive, so wise. But he was so damn glad she was. She was everything they needed.</p><p>She leaned forward, taking Cole\u2019s hands\u2014and giving them both a great view down her dress. \u201cI want you to dominate me, Cole. And Burke, baby, I want you to be the loving, indulgent man you are. I want you both. I want the possessive caveman and the tender seducer. I want the whole package, especially since you come in two gorgeous bodies. I want you together and apart, and every way you\u2019ll have me.\u201d</p><p>Tears swam in her green eyes, glistened on her cheeks.</p><p>A melee of emotion surged and swarmed. It overflowed inside Burke. Fuck, he loved her. Absolutely loved her. The sentiment had never made sense before. Love had been elusive, something written about, but it had never meant anything. He understood now. Love was this ridiculous feeling of acceptance and hope and security. This was his family. These were the people he would grow old with, count on, build a life with.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll have you every way you\u2019ll let me, sweetheart.\u201d Burke was caught between his raging hard-on and his soft fucking heart. The rest of the world was a piece of shit, but Jessa...oh, Jessa made it all worthwhile.</p><p>Cole still held back. \u201cThink carefully. I\u2019ve been as gentle these past few days as I know how. But if you give me permission, the gloves come off, baby. And I can be damn dark.\u201d</p><p>He could. Burke didn\u2019t need a woman\u2019s submission the way Cole did, but he understood his brother and often assisted so Cole got what he needed. \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019ll keep him in check. He never pushes too far. Don\u2019t be scared.\u201d</p><p>Jessa stood and inched closer. \u201cI\u2019ve read up, looked at some videos. I\u2019m ready to try more. I trust you.\u201d She stared right at Cole. \u201cBoth of you.\u201d</p><p>Burke watched his brother\u2019s eyes close briefly. When they opened, the Dom had taken up residence in his brother\u2019s body, and Burke knew they were in for an amazing night.</p><p>\u201cYou need a safe word, one you can say to stop everything. Pick one now.\u201d</p><p>She blinked, hesitated. \u201cResolution?\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded. \u201cResolution is fine. Now undress. Slowly. Take off your clothes and get to your knees. If you\u2019ve done your research, then you know the slave pose. I want to see it.\u201d</p><p>Burke took a long breath at the thought of their Jessa truly submitting.</p><p>She rose, a fine tremble in her hands, but her eyes were steady, resolute. Her hands went to the back of her dress.</p><p>\u201cWill you help her, Burke?\u201d Cole said, his gaze never leaving Jessa.</p><p>He stood behind her an instant later. \u201cAllow me, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>Grabbing hold of the zipper, he dragged it down slowly, revealing her creamy skin. As he pulled, he kissed his way along her spine. Then he eased the dress down to her waist, trapping her arms at her sides. With a practiced hand, he flicked the clasp of her bra open, allowing her breasts to fall free.</p><p>\u201cIs this what you wanted to see?\u201d Burke asked, his hands coming around to cup her breasts. He watched Cole over Jessa\u2019s shoulder. She wiggled a little, her ass grazing his cock. \u201cStop, sweetheart. Patience. Let me present you to Cole. He wants to see your breasts, pussy, and sweet ass.\u201d He whispered in her ear, \u201cWe\u2019re going to take your ass tonight, Jessa. We\u2019re going to share you in every way possible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want that,\u201d she managed to choke out a whisper.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have it,\u201d Cole said, backing away and sinking down into the plush chair across from them. \u201cEventually. But we do this my way tonight, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, gasping a little as Burke flicked her nipples, sending tingles and a bite of pain through them until they hardened. \u201cYes, Sir.\u201d</p><p>Cole shook his head. \u201cNo. No \u2018Sirs.\u2019 My name, Jessa. Say my name. Tell me that you want both of us to take you. Together.\u201d</p><p>That naughty backside of hers was moving again, twitching against him. \u201cYes, Cole. I want you and Burke to take me at the same time. I want you in my ass, Cole, and Burke in my pussy. I want to serve you tonight, to worship your cocks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI like the sound of that.\u201d Burke continued rolling her nipples between his thumbs and forefingers. Her skin was flushing, her breasts swelling. He\u2019d bet anything that pussy was nice and wet.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s only fair,\u201d she murmured. \u201cYou\u2019ve worshipped me. I wouldn\u2019t have believed it could be so good, that I would feel so...cherished.\u201d</p><p>He kissed her neck. \u201cYou are cherished, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPrecious pet.\u201d Cole consumed her with a stare. \u201cSo fucking precious. Show me that pussy. It belongs to us, and I want it on display.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLet\u2019s do what he says, sweetheart. He\u2019ll make it worthwhile.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Burke let his hands skim the curves of her hips, dragging the dress down. He knelt behind her, helping her step out of the dress. Her lacy black bra, previously tangled with her hands, came free, leaving her in nothing but a tiny black thong and some spectacular fuck-me heels. Burke tossed the dress and bra away and really looked at her gorgeous ass. He traced the line of her thong from the little triangle at the top of her ass down the valley where the little string of black lace disappeared. So fucking sexy. And in his way.</p><p>He hooked his fingers under the straps. \u201cThis has to go, too. But keep the shoes. I like them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGee, thanks, Burke. They\u2019ll keep me warm,\u201d Jessa snarked, looking over her shoulder at him.</p><p>Cole growled, his eyes narrowing. That look let Burke know just what his brother wanted him to do.</p><p>\u201cDamn,\u201d Burke said as he pulled the thong down her legs and helped her balance while she stepped out of it. \u201cYou obey or you\u2019ll get in trouble. And you have to listen carefully. He gets to a point where he communicates entirely through grunts and shoving his cock somewhere.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour sarcasm is duly noted,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>Burke ignored him, preferring to kiss the dimples right above her ass. He loved that little valley and how it dipped and curved. \u201cLuckily for you, I speak Cole. He\u2019s not happy with the snarky attitude, sweetheart. He\u2019ll love you for your sass outside the bedroom, but he won\u2019t put up with it here. Get on your hands and knees. We\u2019ll start with a count of ten. When I\u2019m done, you\u2019ll find your slave pose and ask Cole very nicely to forgive you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will?\u201d The question squeaked out of her mouth.</p><p>\u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Cole sounded supremely confident.</p><p>Burke nodded, confident, as well. He knew something Cole couldn\u2019t yet. \u201cThe minute I told her we\u2019d start with ten, she got aroused as hell. I can smell her.\u201d</p><p>Jessa tried to take a step away, but he caught her. \u201cBurke, stop embarrassing me.\u201d</p><p>Her skin was flushing, and he smiled. It wasn\u2019t polite. \u201cI would think after having one of us deep in your pussy almost constantly for the past four days that you\u2019d be over the embarrassment. I love the way you smell. I want to stick my face in your pussy and drown.\u201d He caressed her hip. \u201cSex is dirty and nasty, sweetheart. Do you really want some nice boy who will politely fuck you once a week in a standard missionary position and never, ever spank you? Or refuse to shove his cock up your ass while he shares you with his brother?\u201d</p><p>She glanced at him over her shoulder, cheeks stained pink. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. If you want two men who will obsess over you, treat you like a princess and a hot sex toy all at once, then get on your knees and take our discipline.\u201d</p><p>Jessa dropped immediately to her knees and presented herself. Cole\u2019s eyes glittered, and Burke smiled. Yes, she was exactly what they needed.</p><p>Jessa felt the plush carpet beneath her and tried to breathe through her excitement. God, what were they doing to her? Five days ago, she\u2019d been a virgin. Sex had seemed so unimportant when compared to everything else. Now she was on her hands and knees waiting for two hot men to spank her and fuck her and take everything she had to give.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Because she loved them. She let the thought flow through her as Burke settled himself behind her. She looked up, and Cole sat like a king on his throne, watching her with those deep blue eyes that reminded her of the night sky right before a storm. He wore a satisfied smile that made her womb clench, one that told her he meant to fuck her ruthlessly and often tonight.</p><p>\u201cThis is the right choice, sweetheart. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Burke\u2019s hands soothed over her backside.</p><p>She knew that and couldn\u2019t resist baiting them. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talking and not a lot of action.\u201d</p><p>She heard the smack before she felt it. It cracked through the air, stinging her. She bit her bottom lip to keep from crying out. It hurt a little, but nothing she couldn\u2019t handle. Instead, she opened herself to the sensation, the visceral heat of it, letting her senses really take it in.</p><p>Another smack, this time on the other cheek. She groaned. Fire licked at her skin. Yep. She\u2019d definitely felt that one. Eight more.</p><p>She breathed in as Burke struck again, this time a bit faster, a bit harder. She memorized the sound of his hand hitting her ass, the sharp breath he took with each slap, Cole\u2019s tightening posture. She let the smells wash over her. Burke and Cole\u2019s cologne came first, masculine and clean. But her arousal, musky and pervasive, settled underneath that. No way to hide it. Getting her butt spanked was doing something for her. Burke struck again and again, moving around, laying his hand on every part of her ass, the tops of her thighs, forcing her to spread her legs, then landing a blow directly on her pussy.</p> <p>The physical sensations astounded her. Her ass was burning, but it was an oddly sweet heat, reminding her how alive skin could feel, reminding her that every part of her body was connected. Burke\u2019s every blow washed like a wave from her ass to her pussy, drenching her. Her nipples tightened. She fisted her hand into the carpet, and she whimpered.</p><p>But she was dazzlingly alive. This was what she\u2019d found in the last week. Lights seemed brighter. Sounds louder. Smells more decadently tempting. And her painting...oh, she\u2019d found her passion again. When she wasn\u2019t with them or working at the hotel, she was painting with a purpose she hadn\u2019t had in a long time. Passion. Love. Acceptance. They\u2019d opened doors Jessa hadn\u2019t known she\u2019d closed.</p><p>Another blow, and she moaned, unable to stop the sound. She didn\u2019t even want to. She wanted them to know that she felt it. Burke smacked again, striking in the center of her ass, lighting it up. Jessa waited for the pain to bloom into something else.</p><p>\u201cThat was ten, sweetheart.\u201d She could hear the approval in Burke\u2019s thick voice.</p><p>\u201cShe took it well. I was right.\u201d Cole smiled down at her. His body was poised back in the chair, but he\u2019d opened his slacks and released his cock. He stroked the thick column in one hand while he watched her, the very picture of decadence. \u201cShe\u2019s very submissive sexually.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou only know the half of it. She\u2019s so wet.\u201d Burke\u2019s hand stroked her ass now, tracing the flesh he\u2019d struck until he skimmed down to her pussy.</p><p>Jessa gasped with pleasure as he forced a finger past her swollen folds and up her hungry cunt. She felt so empty. She hadn\u2019t even realized it until just now. She wanted one of them inside her. \u201cPlease...\u201d</p><p>Burke chuckled behind her, his finger teasing lightly. \u201cPlease? What would please you, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou. Or Cole. Or both. I need you.\u201d She wiggled, trying to tempt that finger deeper inside and maybe to bring a friend.</p><p>Burke pulled away. \u201cNot yet. You have something to say to Cole.\u201d</p><p>She looked up. Cole was still leisurely stroking his cock, the enormous organ standing straight up like a temptation she was dying to taste. Yes, she had a few things to say to Cole. Things like, \u201ctake me now\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to scream if you don\u2019t fuck me.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t what he wanted to hear. Jessa sat back on her heels, wincing a little at the ache in her ass. After she\u2019d figured out that Cole was into BDSM, she\u2019d looked it up on the web. She\u2019d found thousands of images, articles, and videos on the subject. She understood the single thread that bound every piece of BDSM information together: trust.</p><p>She spread her legs wide and lowered her head, trying to keep her spine as straight as possible. The slave pose was a way of greeting a Dom. It showed a submissive\u2019s trust and respect. She\u2019d been aroused by the pictures, but a little afraid until she\u2019d understood that this was an exchange of power. It wasn\u2019t a stronger person taking from someone weaker. It was a mutual decision meant to bring peace and pleasure to both parties. Jessa hoped she had the pose right. She wanted to please him so much.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful, baby. You have no idea how exquisite you are to me.\u201d Cole\u2019s deep rumble rolled over her. She felt his hand on her head, sliding into her hair. Burke still hovered at her back. She heard the rustling of clothes, but she kept true to her role, leaving her head submissively down when all she wanted to do was watch Cole undress. \u201cDo you have any idea what it means that you figured out how to do this yourself? That you cared enough to study?\u201d</p><p>She smiled, though she knew he couldn\u2019t see it. Cole was so insular, always waiting for someone to reject him, thanks at least in part to their bastard of an uncle. Burke wasn\u2019t far from him, but knew how to hide the insecurity better. But she suspected these two gorgeous men had been rejected before. How many women had used them for the pleasure they could give but refused their love because they couldn\u2019t function apart? How many of them had spurned a m\u00e9nage relationship most of the world would reject? The world could go to hell as far as Jessa was concerned. The world could shrink to just the three of them, and she would be happy.</p><p>\u201cJessa, I have never felt about a woman the way I feel about you.\u201d</p><p>It took everything she had not to look up. Cole sounded tentative, and despite his deep voice, vulnerable. It took a lot for him to admit that. She kept quiet and listened carefully out of respect.</p><p>\u201cI want to be responsible for you. God, I want to be your Master.\u201d</p><p>It was the equivalent of \u201cI love you\u201d in the BDSM world. Jessa felt tears prick her eyes. Burke made no qualms about his feelings, but Cole had been far more reserved. He\u2019d clearly taken every rejection to heart, while Burke\u2019s sunny disposition allowed him to shrug it off more easily and move on.</p><p>Cole\u2019s confession now warmed her and gave her strength.</p><p>\u201cI want your mouth on me while Burke prepares your ass.\u201d Cole settled a hand under her chin and lifted it gently. She let him lead her slowly up, enjoying every inch of his body from his muscled legs to that cock that made her mouth water, all the way up to his beautiful blue eyes. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to play this way. I\u2019ll still be here, Jessa. It means a lot that you would try.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She didn\u2019t want a Cole who simply tried to please her. She wanted every dark bit of him getting what he needed. \u201cI took my spanking. I want the rest of it, too.\u201d</p><p>A smile of pure joy lit his face in the form of a bad-boy grin. He leaned down and kissed her, touching her lips sweetly to his. \u201cThen I\u2019ll give it to you, baby.\u201d</p><p>He took his cock in hand, and Jessa sighed, leaning in. She really wanted this, to please him. They had spent days worshipping her. It felt right to revere one of them now.</p><p>\u201cAll right, baby. Lick the head for me.\u201d</p><p>The head as he called it, looked enormous, and there was a pearly drop on the tip. Dying to know how he\u2019d taste, she leaned forward and did as he bade, running her tongue over the bulbous tip. Cole tasted clean and woodsy; his masculine scent filled her senses. His hissed-in breath made her smile.</p><p>\u201cOpen up for me, sweetheart,\u201d Burke said, pressing down on her back. \u201cI need to plug this pretty ass. We bought this one two days ago for just this occasion.\u201d</p><p>Cole got to his knees as Jessa went back to all fours. Burke forced her legs farther apart, making a place for himself there. Cole offered his cock as Burke caressed her backside.</p><p>She licked at Cole, running her tongue around the head again. She loved the soft skin covering all that hardness. Cole\u2019s hand tangled in her hair, forcing her to take him deeper. She opened her mouth, allowing him to invade. He was so big. She could barely get her tongue to swirl around the thick stalk, but she managed it, slowly whirling. He groaned, and the hand in her hair guided her with lazy insistence.</p><p>The hand on her hip gripped her, too. The brothers held her firmly in place. Something cold and wet dribbled down the crack of her ass. Lubricant. They had been playing with her ass every time they made love, preparing her for what they wanted. One of them would distract her with pleasure while the other stretched her for the sharing. She\u2019d thought they would simply do it, but they had taken care of her patiently and with great care.</p><p>She didn\u2019t even move when Burke started to rim her with his fingers. She was used to the pressure. He massaged her ass with the lube, forcing the tight ring of muscles to accept his invasion. She shivered at the pressure and the jangly feelings of heat and tingles he gave her.</p><p>\u201cTake me deeper, baby,\u201d Cole\u2019s voice had gone guttural, his strokes into her mouth quicker. \u201cGod, I love how good your mouth feels. So hot and tight on my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your ass is so lovely.\u201d Burke\u2019s words joined with Cole\u2019s, a stereo of praise that made her feel wanted and sexy and beloved. \u201cYou keep that cock in your mouth. Don\u2019t lose Cole. I\u2019m going to work this plug into you. God, I can\u2019t wait to get my cock in here. She\u2019s going to be so fucking tight.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s hand softened on her hair, petting her. \u201cEase up, baby. I don\u2019t want to come until I\u2019m deep inside you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Something harder than Burke\u2019s finger started to push against her. She groaned around the cock in her mouth. She found a soft place on the underside of his thick stalk, where the hard column met the head. She worked it, worrying it with her tongue to take her mind off the way Burke shoved the plug in and out of her ass.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a bad girl, Jessa,\u201d Cole said, pulling away. \u201cI told you to ease up. You\u2019re trying to make me lose control. You tried to make me come in your mouth.\u201d</p><p>He leaned in until his hands found her breasts.</p><p>Jessa moaned. \u201cI was trying to forget about the fact that Burke is shoving a piece of plastic up my ass.\u201d</p><p>Cole pinched at her nipples, twisting. \u201cYou obey me in the bedroom, Jessa.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr he\u2019ll spank you all over again.\u201d Burke\u2019s silky smooth tone gave away his deep pleasure at his task. \u201cAnd this bottom is already a perfect pink.\u201d</p><p>\u201cKeep disobeying, baby, and I\u2019ll clamp your nipples. I\u2019ll pull out the clover clamps and the chain that goes between them. They\u2019ll bite into these sweet little buds, and you\u2019ll feel the burn when I tug on the chain as I force you to ride my cock.\u201d</p><p>Jessa let her head fall forward as he tugged on her nipples. Each little wrench of his fingers flashed fire down to her pussy. So hot. She\u2019d never been so aroused, and his words were just adding kindling to the fire. She suddenly wanted to try those clamps. Apparently, she was a little bit of a freak, but with Burke and Cole, it made sense. They accepted this side of her, wanted it. She was with men she trusted. Men she loved.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019d like that, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, you\u2019re so fucking perfect.\u201d His hand slid down, and suddenly she felt him pinching at her clit.</p><p>\u201cOh, oh.\u201d She couldn\u2019t stop it. It felt too good. Cole still plucked at her right nipple, squeezing harshly, then rolling it. His other hand played in her pussy, sliding all around while Burke seated the plug deep in her ass.</p><p>\u201cGive it to her, Cole. I want to watch her come.\u201d</p><p>Jessa nearly screamed when Cole took his hand away. \u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d</p><p>There was a smack to her ass that made her moan. The plug shifted, causing waves of jagged sensation to streak through her.</p><p>\u201cHush, Jessa,\u201d Cole said, his voice a sharp bark. \u201cYou\u2019ll get what you need when I decide you need it, not before.\u201d</p><p>As though she weighed nothing at all, he lifted her up and she found herself falling on top of him, sprawled across the big bed that dominated the suite. The shades were open, and the twinkling lights of Manhattan lit up the room.</p><p>\u201cI told you I would force you to ride my cock. I mean what I say, baby. Burke, I need a condom.\u201d</p><p>Jessa shook her head. \u201cNo. You don\u2019t. I\u2019m on the pill. I want to feel you. I\u2019m clean.\u201d</p><p>\u201cObviously,\u201d Burke said, standing next to the bed, a concerned look on his face. \u201cCole and I never have sex without a condom. And you might not believe it, but we\u2019re not out there every night with a different woman. We\u2019re clean, but maybe we should still...\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said, practically pleading. \u201cIt\u2019s safe. I don\u2019t want to stop. I want to feel you, skin to skin.\u201d</p><p>Cole gave her his answer by thrusting up and joining them in a single smooth move. \u201cOh, god, that feels so fucking good.\u201d</p><p>It did. Nothing between them but shared breaths and bare flesh. She was so glad she\u2019d decided to go to the clinic and get on the pill. No stopping for protection. No latex. Just her and them, the way it should always be.</p><p>\u201cThat sounds heavenly, sweetheart.\u201d Burke shoved his pants down and off. \u201cI want a turn, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll get it,\u201d Cole replied. \u201cSoon. I had her pussy first. You take her ass.\u201d</p><p>Cole surged up, pumping inside her. With his hands, he forced her to grind down on him. He was so damn deep, she gasped, mouth open, sensations washing over her as her pussy clasped and grabbed at him, pulling him even farther inside.</p><p>\u201cFuck. I want that. I want that so goddamn bad.\u201d Burke reached for the lube.</p><p>\u201cCome for us, baby. Let go for us before we take you together. I want you soft and happy when we share you the first time.\u201d</p><p>She gave over to him and rode that big cock. The plug took up a lot of space, making her feel fuller than ever before. She slid up and down, Cole\u2019s hands on her ass, a finger on the plug, holding it deep. She slid down on him, her clit hitting his pelvis as he surged up, hitting just the right spot inside her once, twice, again. Then she came with a mewling cry, the pleasure crashing through her system. She fell on Cole\u2019s chest, and his arms closed around her, making her feel safe and warm.</p><p>\u201cGet that plug out and get inside her, Burke. I don\u2019t know how much longer I can last. Fuck, she feels so good.\u201d Cole groaned against her ear, spreading kisses across her cheek, brushing his lips over her mouth.</p><p>Jessa felt the bed dip as Burke climbed on. His hands moved tenderly over her ass, and the plug slid out. She sighed, tightened. Cole was still thick inside her body, holding her impaled against him, but now she felt the loss of the plug. Her ass felt empty.</p><p>But not for long. Cole soothed his hand down her back as Burke spread her cheeks. She whimpered as she felt him spread more lube on her anus, preparing her to take something far larger than the plug.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so good, baby. We\u2019re going to fill you completely,\u201d Cole murmured, his hips moving in lazy, teasing thrusts.</p><p>Every time he rubbed her clit, a little aftershock sent more pleasure through her that just added to the sweet aftermath of her stunning climax. As they touched, soothed, and worked, she felt boneless and momentarily sated. She let them have their way\u2014just like they\u2019d planned.</p><p>Cole\u2019s hands tightened around her, hugging her as she felt Burke\u2019s cock at the rim of her untried hole.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, you\u2019re so beautiful,\u201d Burke said as he gently stroked himself in, taking her in increments, forcing his cock inside in neat little thrusts. \u201cYou feel so good.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt burns.\u201d Far more than the plug, in fact. She gritted her teeth. It wasn\u2019t pain exactly but it wasn\u2019t comfortable.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d Cole whispered. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Let him in, baby. Arch your back.\u201d</p><p>She lifted her ass a bit higher, pressing her breasts against Cole\u2019s chest. His heart beat loudly with hers as the burn of Burke\u2019s dick sinking a bit deeper seared her. He worked his way inside her, bumping against the tight muscles of her ass.</p><p>\u201cPush out against me,\u201d Burke gritted out, taking her hips in hand and lifting her ass higher.</p><p>Jessa pushed out, wondering if he would really fit inside her. A moment later, he popped past the barrier and slowly filled her with his cock.</p><p>God. She had to force herself to breathe. They were everywhere, so deep and all around her. Her world was filled with Burke and Cole.</p><p>\u201cAre you all right, sweetheart?\u201d Burke\u2019s voice was tentative. His hands gripped her hips, betraying his tension as he thrust gently.</p><p>\u201cPlease be all right, Jessa.\u201d Cole\u2019s face was tight, his brow knitted together, jaw clenched.</p><p>Something about the big bad Dom begging her to accept them made her smile. She pushed back, wiggling against Burke. Nerves she\u2019d never known she had lit up. She shook with the sensation, and as they filled her in tandem with deep breaths and guttural moans, she trembled with need, quickly rushing to the edge of pleasure. She cried out.</p><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s it, sweetheart. Let it go. Let it happen.\u201d Burke clutched her hips as he thrust in.</p><p>Cole groaned when she seesawed back his way. \u201cThis is perfect, the three of us together. The way it should be.\u201d</p><p>Every way she moved brought her pleasure. Cole filled her pussy, his thick dick striking at her G-spot when he pushed up. Burke dragged his cock out almost to the rim of her asshole, marking the path with burning pleasure, before he shoved deep again, forcing her to grind her clit against Cole.</p><p>They set a brutal pace. Jessa gave up trying to control it. She became what they had warned, their pleasure toy, a soft, sweet thing they passed between them. She would have fought it if they\u2019d treated her that way outside the bedroom, but instead, they treated her like a princess, with courtesy, always thinking of her wants and needs. They made it easy to give over to them here, to be pulled and pushed as they fought for pleasure. She felt like they\u2019d been fused together, formed into one unit as they worked inside her. As they made love, they were whole.</p><p>All the languor from her previous orgasm was gone. A new driving pressure built again, surging, searing, until little pleas and whimpers fell from her mouth.</p><p>\u201cHelp her, Burke. I\u2019m dying here,\u201d Cole growled.</p><p>Burke\u2019s arm wrapped around as he drove into her, one relentless thrust after another. He reached between her and Cole and found her clit, rubbing it with sweet friction. Cole thrust up. Every sensation in her body turned molten and converged. They sent her flying again, this time higher and longer than ever before as she screamed their names.</p><p>Jessa bucked against them, trying to prolong the pleasure. Cole thrust up, his face contorting as he came inside her. She could feel the hot wash of his seed flooding her.</p><p>Burke groaned behind her, his grip on her hips punishing as he held her tight and forced his cock in until she could feel his balls against her ass. He thrust in and out, filling her ass with his come until finally he fell forward, his front plastering her back.</p><p>They relaxed into a heap, Jessa safe and warm between them. She fell asleep, happy to have a piece of each inside her.</p><p>Jessa woke slowly, reaching for them. Every muscle in her body felt deliciously used. She stretched and yawned. She kept her eyes closed, letting her mind wander a bit. It was New Year\u2019s Day. She was looking at a whole new year, a whole new life\u2014one with Burke and Cole.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart?\u201d</p><p>She opened her eyes. There was a reason she hadn\u2019t felt them next to her. They both stood by the bed, fully dressed in suits and ties and expensive shoes. She could smell coffee and the deliciously savory scent of bacon. She sat up, pulling the sheet with her, anxiety starting to penetrate her brain.</p><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Not only were they dressed, their faces were grave. They didn\u2019t look like two men who were happy that they\u2019d spent the night making love to their woman. They looked like men who were leaving. They looked to each other, having one of those silent conversations. She just knew they were trying to figure out how to deal with her.</p><p>Her stomach turned. \u201cAt least you didn\u2019t sneak out. I guess that\u2019s something.\u201d</p><p>Burke got to one knee. \u201cSweetheart, we are not sneaking out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you are leaving.\u201d She could see it plainly on his face.</p><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>She could always count on Cole to state the facts without sugarcoating. Burke would try to put the best sheen on it. Cole didn\u2019t bother. She turned to him. \u201cDo I get an explanation, or do you just say \u2018thanks\u2019 and walk away?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you, Jessa,\u201d Cole stated, a stark look on his face. \u201cI do not want to go. If there was any other way, I wouldn\u2019t ever leave that fucking bed again. But I made promises.\u201d</p><p>Tears pricked at her eyes. \u201cWhat kind of promises?\u201d</p><p>Burke took her hand. \u201cWe have some friends, sweetheart. They\u2019re having some problems. Family problems. Their cousin is in trouble.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with you?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe have contacts. We can help her,\u201d Cole stated. His jaw was a stark line, his eyes sunken, as if he hadn\u2019t slept.</p><p>Jessa swallowed. What was going on? Were they telling her the truth? Had this all been a scam to get her in bed? If it was, she reasoned, they would have just left. \u201cYou have to go now?\u201d</p><p>Burke nodded. \u201cYes. Part of why we were here in New York was to make some inquiries for our friends. We got a call an hour ago. We\u2019ve got a really good lead on her location.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can help. I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes widened with horror. \u201cNo. You are not coming with us, Jessa. You will stay here, and you will be safe. That is an order.\u201d</p><p>The Dom was back. At least he seemed to care. \u201cHow long will you be gone?\u201d</p><p>Cole sighed and sank down next to Burke, reaching for her other hand. \u201cI hope it\u2019s only a couple of weeks. No more than a month or two. I can\u2019t tell you more than that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing...it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d She didn\u2019t make it a question. She knew.</p><p>Burke brought her hand to his lips. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping you out of it. The less you know the better.\u201d</p><p>She tried to pull away. How was this happening? Last night had been perfect. She\u2019d been safe and loved and looking forward to building something beautiful and lasting with them. Now they were leaving.</p><p>\u201cJessa.\u201d Cole sounded tortured. \u201cJessa, I love you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t you say that when you\u2019re leaving me.\u201d</p><p>He took her face in his hands and fused his stare with hers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe love you, Jessa. You\u2019re the one for us,\u201d Burke said, caressing her arm. \u201cWe\u2019re going to finish our mission and come back for you. You better be ready to move since our business is in Dallas.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe want to marry you, Jessa. We want a life with you. Please don\u2019t think we\u2019re leaving you lightly.\u201d Cole pulled her between them and kissed her.</p> <p>But they did leave. Two hours later, Jessa showered. She dressed and walked out of the hotel room where she\u2019d lost her virginity and her heart. She went back to work and prayed they would come back to her.</p><p>CHAPTER SIX</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p><p>Burke woke to the sound of the door slamming. A blast of chilly air smacked him. He sat straight up in bed, shaking off the dream. He\u2019d been back in New York, making love to Jessa, her silken body moving against his. She\u2019d told him she loved him. She\u2019d looked at Cole and whispered those sweet words to his brother, too. Then she took every kiss, touch, and thrust they had to give. He\u2019d replayed that night over and over again in his mind. That last night with her had been the best of his life. The next morning had been one of the worst. Every night since, he\u2019d dreamed about her face as he and Cole had walked away.</p><p>\u201cSorry,\u201d Cole said gruffly, his hands full as he walked into the tiny room. His face was red. He\u2019d obviously been standing in the cold for a while. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to wake you. The wind is pretty bad out there. It looks like a storm is coming in tonight. I made a couple of calls.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa was still beside Burke, stretching and rubbing her eyes. Her hair was slightly rumpled from sleep, and she looked perfect to Burke. Despite the danger, all he wanted to do was haul her into his arms, kiss those sensual lips, and sink into her until they were both warm and satisfied. His cock didn\u2019t give a shit that she no longer wanted him.</p><p>\u201cDid you call to check on Caleb?\u201d Jessa asked, her voice a little hoarse.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine, Jessa,\u201d Cole assured her. \u201cDex said he slept late, and now he\u2019s having a ball playing with their kids. He\u2019s eating fine, had some cereal and a bottle. He pooped, too. I thought that was weird. Dex just tossed that out there. Was he supposed to tell me that?\u201d</p><p>A smile pulled at Jessa\u2019s lips. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously a well-trained dad. We moms like to keep up with stuff like that. Babies have touchy digestive systems. He\u2019s in a new place, and his schedule is all messed up. It\u2019s a good sign that he\u2019s eating and playing and pooping.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. All right, then. Good information.\u201d Cole put some bags on the table. \u201cI got some breakfast. Just biscuit sandwiches. There\u2019s a fast food place next door. Sorry it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d The Waldorf\u2014\u201canything better, but I didn\u2019t want to be gone long.\u201d</p><p>Burke winced at his brother\u2019s mental stutter and got up to grab some coffee. He would need it. There was no doubt in Burke\u2019s mind what his brother had been thinking.</p> <p>After he\u2019d set up the computers the night before, he\u2019d started downloading everything he had on Delgado. He\u2019d read late into the night, looking for clues, any weakness, before Cole had awakened and made room for him beside Jessa\u2019s soft body, demanding he get some sleep.</p><p>She mumbled her thanks. \u201cHow long do we have before Marco\u2019s timeline kicks in?\u201d</p><p>Burke was brutally aware that the bastard had given them twenty-four hours before this little game began. If they could trust him to wait.</p><p>\u201cSeven hours at best. We have some decisions to make.\u201d Cole opened the bag and pulled out a sandwich.</p><p>\u201cCan we make decisions with our pants on, please?\u201d Jessa asked, frowning Burke\u2019s way.</p><p>Burke shrugged. She hadn\u2019t minded when they were sleeping. Despite her warnings, after she\u2019d dropped off, she\u2019d rolled into Cole\u2019s arms. They\u2019d slept entwined until it was Cole\u2019s watch. Then she\u2019d merely cuddled back against Burke. She might not trust them when she was awake, but when she was vulnerable, she sought out comfort and the security of their embrace.</p><p>\u201cIt would have been too hot with my pants on.\u201d He declined to mention that it would have been too hot because her body had been pressed to his. He could be a gentleman.</p><p>\u201cBurke, those tight little boxer briefs don\u2019t do much to hide the fact that you have an enormous erection. Am I the only one this bothers?\u201d</p> <p>Cole grunted out a laugh, but Burke simply turned to her, giving her a full view of what sleeping next to her had wrought. She wasn\u2019t going to let him be a gentleman. \u201cWell, sweetheart, that\u2019s what happens when I sleep with my cock nestled against your beautiful ass.\u201d</p><p>She gasped, sounding a little like the virgin she\u2019d been before she met them.</p><p>Cole smiled her way. It was the smile that always let Burke know his brother was about to throw him under a bus. \u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you, baby. He wakes up like that every morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucker. Like you don\u2019t. We both have the same dreams.\u201d He pinned Jessa to the bed with his intent stare. \u201cWe dream about you, sweetheart, and we wake up hard.\u201d</p><p>Her gaze slipped back and forth between the two of them, then dropped. \u201cCould I have some coffee please? From someone wearing pants.\u201d</p><p>Damn it, he should have kept his fucking mouth shut.</p><p>Cole brought her a cup and a sandwich. \u201cCream and sugar. Two spoons. And please eat, Jessa. You didn\u2019t eat on the plane last night.\u201d</p><p>Burke knew that Cole wanted to demand, order her to eat, but they didn\u2019t have the right to command anything of her that didn\u2019t pertain to her immediate safety. Curbing himself, holding back from Jessa, hurt Cole like hell. Burke didn\u2019t like it any better.</p><p>She accepted the coffee but put the sandwich down. \u201cI don\u2019t feel much like eating.\u201d</p><p>Burke didn\u2019t either. He wanted to work through their problems with Jessa somehow. But now wasn\u2019t the time. And he wanted to see Caleb. God, a single day as a dad, and he was already freaking out about his kid. He shook it off. Their son was safe with the James family. They were insanely wealthy and very powerfully connected. They would take care of Caleb. But the James brothers weren\u2019t the only powerful people they knew. \u201cDid you get Rafe or Kade on the phone? I tried last night, but no one answered.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded, finally looking away from Jessa. Thankfully, the question directed his brother\u2019s attention elsewhere. \u201cThey were...busy last night.\u201d</p><p>Burke took a long sip of the fast food coffee. Swill, but still better than some he\u2019d had in the past. He could bet how Rafe and Kade had been occupied. They had business interests in the States, but they loved American women. Lots of them. And they loved to share. It was just one reason they had all bonded as friends. \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re in town. They have some meeting with Black Oak about the new refineries in Bezakistan. They\u2019re going to come out here and bring some equipment with them. Sat phone, better computer equipment, new car, and a whole lot of cash. And cell phones. I don\u2019t want Hilary to know our number after we get out of town. It\u2019s better for all of us. They\u2019re bringing some credit cards, too, and passports in case we want to leave the country. I know we can\u2019t stay in one place too long, but I think it\u2019s worth the wait to meet with them before we move.\u201d</p><p>Jessa turned, her eyes wide. \u201cI can\u2019t leave the country without my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cJessa, we\u2019ll do what we have to do to keep you alive.\u201d Burke didn\u2019t want to leave her again. He was sick at the thought, but she stood the best chance of staying alive somewhere far away.</p><p>She shook her head frantically. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t leave the country.\u201d</p><p>Cole frowned. \u201cYou\u2019ll be surprised what you can do when I tie you up and shove you on a private jet.\u201d</p><p>Burke looked at Jessa for a moment. She was still tired, despite her sleep. It was written in the circles under her eyes. She was still the most beautiful thing in the world to him, but she looked fragile, haunted. And very afraid. She clasped her hands tightly in her lap. \u201cWhat haven\u2019t you told us, sweetheart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d Jessa asked.</p><p>Because he\u2019d made a careful study of her. He had a brilliant mind and a very good memory. Every exchange they\u2019d ever had, he\u2019d kept vibrant and alive in his brain. \u201cYou wring your hands when you\u2019re upset or unsure.\u201d</p><p>She also did it when she didn\u2019t want to admit things. Like she had that night she\u2019d admitted she was a virgin.</p><p>Jessa unclasped her hands. \u201cDamn observant men. Someone texted my phone last night. I had my purse in Caleb\u2019s diaper bag, and when we had to leave him, I grabbed it. The phone has pictures of Caleb, and I thought keeping it was harmless. I wasn\u2019t planning to call anyone. I thought if you knew he\u2019d contacted me, you\u2019d take the phone away, so I didn\u2019t say anything. But then you started talking about what sounded like leaving the country...\u201d She sighed, then reached into the small bag Hannah had given her and pulled out her phone. Jessa held it out, her eyes full of tears. \u201cI knew I needed to say something. I just want my pictures.\u201d</p><p>Cole grabbed the phone.</p><p>Burke sat beside Jessa. He would let Cole do the investigative work while he handled their woman. Even if she refused to be, he still thought of her that way. This was one of the joys of sharing. There was always one of them to handle the necessary business, which freed the other to comfort or protect the female.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, no one\u2019s going to take your pictures, but we\u2019re going to turn off anything that sends or receives a signal. You\u2019ll still be able to look at the pictures and use a few apps.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Cole\u2019s curse reverberated through the room. \u201cGoddamn it. I\u2019m going to kill that dog-fucking son of a bitch. I\u2019m going rip him into little fucking pieces with my bare hands and shove them down his shit-sucking throat.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWow, he knows a lot of bad words,\u201d Jessa said, eyes wide.</p><p>\u201cAnd he\u2019s not afraid to use them,\u201d Burke drawled. \u201cWhat does the message say?\u201d</p><p>Cole put the phone down and picked up his own\u2014the disposable, untraceable phone Dex had given him. He dialed a number and continued cursing.</p><p>Jessa watched Cole, but spoke to Burke. \u201cIt said that he knew you two would try to get me out of the country, but that if you called in favors to have me taken abroad, he would have no choice but to go after Caleb.\u201d</p><p>Burke closed his eyes, cursing mentally, using all the same words his brother had. \u201cMarco knew we\u2019d eventually come up with this plan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou were really going to send me away?\u201d</p><p>He hated the way her lips trembled, the hurt in her voice. He hated the fact that she was so scared. \u201cYes. We talked about it while you were sleeping. We were going to send you with some friends who could have kept you safe. Once you were in their country, Gavin James was going to fly Caleb to Bezakistan himself. We didn\u2019t have enough time to pull it off at the onset, and the fucker knew it. That\u2019s why he only gave us twenty-four hours. But it still might be the best plan.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cNo. I believe him. He\u2019ll come after us.\u201d</p><p>Burke raised an arrogant brow. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get to you in Bezakistan.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay there the rest of my life,\u201d Jessa said, frustration evident in her tone. \u201cHe wants to kill me. I don\u2019t get why, but I have to fight this. I can\u2019t risk letting him come after my son, not even for a second. Unless you manage to kill this asshole, we\u2019ll be looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives, worried that he\u2019s gunning for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI will kill him, Jessa. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you or our son,\u201d Cole vowed, hanging up the phone.</p><p>She was quiet for a moment. \u201cExactly who is this man?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking dead,\u201d Cole said, his face still red.</p><p>Jessa turned to Burke. \u201cCould you please tell me? Without the gorilla chest thumping.\u201d</p><p>He didn\u2019t want to. It would have been so much easier if he\u2019d just been able to pack her off with Rafe and Kade, then pick her up when it was over. Then he wouldn\u2019t have to admit just how much they\u2019d screwed up.</p><p>\u201cTell me! I have the right to know why this man wants me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe usually handle security problems for corporations,\u201d Cole explained. \u201cBut in this case, we were helping our friends from Bezakistan find their cousin, like we explained.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlea, yes.\u201d She waved him off, hugging the blanket to her chest. \u201cNow give me the rest of the story.\u201d</p><p>Burke took a long breath and plunged in. \u201cMarco believes we\u2019re responsible for his father\u2019s death.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit. I wish I had been. I would have fucking enjoyed pulling the trigger,\u201d Cole growled. \u201cBut no, I was a good boy and sent the asshole off to prison. If I had known he\u2019d be dead so soon, I would have put a bullet in him myself\u2014and Marco right after him\u2014and ended everyone\u2019s goddamn misery.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Burke stared pointedly at his brother. \u201cWhat Cole is trying to say in his Neanderthal way is that the elder Delgado was a very bad man and that a rival stabbed and killed him behind bars.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe deserved everything he got. The fucker trafficked young women. He filled client orders and sold them to brothels all over South America. He bought and sold girls to fulfill male fantasies, made them prostitutes and sex slaves.\u201d Cole never flinched.</p><p>But Jessa did. She paled visibly. \u201cOh, my god. It\u2019s so horrible.\u201d</p><p>\u201cA single word can\u2019t describe that kind of hell.\u201d Cole continued. \u201cWe got involved because we did some security work for Bezakistan when we were Navy SEALs. Some extremists kidnapped Sheikh al Mussad, and we rescued him.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy? Is he a dictator? How does Delgado come into this picture? Were they in business together?\u201d</p><p>Burke laughed at the thought. \u201cTalib? No. He\u2019s not a dictator, and he would never harm a woman. And he\u2019d certainly never go into business with Marco. Though I will admit his family has a long history of kidnapping females. The women all ended up being very happy brides, however. Tal and his brothers were educated in London, so he runs Bezakistan like a business. A ridiculously profitable business. They\u2019re a small country, but they\u2019re sitting on a wealth of resources. Talib\u2019s father decided to spread the wealth many years ago. Every citizen in the country gets a portion of the money from the oil they put out. It\u2019s the single wealthiest country per capita in the world.\u201d</p><p>She bit into her bottom lip as she considered what he\u2019d said. \u201cThen why would someone kidnap him?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe region doesn\u2019t look kindly on the way the royal family runs the country. They cling to some very old practices.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh. The polyandry. Yeah, I know their neighboring countries think it\u2019s a mortal sin.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes.\u201d Cole smirked down at her. \u201cBut the mortal sin of all the brothers in a family sharing a single wife means there\u2019s no need to divide the kingdom or the wealth. Anyway, my team was sent in to rescue the sheikh. Our government didn\u2019t like the idea of a less friendly leader in control of all that oil.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes went dark as they always did when he thought of that day. Burke was pretty sure he was the only one to whom Cole had told the whole story. \u201cTal was in bad shape by the time we rescued him. We were trapped for a couple of days under fire until we got away.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUntil you managed to kill everyone.\u201d His brother still had nightmares.</p><p>Cole shrugged it off. \u201cSame difference. We got cut off from my team, and I got him out of there. Anyway, we got to be friends. He does a lot of work with Black Oak Oil, the company Gavin and Dex run with their brother, Slade. When they were looking for a firm to handle outside security, Talib recommended us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo when his cousin disappeared in New York City, he asked us to look for her,\u201d Burke explained. \u201cThe morning we left you, we\u2019d just gotten word that Delgado had a girl for us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you used a fake last name while you were investigating Marco\u2019s father,\u201d Jessa said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me the truth because...?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe were posing as men looking to buy a slave,\u201d Cole said bluntly. \u201cWe had to build a whole cover story that would check out to Ricardo Delgado\u2019s people. Any loose end could have unraveled the whole case.\u201d</p><p>Burke winced at the indelicate way his brother put everything. \u201cWe had to work very carefully to even get the elder Delgado to talk to us. It was months before the cautious bastard agreed to a meeting. We took possession of our \u2018slave\u2019 about three hours after we left you that morning. When the buy went down, we recorded everything and turned it over to the feds. It started a whole shit storm. The FBI stormed the Delgado compound and arrested Ricardo. He was dead in prison six weeks later.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd now his son wants you to feel his pain.\u201d Her fists clutched the folds of the blanket.</p><p>\u201cYes. He figured out that you were our weakness. I\u2019m sure he started investigating us. It wouldn\u2019t have taken much to find out that we\u2019d hired a private investigator named Landry to keep tabs on you while we were gone. And apparently he bribed the PI to keep us apart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Jessa looked between the two of them as if searching for answers.</p><p>Cole scrubbed a hand through his hair. \u201cWe got regular reports, Jessa. We knew you went to Scotland, and Landry said that you\u2019d gotten married there.\u201d</p><p>Bitterness welled inside Burke. So much time lost. Marco Delgado had cost him in ways Burke couldn\u2019t have imagined. Marco Delgado had made sure he hadn\u2019t been there at the birth of his child. That he hadn\u2019t held Jessa\u2019s hand and comforted her. That he hadn\u2019t been there when Caleb woke up in the middle of the night. Fucking Marco had played them like pawns on a chessboard.</p><p>Jessa rolled her eyes, a little huff coming out of her mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s the reason you kept insisting that Angus was my husband. So this PI was on Marco\u2019s payroll?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Burke sighed. \u201cAnd Landry didn\u2019t bother to mention your pregnancy. We would have come home. We were going to leave South America after we rescued Alea and come back to you. But he said that you\u2019d married...\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything to come home to but a fucking empty condo, so we decided to stay on and rescue as many as we could.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI went to Scotland early in March. That was long after you left me without a single phone call or e-mail. Or even a shred of real information about you. Don\u2019t try to cover your asses now. You could have contacted me, asked me about my \u2018marriage\u2019 yourselves. I get that you were doing something important. I really do, but I was important, too. Well, I thought I was. I realize now that I misunderstood. I was a stupid little virgin who thought sex meant love.\u201d</p><p>This was what he\u2019d wanted to avoid. \u201cJessa, we told you we love you. I still love you. Cole still loves you.\u201d</p><p>She stood, leaving the coffee and food behind. \u201cYou also told me you would come back for me, so you\u2019ll forgive me if I find your undying devotion hard to believe. You lied about everything, Burke. You\u2019re two dangerous men who amused yourselves with a little virgin who was dumb enough to get pregnant. I\u2019m sure I was an interesting conquest, but that\u2019s all I was. I\u2019m going to take a shower. No, you are not invited. Just get this guy so I can get back to my son, and you two can get on with your lives.\u201d</p><p>Cole reached out and grabbed her arm. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re going to let you go at the end of this, you don\u2019t know us at all.\u201d</p><p>She pulled away. \u201cYeah, well, since I just found out your real last name and occupation in the last twenty-four hours, I think I can safely say that you\u2019re right. I never really knew you. Now let me go. Don\u2019t you need to clean your gun or shoot bad guys or something?\u201d</p><p>As if he\u2019d been burned, Cole released her. She turned and walked to the bathroom, her face set in stubborn lines. The door closed with a little slam.</p><p>\u201cThat went well. You know you could tone down the caveman act.\u201d Burke looked down at his sandwich, but his stomach turned. He understood why Jessa didn\u2019t want to eat.</p><p>\u201cYeah, well, your nice guy act isn\u2019t working, either. I\u2019m not letting her walk away. She belongs to us. She\u2019s the mother of our child. I\u2019m not going to sit back and wave as she leaves.\u201d</p><p>So stubborn. \u201cNeither am I, but I don\u2019t think tying her up is going to work in this case.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see why not. She can\u2019t leave if she\u2019s bound to the bed with both of us deep inside her.\u201d</p><p>His brother\u2019s skull could be so fucking thick that not even a chainsaw could penetrate it. \u201cWe fucked up. We got scared for her safety and fucked up. We didn\u2019t want her to know about our work or tell her how often we get our hands bloody. We should have told her everything, but we kept our mouths shut.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes turned down. \u201cYeah, well, would it have mattered? You saw how she reacted just now. Someone as sweet as Jessa doesn\u2019t need a man as hard as me. Our job is dangerous. I\u2019m not good for her and Caleb.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not pissed about our work. She\u2019s furious that we didn\u2019t call. And the minute we thought there was an obstacle, we let her go. We shouldn\u2019t have believed Landry or given up on Jessa without checking out this \u2018husband\u2019 ourselves. We caused this. We have to make it right.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s whole body deflated. \u201cYou should work it out with her. I love her, but I\u2019m too rough. I don\u2019t fit into the life she deserves. I sure as hell can\u2019t raise a kid, not when his mom thinks I\u2019m nothing more than a gun-toting motherfucker.\u201d</p><p>\u201cDo not let Uncle Martin win. Whatever shit he told you, you aren\u2019t unwanted and unlovable. Were you listening to her, damn it?\u201d</p><p>But Cole was done. Burke could see it plainly. His brother turned away. \u201cI need to make a few more calls. Did you get what you needed off the hard drive?\u201d</p><p>Burke felt his hands tighten into fists. He knew how much Jessa meant to his brother. Cole had gone off on a two day drunk the day they got word she\u2019d married someone else. Burke wasn\u2019t sure Cole hadn\u2019t been trying to kill himself since. He\u2019d been reckless. Dangerous. Never around the women they had saved, but since he\u2019d learned about Jessa\u2019s marriage, he\u2019d taken chances he wouldn\u2019t have before.</p><p>Cole had accepted the loss not because he didn\u2019t love her, but because he didn\u2019t think he deserved her or that she could ever love him in return.</p><p>His mouth a flat line, Cole turned back to him. \u201cI\u2019ll kill Marco. My wedding gift to you two. I\u2019ll kill him for her if it\u2019s the last thing I do.\u201d</p><p>Burke was suddenly afraid that Cole\u2019s words would prove all too true.</p><p>Eleven months earlier, February 14 \u2013 New York City</p><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Jessa asked, her mind not able to really register the doctor\u2019s words.</p><p>The middle-aged woman looked entirely competent in her white coat. \u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d</p><p>Pregnant. With child. Knocked up. Left behind.</p><p>\u201cBut I was on birth control,\u201d she sputtered.</p><p>The doctor shrugged. She worked a low cost clinic for women. She\u2019d obviously heard it all before. \u201cNo birth control is one hundred percent effective. I noticed on your chart that you came in and got the prescription about seven weeks ago. Did our pharmacist explain how it worked? You have to take them every day.\u201d</p><p>She wasn\u2019t stupid. \u201cI know that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd you should use condoms for the first month. It takes some time for the hormones to take effect in your body.\u201d The doctor raised her eyebrows over very sensible looking glasses. \u201cDid she go over all of that with you?\u201d</p><p>Jessa shook her head, the reality starting to set in. \u201cI told her I didn\u2019t need a lecture. I was running late to a meeting. I thought I knew what I was doing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had girlfriends who were on the pill?\u201d the doctor asked, crossing her arms over her chest.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d She\u2019d never had real girlfriends, period. Not since sixth grade when her father decided she was far too smart to stay behind with her friends. She\u2019d been accelerated, moved through grades with no thought to her social life. She hadn\u2019t had one. She\u2019d studied and when she could, worked on her art. She\u2019d been far too young to be friends with her classmates. She\u2019d gotten used to being alone.</p><p>Except for one week when she\u2019d thought, just for a moment, that she wasn\u2019t any more. Tears spilled on her cheeks.</p><p>\u201cOh, sweetie,\u201d the doctor said, her demeanor changing in an instant. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay. Can you call the father?\u201d</p><p>Which one? She shook her head. She wasn\u2019t going to go into her m\u00e9nage relationship now. \u201cI lost his number.\u201d</p><p>The doctor took Jessa\u2019s hand in hers. \u201cYou should look him up. He should know what\u2019s happened. Look, you have options.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. I want my baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood. You\u2019re not a child. You have a job. You can come here for your appointments. It\u2019s going to be okay. But he should know.\u201d</p><p>The doctor gave her hand a reassuring squeeze and left her to get dressed.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, she walked out, the frozen blast of Manhattan air hitting her straight in the chest. What she hadn\u2019t told the doctor was that she\u2019d already tried to find them. After she\u2019d realized she had lost the number, she\u2019d tried looking them up. She knew they lived in Dallas. She knew the name of their business.</p><p>Except it didn\u2019t exist. Neither did they.</p><p>She walked back toward the hotel where she had to tell her sweet but flighty aunt that she was in trouble again. She was jostled and shoved by the crowd. She was surrounded by a throng of humanity, but she was alone. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>They weren\u2019t coming back. They had used her, and in what seemed to be the cruelest way possible. If they had just told her what they wanted, she might have gone along anyway, but she wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love. She would have guarded her heart.</p><p>But they had told her they loved her.</p><p>A ruthless little lie.</p><p>She was alone. Except she wasn\u2019t any more. Her hand went to her belly. She would never be alone again. She would have someone who needed her, whom she couldn\u2019t let down. She\u2019d spent weeks drowning in her own misery with tears, but she couldn\u2019t do that now. She had a baby to think of.</p> <p>She had a life to build. She turned. She wouldn\u2019t talk to her aunt yet. The gallery owner had made her a very interesting offer. One she\u2019d turned down because it would take her to Scotland, and she had been waiting for them.</p><p>No more waiting. They had left. They had lied. They were out there somewhere, and it was a good bet they had moved on with their lives, found another woman or two.</p><p>It was time to build her own life\u2014and one for her baby.</p><p>CHAPTER SEVEN</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p> <p>Jessa finished drying her hair and stared in the mirror. She wasn\u2019t sure she recognized the woman staring back at her. She looked tired and older than she really was. She sniffled. She\u2019d cried in the shower, the pressure just too much to handle. Her whole world had upended in the course of a few short hours, and it was damn hard to handle.</p><p>She missed Caleb. His absence was a gaping wound in her chest. It was mid-morning, the time she usually brought her canvas into the living room to catch the soft, pure light that came through her windows. She would hum and talk to Caleb while he played and napped in his blue and white playpen. The hours would fly by as she mixed her colors and brought the pictures in her head to life. But she wouldn\u2019t work today. And her latest series was gone, destroyed by a man she\u2019d met for less than a minute over a year ago. Five large canvases all burned. Two smaller ones, too, meant for a gallery.</p><p>She tried to shake it off. She didn\u2019t need the money now. Her bank account was healthy. And she would never have sold the large works. She wouldn\u2019t have put them out there on the off chance that someone would recognize the men she\u2019d painted with bold lines, broad strokes, and vibrant, vivid colors. Her agent had seen them and called them modern and erotic. She\u2019d said she could sell them in a heartbeat for a pretty penny, but Jessa had refused.</p><p>Now the point was moot. They were gone, like her pictures and her videos, like all of Caleb\u2019s toys, and the crib she\u2019d had to put together herself.</p><p>She wasn\u2019t just tired. She was angry, too. Furious.</p><p>Jessa pulled the robe she\u2019d discovered in her small bag around her body. The bathroom, despite the hot water she\u2019d used, was chilly. She\u2019d forgotten to get her clothes, but the robe was large and warm. Not as warm as she\u2019d been when she\u2019d awakened in the middle of the night with Cole\u2019s big arms around her. She\u2019d heard Burke working quietly nearby, his hands tapping at the keys of the computer. She\u2019d felt his eyes settle on them.</p> <p>And she\u2019d cuddled closer. Despite all the trauma of the night, with Cole enveloping her, she\u2019d felt safe enough to go back to sleep almost instantly. When she\u2019d awakened this morning, Burke\u2019s arms had been wrapped around her.</p><p>There was a knock on the door outside, and Jessa nearly jumped out of her skin. She took a deep breath as she heard Cole greet a man he called Kade.</p><p>Their friends from Bezakistan. The ones with whom they had wanted her to go into hiding. Jessa opened the door and walked into the cramped room. If she let Burke and Cole, they would completely steamroll her, and she wouldn\u2019t have any say in her own protection. She wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.</p><p>Two insanely gorgeous men with dark hair, dark eyes, and golden skin sauntered in, one carrying a duffel bag stuffed full. She stared. They could have walked off the pages of a magazine. Tall and lean, both men were dressed impeccably. One was slightly broader than the other, with a hawk-like air about him. The other man seemed a bit younger than his brother, his solid face handsome. He wore a faint, mischievous smile.</p><p>\u201cHello. You must be Jessa,\u201d the younger man said smoothly, somehow instantly setting her at ease as he crossed the room in two long strides. \u201cI am Kadir al Mussad. It is my greatest pleasure to meet you.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she believed him. He was one of those men who could just make a girl feel like the only woman in the world. He took her hand in both of his, surrounding her. \u201cHello.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, his lips curling, making his whole face come alive. \u201cYou are most beautiful.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCut that shit out now, Kade.\u201d Cole yanked her away from Kade.</p> <p>Damn it. Even as beautiful as this man was, she found herself attracted to two goddamn men who looked exactly alike, one a smooth talker, the other this Neanderthal glaring daggers at his friend.</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s not going to Bezakistan with you,\u201d Burke said.</p><p>The taller man frowned. \u201cPity. She would do well there. I could give her between three and five husbands very quickly. In fact, Talib would love her. He has a thing for redheads. She could save our kingdom. We only have another year left, you know.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s ours,\u201d Burke said with a little growl.</p><p>\u201cBetween three and five men?\u201d Jessa gaped. \u201cI can\u2019t handle two.\u201d</p><p>The older brother\u2019s lips curled up, but she wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a smile. Instead, the expression promised all manner of decadent delights. \u201cI think you would be surprised what you could handle if you were properly prepared. Trust me. I know how to prepare a woman.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I know how to prepare a body for burial,\u201d Cole scowled.</p><p>\u201cHe really does,\u201d Burke added, his voice deep and dark. \u201cI do, too.\u201d</p><p>The other man ignored them. \u201cI am Prince Rafiq, second in line to the throne of Bezakistan. And because my brother owes Cole his life, I regret that we must forego carrying you off to my country to seduce you.\u201d</p><p>Kade raised a brow. \u201cSeducing her is a tempting thought, but she is the mother of their child. We will honor our debt.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIndeed.\u201d He turned to Cole and Burke. \u201cReconsider sending her with us. We will keep her safe and make certain no one touches her. She can disappear into the palace. Our jet is fueled.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI appreciate the offer, but I can\u2019t leave the country,\u201d Jessa explained.</p><p>Rafe\u2019s handsome face turned down with what Jessa thought was disapproval. He waved a hand toward her, but spoke to Cole and Burke. \u201cYou will allow your precious gem to make such a decision unaided? Why is she not tied up? I have rope if you have need of it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd a gag,\u201d Kade offered. \u201cIt would be terrible to close that pretty mouth, but she looks quite capable of screaming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI bite, too,\u201d Jessa promised. Yeah, she could see why all these guys got along with the Lennox brothers.</p><p>\u201cI am sure Cole has his own rope, and I would be shocked if he hadn\u2019t gagged many a woman over the years,\u201d Rafe offered.</p><p>Jessa shook her head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, guys. I can\u2019t leave the country or this man will come after my son. I\u2019ll never have my life back until we deal with this bastard. I won\u2019t leave. Now, I would like to know exactly what\u2019s going on. Are we moving? Have we found out anything about where this Marco person is?\u201d</p><p>Burke crossed his arms over his chest. \u201cThat\u2019s my girl. And Rafe is right about Cole. He\u2019s damn good with a knot. Now, what have you two found out?\u201d</p><p>Kade straightened up, suddenly looking more professional. \u201cFirst off, Cole called earlier about your phone, Jessa. We have confirmed that no one has turned on the tracking device. You should be safe. Now, about Delgado, we have uncovered a few things. We know that he has a private jet. The FAA shows the Delgado jet filed a flight request late last night for a small town outside Albuquerque. They landed. I don\u2019t know where they went from there, but on a short flight, they wouldn\u2019t have to file another request. But you should know that I also discovered Delgado owns several businesses in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\u201d</p><p>Jessa\u2019s heart rate tripled. \u201cHe\u2019s here? In the same city as my son?\u201d</p><p>Cole held a hand out. \u201cCaleb is safe. Gavin is moving the whole family to his penthouse. They own a floor with a private elevator. They can shut the floor off from the rest of the building and lock down the stairwell, if need be. And if we get really worried about Caleb, Gavin promised to take him to Alaska. No one gets in and out of River Run without the whole town knowing it. It\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d</p><p>But Burke was frowning. \u201cWe have friends in Albuquerque. A couple of our old SEAL team members live out there. From Delgado\u2019s perspective, it would be a good bet that we\u2019d run there and potentially stash Jessa with them.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s fingers tapped along one of the briefcases he\u2019d brought in. \u201cOr it\u2019s a ruse. When I hunt, it is good for the prey to believe you are in one place when you\u2019re really in another. All I\u2019m saying is you should be careful. It would be easy for him to drive here from Albuquerque or to change planes.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI covered our tracks,\u201d Burke argued. \u201cI haven\u2019t used a credit card. The car can\u2019t be traced back to us. He could have followed us from D.C. and figured out we flew to Dallas with Gavin James, but after that, he\u2019d have no way of knowing where we are. Dallas is a big city.\u201d</p><p>\u201cUnless he has someone on the payroll at Black Oak,\u201d Cole mused.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Gavin about that.\u201d Burke frowned, but opened one of the briefcases and pulled out a new phone. He held it up to her. \u201cWe have about ten of these now. We\u2019ll toss out the ones that came from our office, just in case one of the bastards gets to Hilary. We use one for a day or so, then we toss it. Stay here with Rafe and Kade for the moment. Cole is going to change the plates on the car. I\u2019m going to scout the area. In a couple of hours, we\u2019re going to leave here and head to Louisiana. We have a Cajun friend there, a real security pro, and a damn fine Dom. He has a place in the swamp. We\u2019re going off the grid, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe has a lot of rope, too,\u201d Cole drawled, selecting a new license plate from those Kade had carried in. In fact, the Middle-Eastern hotties had brought a veritable grab bag of items to help hide a person\u2019s identity. After selecting one, Cole stared, his gaze heavy, somber\u2014completely closed. \u201cI know you\u2019re afraid and angry, Jessa. Just let me get you through this. Then you don\u2019t have to see me again.\u201d</p><p>Well, he\u2019d given up pretty easily. So maybe she\u2019d never meant much to him. Hadn\u2019t she wanted them to go away? Yes. So why did those words make her heart hurt?</p><p>Jessa swallowed down the anger and forced herself to shrug, refusing to give him the satisfaction of seeing that he\u2019d bruised her feelings. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s whole face shut down, and his shoulders squared. \u201cLet\u2019s go, brother. We need to leave tonight. Jessa, stay here. And for god\u2019s sake, eat something. I know you don\u2019t want to. Neither did I, but don\u2019t hold us back because you can\u2019t see past your own misery. We\u2019ve already got one member of the team who seems intent on doing that. I don\u2019t need another.\u201d</p><p>Burke slammed out after his brother.</p><p>He was right. As terrible as food sounded to her turning stomach, she needed to stay strong so she could get back to her son. Caleb mattered to her. Cole and Burke didn\u2019t. She had to keep telling herself that.</p><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re Jessa.\u201d Kade sat down in the chair at the room\u2019s single table. It was a wobbly thing, but Kade made it seem almost elegant.</p><p>\u201cI am.\u201d She wished one of the twins would have stayed. Suddenly, she was brutally aware that she was alone in a motel room with two very virile strangers who shared their women and all she wore was a robe.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been listening to those two moan about you for a solid year,\u201d he explained. \u201cWell, Burke moaned. Cole simply brooded more than usual.\u201d</p><p>She picked up the last sandwich. Her stomach turned. \u201cI thought they were in South America for the last year. Not the Middle East.\u201d</p><p>Rafe stared at her. His easy charm seemed to be gone. \u201cWe\u2019re not really the Middle East, at least according to our neighbors. They don\u2019t like our...customs.\u201d He shrugged. \u201cWe hardly care. The Lennox brothers have been in South America. Because of the rescue operation they undertook, we talked to them on a regular basis. You seem to be under the impression that those men have been throwing a party.\u201d</p><p>Talk about accusations. At least the idea of a good argument made it seem easier to eat. She swallowed the first bite and reached for a bottled water. \u201cI realize they were working.\u201d</p><p>Kade leaned forward. \u201cThey risked their lives every single day. We hired them, so we feel a bit responsible for the situation they find themselves in. After all, they were looking for our cousin.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cAlea.\u201d She remembered the name they had given her and wondered about the woman. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d</p><p>Rafe sighed, a deep sound of regret that filled the room. \u201cShe is alive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was brutalized.\u201d Kade threaded his hands together as though steeling himself. \u201cShe hid her ties to our family because she wanted a normal life. She is a beautiful girl both inside and out. Our little cousin was always a rebel.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSometimes I think she left Bezakistan because there weren\u2019t enough down-trodden people for her to help.\u201d Rafe paced as he talked. \u201cShe wanted to save the world. The world showed her that it doesn\u2019t want to be saved.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d Kade argued.</p><p>Rafe shook his head, a tiny, somewhat brutal gesture. Jessa would have bet this was a well-worn argument.</p><p>Kade nodded his brother\u2019s way. \u201cForgive him. He\u2019s still angry. I am as well, but I know that Alea will eventually come out of this. She will live again. Her mind and her heart will heal. But only because Burke and Cole Lennox saved her.\u201d He massaged the place between his eyebrows as though trying to soothe away his frown. \u201cShe refused a security detail when she went away to school. She isn\u2019t in line for the throne, so we didn\u2019t think she\u2019d truly be in any danger. She disappeared six months into her school year. They took her because they thought she had no family and the whoremongers needed a woman of Middle-Eastern descent. The brothel Ricardo Delgado sold her to liked to keep a variety of women for their clientele.\u201d</p><p>There went her appetite again. The idea of a young woman being sold made her shudder. Her heart went out to the woman. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was drugged. All of the girls were fed a steady diet of chemical crap.\u201d Rafe bit the words out like bullets. \u201cShe begged for the drugs for weeks after she came home. She was down to skin and bones, but all she wanted was another hit. That\u2019s just one of the many things they did to her. She still has terrible nightmares...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen Burke and Cole found her,\u201d Kade continued, his voice going hard for the first time, \u201cshe was being held with fifteen other women. It pleases me to lie awake at night and think about everything your men did to the bastards who held those girls against their will. Their descriptions were pleasingly detailed. I have a vivid picture in my head.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what Alea went through.\u201d She shivered despite the robe, feeling so terrible for the young woman. Even after she\u2019d been saved, it was obvious Alea still had a hard road ahead of her. Delgado had ruined many lives, and now his son seemed determined to keep up the family business.</p><p>\u201cNo, you can\u2019t,\u201d Kade replied. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want you to. But I am asking you to take into consideration that their work was vital to us and the families of the other girls they rescued. Yes, they sacrificed. But Burke and Cole also saved lives.\u201d</p><p>Jessa stiffened her spine. \u201cOf course their work was important. I don\u2019t disagree. And I would have understood the truth. But the fact is, they lied to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWould you have understood? Really?\u201d Rafe asked, his tone slightly arrogant, as if he\u2019d already determined the answer to the question.</p><p>So they had judged her. \u201cI would have done my very best. Maybe it sounds selfish to you, but I wanted to be important, too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey believed you had been claimed by another man,\u201d Rafe said.</p><p>\u201cSomething that could have been cleared up if they had given me a real name or had called me even once.\u201d She felt tears threatening. God, she didn\u2019t want to feel this aching, gaping hole in her chest. She wanted to feel nothing at all for them. \u201cIf I had known what they were doing, I would have sat up at night praying for them. I would have loved them, but they didn\u2019t give me the chance. They didn\u2019t trust me enough.\u201d</p><p>Rafe\u2019s eyes softened slightly. \u201cMen are sometimes not the smartest of creatures. We make decisions that we think are best to protect those we love. And sometimes, we make mistakes. It doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t know our hearts. If they have told you they love you, then they mean this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are good men. The best I know,\u201d Kade said softly. \u201cThey are rough at times, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have tenderness for you, for your son. It would be a shame if that son never knew his fathers.\u201d</p><p>She glared at Kade. That just wasn\u2019t fair. She was just supposed to forgive Burke and Cole the instant they walked back into her life? They had cost her a terrible year of heartache and pain, and never given her a choice. \u201cThe funny thing is, if they had asked me to take the risk and go to South America with them, I would have. Or I would have stayed here and waited, as tough as it would have been. I would have done whatever they asked. But they didn\u2019t give me a choice.\u201d</p><p>Yes, she was probably being stubborn, but the more she thought about it, the angrier she got. Of course they were heroes; there was no question about it. But did that mean she was just supposed to take them back without a qualm? What happened the next time they had a \u201cmission\u201d they believed in? Would they leave her behind for months or more at a time with no communications? Would they decide that their son was safer without them and simply walk out again, this time for good? They wouldn\u2019t simply be leaving her behind. They\u2019d be breaking Caleb\u2019s heart, too.</p><p>No. She didn\u2019t think she could risk that. She wasn\u2019t sure she was ready to trust them again.</p><p>And that made her brutally angry because she wanted to. She wanted to throw herself in their arms and beg them to love her, never leave her again. Though they had left her pregnant and alone, she still dreamed of them. She still woke up calling out their names.</p> <p>She swiped angry tears away. She wasn\u2019t listening to her stupid heart this time. She couldn\u2019t afford to. She wasn\u2019t a child anymore. Now she was a mother.</p><p>Rafe straightened his coat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I overstepped my bounds. I merely hoped to give you something to think about. Know that if you need anything at all, we will help you.\u201d</p><p>Kade stood. \u201cIndeed. All you need to do is call.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know me. Why would you do that?\u201d These men confounded her. They were obviously powerful, yet they seemed to genuinely care about Cole and Burke, who were basically employees. They were royal, in line for a kingdom, yet they were risking their lives to help others out.</p><p>\u201cThe royal family of Bezakistan owes the Lennox brothers a debt for saving one of our family. Actually, two, since Cole also saved my brother, Talib,\u201d Kade explained. \u201cWhen I asked how we should repay them, do you know what your men asked for?\u201d</p><p>Rafe shook his head. \u201cMy brother would have given them millions. Anything they wanted.\u201d</p><p>More tears. Would they ever stop? \u201cI know they didn\u2019t ask for money.\u201d</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t. They would want to be paid for the job, but not for saving a life. She knew that deep in her soul.</p><p>Rafe regarded her seriously. \u201cYou know them better than you think. They asked us to bankroll the rest of their operation, though they did not take pay for themselves. They wanted to save as many women as they could. Seven women have been reunited with their families. And another three families at least no longer have to wonder what happened to their daughter or sisters.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey drove a rough bargain,\u201d Kade explained. \u201cWe not only had to pay for their travel and expenses, but for these women to see a counselor and for their drug rehabilitation.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI would pay millions more for it to have never happened.\u201d Rafe regarded her somberly. \u201cI have never told Cole or Burke this, but we do not consider our debt paid. This is something we would have done regardless. One day, we shall repay them. You say you do not know these men, but when asked that question, you knew immediately that they wouldn\u2019t do what was easy. Search your heart. Perhaps it is yourself that you do not know.\u201d</p><p>The door opened, and Burke walked in, rubbing his hands together. His face paled when he looked at Jessa. \u201cSweetheart? Why are you crying?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll leave you alone now,\u201d Rafe said, gesturing for his brother to leave.</p><p>Kade followed him. \u201cI wish you well, my friend. In all things. Bring your family to the palace when this is over\u2014or sooner. You are always welcome in our country.\u201d</p><p>They left, slapping Cole on the shoulder as he walked in, his face blank.</p><p>\u201cThe car\u2019s ready, but I\u2019d rather lay low until it\u2019s dark. If they\u2019ve got a visual on us, it will be much harder to follow us once the sun is down. It\u2019s about six hours from Dallas to Lafayette and another hour to the swamp. I\u2019ve made all the arrangements.\u201d Cole spoke, but there was no inflection in his tone. He could have been talking about the weather.</p><p>It was so easy for Cole to shut down. He seemed to be a pro at it. But what would happen if she broke the barrier down and got to the real man? Something angry took root in her gut. Something wicked and restless was making her heart twitch.</p><p>\u201cJessa, sweetheart, tell me why you\u2019re crying.\u201d Burke gripped her hand, his eyes seeking hers.</p><p>Cole crowded in on the other side, looking ready to make demands. Her body leapt. For whatever reason, she\u2019d always be attuned to them. She felt their fear for her, their fury with Delgado. Their need to keep her safe. And to hold her.</p><p>God, she wanted the comfort they silently offered. That connection she felt to them reached out in a silent scream with almost painful yearning. She ached for just one hour of nothing but their reassurance, their touch. She wanted to break past Cole\u2019s defenses.</p><p>But she couldn\u2019t accept their tenderness. And couldn\u2019t admit that she wanted them, would probably never want another man. They\u2019d construe either as surrender, and she\u2019d have to work twice as hard to convince them to let her out of their lives. If she accepted tender kisses and soft words, cutting them out of her heart again might be impossible.</p><p>But she wanted them again, one last time. She pulled her hand away from Burke\u2019s and glanced at the clock. It was hours before dark. Hours before they would flee. She smiled to herself. She wanted Burke and Cole now. On her terms. And she knew exactly how to persuade them to give it to her.</p><p>Eight months earlier, April 5 \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p><p>Cole stared at Hilary. No way he\u2019d heard her right. He didn\u2019t like the woman, but she was smart and ran the office well. Still, she had her blonde moments. She had to be wrong about this.</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Burke shook off Hilary\u2019s touch. \u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><p>She put a hand on his brother\u2019s shoulder, her eyes going soft with sympathy. When she looked like she was about to repeat herself, he felt his own go cold and dead. Exactly like his heart.</p><p>\u201cThat woman you\u2019re having Mr. Landry follow, she got married,\u201d she murmured.</p><p>The words still didn\u2019t seem to compute to Burke, but Cole heard them. Loud and clear. They echoed in his ears. Married. To another man. Their Jessa. No, not their Jessa anymore. Less than four months after they had left her with kisses and vows to return, she not only started dating another man, she\u2019d married him, tied her life to him. Given him her eternal love.</p><p>\u201cI am so sorry, Burke,\u201d Hilary said, taking a step back. She looked to Cole, her eyes sliding away silently.</p><p>She always addressed Burke, the gentleman. Cole couldn\u2019t remember a time Hilary had looked him in the eyes, as though she was afraid of what she would find there. No surprise. She viewed him as a violent barbarian.</p><p>Hilary placed a manila folder on the desk in front of him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it is about this woman that has you all tied up in knots, but according to this report, she\u2019s happily married, so if she\u2019s one of your little projects, you don\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d</p><p>Burke grabbed the report before Cole could. He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to see it anyway. If there were pictures of the happy couple, the image would probably sear itself into his brain. Already, he could picture too vividly Jessa with someone else, speaking words of devotion. Making love, giving her body to him night after night. Her gifting him with all of her luminous smiles and her warm laughter.</p><p>Cole turned away. He didn\u2019t want to see the fucking report. He wanted to see Jessa. He could be on a plane and in New York in just a couple of hours. He could stand in front of her and ask her if they\u2019d ever meant a damn thing to her. He and Burke had loved her. Neither one had even thought of touching another woman since they\u2019d left Jessa. She\u2019d apparently done a hell of a lot more than think about it. Fuck.</p><p>Burke slammed the folder down.</p><p>\u201cI really am sorry, Burke,\u201d Hilary said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to send that file to you. But I had to be honest. Who is she?\u201d</p><p>Burke shook his head, his gaze hardening. \u201cApparently, no one special.\u201d</p><p>No one special. Just a woman he would love for the rest of his life. His heart ached. Though it made him furious, the voice in his head asked: Did you really expect her to wait for you? No one gives a shit about you, least of all a gorgeous, talented creature like her. Stupid bastard. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Wincing, he looked at his brother. Burke\u2019s face had shut down.</p><p>\u201cBurke? Is there anything I can do?\u201d Hilary asked. \u201cYou must be so tired. I can make reservations for dinner. You need to eat.\u201d</p><p>Burke shook his head. \u201cNo, thank you. Not hungry. Get us back on a plane to Colombia.\u201d</p><p>Hilary\u2019s eyes widened, her lip forming a pout. \u201cBut you just got here. Burke, your wounds aren\u2019t completely healed.\u201d</p> <p>A cold professional mask slid across Burke\u2019s face. Cole was fairly certain that his own mirrored that desolation. \u201cGive us a moment.\u201d</p><p>Hilary nodded reluctantly and walked out of the room.</p><p>\u201cI want to go to New York,\u201d Cole blurted.</p><p>\u201cWhat would it prove? And according to that report, she\u2019s moved.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI want to lay eyes on this fucker. What\u2019s his name?\u201d Cole demanded.</p> <p>Burke\u2019s laugh was humorless. \u201cAngus. He\u2019s from Scotland.\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d married someone named Angus? \u201cShe can\u2019t be serious. We\u2019ve got to go.\u201d</p><p>They could talk to her, force her to tell them just why she\u2019d promised to wait when she\u2019d obviously had no intention of being there when they came home.</p><p>Fuck, he still loved her. He didn\u2019t want to let her go, but he couldn\u2019t bear to see her with this man who had replaced them in her heart. He couldn\u2019t see a ring on her finger and know he hadn\u2019t put it there.</p><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t go, Cole.\u201d Burke scrubbed a hand over his hair. \u201cShe never called.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t call her, either.\u201d He regretted that fact on a daily basis, but it had been too dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cWhen were we supposed to call, man? We\u2019ve been deep undercover for months. We have to face facts. She didn\u2019t love us. It\u2019s over. Fuck.\u201d Burke turned away. He stalked to his desk and picked up the phone. \u201cRafiq al Mussad, please. Yes, tell him this is Burke Lennox, and he needs to call me soon. We\u2019re heading back to Colombia soon. We need to meet with him.\u201d</p><p>Cole stared out his window. Miles separated him from Jessa, but even if she stood in front of him now, he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach her.</p><p>His future was over. He needed a drink.</p><p>Burke continued to make plans, but Cole could see the rest of his life mapped out in a neat plan. Fight. Fight. Die. Alone. Maybe he would save a few people, but the only woman who could have saved him was lost.</p><p>CHAPTER EIGHT</p><p>Present Day \u2013 Dallas, Texas</p><p>Cole watched Jessa, his every instinct on overload. She was thinking something, up to something. She glared at him, then paced the small room, her feet padding across the floor in a quick step that told him all about her anxiety\u2014and her anger.</p><p>Of course she was angry. In her head, they had lied, but it hadn\u2019t really seemed like a lie at the time. It had been a cover. They went undercover enough that it was just part of the job.</p> <p>But this particular cover had blown up in their faces. Burke could be as optimistic as he wanted. She wasn\u2019t coming back. Not now that she\u2019d decided what they really were.</p><p>Mercenaries.</p><p>He hated that fucking word. It sounded selfish, made them seem like men who sold their services to anyone with cash, who used their power and strength, no matter the cause and no matter who got hurt. That wasn\u2019t him, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to convince Jessa. Did he even deserve a chance to try at this point? He sighed. And how would their son regard them when he got older, grew up?</p><p>\u201cSo, how long do you expect me to live in a swamp?\u201d</p><p>Cole watched her pace, her hands clenching and unclenching. She was ready to explode, and he was going to let her. Maybe if she bled off some of her tension naturally, he wouldn\u2019t be tempted to throw her onto the bed and force orgasms on her until she relaxed. He liked that plan much better, but she didn\u2019t want him. Uncle Martin had been right; he wasn\u2019t good for anything. No one would ever love him.</p><p>Burke crossed his arms over his chest and stared straight at Cole. \u201cWell? Don\u2019t you have some caveman comeback to that one?\u201d</p><p>Cole just shook his head.</p><p>\u201cNot a single word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Burke wanted to bait him into losing his temper, and Cole refused to let him. Burke wanted him to grab Jessa and push pleasure on her until she melted in his arms, then pass her to his brother so he could give her more of the same. But Cole wasn\u2019t going to give his brother the satisfaction of showing Jessa how much he loved and wanted her. Or of trying to break her down and soften her up for them. It was pointless. She wasn\u2019t coming back.</p><p>Burke\u2019s growl came from the back of his throat. His brother was getting really angry, a surprise since Burke rarely lost his temper. That was Cole\u2019s job, but Burke seemed willing to take over for him. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll do what I always do. I\u2019ll fucking speak for you. Jessa, you\u2019ll stay in the swamp for as long as it takes, until we tell you it\u2019s all right to go.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes narrowed. \u201cOr maybe I\u2019ll call the cops myself. He can\u2019t possibly own every single one of them. Maybe I would be better off taking my chances with them than the two of you. At least they won\u2019t lie to me.\u201d</p><p>Cole felt his whole body flinch, like she\u2019d hit him with a bullet. No, a bullet would hurt less.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not calling anyone.\u201d Burke crossed his arms over his chest and intentionally crowded Jessa. He got right into her space, towering over her. \u201cDo you honestly believe we haven\u2019t tried everything we could in the short amount of time we\u2019ve had? We have people calling the feds, the US Attorney\u2019s office, the DA of New York. These things take time. That\u2019s what Marco is counting on.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr maybe he\u2019s counting on the fact that he\u2019s had months and months to prepare for this and he knows exactly what you\u2019ll do at every turn, like just sitting here and waiting for him to come get us.\u201d Her body was practically vibrating with anger.</p><p>\u201cDo you think I like sitting around? Do you honestly believe I wouldn\u2019t rather be out looking for this bastard? If I knew you\u2019d be safe, I would. But I don\u2019t know if this asshole is nearby, and driving around in the middle of the day is just asking for someone to spot us. So until dark, we\u2019re staying. What the fuck else do you want me to do, Jessa?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGo back a year ago and change everything. Hell, if I could go back, I\u2019d be smarter, see through you two. I should have known exactly what you were. I can see it so clearly now.\u201d Her fists were little balls of barely contained emotion. Even her toes seemed curled, biting around the cheap carpet.</p><p>\u201cAnd just what are we?\u201d Burke challenged. \u201cLay it out, sweetheart. Put it all out there.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re liars.\u201d</p><p>Cole closed his eyes. That hurt almost as badly as the idea that they were mercenaries. Did she think they lied to everyone or just sweet virgins like her, looking for affection? Did she believe they really made money off saving or taking human lives? Probably. He\u2019d been called worse, but never by someone he cared about.</p><p>\u201cWe were undercover. Did you want us to walk around giving the bad guys business cards?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter. They seemed to have figured out who you are. They were way smarter than I was.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOf course, they figured it out. We had to file a ton of paperwork to get the feds to accept the evidence we\u2019d collected. We had to put the bad guy away. Don\u2019t act like we\u2019re the villains in this scenario. We were the ones saving the women, and you know it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t save me, did you?\u201d she said acidly.</p><p>Cole felt his fucking heart almost stop at the question. Unlike her previous rantings, this question came out of her mouth with a hint of vulnerability that broke his heart. The hurt in her eyes was raw, like it had been scrubbed to bleeding with steel wool. Guilt churned in his gut.</p><p>Burke softened up a bit. He reached out for her. \u201cSweetheart, we didn\u2019t know you needed us or were in danger. The minute we thought you were, we came for you.\u201d</p><p>The vulnerable girl was gone in a heartbeat, righteously angry female taking her place. \u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about that, you asshole. I was talking about the fact that you left me alone and pregnant, and if Marco Delgado hadn\u2019t decided I would make a spectacularly good Judas goat, you would never have come back for me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe would have checked.\u201d Burke\u2019s hands came back down, his fingers twitching as though they really wanted to be on her. Cole knew his brother. Burke thought if he could get his hands on her, he could smooth their way back. Cole didn\u2019t think Jessa wanted to be placated. She wanted to fight, and they were the only available targets.</p><p>\u201cWould you? Or would you have just moved on to the next job and the next female who was stupid enough to buy into your routine?\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a routine, and we would have checked on you.\u201d</p><p>She turned those big green eyes on him. Cole felt his heart stutter. \u201cWould you, Cole? Really? Would you have come looking for me, a woman you thought was married?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d He\u2019d died a little the day he\u2019d heard about her marriage. A piece of himself had shriveled, and he\u2019d buried it. He wouldn\u2019t have gone back. He wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see her with her husband. \u201cWe\u2019d already discussed it and decided to leave you in peace.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Cole. Can you think for two seconds before you say something? Why are you sitting there? I know you love her. Why are you just letting her tear us apart?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe can love her all we want, but we\u2019re not together, Burke. I can\u2019t tear us apart because she\u2019s not going to let us close to her again.\u201d</p><p>And it hurt like hell. Cole had never felt more alive than when he\u2019d been with Jessa. With her, he\u2019d felt like he\u2019d been good at something other than his fucking job. He\u2019d been good at loving her.</p><p>Then he\u2019d fucked up.</p><p>He watched as Burke spewed angry words her way, and she yelled right back. Yes, he\u2019d fucked up. Brutally. He had told Jessa the truth. They wouldn\u2019t have gone back. Cole knew he would have taken job after job after job until it killed him. That fucker Landry had lied to him about Jessa\u2019s marriage, and he\u2019d swallowed every damn word. He would have gone to his grave heartbroken, loving her...and believing that she belonged to another man.</p><p>\u201cHave you thought about the fact that Caleb is our son?\u201d Burke challenged.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably Cole\u2019s son.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think that matters to me? That I give a shit?\u201d Burke shot back. \u201cWe\u2019ve shared everything since the moment we were conceived. In my heart, that is my son, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let you shove me out of his life.\u201d</p><p>She was toe to toe with Burke, her face more alive than he\u2019d seen in hours. She was flushed, her hair sliding out of its ponytail with every shake of her head. Little tendrils of red hair escaped to flutter around her face. She was so goddamn beautiful. Even when she was screaming at them, Cole was utterly fascinated with her.</p><p>Could he really let that go\u2014her go\u2014because he was worried he was everything she accused him of being? Was he going to let his uncle keep taunting him from the grave? Jessa wasn\u2019t married. She\u2019d given birth to their son. Cole still fucking loved her. She\u2019d cared about him once. Maybe...Burke had a point.</p><p>Cole paused and really watched her. He\u2019d been mired in his own misery and hadn\u2019t looked beyond her beauty, her anger. But now he did. His eyes narrowed. It was as if she wanted to...provoke them. For a fight? Or something else?</p><p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be in his life at all,\u201d she insisted.</p><p>\u201cHow can you say that, Jessa? He\u2019s our son. We\u2019re his fathers.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t care enough about me to call and find out that you had a son, but I\u2019m supposed to believe you\u2019re suddenly going to be dads of the year?\u201d</p><p>Burke gritted his teeth, clearly nearing the end of his control. \u201cI\u2019ve explained that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou gave me an excuse. How hard would it have been to pick up the damn phone?\u201d She turned to Cole. \u201cThere were three months between the time you left and I returned from Scotland with my supposed husband. Three months. Ninety days in which you could have called me. Ninety days of me waiting and believing that you\u2019d abandoned me.\u201d</p><p>She said it with an angry growl, but there was something else underneath. Burke continued to argue his case. Cole frowned, working to shove aside his own guilt and misery, his uncle\u2019s destructive words. He watched her. She just kept picking at them, getting more frustrated with every one of Burke\u2019s comebacks.</p><p>\u201cJust admit it, Burke. You found a dumb virgin who gave you two exactly the kink you two wanted, then you left with no intention of ever coming back. You\u2019d gotten what you wanted and you were through. And you.\u201d She turned to look directly at Cole, her gaze laced with some sense of anticipation, like she sought something. \u201cYou\u2019re sick. Perverted.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole absorbed her words, but he was calmer now. Thinking. Watching. She was after something, and he didn\u2019t think it was simply the means to let out her anger. If that was all she sought, he\u2019d take her rage. But there was something about the way she sidled closer and stared at him that made him question the reason behind her tirade.</p><p>\u201cYes. I\u2019m very sick, baby.\u201d He gentled his tone. If he could calm her down by agreeing with her, then he would. But his guess was that his composure would only piss her off more. If so...he\u2019d know exactly what she needed. \u201cI\u2019m damaged. I\u2019m not good for you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoddamn it, Cole.\u201d Burke\u2019s anger came off him in waves, blasting at his brother who had always been able to sense his strong emotions.</p><p>Jessa stiffened, her rage seeming to escalate, not dissipate. \u201cDo you spank all your stupid little conquests? Poor Cole, can\u2019t get it up without a little kink. He has to tie up women or they might run away.\u201d</p> <p>Jessa wasn\u2019t just spewing anger. She was painting him a picture with her words. If all she wanted was for him to admit his sins against her, he\u2019d done that. But she kept poking.</p><p>\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t have anything to say? You just don\u2019t care, Cole. I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised. Under all that aggressive attitude, you give up. You back down, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re just going to stand there and let a girl tell you off.\u201d She shrugged like it didn\u2019t matter.</p><p>But it did, and he was beginning to get the picture.</p><p>Burke opened his mouth to start defending Cole\u2019s honor, but he stopped his brother with a shake of his head. Burke didn\u2019t need to waste his breath. All this bullshit of Jessa\u2019s wasn\u2019t really about him.</p><p>\u201cBig, bad Dom, huh?\u201d She scoffed, baiting Cole even more.</p> <p>The pieces slid together, unmistakable. She\u2019d clung to him in the night, and for part of it, she hadn\u2019t been asleep. He\u2019d been able to feel her breath take on an uneven rhythm as she\u2019d awakened, restlessly moving until he\u2019d wrapped his arms around her to force her to be still. He\u2019d felt her stiffen for a moment and worried she would reject him, but she\u2019d simply melted back into him and fallen back to sleep, their arms and legs entangled. She\u2019d woken this morning wrapped around Burke. She\u2019d wanted comfort, but she wouldn\u2019t ask for it.</p><p>This argument was no different. She was fighting, battling against him when he\u2019d laid down his arms and given her the victory. Yet she still poked him, as though picking a scab she couldn\u2019t let heal over. Because she didn\u2019t want it to. Fuck. If he was right, then she was in a corner, wanting something from them, but having no idea how to fight past her pride to simply ask for it.</p><p>So she\u2019d maneuvered him into taking it. She might need him far more than he\u2019d expected.</p><p>\u201cNot so tough without handcuffs and a ball gag, are you?\u201d She glared with disdain.</p><p>Cole tested the waters, crossing the room to tower over her. He laced his arms over his chest and got in her personal space, leveled a dark, heavy stare at her. A thousand dirty thoughts of Jessa naked and under him, between him and Burke, crossed his mind. He let every one of them show in his eyes. Relief and arousal flared across her face. She should be backing away, but she wasn\u2019t, because Cole could clearly see that she didn\u2019t merely want to stir his ire. She\u2019d been looking to rouse his dick, maybe even his heart. She wanted them. Needed them? The next few hours would tell.</p><p>This might not solve anything, but he wasn\u2019t giving up his forever without a fight. He hoped that his uncle rotting in hell was gnashing his teeth. He was done stewing on all the swill the old man had shoved down his throat. Jessa might not love him, but she cared. That would be enough for now. It was a start.</p> <p>\u201cJessa, turn off your mouth, or we\u2019re going to have some serious punishment.\u201d</p><p>Though he\u2019d spoken quietly, both Jessa and Burke shut up immediately. The air froze.</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to punish me.\u201d Her breathing picked up pace. Her cheeks flushed.</p><p>Stubborn little sub. \u201cI\u2019ll take it if I have to. You don\u2019t top me, baby.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh, but you want me to.\u201d He edged closer, satisfied with her sharp intake of breath.</p><p>Then her shoulders relaxed, and her eyes softened, as though she knew she was going to get what she wanted. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p><p>Oh, she was so digging her own grave with those breathless words. He smiled.</p> <p>\u201cYou won\u2019t admit the truth. I suspect you\u2019re going to fight me, even though we both know you want this. You want me to take you, Jessa. I showed you a whole world, then I left you alone to suffer. You haven\u2019t been with anyone since that night, have you? Don\u2019t you dare lie to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll lie to you all I like, Cole. Our whole relationship has been a lie.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, but I understand why you feel that way. Now, we have a few hours before we can leave. Do you want to sit down and rationally figure out how to deal with this or do you want to play this game out to its inevitable conclusion?\u201d He felt so much calmer now. The guilt was still there, but now he could see plainly that she needed what only he could give her.</p><p>Burke stood silently beside his brother, allowing Cole to take the lead. He stared at Jessa, his eyes hooding. Yeah, his twin was finally in the know and on board.</p><p>\u201cWhat game is it that you think I\u2019m playing?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re topping from the bottom, baby.\u201d And normally, he wouldn\u2019t rise to the bait, but if this was his only way back to her, he\u2019d bend his rules this once. \u201cYou\u2019re doing your damndest to manipulate me to a place where I simply take you and you don\u2019t have to consent. You want us both, but you\u2019re too hurt to ask for what you need. There\u2019s only one problem with that scenario. This has to be consensual. I won\u2019t rape you, not even to pretend.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to make love with you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, you want me to fuck you. If I took that robe off you right now, would I find your nipples hard? Would they be standing up straight, all peaked for me? If I slid my hands down your body and buried my fingers in your pussy, would I find you wet and ready for me?\u201d</p><p>She swallowed, then tried to pass off a shrug. \u201cIf I was, it doesn\u2019t mean I love you. It just means I haven\u2019t had some in a long time.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBaby, I haven\u2019t touched anyone since I walked out of that hotel room. I won\u2019t touch anyone else for the rest of my life. I love you. I love you with every ounce of my being, and I\u2019ll die before I ever take another woman.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes flared with hope. He watched her squash it quickly with pain and fear. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHe hasn\u2019t, Jessa,\u201d Burke murmured. \u201cI haven\u2019t touched anyone in a year, either, sweetheart. In my head, in my heart, it would have been cheating. Even after we thought you had gotten married, we couldn\u2019t look at another woman. You\u2019re it for us. We fucked up. We let our work and our own misery and guilt defeat us. If I could do it again, I would have told you everything.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t fix this, Burke.\u201d She crossed her arms over her chest and fought tears. \u201cNot now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he can\u2019t. I can\u2019t fix the past either, Jessa. I can only promise that the future is going to be different. Now, you need to decide how this is going to go. We can talk. I can be gentle. Or I can give you what all three of us need.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf I sleep with you, it\u2019s only because I want to fuck you out of my system.\u201d</p><p>The words hurt, but he wasn\u2019t going to stop. \u201cAnd if I sleep with you, it\u2019s only because I love you and I want to imprint myself on you. We want to fuck you so hard, you\u2019ll never be rid of us. You\u2019ll always feel us deep inside you.\u201d</p><p>Burke took up the declaration. \u201cYou won\u2019t ever be able to forget how it feels to be in between us, to be surrounded and loved. If we fuck you, it\u2019s because we need you. I love you, Jessa. I want to marry you and have more kids, build a real family with you. But if you need to call this sex, then I\u2019ll take that, too.\u201d</p><p>There were tears in her eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. I\u2019ll never believe you. I hate you both.\u201d</p><p>Cole closed his eyes briefly. There was a part of himself that wondered if he should let her go and let her find someone who didn\u2019t come with baggage. She deserved a lifestyle that wouldn\u2019t isolate her. But he silenced that voice. She\u2019d loved them once; she could do it again. Now that he knew she needed them, he couldn\u2019t walk away. No matter what the cost. He reached for her hand and swept her up into his arms, her weight reminding him of everything he\u2019d missed for the last year. \u201cHate me all you like. We\u2019ll love you enough for all of us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d she said, but she was already softening in his arms.</p><p>Cole scoffed. \u201cWhatever. You remember your safe word?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck you, Cole.\u201d She spat the words out. She\u2019d apparently gotten comfortable with cussing. She\u2019d likely cursed them every day they had been apart.</p><p>Cole didn\u2019t let it bother him. He knew the game now, and he intended to win. \u201cOh, we\u2019ll get to that. But you\u2019d better spit out your safe word first, or we\u2019re going to stand here all afternoon and wait until you do.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou bastard,\u201d she mumbled. \u201cResolution.\u201d</p><p>He smiled. \u201cGood. Now I definitely think our little sub requires some discipline. Burke, we\u2019re going to need the clamps. All of them.\u201d</p><p>He tossed her on the bed. Her robe gaped open showing off the breasts he\u2019d dreamed of every night since he\u2019d met her. They were beautiful and a bit rounder after having their son, with skin so soft he\u2019d never been able to forget the feel of it. Just like he\u2019d thought, her nipples were hard little nubs. And for the first time, there was just a bit of fear in those green eyes.</p><p>Yeah, he liked that, too. His cock throbbed in his jeans when he considered all the nasty, explicit things he could do to her.</p><p>Every muscle in his body was on full alert. He\u2019d dreamed of this, of having her again. Of sinking into her body and never leaving. \u201cPull the robe wide open. Let me see every fucking inch of you.\u201d</p><p>Her mouth firmed, and he watched as she undoubtedly decided whether or not to defy him. Her hands finally went to the tie of her robe, and she pulled it open quickly, without a hint of seduction.</p><p>If she thought that was going to deter him, she had another thing coming.</p><p>As Jessa revealed her body to him, Cole noted the differences. She carried a few more curves. She had a few stretch marks and a straight scar across her lower abdomen.</p><p>\u201cI had a C-section. If it bothers you, I can get dressed.\u201d She started to pull the robe on again, but Cole pushed her hands away.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful.\u201d His whole body responded to her. Every cell inside him felt like it was coming to life after a long period of hibernation. He\u2019d been surviving since the moment he\u2019d walked away from her. Just existing. Now he felt alive again.</p><p>This woman in front of him was all that mattered. Jessa, his brother, and the son they had made together. If they were the only people in his world, he would be fine with that. He shoved aside everything else. No more guilt. No more doubt. No more hiding away. He had a new mission. To make Jessa love him again.</p><p>And Cole Lennox never failed a mission.</p><p>Jessa held her breath. He\u2019d said she was beautiful, but she knew she looked different than the last time he\u2019d seen her naked. Her breasts weren\u2019t as perky. They had fed a child for nearly three months. She had scars from her surgery and stretch marks. She wasn\u2019t some perfect little virgin anymore. She was a woman, and she had the marks to prove it.</p><p>Was this a huge mistake? Probably, but it was hers to make. She wanted Cole and Burke. She wanted to remember what it felt like to be wanted one last time.</p><p>Oh, she wasn\u2019t going to take them back. She couldn\u2019t trust them. They could talk a good game, but she didn\u2019t dare open her heart up to them again. She just wanted tonight. Well, maybe a few nights. A few kisses and caresses and memories to keep her warm when they were gone again. That probably made her an idiot, but she\u2019d never wanted anyone but them. They\u2019d used her, and she still wanted them. This was her last chance to get over them.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you\u2019re so fucking gorgeous.\u201d Cole stared down at her.</p><p>\u201cFuck. I didn\u2019t think I would get to see you this way again.\u201d Burke breathed the words out. He stood beside his brother, his previous anger seemingly spent. Burke had been willing to fight. Cole hadn\u2019t. He\u2019d closed in on himself. The walls he\u2019d seemingly placed between them had enraged Jessa. But he\u2019d still seen her, read her need. That was all that mattered now.</p><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t lost all my baby weight.\u201d Now she was nervous. Without the anger raging through her system, she felt vulnerable, a little worried. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Cole\u2019s eyes went hard. \u201cNot another disparaging word. You\u2019re beautiful, Jessa. I won\u2019t let anyone insult you, even yourself.\u201d</p><p>He was using that voice on her, the one that went to a deep, dark place when he took control. It was rich and oozed authority. Burke\u2019s rich tone was pure seduction, but when Cole started telling her what to do in that dark honeyed growl of his, she couldn\u2019t resist him.</p><p>\u201cPut your hands over your head. It\u2019s been a long time, and I want to inspect you. I want to learn your body all over again.\u201d</p><p>Jessa winced. She just wanted to have sex, but he was going to drag this out, make it a lavish, prolonged affair. A glance into his resolute face told her that he wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. She\u2019d pushed, and now she had to take what he gave her. Oh, he would listen to her, but then he\u2019d do exactly what he pleased. If she was going to get what she wanted, she\u2019d have to play by Cole\u2019s rules. It rankled, but she also found an odd sense of security in it. He wouldn\u2019t let her fall, not in bed. He would take care of her. Burke would, too. They talked a good game, but it was still possible they\u2019d walk away the instant Delgado no longer threatened her. But they would be utterly here with her now.</p><p>It was the only place she could trust them.</p><p>She let her hands drift up, threading her fingers together.</p><p>\u201cVery good, baby. Now spread your legs. We want to see our pussy again.\u201d</p><p>She wanted to argue about the \u201cour\u201d part, but it was true. In the year since they had left, she hadn\u2019t even thought about another man. She\u2019d met many attractive men, but not a one made her feel the way these two did. None had been as commanding as Cole or as smoothly seductive as Burke. Not one of those men had haunted her dreams or held a candle to their memories.</p><p>Her heart raced as she let her knees fall to the sides, and her legs opened to them, the cool air of the room sliding over her. She felt her nipples peak even tighter. Her skin came alive under their watchful gazes.</p><p>\u201cWider,\u201d Cole barked.</p><p>She stretched her legs out, putting her pussy on full display.</p><p>Burke breathed in, filling his lungs. \u201cShe smells delicious. Jesus...\u201d</p><p>His voice wobbled, and he licked his lips. Jessa\u2019s pussy pulsed at the thought of his talented tongue on her, lashing her with pleasure until she couldn\u2019t see straight. Burke could feast on her for what felt like forever.</p><p>\u201cNot yet, brother. She has to work her way up to that. That\u2019s too good a treat for a sub who\u2019s spent the last hour baiting her Masters.\u201d Cole held out his hand, and Burke placed something in it. It looked metallic and attached to a chain. \u201cShe manipulated us to get what she wanted without having to admit her desires, without having to promise or work anything out.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCole, don\u2019t push her,\u201d Burke practically begged.</p><p>\u201cOh, but she wants me to push her.\u201d Cole\u2019s smile turned slightly feral. \u201cTie her hands.\u201d</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat at his purred threat. God, she\u2019d missed this side of Cole. When he used that smile on her, she was never sure if he was genuinely amused or just getting ready to do something really nasty that would get his cock hard and drive her wild.</p><p>Burke reached into Cole\u2019s brown leather bag and came back out with a length of thin rope. As he wound it around her wrists, binding them together over her head, she felt something in her relax. She sighed, having missed the feeling of truly giving over to these men, of not being alone. Even if it was just for a little while, she needed this fantasy. She wanted to linger because all too soon they would likely be gone again.</p><p>While Burke bound her hands together, Cole stripped. Jessa watched as that enormous, hard body was revealed inch by inch. She remembered what it felt like to run her hands across his smooth skin, to feel each hard, bulging muscle and know it was hers. Cole\u2019s hands went to the fly of his jeans, and he efficiently did away with them, tossing them over the chair. His cock stood out from his body, thick and long. She couldn\u2019t help but stare at it.</p><p>And then she saw that she wasn\u2019t the only one who had obtained a few scars in their time apart.</p><p>A nasty circular scar puckered up from the skin of his abdomen, just over his hip bone.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d It looked angry, as though it wasn\u2019t finished doing its damage yet.</p><p>Cole touched it, his eyes going down as though he had to remind himself it was there. \u201cTook a round outside of Medellin. It was no big deal. It was a through and through. Burke just stitched me up until we could see a doctor.\u201d</p> <p>Burke hopped off the bed, seemingly happy with his knot now securing her. He pulled at his T-shirt, tossing it away. \u201cWe were lucky that time. We couldn\u2019t find a regular doctor for Cole, just a vet. There was my big, bad brother and twelve overindulged pussy cats.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not funny. He could have died.\u201d Jessa\u2019s voice shook.</p><p>Cole could have died. He could have lost his life, and no one would have told her. She would have gone on, never knowing that he was gone.</p><p>\u201cNo, Jessa. This wasn\u2019t fatal. Show her, Burke.\u201d</p><p>Burke sighed, dropped his pants, and turned around. Jessa gasped. He had scars across his lower back that hadn\u2019t been there before.</p><p>\u201cAs we were fleeing with Alea, one of the brothel owner\u2019s brothers caught up with us. Burke took three in the back before I took the fucker down. This isn\u2019t the first time someone\u2019s family has come after us.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI lost a good portion of my liver, but apparently it grows back. Lucky me.\u201d Burke turned back around. \u201cDo you know what got me through?\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. She didn\u2019t want to hear this. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me.\u201d</p><p>Burke sent her a triumphant smile. \u201cToo bad, because now that you\u2019re tied up, you\u2019re not going anywhere. As I lost consciousness, I thought about you. As I woke up, I thought about you. As I recovered, I thought about you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou did a lot of thinking, but not a lot of picking up the phone and calling.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s eyes rolled. \u201cClamp her. Maybe it will make her more pleasant.\u201d</p><p>Cole let the metal object in his hand drop, holding on to a thin, silver chain that connected them. \u201cThese are clover clamps. They\u2019re for your nipples. Burke, I need those nipples hard and ready.\u201d</p><p>Burke climbed on the bed and brushed his fingers over her nipples, softly at first, then gripped them hard between his thumbs and forefingers. He squeezed, making her whole body pulse with anticipation. \u201cLike this, brother?\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s eyes never left her breasts. \u201cPerfect.\u201d</p><p>He climbed on the bed, in between her legs, making the bed dip. Burke stayed at her side, holding her nipples for Cole.</p><p>\u201cI think you\u2019re going to like these, baby. I know I will. The clamps go on comfortably. They\u2019ll grip your nipples and make them exquisitely sensitive, but they get tighter with every yank of the chain.</p><p>Moisture flooded her folds. She could feel herself getting wet, growing restless. Burke leaned over, his mouth hovering over one breast. A low growl of appreciation came out of his throat just before he set his mouth over the already impossibly tight nipple, twisting the other with his fingers. The suction jolted straight to her pussy, lighting her up and making her writhe.</p><p>\u201cYeah, baby, every time you do that, these clamps will tighten.\u201d Cole moved in the instant Burke lifted his head. Cole eased the silver clamp on to her nipple, ruthlessly placing it at the base, the bud plumping and reddening.</p><p>Burke put his mouth against her ear. \u201cI know you feel that, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>His whisper ran like wildfire across her skin. She felt the pressure on her nipple, but that was just the start. As she wriggled and writhed, the pressure began to build all over, like a bottle of champagne just waiting to be uncorked. So long. She\u2019d needed this for so long. She needed this and so much more.</p><p>Burke leaned over her body, capturing the opposite nipple between his teeth and tugging, preparing it for the bite of the clamp. He pulled on the nub, abrading it with his teeth, prodding it with his tongue. With a little groan, Burke lifted his head. Cole slipped the clamp on. She whimpered, the pressure brushed the edge of pain, but she felt. She finally felt, and her men had given her this gift.</p><p>Cole sat back on his heels, his cock jutting out, but he seemed utterly in control. His dark brooding had transformed into sexual need. Jessa was shocked at just how much that excited her. She hadn\u2019t admitted how much seeing him shut down hurt her. Burke had been willing to fight, but she needed Cole, as well. And they seemed to need her, too.</p><p>\u201cI can see her arousal from here. She\u2019s ridiculously wet,\u201d Cole said, his voice a deep groan as he palmed his cock.</p><p>Burke let his hand slide down her body, causing her to quiver. His fingers slipped over her clitoris. \u201cOh, she\u2019s a dirty girl. She likes her nipples pinched, clamped, and tortured.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThose clamps look perfect on her, like jewels.\u201d Cole flicked at one.</p><p>Jessa shuddered, the sensation flaring. Her nipples were engorged with blood. Cole pulled lightly on the chain that draped across the valley of her breasts. Jessa moaned as the clamp bit into her flesh with ruthless pressure. She looked down and saw that her nipples were turning a deep red. The silver clamps were pretty against her flesh. She whimpered.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, baby,\u201d Cole said, nudging the chain again. \u201cThat sound goes straight to my cock.\u201d</p><p>\u201cMine, too,\u201d Burke chimed in, his fingers playing around her pussy. \u201cI think our little Jessa wants the merciless Doms to hurt her a bit, take what we want from her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd we will,\u201d Cole promised. \u201cBut not until I have what I want.\u201d</p><p>She didn\u2019t like the sound of that. \u201cI\u2019m not going to promise you anything, Cole. If this is some power play to get me to do anything but have a little fun, then you should let me out now.\u201d</p><p>His eyes darkened. \u201cI\u2019ll settle for you begging for some cock today, Jessa. But don\u2019t think for an instant that I won\u2019t get what I want. You and me and Burke forever. You can fool yourself, but I won\u2019t let you go. You had your chance.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI just want the sex, Cole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you\u2019ll beg for it.\u201d He held out a hand. \u201cI need the last clamp, Burke.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s head came up. \u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><p>Jessa felt her eyes go wide. She shivered. She was very aware of how vulnerable she was. They could do whatever they wanted. \u201cI don\u2019t have any more nipples, Cole.\u201d</p><p>Cole stared down at her pussy, his fingers taking the place of Burke\u2019s. She whimpered as he teased her. She gasped when he took her clit between his thumb and forefinger and squeezed. \u201cYou have this. This belongs to us, the same way those nipples do. We want to decorate our prize. Give me the clamp.\u201d</p><p>Burke passed the little silver bauble to his brother, and Cole settled on his belly between her legs. This clamp also had a chain that Burke clipped to the chain on her nipples.</p><p>Cole pulled the petals of her labia apart, exposing her clitoris. He pulled the hood back. Jessa felt all of the blood in her body rush to that one tiny spot. Cole took a deep breath.</p><p>\u201cYou smell so good to me.\u201d He leaned down and touched her clit with his tongue. The chain that tied the clamps together was still in his hand, and it jerked when she moved, the pressure tightening ruthlessly on her nipples. The pain bit into her, heightening the pleasure of his tongue.</p><p>She squirmed as he slid the clamp over her sensitized clit. She needed him\u2014touching her, inside of her. Both of them. This was what he\u2019d meant. He meant to make her beg, and she was already on the verge. Her clit was throbbing, and when he leaned back down and swiped at it with his tongue, Jessa nearly came off the bed. Burke held her down, his hands molding to her curves.</p><p>\u201cNo, you stay still. You let him make you come.\u201d</p><p>He would do it. Oh, this wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d planned. She wanted him inside her, but he was going to do it his way. He was going to utterly undo her\u2014on his terms.</p><p>Cole lashed at her clit, the pleasure stunning her into obedience. She wanted to tangle her hands in his hair. To force him to make her come. It was right there, just beyond her reach, but he kept his touch light and teasing, torturing her clit. She wanted to fight, to make him do what she needed, but he had her tied up and held down. She was spread for his pleasure, and all she could do was lay there, taking lash after lash of his tongue on her distended clit. Every press made her more sensitive. And the whole time Burke played with her nipples, making them flare with arousal, with need. She tried to wiggle away. It was overwhelming. Her heart felt like it would pound out of her chest. It was right there on the tip of her tongue to beg, exactly as he wanted.</p><p>Instead, she wiggled to make him stop. Cole slapped at her thigh and growled.</p><p>\u201cNo, fighting me. You can say your safe word or you can obey.\u201d His mouth came back. Little licks, long swipes all meant to keep her on the edge. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa settled back, Burke\u2019s arms a loving cage around her.</p><p>\u201cGive him what he wants, sweetheart. God, I\u2019m going to die if I can\u2019t fuck you soon. I want you so badly.\u201d</p><p>She was going to die soon, too.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cole. Please let me come.\u201d She couldn\u2019t hold out another second.</p><p>\u201cYour wish, baby,\u201d Cole muttered before he sucked her clit into his mouth.</p><p>She hurtled over the edge, panting as the orgasm overtook her. Every wiggle of her body tugged on the clamps biting her nipples and clit, sending aftershocks through her.</p><p>Burke held her, his body beside hers. She could feel the length of his erection against her hip. He moved restlessly against her, whispering in her ear. \u201cThat was fucking gorgeous. Do you know how long I\u2019ve waited to see that?\u201d</p><p>Yes, she knew. They had waited as long as she had. A year. Almost a solid year of longing and loneliness and anger, and now all she had to do was give over and she could pretend just for a little while that everything would be okay.</p><p>Cole looked up, leaving her pussy for a moment as she came down from the orgasm. She could see her arousal glistening on his lips. \u201cAgain.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo! Cole, please.\u201d She wasn\u2019t sure she could take another one. Her body was humming, but she felt stripped and bare down to her soul.</p><p>\u201cAgain, Jessa. I told you. Not until you beg for cock.\u201d His mouth closed over her pussy in an all-encompassing kiss, and Jessa surrendered. There was nothing else to do. Burke continued to tell her how much they loved her while Cole drove her to orgasm over and over again. Each time she thought she was sated, the need would build again until she was breathless and begging to come.</p><p>She knew what Cole wanted. He wanted her complete surrender. He wanted her to let go of the aches and hurts of the past year and embrace what they might have together. Tears poured from her eyes as she peaked again. She felt so connected to them now, it frightened her. Somehow these two men completed her, and in return she made them whole. Burke told her that, too. She was the piece that had always been missing.</p><p>She shuddered as she came down again. Connected. Beyond any orgasm, this connection was what she had missed. Her heart was taking over, unable to hide in the face of their onslaught. The orgasms were amazing, but empty because they weren\u2019t with her, inside her. She could refuse to beg all night, and they would still give her this pleasure, but it wasn\u2019t what she\u2019d really wanted when she\u2019d started this fight. She wanted her arms around them, her skin against theirs, their scents mingling. She wanted to merge with them. The orgasm was secondary to the feeling of being one with them.</p><p>\u201cPlease, Cole. Please.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s head came up. \u201cThat\u2019s not your safe word.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPlease. I\u2019m begging you and Burke to make love to me. No safe words. Untie me. I want my hands on you.\u201d It was as plainly as she could put it. She held in the words that she wouldn\u2019t say. I love you both. I love you so much.</p><p>Cole hesitated, then got to his knees. Burke got up as well, leaning over to pepper her face with kisses as he reached for her hands.</p><p>\u201cSweetheart, I love you. God, I missed you. You can\u2019t imagine how much I missed you.\u201d His hands worked to undo hers. She breathed a sigh of relief as they came apart and she was able to touch Burke. She sank her hands into his hair and pulled him down for a kiss. She was hungry again, this time to please them. Burke kissed her, not holding back anything. His tongue surged in, playing with hers, as she felt Cole\u2019s hands on her body. She gasped, nearly screaming into Burke\u2019s mouth as Cole unclamped her clit.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Burke petted her hair, keeping his arms around her, but giving Cole access to her breasts. \u201cWhen the blood rushes back in, there\u2019s a little bite of pain.\u201d</p><p>But Cole was already soothing it. He kissed her clit, his tongue swirling around gently, making the blood flow again. Burke kissed his way down her neck to her breasts where he did the same thing there, unclamping each nipple and lavishing it with affection. The pain caused her eyes to water, but their tender care did strange things to her heart.</p><p>Burke finally lifted his head and reached over to the nightstand and the leather bag where Cole kept his toys. He pulled out two condoms. He passed one to Cole before ripping his open. Jessa watched him stroke that big hard cock with his hand before rolling the condom over it. \u201cI want to get in your pussy, Jessa. Ride me.\u201d</p><p>He rolled with her on the big bed until she straddled him. She felt Cole\u2019s hands on her back, and her energy surged. Oh, yes, she wanted that. She wanted to feel the burn and know that she had both of them deep inside her body.</p><p>Burke gripped her hips and suddenly shoved up, his cock plundering her pussy in an instant. She was so soft from the orgasms they had forced on her that he managed to push his way inside with one long groan. Jessa let her head fall back. So full. She was so full, and it felt good. The orgasms had been sweet, but she\u2019d wanted this fullness.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, you feel so good. She\u2019s so tight, Cole. She\u2019s so perfect.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe\u2019s going to be so much tighter when I get in.\u201d Cole pulled her cheeks apart, and she felt the cool sensation of lube being dribbled on the rosette of her ass. \u201cGod, I love you, Jessa. I\u2019ve never loved anyone the way I love you. I will die one day, and the best thing I will have done was to love you.\u201d</p><p>She gritted her teeth as she felt him line the head of his cock up to her ass. She groaned as he started to press in. So fucking good. He felt so good. The burn began, but she welcomed it because it meant she had them both.</p><p>\u201cPush against me, baby. You\u2019re tight. So fucking tight. It\u2019s like you\u2019re a virgin again.\u201d Cole pulled at her hips, his voice rumbling.</p><p>She flattened her back, brushing her sensitive nipples against Burke\u2019s chest. Cole fucked her ass in short strokes, gaining ground with each pass. The burn made her hiss, but Burke\u2019s sweetness reminded her of all she had to gain. He kissed her, running his hands through her hair, tangling his tongue with hers.</p><p>Slowly, Cole worked his way in, inch by delicious inch.</p><p>\u201cGod, Cole. Give it to her. She\u2019s milking my cock. I won\u2019t last,\u201d Burke said on a moan.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll last as long as we need. We don\u2019t go until we can do it together,\u201d Cole said, still taking his time.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking bastard,\u201d Burke said.</p><p>Cole laughed. She felt that chuckle all along her spine. \u201cTakes one to know one, brother.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s face showed the strain of waiting for his brother, but Cole didn\u2019t let up. He continued his slow advance and retreat.</p><p>\u201cYou are so fucking hot, baby. Do you have any idea how much I love to fuck this pretty ass? This ass is ours. Take us, Jessa. Take all of us.\u201d</p><p>She pushed back, feeling Burke deep inside her the whole time she adjusted to take Cole. She shivered as his cock breeched her ass, slipping behind the tight ring of her muscles and lighting her up. All the sensitive nerves sang out after such a long time left untended.</p><p>\u201cBaby, you feel so good. I love you, Jessa. I won\u2019t let you go. I won\u2019t ever let you go. You might never believe me, but I\u2019ll never stop loving you. I\u2019ll never give up on us again.\u201d Cole pressed in until she could feel his balls tap just below the curve of her ass.</p><p>\u201cWe won\u2019t ever give up. We\u2019ve learned our lesson. Never again, Jess,\u201d Burke promised.</p><p>She wanted to believe them, but it didn\u2019t matter. All that mattered was that they were all together in this moment. It was something she could hold on to later when she was lonely. She could remember how it felt to be loved, even if only for a moment. She would take a moment or two with them over a lifetime with anyone else. She might never trust them again, but she would go to her grave remembering what it felt like to be between them, their words, hands, and bodies caressing her.</p><p>Cole pulled out, almost all the way. She wiggled against him, not wanting to lose his cock. Just as Cole pulled away, Burke pressed up, hitting her G-spot. Jessa hadn\u2019t thought she could come again, but the need rode her hard now. She pressed back, seesawing between them, unwilling to give up either cock. She rode them both, every nerve in her body attuned to them. Back and forth she let her body be pulled, manipulated, as they shared her like a sweet sex toy. Desired. Wanted. Beloved.</p><p>Cole\u2019s hand came between them and plucked at her clit, the sensitive nub flaring to life. She came, the orgasm crashing into her, making her scream out their names. Cole stiffened behind her, gripping her hips, and he pulsed in her ass as he came. Cole\u2019s orgasm seemed to trigger Burke\u2019s. He pressed up, calling her name as he pumped into her and emptied himself into the thin latex barrier.</p><p>Jessa fell onto Burke\u2019s chest, her breath sawing in and out of her body. Cole pulled at her as he rolled to the side, bringing her in the middle, pressed between them. She was warm and happy. Fear and anxiety had no place in their bed right now.</p><p>\u201cJessa,\u201d Burke whispered against her ear, the words tickling her skin. \u201cTalk to us. We still have hours. We want to talk to you, work this through. Tell us what happened while we were gone.\u201d</p><p>Why did he have to do that? She\u2019d given him her body, but he looked for more. He wanted to know her damn soul.</p><p>\u201cTalk to us,\u201d Cole cajoled, his hands caressing her. \u201cTell us, Jessa. Tell us about Caleb.\u201d</p><p>Her eyes watered. Caleb. Her only real and lasting connection to them. He reminded her so much of his dads. He might only have one as a biological father, but she saw them both in her boy. Caleb was a lovely combination of Burke\u2019s sunny charm and Cole\u2019s iron will. Her baby. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d</p><p>It was the one thing she couldn\u2019t refuse them. Caleb was the gift they\u2019d given her. Amid all the sadness, he had been her shining light. Even in her darkest hour, she\u2019d known that she wanted that little spark of life that had begun that winter night.</p><p>\u201cEverything,\u201d they said, their voices a stereo. They moved closer, invading every inch of her space. She knew she should protest, but their bodies warmed hers.</p><p>She choked back tears. She\u2019d started this because she\u2019d wanted a last moment with them. She\u2019d wanted closure. But she\u2019d made a deadly mistake. There was no closure. There could never be closure between them. What they had would never be over. She saw that now. She could walk away. She could allow the pain she\u2019d felt to break them apart forever, but she wouldn\u2019t be complete. She would walk through life a ghost, remembering a time when she was whole. She belonged to them, and she always had. Even before she\u2019d met them, she\u2019d been theirs, a girl waiting for these two men, these halves of a whole, to walk into her life and complete her.</p><p>She took a deep breath and began to speak, telling her son\u2019s fathers everything they wanted to know, both loving and fearing the peace settling into her heart.</p><p>CHAPTER NINE</p><p>Burke glanced over his shoulder at the clock, trying not to move the rest of his body. He didn\u2019t want to wake Jessa. The last thing he wanted to do was pull her from her safety and security, back out into this world they had dragged her into. She stirred beside him, but didn\u2019t wake, merely cuddled closer to Cole, who wrapped his arms around her.</p><p>The last two hours played back through his brain. He would go to his grave with the feeling of Jessa\u2019s pussy clamping around his cock, milking him, taking everything he had. It had been so much more than sex. It had been a merging of who he was with her. Love for her lodged in his chest. He was a better human being for loving her. He reached out and touched her hair. So soft. Like the woman.</p><p>With a sigh of regret, he sat up. If he had his way, he would never leave this damn bed. He would stay with her, only allowing her out to shower and eat. She would need her strength because he and Cole had a whole year of sex to make up for.</p><p>Nearly five o\u2019clock. They would have to leave soon. Burke preferred to travel deep in the night if he had to go by car. There were fewer people on the road late at night. It was far easier to tell if someone was following them. Once they got out of Dallas and into East Texas, the crowds would thin to nothing. He would be able to keep watch on anyone trying to sneak up on them.</p><p>Cole stared at him over Jessa\u2019s shoulder. His eyes widened, one brow rising up.</p><p>Burke knew what he was saying. They had discussed earlier that one of them needed to call Dex before they headed out for Louisiana. The James brothers had promised to spend the day working on the case, calling the DA and trying to find anyone in the FBI they could trust. If they\u2019d gotten a reprieve from having to hole up in a swamp, Burke wanted to know.</p><p>Burke sighed. Why the hell did he have to get out of the warm comfy bed and make the call?</p><p>Cole smiled smugly and tightened his arms around her. Because I have the prize, brother.</p><p>Fucking bastard, Burke shot back, sending Cole a look he couldn\u2019t possibly mistake.</p><p>Cole simply grinned.</p><p>His brother was a bastard. It was only by chance that Jessa was in Cole\u2019s arms. They had passed her back and forth between them for hours, but Cole always seemed to have the best sense of timing. Burke sighed and rolled out of bed, grabbing his pants. Cold. It was fucking cold. He hoped it wasn\u2019t this cold in the swamp. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cNext time I get to hold her, asshole.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a next time,\u201d Jessa said, but even as the words breathed from her mouth, she settled her head on Cole\u2019s chest and nuzzled him. \u201cThis was a one-time weakness on my part. Don\u2019t expect it again.\u201d</p><p>Burke froze. After all the intimacies and genuine need they\u2019d shared tonight, she was pulling away again?</p><p>Cole huffed, gritting his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d</p> <p>A deeply satisfied smile crossed her face. \u201cYes, we will.\u201d</p><p>Jessa didn\u2019t stand a chance. Cole had thrown down the gauntlet. She could play stubborn all she liked, but they wouldn\u2019t let her go. If they had to sleep on her doorstep, they would. But eventually, they would break down her resistance, and they would win. She\u2019d shown them exactly how to win her back. Jessa craved their touch, but she couldn\u2019t submit just her body. When she gave her body to them, she also gave her heart and her soul. And when they dominated her sexually, she flowered open like a plant reaching for the sunlight. She unfurled, took from them, then gave everything back.</p><p>Burke intended to treat her like the precious gift she was. She was the only woman in the world for them, and he and Cole would prove that they were worthy of her. That they wouldn\u2019t let her down again. They couldn\u2019t.</p><p>Cursing the cold, he padded across the carpeted floor to the small desk where his laptop had been downloading files from the hard drives Dex had brought them.</p><p>He grabbed his phone and laptop, then retreated to the bathroom so Jessa and Cole would have a little peace and quiet while he made the call. They had made a tactical error with Jessa several months before in allowing their shock and misery at the news of her marriage to overcome their good sense. They should have left Colombia immediately, handed Alea over to Rafe and Kade, and flown straight to New York. It was what they\u2019d intended to do. The mission had taken far longer than expected. They\u2019d gone to the office, meaning to have Hilary book tickets to New York, but she\u2019d greeted them with that damn report. Jessa Wade had married. Jessa was happy with her new husband. She had moved from her aunt\u2019s hotel in New York to a fabulous property in Virginia. She had moved on without them.</p> <p>He and Cole should have camped on her doorstep and demanded an explanation. They should have trusted that she\u2019d keep her promise to wait. They should have been willing to fight.</p><p>Too many people in his life had left him, whether through disinterest, discontent, or death. He\u2019d learned to let go, but he hadn\u2019t been able to let go of Jessa emotionally. Even after they had agreed to give Jessa the space to be happy with her husband, Burke had carried her in his heart.</p><p>It had known better than his brain. Never again would he let her go.</p><p>He winced as he tried to spread his equipment across the miniscule counter. God, he hoped the place they holed up in next had more space. Besides being tiny, the bathroom was cold.</p><p>He dialed Dex\u2019s number as he pulled up the files he sought. He wanted to do a bit more digging before they spent hours on the road. Once they got to Louisiana, he would have plenty of time to comb over everything, but he wanted to see the original reports from the PI, see if he could make heads or tails of how long it had taken Marco Delgado to corrupt their investigator.</p><p>\u201cThis is Dex James.\u201d Dex\u2019s voice was cautious, as though he didn\u2019t want to give anything away.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s Burke.\u201d</p><p>There was a long breath from the other end of the line. \u201cThank god. We\u2019ve been worried. We expected you to call hours ago.\u201d</p><p>Hours ago he\u2019d been buried deep inside Jessa. He didn\u2019t feel bad about that in the least. \u201cSomething came up. We\u2019re all still fine. We\u2019re heading out in an hour or so. How\u2019s my boy doing?\u201d</p><p>It felt good to ask about Caleb. His son. When this was over, he would never be apart from his son again. He would make up for all the lost time. He would convince Jessa to have another baby. A brother or sister for Caleb.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s good, Burke. He\u2019s a great kid. I can tell he\u2019s missing his momma, but he\u2019s enjoying playing with our kiddos. Hannah\u2019s feeding him dinner right now.\u201d</p><p>He remembered what Jessa had said earlier. Though he felt like an idiot, he asked the question. \u201cUhm, how\u2019s his poop?\u201d</p><p>Dex\u2019s laugh made Burke pull the phone from his ear. \u201cHis bowels are fine, man. You tell Jessa that he\u2019s still on schedule. And get used to it. You\u2019re going to hear yourself saying things you\u2019ve never before imagined would come out of your mouth. Your kids become your life. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m a dad, too. I can tell you, though, that one of the joys in my life has been sharing this family with my brothers. Spread the pain, man. I don\u2019t know how couples do it. Kids are like little monkeys. They\u2019re everywhere and into everything. I swear, one of us has to save Eli at least twice a day, and I\u2019m sure the same will be true of his sister when she starts walking.\u201d</p><p>Burke knew he should be horrified, but all he could think about was how much he wanted to be there for Caleb and any other children he, Cole, and Jessa had in the future.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us here,\u201d Dex continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve hired extra security for the place. Round the clock. These guys are solid, man. There is no way Marco could get to them. I trust them with my family.\u201d</p><p>Burke breathed a sigh of relief. Marco had already proven he could get inside law enforcement. He\u2019d even managed to pay off their private investigator. Burke was sure Marco knew about their ties to the James family. He had to trust Dex. The man and his brothers were putting their own kids in the line of fire to help Burke and Cole.</p><p>\u201cHas anyone talked to the DA?\u201d Burke asked. He didn\u2019t hold out much hope, but if the DA had anything on the younger Delgado, it might slow the fucker down.</p><p>\u201cSlade has been on the phone with him for hours. God, Burke, next time this shit happens can you keep it in Texas? We would have this shut down here. We don\u2019t have the same pull in New York. Anyway, they\u2019re willing to offer you witness protection.\u201d</p><p>Fuck, no. \u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let you go,\u201d Dex admitted. \u201cWe know Marco Delgado has feds on the payroll. The DA seems solid, but I\u2019m not going to turn you over to him. Even he didn\u2019t recommend going into witness protection. Off the record, of course. He\u2019s lost a witness in the last six months. She was connected to one of Delgado\u2019s distributors. Look, I think he\u2019s on the up and up, but he\u2019s only one man. The cops are going through what\u2019s left of Jessa\u2019s house. It\u2019s a mess. It\u2019s going to take time.\u201d</p><p>That was what Marco was counting on. \u201cDid they identify the body?\u201d</p><p>Maybe the identity of the man Marco had sent to set those bombs would help.</p><p>\u201cNot so easy in the charred remains. We\u2019re going to need dental records. He couldn\u2019t have been a higher-up in the organization. I don\u2019t think Marco intended for him to get out of that house alive. He knew when your plane was coming in. He had to. He was waiting there. The cops found what appears to be the trigger device about a quarter of a mile from Jessa\u2019s house. We think he was watching from the woods. With binoculars, he would have been able to see you coming.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah, we got that when he managed to call us just as we were fleeing the scene.\u201d Burke tried to juggle the phone and his laptop. \u201cDid you manage to copy those files before you brought them to me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes. That secretary of yours is a pit bull, by the way.\u201d</p><p>Hilary? She\u2019d always been polite and spoken in soft Southern tones to him. She and Cole, had never gotten along, but he could be an ass, too. \u201cSorry if she gave you hell. I didn\u2019t think to call her first.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe was pissed off. And damn but she thinks you walk on water. The whole time I was packing up hard drives, she was telling me how you would beat the crap out of me when you found out how I had treated her. You got something going with her?\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, no.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t touch her with a twelve-foot pole and a Hazmat suit. She was deeply competent, but the blonde did nothing for him physically. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought of her as anything but an office manager. Look, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with her, but she\u2019s just the woman who does my paperwork and books.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think she sees it that way.\u201d</p><p>With a grimace, Burke grabbed the CD he\u2019d made earlier of files from Hilary\u2019s computer so he could transfer them to his and compare. He needed to keep searching, see what other weaknesses in their security he and Cole might have that Marco could exploit. He popped open the drive. \u201cSeriously, man. She handles my travel and\u2014\u201d</p><p>Fuck. Lying there, small, black, deadly was a little tracking device. He knew what it was the instant he saw it. \u201cGoddamn it.\u201d</p><p>\u201cShe knew when your plane was coming in, didn\u2019t she?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he said, his mind racing. \u201cWe booked the flight from Medellin to Mexico City on our own, but she worked a miracle to get us on the flight to Dulles. It was full. I\u2019m now wondering if Delgado helped her manage that.\u201d Maybe the PI hadn\u2019t been the only one on Marco\u2019s payroll.</p><p>Dex was quiet for a moment. \u201cShe was particularly upset that I took her hard drive, but by then she knew I wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t insert a tracking device in my computer\u2019s DVD drive, did you?\u201d Burke doubted it, but just in case...</p><p>\u201cNo. Why would I?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought. Hang on.\u201d</p><p>He cursed as he raced to retrieve her computer. Quickly, he booted it up and retrieved her e-mails. She was meticulous. She kept everything. Every freaking e-mail. There were thousands. He typed the private investigator\u2019s name into the search function and finally had what he wanted. The original reports from the PI.</p><p>He cursed. \u201cFuck me, Dex. Hilary is our Judas. I gotta talk to my brother.\u201d</p><p>They were in way deeper shit than even he\u2019d imagined.</p><p>Cole sighed. He didn\u2019t want to get up, but the sun was just about to slip under the horizon for the day. Time to leave soon. Jessa lay on his chest, her soft breaths making a rhythm he found soothing. She was here in his arms. It was a fucking miracle.</p><p>\u201cBaby,\u201d he whispered, his hands tracing her curves. Her skin was so damn soft. \u201cWe have to get ready to go. We have a long drive ahead of us.\u201d</p><p>She groaned, sounding drowsy and sleep-soft. \u201cDon\u2019t want to. Cold outside.\u201d</p><p>He chuckled. She was so much easier to deal with after ten or so orgasms. He made a mental note. When Jessa got difficult, he would simply tie her down and make her come until she purred like a kitten and wrapped herself around him.</p><p>\u201cI would do just about anything if we could stay right here.\u201d He meant it. He\u2019d give anything for the danger to be over, for his worst problem to be figuring out how to change Caleb\u2019s diapers. He knew their son liked rice cereal, and that Jessa had just started him on mashed banana. She\u2019d also told him that he liked to get both everywhere. The thought of their son made his heart twist.</p><p>Caleb was the expression of their love for Jessa. Cole wouldn\u2019t take him back for anything. He would endure every minute of pain and isolation again for a single shot at knowing his boy and loving Jessa.</p><p>Jessa sat up in bed, the sheet coming down, and her breasts were on display for a moment. His cock hardened again. He wouldn\u2019t ever stop wanting her. All she had to do was be in the same room and he was hard and ready to mount her. His mate.</p><p>She rubbed at her eyes, then finally seemed to realize that she was naked. She pulled the sheet up. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d</p><p>She wanted to play modest now? Ain\u2019t happening. \u201cYeah, I mind that you covered them.\u201d</p><p>She shot him a look that was probably designed to kill, but he didn\u2019t let it affect him. \u201cCole, I\u2019d like to get dressed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you should, I suppose. Baby, I\u2019m not leaving the room. Nor will I turn away and pretend I didn\u2019t spend the last several hours with my cock inside your pretty ass.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGod, that was rude!\u201d</p><p>He smiled, the very act lifting his spirits. \u201cNo, it was amazing. You have got the tightest little backside I\u2019ve ever fucked.\u201d</p><p>Cool green eyes rolled. \u201cNot exactly a compliment, Cole.\u201d</p><p>He shrugged. He\u2019d thought it was. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t going to put it on a bumper sticker or anything. Unless you want. Or a T-shirt. That might be nice.\u201d</p><p>Jessa shook her head, and her laughter was beautiful to Cole\u2019s ears. She hadn\u2019t laughed once since they\u2019d pulled her from her big Victorian house. He could certainly see why she hadn\u2019t, but he wanted her to laugh now. He wanted to fill her life with it.</p><p>She turned, her hair covering half her face, making her look like a siren. \u201cBurke would tell me how beautiful my eyes are. But not Cole. No. You discuss the elasticity of my anus. What the hell am I going to do with you?\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cLove me.\u201d The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them.</p><p>Jessa stopped, her laughter silenced, but Cole wouldn\u2019t take the words back. He was done being scared, being weak. How could he get what he wanted if he didn\u2019t ask for it? Maybe he wasn\u2019t good enough for her, but he could be. Loving Jessa had changed him already. He was better, and he would be the man she needed. If she didn\u2019t love him anymore, he\u2019d work day and night until she fell for him again. He wasn\u2019t going to let his fucking uncle win for the rest of his life. He wasn\u2019t going to be the same sort of miserable prick Martin had been.</p><p>She sniffled and got out of bed. \u201cCole, I don\u2019t know if I can do that. I think the wounds run too deep.\u201d She reached for her bag and pulled on her underwear. \u201cI\u2019m not the same girl I was when you met me.\u201d</p><p>No. She was even more beautiful. Being a mother had made her stronger. \u201cI\u2019m not the same man.\u201d</p> <p>She worked the hooks on her bra and started to put on the jeans Hannah had given her. \u201cI think you are, Cole. I don\u2019t think a man like you changes. You need adventure. I can\u2019t give you that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou think I like getting shot at? Let me tell you something, baby. It sucks. It hurts, and I\u2019m getting way too old for it. I would rather hang up my guns and spend the majority of my time playing Mr. Mom while you paint. But Jessa, there is one thing on this earth I am good at, and that\u2019s tracking down people. Burke and I are the best. We\u2019ve used our expertise to track criminals and terrorists, but we found a calling in finding missing persons. I don\u2019t know if I can give that up, but I can promise that we\u2019ll stay in the States, and we\u2019ll always come home to you.\u201d</p><p>She smoothed the sweater down, her eyes still wary. \u201cI don\u2019t...\u201d</p><p>The door to the bathroom banged open. Burke rushed through, laptop in hand. He put it down on the desk and started shutting everything down. \u201cCole, get dressed. We have to get out of here. Hilary is in on this. She\u2019s in on everything. And she put a tracking device in my laptop.\u201d</p><p>Cole absorbed the information. It computed instantly. Fuck. Why hadn\u2019t he considered that Hilary was their leak? She was a cold bitch. He hadn\u2019t pegged her as the type to sell her beloved Burke out for money, but apparently he\u2019d been wrong.</p> <p>Jumping out of bed, Cole crammed his legs in his jeans, listening as Burke talked.</p><p>\u201cThe PI was on the up and up. I found his initial reports. There\u2019s nothing about her marriage. He simply states she came back from Scotland and adopted a cat named Angus. He gives updates on the progress of her pregnancy. He did a good job. And Hilary hid it all.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBitch. You know I never liked her.\u201d Cole had always felt her disdain for him.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s obvious from that one phone call I overheard that she wants Burke,\u201d Jessa said, rushing to get her meager belongings together. \u201cSo she made sure I was no longer \u2018available.\u2019 I\u2019m sure when Delgado made his offer, she didn\u2019t hesitate. She wants Burke alive and me dead.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFucking bitch. I will deal with her,\u201d Burke promised, his face flushing a violent red.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll deal with her,\u201d Cole replied, pulling his shirt on. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019re leaving. We have to dump the equipment. If she put a tracking device in your computer, she may have put one in something else we\u2019re carrying. And it\u2019s almost six o\u2019clock. Our time is nearly up. We leave now with nothing but the clothes on our backs and the cash. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p> <p>He had to get Jessa out of here.</p><p>His hand was on the door when it blasted open. The door exploded inward, hitting him directly in the head, sending him reeling.</p><p>Then chaos ruled. The moment the door fell away to reveal a gaping hole to the winter, something flew in. Cole caught sight of it. A cylindrical black object. Fuck. Flashbang. Cole leapt for Jessa, trying to cover her with his body, but he couldn\u2019t quite reach her. She stood by the bed, her eyes wide with terror.</p><p>The stun grenade went off, deafening him. The sound shook the room, and his eyes shut to try to keep out the blinding flash of light. Heat and sound and fury all in one little package. Jessa screamed. He felt his brother beside him. Both tried to protect Jessa.</p><p>\u201cOh, Mr. Lennox, I don\u2019t think you need that gun.\u201d A smooth voice could barely be heard over the ringing in his ears. \u201cGentleman, take those two down.\u201d</p><p>Cole turned to the sound, trying to focus long enough to get off a shot. And then he lost all control as twin darts bit into his skin, sinking into his flesh and sending fifty thousand volts through his system.</p><p>Fucking Taser. Every muscle in Cole\u2019s body jerked and spasmed in a chorus of agony. He couldn\u2019t move. He couldn\u2019t scream. He couldn\u2019t do anything. He registered that his brother was beside him, body also jerking. In this, as in all things, they shared the pain.</p><p>The horrible cracking sound cut off, but Cole knew it wasn\u2019t over. Even his body couldn\u2019t take a military grade Taser and leap back into the fray. He tried to make his arms move. Nothing. Fucking nothing.</p> <p>\u201cGentleman, this was far too easy.\u201d Marco Delgado came into view. He was dressed in an urbane suit, his hair perfectly cut, wearing a wicked little smile on his face. \u201cI expected more. I suppose this means I win. I doubt you\u2019ll let it pass, but I want to remind you that I kept my word about the boy. I\u2019m not a monster. Just a son looking for revenge. And now I have it.\u201d</p><p>He flicked a hand, and one of his goons walked forward, carrying Jessa\u2019s body. Fuck. She wasn\u2019t moving. His heart seized up. No! If she was dead, he wouldn\u2019t be far behind. Jessa. God, what had he done?</p><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s the panic I wanted to see. I knew I was right about her when I bribed your secretary to send me the private investigator\u2019s files. I saw the adoration on your faces that day at the Waldorf. I knew for certain she was the proper instrument for my vengeance when I realized you were paying a fortune to keep tabs on her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLeeetttt heeerrr goooooo,\u201d Burke groaned, his arms jerking as though he wanted to get his hands around the man\u2019s throat.</p><p>Delgado scoffed. \u201cNo. And to answer the question in your brother\u2019s eyes, no, she\u2019s not dead.\u201d Delgado put a hand on her back, sliding it down her curves. \u201cShe\u2019s taking a little nap. In fact, I\u2019m not going to kill her right away. That would be far too easy for all of you. You cost my father his life and the consortium I inherited, along with its good name in the business. I intend to get it all back, and your lovely lady will help me. Redheads are so hard to find, and they do so well in the more exotic places of the world. I\u2019ll sell her. Imagine that as you search for her. Imagine all the men who will enjoy her body and her pain against her will. I know I intend to. Good night, gentlemen. I expect the next phase of our game will be challenging for you.\u201d</p><p>And then it began again. Just as he managed to move his fingers with the slightest bit of purpose, the two men who stood over he and Burke, flicked the switch again. Fire lit through his system and he jerked. Angry tears he couldn\u2019t stop blurred his eyes. His head jerked, striking the floor over and over.</p><p>Finally, darkness took him.</p><p>CHAPTER TEN</p><p>Burke came to in little stages. Flashes of reality. Flashes of horror. He blinked his eyes open, then slammed them shut when the lights were much too bright. Every muscle ached. Tired. He was so damn tired, as though he\u2019d run a marathon. His muscles protested at any hint of use. His eyes drifted shut, and he wanted to let sleep take him, but something wicked played at the edge of his consciousness.</p><p>Jessa.</p><p>The events of the evening slammed back into his head with horrible clarity. Burke forced his eyes open. How long had she been gone? The tiny motel room shook. Thunder. A storm. God, Jessa was out in that storm, and he had no idea where, with a vengeful bastard determined to use and kill her. And where was his brother?</p><p>\u201cCole?\u201d</p><p>\u201cFuck. I hate Tasers.\u201d Cole sat up, patting his chest. Tiny blood spots dotted his T-shirt where the darts had bitten into his flesh. Burke looked down and could see his own.</p><p>He struggled to his feet, his muscles shaking. \u201cWe have to go. We have to find her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cFigure out where she is, yeah. What time is it? How long were we out?\u201d Cole flexed his hand and stretched. His skin looked ashen, his eyes red rimmed.</p><p>\u201cAbout twenty minutes.\u201d Long enough for Jessa to vanish. Long enough for her to be lost forever.</p><p>\u201cWe have to alert the police, have the airports shut down,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the phone? Fuck. They took the phones.\u201d He looked around the room. \u201cThey even took the goddamn landline. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.\u201d</p><p>Burke took a deep breath, forcing the air into his lungs. \u201cWe have to stay calm and find a phone, call Dex.\u201d He darted for the door. There would be a phone in the lobby unless Delgado had murdered everyone in the motel and taken all their phones. Burke turned back to his brother. \u201cLook around. See if they forgot anything.\u201d</p><p>He threw open the door and stopped in his tracks. A woman stood outside their room, the rain beating on her. She was turned away from him, her blonde hair wet and mangled against the back of her dark coat. Despite the darkness, he knew who stood there, and he was shocked that the bitch had the gall to ever stand in his presence again.</p><p>\u201cHilary.\u201d</p><p>Cole stomped to his side in an instant. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d</p><p>She turned slowly, as though forcing herself to make the movement. Mascara streaked down her face. Her blue eyes blinked in a vacant shock. Burke had never seen Hilary when she was anything less than perfect. Flawless makeup and hair. Designer clothes in the most flattering styles. Now Hilary was a wreck. She stood there, whole body shaking, and he knew she\u2019d been through something terrible.</p><p>He didn\u2019t give a shit.</p><p>\u201cBurke.\u201d His name fell from her trembling lips. She reached an entreating hand toward him. \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re okay.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs she fucking serious?\u201d Cole growled low, his jaw tight as he grabbed her arm and jerked her inside, making Hilary cry out.</p><p>\u201cYep, and she\u2019s got balls of steel,\u201d Burke replied under his breath as he slammed the door shut. They needed answers from her. She was definitely the reason he and Cole had been parted from Jessa for the past year. She had to be in league with Delgado, but for some crazy reason she\u2019d come here. Now, they had to use that to their advantage, get whatever information they could out of her that would help them locate Jessa. Scratch that; he had to. Cole would only try to intimidate and bully her. Burke knew how to handle Hilary, and she had a crush on him that he\u2019d use to their advantage.</p><p>\u201cLet me go, you animal. You\u2019re just like the men you chase down.\u201d Hilary fought Cole\u2019s hold, her legs kicking.</p><p>God, he was going to have to play this right. He didn\u2019t have time to torture her, though it would have pleased him greatly. But Jessa\u2019s life was on the line, so he had to work fast to gain Hilary\u2019s cooperation. Cole had to stand down.</p><p>Burke steeled himself for what he had to do, then turned a scolding look to his brother. \u201cCole, leave her alone. You\u2019re hurting her.\u201d</p><p>Cole turned, his eyes widening. His expression clearly asked what the fuck is wrong with you?</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t treat her that way. Let her go right now.\u201d He sent his brother a ferocious look.</p><p>Cole dropped Hilary like a poisonous snake. She wasn\u2019t ready for it and crumbled to the floor in a heap.</p><p>Go with me. He mouthed the words.</p><p>Cole\u2019s face fell. He gave a long-suffering sigh, clearly understanding. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go to the lobby. Take care of your fucking girlfriend quickly, Burke. Why is she even here? We don\u2019t have time to deal with her...issues.\u201d</p><p>Hilary looked up, her face sheet white. \u201cI knew Burke was in trouble. I put a tracking device in the drive when that awful Dex James walked in and started demanding things. He was not a gentleman. Burke, I was so worried about you. I did it so I could find you.\u201d</p><p>Was there any chance she\u2019d just been concerned about him and hadn\u2019t actually been working with Delgado? Burke mentally raced through the facts. No. She might have doctored those reports initially to keep them from Jessa, but she\u2019d used the information to completely eliminate the competition. After all, if she could get Delgado to do her dirty work for her...why not? He\u2019d wondered where she\u2019d suddenly gotten the money for a new Lexus. There was no way Delgado could have found them tonight without Hilary\u2019s help. Burke forced himself to remain calm. It was all he could do not to tear her apart. Had she felt even a moment\u2019s compunction about helping her employers\u2019 enemy and contributing to the potential death of an innocent woman?</p><p>Why the fuck hadn\u2019t he nipped this worship in the bud earlier? Him not wanting to hurt her feelings unnecessarily and make waves in an otherwise smooth-running office may cost Jessa her life.</p><p>Cole gritted this teeth. \u201cBe quick, Burke. We have to find my woman.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>He\u2019d put the emphasis on \u201cmy.\u201d Yes. His brother knew what he was going to have to do. Cole shot him a glance tinged with regret and apology before striding out into the storm, slamming the door in his wake.</p><p>Burke\u2019s stomach turned, but he forced himself to put his hands on her shoulders and help her to her feet. \u201cHilary? Are you all right?\u201d</p><p>She raised her face to his, and her lips curled up slowly in a tremulous smile. \u201cBetter now that your brother is gone. He isn\u2019t kind and gentlemanly like you, Burke. You\u2019re...wonderful.\u201d</p><p>Yeah? When Burke had what he needed out of Hilary, he intended to prove to her once and for all that he wasn\u2019t a kind gentleman, either. He had to force back the urge to wrap his hands around her throat and squeeze until her eyes bulged for mercy\u2014then keep squeezing. She\u2019d kept him from his child, from the woman who should be his wife, all because Hilary, the fucking bitch, had some fantasy about him. He and Cole would have dropped everything the moment they knew Jessa was pregnant. Hilary was the reason they hadn\u2019t been there for Caleb\u2019s birth. She was the reason they hadn\u2019t held Jessa\u2019s hand and put together Caleb\u2019s crib and waited with blessed anticipation. She\u2019d stolen a critical year from them.</p> <p>And now he had to convince this bitch that he cared about her. Fuck.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d he soothed. \u201cI won\u2019t let Cole hurt you. Hilary, what\u2019s going on? You shouldn\u2019t be here. It\u2019s dangerous. You should be safe in a hotel suite.\u201d</p><p>He wasn\u2019t going to admit he knew anything. He had to draw out her admission to get any information that might help Jessa. He had to let Hilary hang herself.</p><p>She sniffled, then stumbled into him, her wet chest plastered all over his. It seemed like a calculated move to force him to hold her. With deep disgust, he wrapped his arms around her. She was soaking wet, cold rain clinging to her. He was only conscious of his revulsion and the time ticking away.</p><p>\u201cOh, Burke, some men broke into the office earlier today and tried to kill me.\u201d</p> <p>Yeah, Delgado would want to tie up all the loose ends. \u201cHilary. I never meant to get you involved in this. How did you get away?\u201d</p><p>Tears pooled in her eyes again. \u201cDo you remember the woman who works in the accounting firm next door, the one who does our taxes? She was in the office so we could have a meeting. I had gotten up to get some coffee, and they just came in and...shot her. They killed her and thought she was me. She was sitting behind my desk. I don\u2019t know why she would do that. I think she was trying to get into some files she shouldn\u2019t have been looking at. You can\u2019t trust anyone these days.\u201d</p><p>A chill went through Burke. Hilary was playing the damsel in distress in fine fashion, and he wondered if she saw the irony in her statement at all.</p><p>The office had cameras. Hilary always had the security feed up and running on her monitor. But since Dex had taken all her computer equipment except that monitor, the only thing she\u2019d have to do was watch that security feed. Hilary had to have seen the men coming in. What a stroke of luck that blonde, sweet Mary, the accountant from next door, just happened to be sitting there when Hilary left the room. Or had it been luck at all? Most likely, she\u2019d set Mary up to take the fall. It was all Burke could do not to recoil back from the bitch. Hilary was willing to do anything to scheme her way into his love. Now Burke was going to use her desire against her.</p><p>\u201cHow terrible. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d He almost choked on the words. \u201cI\u2019ll get you someplace safe. Then I have to help Cole go after Jessa.\u201d</p><p>Hilary\u2019s eyes flared at the mention of Jessa\u2019s name. \u201cI-is she your girlfriend?\u201d</p> <p>Burke hoped he looked brutally confused. \u201cNo, she\u2019s Cole\u2019s girlfriend. And she had his baby. We just found out yesterday. That private investigator we hired was apparently on Delgado\u2019s payroll. Hilary, Cole has a son. I can\u2019t let my nephew\u2019s mother die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut I thought...\u201d She flushed. \u201cI heard a rumor that you and Cole...shared women.\u201d There was no mistaking the disgust in her eyes.</p><p>A little truth would help his lie. \u201cWe have in the past. But, Hilary, we never expected to live that way for the rest of our lives. I want a normal life with a nice, sweet wife who can stand beside me and be an asset to my business. Jessa is an artist, very Bohemian. She\u2019s nothing like what I imagine my wife would be. I want someone more...traditional.\u201d</p><p>Certainly, Hilary would see herself in that picture.</p><p>But Burke wanted Jessa desperately. He wanted to sit and watch her work. She was so talented. He loved her open mind and her generous heart. Hilary, with her perfect manners, wouldn\u2019t know generosity if it bit her in the ass. Still, he could see that his ploy was working.</p><p>Hilary shook her wet, blonde head. \u201cIf she\u2019s Cole\u2019s, then let him handle it. He\u2019s capable. I\u2019m just so worried about you. I don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\u201d</p><p>Burke pulled away, letting a tiny bit of his disdain show. \u201cCole is my brother. Where I come from, family doesn\u2019t let family down. I thought you felt the same way. I guess I was wrong.\u201d</p><p>She grasped his hand, her fingers like claws around him. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong, Burke. Family is important. Even when they\u2019re not what we could have hoped for. Of course. You should call the police.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t, darling.\u201d He shook his head, watching her eyes light up at the endearment. She was on the hook and buying into his act. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I should be more professional.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Her eyes practically begged him. \u201cThe feelings between us are more than professional. I think we both know it.\u201d</p><p>Clearly, she\u2019d deluded herself into thinking he gave a shit. How? He\u2019d barely spoke to her past giving her orders and asking for updates. He\u2019d never done more than shaken her hand before tonight. But she\u2019d invented a whole bunch of crap about them in her head and convinced herself it was true. He could seal the deal by flirting. It was definitely in his skill set.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, darling. We should stop pretending. The whole idea of you being shot at...god, I can\u2019t imagine it. But, my worries must wait, Hilary. I can\u2019t let my brother down. We\u2019re going after this terrible man who tried to kill you. I won\u2019t stop until we find him. Then I\u2019ll come back to you and...\u201d Burke forced a smile and a sigh, his hand to caress her waist. Bile rose in his throat.</p><p>\u201cI heard them,\u201d she blurted.</p><p>Now that she thought he was on her side, she was going to talk. He forced patience. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen the two gunmen came, I hid. I didn\u2019t know what else to do. One shot Mary, then they talked. The other made a phone call from the office phone. I overheard the conversation. They called some private airfield. They talked about getting everything ready for a flight. I\u2019m sure the number is still on our phone. We could go back to the office and get the number, then Cole can go after her.\u201d</p><p>Delgado was taking Jessa to a private airfield. Of course. It had to be private. He couldn\u2019t exactly haul a drugged woman through security at DFW. A private airfield would allow him to simply drive into the hangar he\u2019d rented and load the plane, far from prying eyes.</p><p>The door opened, and Cole walked in. Burke pushed Hilary away. He\u2019d gotten everything he needed, and he\u2019d fucking cut his hands off before he\u2019d ever touched her again.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s taken her to a private airfield,\u201d Burke said. \u201cHow fast do you think Dex or Slade can get to our office and check the outgoing calls? Idiots called from there to make the last of their plans. They probably didn\u2019t think about leaving behind evidence.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr they were taunting us with the information, thinking that by the time we figured it out, they\u2019d be long gone. We need that number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIs that all the information she had?\u201d Cole asked, his cold eyes raking her.</p><p>He grimaced. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019m willing to touch her to get.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Hilary eased closer to Burke as Cole stalked her way. She turned her head from one brother to the other. \u201cBurke, we should get out of here. Your brother can find the artist now. You\u2019ll take care of me, won\u2019t you? I...I think I might need to go to the hospital. I might be in shock. And I have to deal with the police about poor Mary\u2019s murder.\u201d She gripped his shoulders. \u201cI need you, Burke. I need you.\u201d</p><p>Cole held up a cell phone, utterly ignoring their former secretary. \u201cThe owner gave me her cell. If he\u2019s taking Jessa to a private air field, I think it\u2019s a safe bet that, at some point, he\u2019s planning to take her out of the States. The woman in the lobby says there\u2019s an airstrip about twenty minutes away. She\u2019s always suspected that criminals use it. She\u2019s a paranoid crazy. On the plus side, she\u2019s armed to the teeth.\u201d He held up a pair of Glocks. \u201cBut we have to pay cash. I also had to promise not to sue. She saw the whole thing, but she doesn\u2019t want to call the cops. I suspect she has a record.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood work,\u201d Burke praised his brother.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ll call Dex and get his help.\u201d Cole stepped away, punching buttons on the phone.</p><p>\u201cBurke?\u201d Hilary called for his attention, starting to cry and cling again. \u201cBurke. I love you. I\u2019ve always loved you. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re supposed to be together. I know you want me.\u201d</p><p>Burke only wanted to save Jessa. He jerked away from her and turned a face full of disdain on her. \u201cThe only thing I want now is to kill you. But I would never be able to explain that to my soft-hearted fianc\u00e9e. You\u2019re lucky. If it were up to me...you\u2019d be six feet under.\u201d</p><p>Her head shook violently. \u201cFianc\u00e9e? You aren\u2019t going to marry that tramp. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am. In my heart, she\u2019s already our wife. And we have a son.\u201d</p><p>Cole punched a button to end the call, then approached again, his eyes narrowed on Hilary. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go, start heading for that airfield and hope it\u2019s the right one. Dex will call to confirm and to get the police out there. What about her?\u201d</p><p>Hilary backed up. \u201cNo. No. This isn\u2019t right. Burke, you and I are meant to be together. You don\u2019t want that slut from New York City.\u201d</p><p>Burke looked to his brother, his partner, his other half. \u201cDid they leave us some rope?\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded, a slow smile spreading. \u201cAnd my best ball gag.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen work quickly. We have to rescue our girl.\u201d</p><p>Hilary screamed, but it didn\u2019t take Cole long to shut that up. Burke spared only the merest glance at the woman who had become obsessed with him. In minutes, she was tied to a chair and gagged, her eyes angry and wide. Then they shut the door behind them, Burke satisfied Hilary couldn\u2019t cause any more trouble.</p><p>They were already in the car, racing through the night toward the nearby airstrip when the phone rang again. Dex had their answer, and they were heading to the right place. Now he just had to hope they weren\u2019t too late to rescue Jessa.</p><p>Cole drove through the driving rain, his stomach in knots. The windshield wipers thudded, making a rhythm that did nothing to cut through the tension in the car.</p><p>\u201cDo you see the turn off?\u201d Cole asked.</p><p>Burke hadn\u2019t said a damn word since they had tied up Hilary and gotten the call from Dex confirming the location of the airstrip and vowing to call in the police. After that, Burke had shut down.</p><p>\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be more than a half a mile. Do you think she\u2019s already in the air?\u201d Burke\u2019s voice was a flat monotone.</p><p>\u201cIf they\u2019re in as small a plane as I believe, they would be insane to take off in this storm. And Marco isn\u2019t crazy. Evil, but very intelligent. She\u2019s still here.\u201d As Cole slowed the SUV, he hoped he wasn\u2019t giving his brother false hope, but it was pouring, the rain lashing at the vehicle in straight lines. \u201cBesides, he thinks Hilary is dead. From his perspective, we would have no way of knowing which airport they were at. This one isn\u2019t even listed. It\u2019s a miracle we had a number.\u201d</p><p>It was a miracle. And a clue that they would get her back. Cole felt it deep in his soul. She was out there waiting for them. He knew he was the one who usually took the pessimistic view of life, but with his brother sitting beside him, guilt eating away at him, Cole had to bring the balance. That\u2019s the way it had been all of their lives.</p><p>And they\u2019d felt complete because they had found Jessa. He\u2019d given up on her once. He wouldn\u2019t do it again.</p><p>He caught sight of a line of flashing white lights blinking in the distance. He moved cautiously. \u201cGet the binoculars.\u201d</p><p>Either Marco hadn\u2019t been sure of which car was theirs, or he\u2019d been smug that they couldn\u2019t catch up. Either way, the binoculars were right where he\u2019d left them in the SUV.</p><p>Cole stopped the car. Burke peered through the lenses and turned on the night vision. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI see a hangar. There\u2019s only one. Nothing on the tarmac. If they\u2019re still here, they have to be inside the hangar, waiting out the storm,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to walk.\u201d</p><p>They couldn\u2019t take the chance of tipping off Delgado. The element of surprise might be their only possible advantage. They didn\u2019t even know how many men were in the hangar, between them and Jessa. Everyone would be armed, for sure. They didn\u2019t know exactly where Jessa was being held. Inside the plane? Deep in the hangar? Did she have a gun to her head? Was she tied up? Had Delgado already assaulted her?</p><p>Every one of those thoughts terrified him, but he couldn\u2019t give in to panic. Rushing in wouldn\u2019t save Jessa, just get them all killed. And Burke didn\u2019t have his head on straight.</p><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Cole assured him. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to go into freaking therapy over this, but you have to know that. Hilary was living out some fantasy in her head. That is not your fault.\u201d</p> <p>Burke\u2019s face turned down. \u201cI knew she thought of me as more than a boss. I should have found some way to gently squelch her feelings long ago.\u201d</p><p>Cole groaned. He knew what his brother was thinking, but Burke had to let it go. \u201cI knew she had a crush on you, too. But neither of us ever imagined she would go to such lengths. You can\u2019t go after Jessa with your head all fucked up. Put the guilt and shit out of your mind for now. You have to go in there confident in one thing.\u201d</p><p>His brother finally looked at him. Cole could see the guilt weighing him down. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThat we have the right to protect her, to love her. She belongs to us, and we\u2019re going to save her. No more mistakes. No more letting things come between us.\u201d Cole had been right where Burke was. In many ways, he still struggled not to fall into that dark place in his soul. But he refused to let guilt and doubt cost him another minute with Jessa. She might never forgive them, but by god she would have to deal with them. She would have to see them because he wasn\u2019t going to let his son grow up without a father. And he wasn\u2019t going to let her be alone again. Even if he had to protect her from afar, he would.</p><p>Burke took a deep breath. \u201cI love her.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd she loves us. We just have to remind her.\u201d</p><p>Cole felt a deep sense of relief as Burke\u2019s eyes hardened and his hand curled around the Glock on his lap. \u201cWe\u2019re going to kill him.\u201d</p><p>Cole understood what his brother meant. No matter what happened, Marco Delgado was going to die. They wouldn\u2019t hold him for the police. They wouldn\u2019t make a case against him and hope that the justice system worked. Marco Delgado\u2019s trial was over. He was guilty, and his punishment would be swift.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to kill him,\u201d Cole agreed.</p><p>They took a moment to discuss strategy, making a few assumptions based on what they knew of Delgado, combining tactical experience. They threw in a few prayers for good measure.</p><p>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d Burke tucked his gun under his coat and took off in the pouring rain.</p> <p>Cole followed. There was no other person he would want watching his back than the man who shared half of his soul. And he knew one thing for sure. Somehow, someway, they would win.</p><p>Jessa shivered. She tried to hold it in, but she\u2019d gotten drenched in the rain, and now the cool air of the hangar in which Delgado held her prisoner mingled in her blood with shock. She couldn\u2019t stop shaking.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no use pretending, Miss Wade. I know you\u2019re awake.\u201d</p><p>His voice filled her with dread. She\u2019d come back to consciousness as they were carting her into the hangar. She\u2019d listened to him scream about the weather and threaten to kill the pilot, who had simply told him that taking a small plane into straight-line winds was the same thing as putting a bullet in his brain, and the bullet was faster.</p><p>Marco had backed off, but he hadn\u2019t been happy about it.</p><p>There was a long sigh. \u201cKeeping your eyes closed will not solve the problem, Miss Wade. And you\u2019ll continue to be cold. If you give up the game, you\u2019ll find I\u2019ve provided you with a blanket.\u201d</p><p>There was a tense atmosphere pervading the hangar, but Delgado seemed to have calmed down. Having little choice, Jessa opened her eyes. She would have preferred to play possum for a while longer, but she was freezing. And the drugs they had given her made her head ache.</p><p>She sat up, a dizzy feeling taking over. She was inside the plane, but she could see the lights in the hangar from the small windows. Delgado sat across from her, a glass of amber liquid in his hand. He seemed perfectly comfortable. Just a businessman about to go on a trip in style.</p> <p>God, if she didn\u2019t do something, this was the end. She wouldn\u2019t see her baby again. He would grow up, and he would forget her face. She would be a ghostly vision in photographs, a simple image who wouldn\u2019t mean anything to him. He would have another mother figure. Tears squeezed from her eyes. Her baby. She would give anything to hold him one last time, to feel his hands patting her cheeks, to rub her nose against his.</p><p>She had to trust and pray that if Cole and Burke were still alive, they\u2019d take care of her son. Oh, she wasn\u2019t giving up. Jessa intended to fight until the bitter end. But at the moment, the odds for an escape tonight weren\u2019t looking good. And if Cole and Burke weren\u2019t alive... God, that thought was too painful.</p><p>\u201cAre they alive?\u201d She had to ask.</p><p>The last thing she could remember was the world lighting up around her and thunder cracking through the room. Cole and Burke had tried to get to her, protect her. She\u2019d reached for them, but her ears had been ringing and her vision had been blurred. And then she\u2019d felt the sharp stab of the needle entering her flesh. Nothing after that.</p><p>Delgado took a long sip of his drink. \u201cYes. Though I doubt they\u2019re happy about it right now. I can only imagine the terror they feel. It is horrible to know that your loved one is in danger when you know where to find them. I imagine the terror is a million times worse when you do not know where your loved one is.\u201d</p><p>He smiled, seemingly satisfied with the pain he was causing. Jessa breathed a sigh of relief. Burke and Cole weren\u2019t dead. They would look for her. She might not trust them with her heart, but they wouldn\u2019t let her down in this. They were heroes. They would never stop until they found her.</p><p>Delgado\u2019s plan chilled her to the bone. She\u2019d heard him talking to his guards while she\u2019d pretended unconsciousness. She would be sold, used. Something she\u2019d only done in a loving fashion would be forced on her by men she didn\u2019t know. After hearing what Alea had gone through, terror filled her. But she would survive somehow. She vowed to stay alive until they found her.</p><p>Then she\u2019d see her son again. No matter how long it took. No matter what she had to endure.</p><p>And she wasn\u2019t taking shit from this asshole.</p><p>\u201cYou know a lot about causing pain. The women you sell into slavery have families, you know.\u201d</p><p>He stopped in the act of drinking, his hand freezing in midair. It tightened around the glass, and then he set it back down. \u201cYou have a very narrow view of the world, Miss Wade. This is the way it works. The strong use the weak. You can be a predator or you can become prey. My father taught me that. You are a lovely woman. Your only mistake was choosing weaker men. The Lennox brothers think they can change the world, but I\u2019m going to show them that the world does not wish to change. The world has worked as I have explained it since man first walked upright. It will work this way long after I am gone.\u201d</p><p>Delgado clearly believed it. It made her sick. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in your lecture. I\u2019m sure you have a hundred intellectual reasons to excuse your bad behavior, but I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not buying your crap. The world isn\u2019t always that way. There are some people who genuinely care and want to help others. Those people would be appalled and horrified by you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThey are nothing to me. I don\u2019t care.\u201d His perfectly coiffed head shook. \u201cYou are so na\u00efve. No one cares.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBurke and Cole do.\u201d They had fought against this man. The fight might have taken them away from her, but they had saved women and put families back together. They had done good. How much more could they have done if they\u2019d had more help? A whole team and a huge pool of resources? What could a foundation do? They were soldiers. They wouldn\u2019t think about things like that. But Jessa had grown up in a world where money made a difference.</p><p>What if her money, her connections, could help bring women out of their dark prison and back home?</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to take you down, you know.\u201d Tears blurred her eyes, making the world seem watery, but she found an odd strength. She was here. The worst was yet to come, and yet she felt strong, powerful. He could do what he liked to her, and she would still fight. Her cause was just, and she wasn\u2019t some woman who lightly accepted what fate handed down. She rolled with life, made changes as necessary. She had walked away from wealth because the cost was too high. She\u2019d given birth to a son alone. Some people in her life loved her. She was worthy, and no one could convince her otherwise. And she wasn\u2019t going down without a fight.</p><p>Delgado threw back his head and laughed. \u201cI love the spirited ones. You\u2019re like beautiful horses, you know. I love to ride. My father spent many hours teaching me. He believed that the stubborn horses made for the best ride. I will teach you, too. I will break you.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou will try.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t work. She would close her eyes and dream of Burke and Cole. She vowed it. When someone touched her, she would divorce from her body and reach for them in her mind. She would shut out the pain and be with them. She would survive.</p><p>He leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. \u201cI will win.\u201d</p><p>She pulled the blanket around her and glanced around the plane. It was small, with only six seats in the body. Gavin James\u2019s plane had been larger, but the layout similar. The door at the back was open. An armed man, leaning against the wall with eyes half closed, blocked the staircase leading down. She could see the inside of the hangar by looking out of the three small windows. They made a mural of the world outside, but not a whole picture. How many men lay between her and freedom?</p><p>Delgado sat across the aisle, beside her. She could see the gun on his belt. Besides the guard at the door, she could also see two others walking outside the plane and the pilot in a folding chair, reading a magazine. The guards patrolled the area, but there was a relaxed feel to the operation. One sort of shuffled along, and the other stood just inside the hangar door, smoking a cigarette. They believed they\u2019d already won.</p><p>She watched, wondering if they would all be on the plane when it took off or if some would stay behind. She hoped for the latter. She was studying the man smoking just inside the hangar when the door opened slightly, just a foot or so, and the smoking man disappeared into the night.</p><p>Not as if he\u2019d walked into it, but like he\u2019d been taken.</p><p>She sat up straight, felt her eyes going wide. What had just happened? The man had disappeared...and no one seemed to notice. The pilot appeared absorbed by the magazine in his hands. The man in the doorway of the plane stared at his feet and yawned as though the sound of the rain was making him sleepy. No one seemed to have noticed that one of the guards had just\u2014poof!\u2014disappeared.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Delgado asked, turning and looking out the window.</p><p>Jessa scrambled. \u201cI was just wondering where we\u2019re going. The pilot doesn\u2019t seem very friendly. Does he have any experience? I don\u2019t like to fly.\u201d</p><p>Anything to turn his attention away from that window.</p><p>Delgado turned back, taking another sip of his drink. \u201cWilcox? He\u2019s been in my family\u2019s employ for years. It\u2019s the only reason he isn\u2019t dead now.\u201d</p><p>But he was dead. Jessa watched as Burke stalked the man, coming from behind. In one swift move, he grasped the man\u2019s head and twisted. The pilot\u2019s neck turned far past the point where he could live. Burke let the man slip out of his grasp and caught his magazine. The pilot slumped over in his chair, and Burke set the magazine on the concrete as Cole stalked into the hangar, sans the smoking guard.</p><p>They were here. They\u2019d come for her.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like to fly. I don\u2019t want to fly.\u201d Jessa let her voice rise high, putting a little hysteria behind it. Any distraction could give Burke and Cole the advantage they needed.</p><p>The guard hovering at the plane\u2019s stairway came awake, but he fixed his stare firmly on her. His eyes rolled as though he\u2019d expected her to be difficult.</p><p>Oh, she could absolutely be difficult.</p><p>Delgado laughed. \u201cI\u2019m taking her to a brothel where she will be raped multiple times a day in ways she can\u2019t even conceive of, and the stupid bitch is complaining about the flight?\u201d</p><p>He and the guard exchanged a look. Jessa took those seconds to watch as Cole, his hair plastered to his face, soaked to the skin, moved like a wraith toward the guard pacing the hangar. He moved so fast for a big man, his feet lighter than she could imagine. The guard didn\u2019t stand a chance. Cole had an arm around his neck before he could move. </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>\u201cI hate flying.

You can\u2019t make me!\u201d Jessa screeched. \u201cNo one will let you take off with a woman screaming inside the plane.\u201d She knew her arguments were stupid, but they were doing the trick. The only two men remaining between her and freedom were staring at her like she\u2019d gone slightly crazy.</p><p>In seconds, Cole had pinned the guard to the ground, denying him air until his legs finally stopped kicking. Burke stood in the shadows, his gun out, his eyes on the plane. Cole stood, and they both began coming closer. The guard at the top of the stairs would see and hear them coming a mile away. He\u2019d have plenty of time to draw his gun and shoot them both\u2014unless she distracted the guard.</p><p>\u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d She stood up and stamped a foot like a toddler in need of a nap. Anything to bring their focus on her and not the men moving to the plane. She let it go, throwing a fit to end all temper tantrums.</p><p>\u201cShut up,\u201d Delgado growled.</p> <p>\u201cNo!\u201d she screamed, tossing the blanket in Marco\u2019s face. His eyes widened before they disappeared under the scrap of black felt. He batted at it, the glass slipping out of his hand and spilling.</p><p>The guard rushed forward, grabbing at the blanket.</p><p>\u201cSit down, bitch,\u201d Delgado said, baring his teeth as he swiped at the Scotch on his slacks. \u201cNo, wait. Don\u2019t sit yet. Michael, teach her a lesson first.\u201d</p><p>The hulking guard near the door stalked closer and lifted his hand. Jessa braced herself, but she still lost her balance from the vicious slap that smacked her head back. She fell against the chair, her skin burning and stinging. But she couldn\u2019t give in. The doorway was tight. Both men would have to come through there first. They\u2019d be in deep danger. She couldn\u2019t stand either one being hurt. She forced herself back to her feet and shoved at the guard using every bit of strength she had. She screamed as she pushed at him to let Burke and Cole know that she was in the plane.</p><p>\u201cTwo! Two! Two!\u201d Jessa screamed. If they heard her, they would know that there were two people on the plane with her. They would know they had two men to kill.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s gone crazy,\u201d Delgado said, reaching out to grab her hair. His fingers tangled brutally against her scalp, forcing her head back. \u201cWe can start your training now, bitch. Michael, get the duct tape. I don\u2019t want to hear her scream when I use her ass.\u201d</p><p>There was a loud crack, and Michael stopped, his enormous body frozen for a single moment. There was a neat hole where a bullet had exited his forehead, blood blooming around the circle.</p><p>Cole entered the plane behind the falling guard, his gun ready once more. Burke was right behind him.</p><p>Delgado pulled her against his body. She felt the sting of his hand pulling at her hair and the hard press of metal against her flesh. \u201cGet back. Both of you.\u201d</p><p>Cole\u2019s gun went down. He let it fall to the floor. \u201cLet her go and you can do anything you want to me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOr I could just blow a hole in her side and you two can watch as she slips away,\u201d Delgado shot back. \u201cYour brother will put his gun down, and you will both allow us to leave this plane or I\u2019ll kill her right here.\u201d</p> <p>That wasn\u2019t happening. If Burke dropped his gun, Delgado would simply shoot them all. She understood their hesitation, but she had to take a chance if she was going to save them. \u201cCole, Burke, I trust you. I trust you.\u201d</p><p>The minute the words were out of her mouth, she let her body go completely lax. She fell toward the floor. The only thing holding her up was the hold Delgado had on her hair. But it was enough. He couldn\u2019t balance and hold on to her.</p><p>Another shot rang out, the sound ricocheting through the plane. She hit her knees as the hand in her hair let go. Cole caught her before she hit the ground, his arms pulling her away.</p><p>Burke stood over Delgado\u2019s prone body. He kicked the gun away. In the distance, Jessa could hear the roar of sirens coming their way. Cole held her close, but all she could see were dead bodies.</p><p>\u201cBaby. Baby, are you all right?\u201d Cole\u2019s hands were everywhere, looking for damage. \u201cDid someone hit you? Did they hurt you?\u201d</p><p>Burke was at her back, crowding her. \u201cSweetheart, he\u2019s dead. They\u2019re all dead. They can\u2019t hurt you again.\u201d</p><p>Yes. They were all dead, and she was alive. Her hands shook as she pulled away. So much had happened. She felt herself shake again, the shock setting in. Her knees threatened to crumble beneath her. Delgado was lying dead feet from her. She knew that in her head...but destructive thoughts crept through her mind. What if he\u2019d somehow gotten to Caleb? After all, why should she trust a criminal to keep his word to leave her baby unharmed?</p><p>She looked at Burke and Cole with stark terror and begged, \u201cTake me to Caleb. Please. I need to see my son.\u201d</p> <p>CHAPTER ELEVEN</p><p>Jessa stared at the door that separated her from Caleb. She\u2019d thought about sleeping on the floor beside his crib, but decided that simply leaving the door open between their rooms would work. When they\u2019d arrived at the James\u2019 condo, she\u2019d spent over two hours holding him, cradling his little body, but he\u2019d been sleeping fitfully, waking with an occasional cry. She\u2019d known that if she didn\u2019t let him be, he would be one cranky boy in the morning. And in the morning she had to decide what to do with her life.</p><p>She sat up in bed, knowing that sleep wasn\u2019t coming soon. She\u2019d made it through the police interview and the paramedics examining her. She\u2019d held herself together through it all, but now that the distractions were gone and she was all alone, the tears fell.</p><p>Why couldn\u2019t she just take what Burke and Cole were offering and so willing to give her? Tonight, they had hovered over her, telling her again and again how much they loved her. And she kept pulling away, almost afraid to believe that it was true. Trembling at the thought they might leave her again\u2014this time for good. Maybe she was exhausted and not being terribly rational. But...broken trust was hard to repair. She wanted to try, but being so utterly alone this past year as she\u2019d tried to live without Burke and Cole had been torture. Some days\u2014and nights\u2014she\u2019d thought that if she had to spend another minute without them, she\u2019d go insane.</p><p>She frowned. She still loved them. That wasn\u2019t ever going to change. Something in her was wired for them. So why couldn\u2019t she cling to them now? Why was she holding herself back?</p><p>Fear.</p><p>Jessa rolled out of bed, her feet sinking into the luxurious carpet. She was wearing one of Hannah\u2019s silk nightgowns, the material soft on her skin, but all she could think about was her men\u2019s strong hands caressing her, their arms surrounding her.</p><p>What was she doing? What was she going to do?</p><p>She walked to the windows and opened the blinds. The soft lights of the Dallas skyline played across the room. Marco Delgado was dead. She could leave tomorrow, and the Lennox brothers couldn\u2019t stop her if she really wanted to go. She could pack Caleb up and find a new home. She could go on with her life.</p><p>Jessa sniffled. It sounded a bit mean and petty to move Caleb away from their fathers. To punish them by leaving just because they\u2019d left her. In fact, it sounded terrible. So what the hell was she to do?</p><p>Tired. She was so tired and she felt a little empty. They were in another room. Doors, a hallway, and distance lay between them because she hadn\u2019t been brave enough to approach them last night, tell them how much she needed the sense of safety and love they gave her so freely. She\u2019d been too afraid to try with them again.</p><p>\u201cCome on.\u201d The low whisper came out of nowhere.</p><p>Jessa turned toward the door to the nursery with a start. Someone was in there. She frowned, her heart beating out a rapid rhythm as she padded across the floor and grabbed a heavy, decorative candlestick as silently as possible and drew it up over her head. Since she\u2019d left the door open to be closer to Caleb in the night, she easily heard the masculine voice that whispered in the air.</p><p>\u201cGod, you\u2019re a baby hog. I want to hold him.\u201d</p><p>She closed her eyes and had to grin a little. The sweet grumble of Burke\u2019s voice pierced her heart. They were here. She\u2019d turned away from them, but they had snuck into the nursery to be with their son. The miracle they\u2019d created with her.</p><p>She peeked through the crack in the door.</p><p>There were two rockers in the nursery. Hannah had explained that this was the east wing bedroom, for times when one of her babies was sick. It must be nice to be wildly wealthy. Jessa would have to settle for a lovely home with only one nursery. It would have been enough if Burke and Cole hadn\u2019t come back in her life. Now it seemed like...settling. They\u2019d come back into her life and made her want more\u2014a house with a bedroom big enough for the three of them, along with more love to fill it. No, she\u2019d always wanted more, and now she knew they wanted to give it to her.</p><p>She had to make a choice.</p><p>Burke and Cole sat in the rockers. Cole had his shirt off and cradled Caleb against his chest. Her son, who never seemed to sleep when she held him, was like a limp noodle in his father\u2019s strong arms.</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t help it. Look at him. He\u2019s so fucking beautiful.\u201d Cole smiled down at the baby.</p><p>Burke kicked at his shin. \u201cDon\u2019t cuss around the baby. Do you want his first word to be fuck?\u201d</p><p>\u201cShit.\u201d Cole winced. \u201cSorry. I hadn\u2019t thought of that. No.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen watch your language. We have to do things differently now. We have a son.\u201d</p><p>Cole rocked back and forth, cuddling Caleb. Burke leaned over, his fingers stroking Caleb\u2019s hair. \u201cWe might have to move. If Jessa goes back to Virginia, we\u2019ll follow her. She might not want us now, but I\u2019m not giving up. And I can\u2019t let him go.\u201d</p><p>Jessa felt tears prick her eyes. Cole\u2019s voice, his strong, deep voice, had hitched when he\u2019d said she didn\u2019t want them.</p><p>Burke took a deep breath. \u201cI thought if we found her in time and eliminated Delgado, that she\u2019d want to be with us, would see...\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up, either.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI love her. I need her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe both need and love her.\u201d Burke sat back, his head resting against the chair. \u201cShe\u2019s the one, but we can\u2019t force her to love us back. We can only be there. We can only prove that her hardheadedness can\u2019t drive us away. We made some horrible mistakes, but we won\u2019t make them again.\u201d</p><p>Cole sighed, his lips cracking into a sad smile. \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel that way. I was worried that all the bullshit with Hilary would turn you into me.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo. There\u2019s only room for one brooding butthead in our lives.\u201d He chuckled. \u201cYou took that role on long ago. I\u2019m going to be the happy dad. And you\u2019re right. He\u2019s so fucking beautiful. He\u2019s the best thing we ever did. Do you think he\u2019ll love us? Or do you think he\u2019ll be angry that we couldn\u2019t love his mother separately? Do you think he\u2019ll be ashamed?\u201d</p><p>The tears coursed down her face. She\u2019d hurt them, made them worry about their relationship with their son. Made them doubt what they needed. God, she hadn\u2019t meant to.</p><p>\u201cWe can only try, Burke. We\u2019re going to love him. We\u2019re going to be the best fathers we can, and that starts with cutting back on work. We can\u2019t risk ourselves anymore. He needs us. Even if Jessa doesn\u2019t want us around, we have to be here for him. I love Jessa, but I owe this child.\u201d</p><p>They wouldn\u2019t leave Caleb\u2014or her\u2014again. Deep down she\u2019d known it all along. She\u2019d known that they would be good fathers, but she was still afraid that the only reason they would settle down would be for Caleb\u2019s sake, and she wanted to mean more to them than a successful breeder. Her fear and insecurity was roaring in her head. And a single quiet voice spoke below it. A little whisper.</p><p>You are more than that.</p><p>She\u2019d let her grief and fear lead her. She was allowing her need to protect herself to keep her from them.</p><p>But she wasn\u2019t the girl who was going to let fear trump happiness. She was a woman who knew what she wanted. She\u2019d been brave enough a year ago to take them on, and damn the consequences, because she knew that it was better to try than to regret. She\u2019d turned away privilege and money because they came at too high a cost. She\u2019d been braver in the past. She\u2019d been a woman two men could fall in love with. She\u2019d been enough for them.</p><p>If she\u2019d dig for a little courage, she could be enough for them again. She had to dig for it. She didn\u2019t want to give them up, either.</p><p>Cole finally passed Caleb to Burke, whose arms curled around his tiny body. His lips curled up in a smile.</p><p>\u201cHey, buddy. We\u2019re your dads. You\u2019re lucky. You got two. We\u2019re not very smart, but we\u2019re tenacious. We won\u2019t let you down.\u201d Burke kissed his forehead.</p><p>\u201cAnd we won\u2019t give up on your momma. We\u2019re going to be patient. We\u2019re going to show her. We\u2019ll move. We\u2019ll buy a house close to you. We\u2019ll build another business, one that won\u2019t take us away from you.\u201d </p> </body></html>", "<!DOCTYPE html><html lang=\"en\"><head><meta charset=\"utf-8\"/><meta content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0\" name=\"viewport\"/><link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans|Roboto\" rel=\"stylesheet\"> <style type=\"text/css\">img { max-width: 100%;}body {font-size: 1.2em;font-family: \"Open Sans\", sans-serif;}h2 {font-family: \"Roboto\", sans-serif !important;}* {-webkit-user-select: none;}</style></head><body> <p>Jessa pressed on the door, pushing it completely open with a little smile. She was done with fear and doubt. She was done with pessimism. She was going to live her life the way she wanted, with hope in her heart. She was going to be the mother Caleb deserved\u2014a brave woman who followed her heart and didn\u2019t regret. If it all went wrong, then at least she\u2019d know that she tried. She would open her heart to love because that was the only way to find it.</p><p>\u201cJessa?\u201d</p><p>She moved to the doorway, revealing herself. \u201cHi.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHi yourself, sweetheart.\u201d</p><p>God, they were so beautiful it hurt. Her two men had traveled a hard road, too, looking for so long for a woman who could accept them as they were. They had never compromised. They had held fast, looking for what they needed.</p><p>They\u2019d decided what they needed was her. Jessa\u2019s heart skipped. She was taking a leap. They could decide tomorrow that they\u2019d rather return to their dangerous lives. They could decide they didn\u2019t really want her, after all. The world could end. Any number of things could happen, but she only had control over what she did. At the end of her life, she would only be able to look back on what she had done and find some modicum of pride. She would be damn proud that she\u2019d stepped out of her shell and tried to be brave. She would be proud that she\u2019d loved with her whole heart. She would love them until she took her last breath. Then she would love them more.</p><p>\u201cCome to bed.\u201d</p><p>The rocking stopped.</p><p>\u201cJessa?\u201d Cole froze, stared.</p><p>It was funny that other people couldn\u2019t tell them apart. It was so obvious to her. \u201cAre you going to make love to me or are you just going to rock our son and say my name?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou didn\u2019t want us earlier.\u201d Cole stood.</p><p>Burke remained rocking, as though he wasn\u2019t sure what to do about the baby in his arms. \u201cWe should talk about this.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t want to talk. I want to make love. I want to lose myself in your arms.\u201d She grinned, the love she felt for them suddenly light and buoyant. It was crazy, but jumping off the edge of her cliff of fear felt...good.</p><p>\u201cI love you both,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI want us to be a family, and I won\u2019t force you to move. I can handle it here in Texas. I can two-step and eat steaks.\u201d There was one thing she was immovable on. \u201cBut you\u2019re finding a new secretary.\u201d</p><p>Cole nodded, easing closer. \u201cFuck, yeah. We kind of left her tied up and gagged. I\u2019m sure someone is going to find her tomorrow. They have a maid staff at the motel, right?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou left her tied up in our motel room?\u201d Jessa stared, stunned.</p><p>Burke flushed. \u201cYeah. I wasn\u2019t sure what else to do. Maybe we should call someone.\u201d</p><p>Maybe they should stop what they were doing and call someone to help out the woman who had kept them apart and tried to have her killed and attempted to steal one of her men? Hilary could rot...until the police came for her. \u201cPut Caleb to bed, Burke. His parents need to be together.\u201d</p><p>Burke stood, his movements slow and steady. He would get more sure of himself, of that she had no doubt, but she would always remember this time when he treated Caleb like a precious, fragile gift.</p><p>Cole pulled a blanket over the sleeping baby\u2019s body, then both men turned to her. She backed up, drawing them into her room.</p><p>Her nipples tightened. They had gone from loving fathers to dominant lovers in a heartbeat. Both men stared at her before looking at each other, their conversation going silent.</p><p>\u201cI get so nervous when you do that \u2018silent twin mind-meld\u2019 thing. What did you two just decide?\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s lips curved up in a sexy smile as he tugged his shirt off and revealed his magnificent chest. \u201cHow we\u2019re going to make love to you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t I have a say in that?\u201d She sent them a saucy grin.</p><p>\u201cNever,\u201d Cole replied. \u201cWe\u2019re the Masters in the bedroom. You\u2019re the queen outside, but here we want our precious submissive who takes us every way we want her.\u201d</p><p>Cole shoved his jeans off, his cock bobbing up, begging for attention. Beside him, Burke stood naked as well, his body ready for whatever they had silently agreed upon.</p><p>She stared for a moment at her men, loving the identical tats on their biceps and the way their movements mirrored each other. She loved everything about them, including the way they mastered her in the bedroom. When she pushed the straps of her gown off her shoulders, it pooled at her feet. Jessa stepped out and dropped to her knees in front of them, pushing her knees out, straightening her spine. She was offering herself to them\u2014her pussy, and her breasts, her heart and her soul.</p><p>\u201cBeautiful,\u201d Cole said, placing a hand on her head. \u201cYou are the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d</p><p>With them, she felt beautiful. No amount of makeup or designer clothes could recreate the way she felt when her men told her she was lovely.</p><p>\u201cJessa Wade, we\u2019re getting married in three days,\u201d Burke proclaimed, taking her hand and lifting her to her feet. He hauled her into his arms, cradling her close, then looked down, his eyes shining. \u201cThat\u2019s how long it takes to get a license and fill out the paperwork. None of this \u2018living together\u2019 crap. We have a son. We have to be respectable.\u201d</p><p>She smiled as he climbed on the bed, placing her in the center. \u201cWe will be as respectable as one woman and two men can possibly be.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not going to be respectable at all tonight, baby. So you should be ready for that.\u201d Cole opened the drawer of the nightstand. He sighed as he pulled out a tube of lubricant. \u201cI can always count on the James gang. I don\u2019t see any condoms though. I\u2019ll go get my bag.\u201d</p><p>She shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t want them. I want another baby, one we all watch grow together. I want Caleb to have a brother or a sister.\u201d</p><p>Burke\u2019s hands tightened around her. \u201cSweetheart, we want that, too. We want that so badly. Are you sure you\u2019re ready now?\u201d</p><p>She\u2019d barely finished nodding when Burke kissed her, his mouth covering hers, tongue seeking. She wrapped her arms around him and let her tongue slide against his. He cupped her breasts in his warm hands, his legs tangling with hers. Burke rolled on top of her, pressing her into the mattress. He kissed her until they were both breathless.</p><p>And then it was Cole kissing her as Burke moved down her body. Burke started suckling her nipples as Cole dominated her mouth. She had a brother on each side, surrounding her, enveloping her. Loving her. Their hands were everywhere. Their mouths caressed her, lavishing attention on her. They whispered to her, telling her how beautiful she was, how much they loved her. They wrapped her in desire and passion and love.</p><p>Jessa clung to them, allowing them access to her body and soul. She opened herself completely, not letting fear or worry or the past between them. With every touch, she could tell they\u2019d put it behind them, too. For once, she was the canvas, and they painted her with kisses and caresses. They adorned her with devotion.</p><p>\u201cI love you.\u201d Jessa didn\u2019t hold back. She never would again. She would build her life with these men, not regretting anything. They\u2019d struggled and suffered, but their love was stronger for having survived the hurt.</p><p>\u201cI love you, Jessa,\u201d Cole said.</p><p>\u201cI love you, our beautiful bride.\u201d Burke pulled her back into his arms, fusing their mouths together, rolling them over. \u201cRide me.\u201d</p><p>He maneuvered her until she was astride his hips, his big cock thrusting up toward her. She was slick and ready for him.</p><p>\u201cTake me, sweetheart.\u201d Burke pressed up, pushing his thick cock deep inside in a single strong thrust.</p><p>She gasped as he filled her. Her cunt was already clamping down on him, but they weren\u2019t done yet. Cole pressed a hand to her back, lightly pushing her against Burke\u2019s broad chest. Her nipples brushed his fevered skin, making her shiver all over again.</p><p>\u201cYou feel so fucking good, sweetheart. I missed you so much.\u201d His hands gripped her hips, holding her still while Cole began to prepare her. She shivered as he coated her with lube and began pressing his finger in to open her wide for his pleasure.</p><p>\u201cWe were lost without you,\u201d Cole murmured, pulling his finger out and pressing something far larger against the rosette of her ass.</p><p>She\u2019d been lost, too. She grasped at Burke, forcing herself to hold still as Cole fucked her ass in short, smooth thrusts. He gained ground with each pass until finally he slid his hot length deep inside her. Tears pricked her eyes at the sublime feeling of completeness and joy that infused her. It didn\u2019t matter that her house had been destroyed. It didn\u2019t matter where they lived at all. Right now, with them, oh, this was home. Finally.</p><p>They took her, their movements a bit slow and rough, but perfectly timed. Burke thrust up as Cole retreated, his cock dragging over the nerves of her ass, making her moan. Her breath merged with Burke\u2019s as pleasure washed through her. Cole nipped a tender chain of kisses across her shoulder as he thrust deep. Burke pulled on her hips, grinding on her clitoris as he hit that perfect spot that sent her soaring. Jessa gave up. She let the orgasm take her and rode the powerful explosion of ecstasy, rocking back and forth between her men with a keening cry. Cole shouted out behind her, and Burke thrust up, his body tensing, shaking. She was filled with them, each giving her his come in a hot wash that started another wave of pure joy. Jessa\u2019s body was wracked with it, her every muscle suffused with a delicious tension, followed by a happy lethargy as she fell forward, and her head found Burke\u2019s chest. He cuddled her for a moment, catching his breath.</p><p>Cole slipped from her body, rolling off and pulling her with him. She was in the middle, their big bodies surrounding her, nestling her. Warm and safe and loved\u2014that\u2019s exactly how she felt. Happy tears burned her eyes. This was what she\u2019d missed, fulfillment, peace, adoration.</p><p>\u201cOh, baby, we love you. We won\u2019t ever leave you again,\u201d Cole said, his voice thick with emotion. \u201cWe promise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNot ever again, Jessa.\u201d Burke\u2019s hand caressed her cheek, brushing away her tears. \u201cYou won\u2019t regret giving us another chance.
